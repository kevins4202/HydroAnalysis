6110,tinopal cbs x has been described in published literature as a fluorescent dye that is suitable for use as a tracer in groundwater investigations however several of these field tests have yielded unexpected results in this study the influence that the complexation agent edta ethylenediaminetetraacetate and ph have on the solubility of tinopal cbs x have been systematically investigated in the laboratory and the results obtained validated with thermodynamic calculations using the phreeqc software modeling indicated that the amount of edta required for complete tinopal cbs x dissolution is in many aquifers so great that its use is no longer feasible however softening the water by adding naoh appears to be a promising way to increase tinopal cbs x solubility water with a low availability of bivalent and or trivalent ions yielded solubilities up to two orders of magnitude higher than waters from limestone aquifers with a high ca2 ion content results revealed that the spectrum of tinopal cbs x applicability as a conservative tracer in aquatic environments is limited to a limited range of specific water chemistries the long tailing in the breakthrough curve and the retarded breakthrough of tinopal cbs x in a previously reported carbonate karst aquifer field tracer test was accurately reproduced by a transport model with a modified input function based on solubility modeling travel times and attenuation by incompletely dissolved tracers are tend to be overestimated which can be problematic with regard to predictions of contaminant transport or the delineation of water protection zones the use of tinopal cbs x as a conservative tracer and the concentrations required needs therefore to be carefully evaluated with respect to water hardness ph alkalinity and dilution rates an input script for phreeqc is provided to help estimate appropriate concentrations of tinopal cbs x thus enhancing its potential and reliability for future groundwater research

are therefore invaluable for the management and protection of water resources e g flury and wai 2003 tinopal cbs x is one of the few solute tracers with fluorescent properties dye tracers for which legal authorisation can be obtained for use in field investigations field et al 1995 while other dye tracers can result in strong coloring of the water which is likely to raise public concern this tracer is almost invisible to the human eye it also has a fluorescence that is independent of ph within the ph range encountered in most types of aquifers käss 2004 the compound has emission excitation wavelengths 346 435 nm that are complementary to other frequently used fluorescent dyes such as na fluorescein uranine and the rhodamines and can therefore be used simultaneously with these tracers in multi tracer tests flury and wai 2003 geyer et al 2007 despite these advantages there have been few reports published over the past 20 years on the use tinopal cbs x it may be that optical brighteners discharged into the system in wastewater result in a strong background signal that complicates the quantitation of tinopal cbs x davis et al 1980 meus et al 2006 murray et al 2007 bailly comte et al 2018 furthermore a number of tracer studies have reported low recoveries or a somewhat retarded breakthrough compared to other tracers due to long tailings in the breakthrough curves käss 2004 geyer et al 2007 vincenzi et al 2011 2014 these features were thought to be possibly related to the low solubility of tinopal cbs x in the injected pulse of water käss 2004 licha et al 2013 typical tracer input concentrations of a few grams per liter e g gombert et al 2017 exceed the solubilities reported for tinopal cbs x 6 50 mg l 1 licha et al 2013 by about two orders of magnitude licha et al 2013 concluded that low recoveries of tinopal cbs x in tracer tests were due to its complexation mainly with omnipresent mg2 and ca2 divalent cations the long tailing was suspected to be a result of precipitation and subsequent re dissolution of precipitates the complexation agent edta ethylenediaminetetraacetate for additional information see dwyer 1964 flaschka 1964 has been suggested by some authors käss 2004 licha et al 2013 as an additive that if mixed with the tracer solution before adding the tracer would prevent tinopal cbs x precipitating together with divalent and or trivalent cations theoretical calculations by licha et al 2013 of the edta concentrations that would be required in tinopal cbs x tracer solutions remain to be systematically validated and their practical use has yet to be evaluated in field tracer tests the dissolution of tracer precipitates during tracer input into an aquifer has also not previously been taken into consideration only the chemical behavior of possible input solutions the objective of these investigations was to validate the required edta concentrations calculated by licha et al 2013 and to derive practical guidelines regarding the application and applicability of tinopal cbs x in different aquifers in particular with respect to their water chemistries to this end the solubility of tinopal cbs x was systematically investigated for different edta concentrations and at different ph values both experimentally and by equilibrium modeling using phreeqc software the results obtained were then used to calculate the solubility of tinopal cbs x in waters from selected aquifers in order to provide a basis for decision making on the applicability of tinopal cbs x for these specific aquifers finally the influence that the limited solubility of tinopal cbs x has on the breakthrough of the tracer was investigated using data from a previous field tracer test geyer et al 2007 in a carbonate karst aquifer the results are expected to provide valuable guidance for the future use of tinopal cbs x in tracer investigations and to reduce the risk of failure 2 analytical and laboratory methods 2 1 chemicals tinopal cbs x with 98 purity was purchased as sodium salt relevant physico chemical properties of the compound are listed in table 1 the solubility of tinopal cbs x in deionized water is reported to be in the range of 0 4 0 5 gl 1 at 10 c and 25 gl 1 at 25 c käss 2004 table 1 ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta was purchased as titriplex ii from merck kgaa cas 60 00 4 relevant physico chemical properties are again listed in table 1 berlin tap water was used as the matrix water for all experiments its chemistry is comparable to that of water from limestone karst aquifers e g white et al 1963 licha et al 2013 where tracer tests using tinopal cbs x have been frequently conducted concentrations of the most abundant ions in the matrix water are included in table 2 the ph was adjusted using hcl and naoh for this purpose a concentration of 1 moll 1 sodium hydroxide was prepared from concentrated sodium hydroxide stock solution analysis quality acquired from merck kgaa while hcl was added as 0 1 moll 1 hydrochloric acid titripur quality also acquired from merck kgaa hexamethylenetetramine cas 100 97 0 and hydrazine sulfate cas 10034 93 2 both from merck kgaa were used to prepare a formazin standard for turbidity calibrations 2 2 chemical analyses tinopal cbs x concentrations were measured using a field fluorometer ggun fl 30 albillia co neuchâtel switzerland the tinopal cbs x has been found be subject to photo degradation during analysis poiger et al 1996 due to isomerization processes only the first concentration measurements were therefore considered in each case no photo degradation was observed during short periods several minutes of exposure to sunlight calibration was performed for four different concentrations 0 01 0 1 0 5 and 1 mgl 1 with three repetitions for each calibration and using freshly prepared concentration standards in each case the mean standard deviations 1σ for all sets of three concentration standards n 12 were less than 3 the lower limit of detection llod in matrix water with a ph of 7 6 was determined to be 2 ppb and the limit of quantitation 6 7 ppb the upper limit of detection was approximately 1 mgl 1 giving an operating range of 2 µgl 1 to 1 mgl 1 the fluorescence intensity of tinopal cbs x was constant within a ph range of 6 1 10 which is in accordance with other studies käss 2004 a formazine standard for calibrating turbidity was prepared using hexamethylenetetramine and following din en iso 7027 the ph was measured using an hq40d portable multi meter and an intellical phc201 ph electrode both from hach lange gmbh düsseldorf germany with the smallest detectable change being less than 0 1 the edta and tinopal cbs x input concentrations were calculated from their respective masses errors are estimated to be less than 5 calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 and sodium na were analyzed using atomic absorption spectroscopy analytik jena ag novaa 400g anion concentrations were determined using ion chromatography dx 120 dionex and hco3 concentrations using gran titration 2 3 precipitation experiments precipitation experiments were carried out using batches of samples each comprising 100 ml of matrix water with identical tinopal cbs x concentrations but varying edta concentrations compositions listed in table 2 and with different ph values table 3 all experiments were conducted at 25 2 c with continuous mixing by magnetic stirrer five different edta concentrations were prepared for each batch by adding 0 10 26 40 and 52 mg of the compound the ph was varied for each edta concentration by adding either naoh to obtain ph values of 7 6 9 0 9 5 and 10 0 or hcl to obtain a ph of 6 1 resulting in 25 samples altogether and hence 25 experiments following complete dissolution of the edta after 30 min and stabilization of the ph values 10 ml of tinopal cbs x stock solution were added for each of the ph values 10 7 ml at ph 6 1 yielding a tinopal cbs x concentration of 909 mgl 1 975 mgl 1 for ph 6 1 the solution was then mixed for 24 h using a magnetic stirrer in order to ensure equilibration the samples were then centrifuged for 60 min at 25 c and 3000 rpm in a temperature controlled centrifuge sorvall rc 3b refrigerated centrifuge a 50 µl volume of the supernatant solution was then extracted from each sample taken from the uppermost part of the solution by pipetting and then diluted to 100 ml with matrix water fluorescence intensities were then measured the samples and stock solution were thoroughly protected from direct sunlight with aluminum foil although the analytical error in the fluorescence measurements was quite low 1σ 3 for nine individual prepared calibration standards additional errors could have been introduced during sample preparation e g during centrifugation and dilution but these are estimated to have been less than 5 for tinopal cbs x concentrations in the solution the total methodical error is therefore estimated to have been less than 10 2 4 geochemical modeling the phreeqc program version 3 3 12 12704 parkhurst and appelo 2013 was used to calculate the equilibrium chemistries of the solutions in the batches in order to be consistent with chemical nomenclature the anion of tinopal cbs x will be called tinopalate t2 and its respective salts tinopalates met or me2t3 where me represent bivalent and or trivalent cations selected input scripts used to calculate equilibrium conditions can be found in the supplementary file script s 1 the minteq v4 dat database was used and data on solubility products and the enthalpies of tinopalates were implemented according to licha et al 2013 table 4 referring to the reaction 1 met me 2 t 2 with met being the tinopalate me2 the related cation and t2 the tinopal cbs x in solution the solubility product of met is then defined as 2 k sp met a me 2 a t 2 with ksp met being the solubility product a me 2 the activity of the bivalent cation and a t 2 the activity of the tinopal cbs x anion data on fe2 fe3 and al3 were not used because of missing values for standard solution enthalpies formation constants for metal edta complexes e g ca edta 2 were calculated using experimental data obtained at 25 c identical to our conditions from arena et al 1983 and then used in the phreeqc program since variations in the ionic strengths of the solutions used in our investigations had no significant effect on the equilibrium constants logkca 10 5 12 2 logkmg 8 7 10 3 equilibrium constants were calculated for the input water matrix only is 9 7 kca 11 88 kmg 10 00 and only a minor error introduced as a result acidity constants for edta were taken directly from the phreeqc database and not adjusted to ionic strength no significant change in acidity constants were expected due to the low ionic strength in most cases battaglia et al 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of edta and ph on tinopal cbs x solubility preliminary modeling was used to predict the influence of edta input concentration 236 mgl 1 on tinopal cbs x solubility input concentration 1 gl 1 at increasing ph values fig 1 the matrix water in the model was the same as that used in the experiments table 2 the modeling indicated that edta at approximately half the molar concentration of tinopal cbs x has only a minor effect on its solubility even though the concentration of the ca2 species decreases significantly between ph 3 and ph 5 5 due to chelation by edta the solubility of tinopal cbs x is hardly affected at ph 8 1 the saturation index of calcite approaches zero and the solubility of calcite is exceeded resulting in an abrupt reduction in the ca2 species in solution the solubility of tinopal cbs x increases as the ph increases until it is completely dissolved at ph 8 8 the modeling indicated that the precipitation of carbonates first calcite and then dolomite is the main factor affecting the solubility of tinopal cbs x under equilibrium conditions for the applied water chemistry as the ph approached 10 edta favored na edta 3 over ca edta 2 resulting in ca2 precipitation the molality of na2t also increased abstracting already dissolved t 2 from the solution the experimental results show similar trends in tinopal cbs x solubility to the preliminary modeling fig 2 b edta had a significant effect on the solubility of tinopal cbs x at low ph values fig 2a for example at ph 6 1 the concentration of tinopal cbs x in solution increased progressively from 100 mgl 1 to 670 mgl 1 following the addition of 473 mgl 1 of edta increasing concentrations of edta increased the proportion of its four valent species which chelates bivalent and trivalent cations thus inhibiting the precipitation of tinopalates however complete solution of tinopal cbs x was not achieved for ph values between 6 and 9 even though the input concentration by mass of edta was up to half that of tinopal cbs x and almost the same by molar concentration except at ph6 1 where edta input had only 94 molar concentration compared to tinopal cbs x as in the preliminary modeling the experimental data show a rapid increase in tinopal cbs x solubility at elevated ph values this effect is clearly visible if the tinopal cbs x solubility is plotted against the ph fig 2b both the modeling and the experimental data therefore indicate that softening decarbonisation of the solution due to the precipitation of carbonates is the main factor affecting tinopal cbs x dissolution in the particular matrix water used in our investigations however the sudden increase in tinopal cbs x solubility occurred at higher ph values in the experiments than in the preliminary modeling the experimental results were therefore used to calibrate the model in the preliminary modeling tinopal cbs x was already completely dissolved at ph9 0 for modeling the experiments supersaturation of carbonates was required to be taken into account at the same ph in order to obtain relatively low tinopalcbs x solubilities fig 1 oversaturation of carbonates is a common phenomenon especially when homogeneous nucleation occurs where no seeds for crystallization are present morse et al 2007 de choudens sanchez and gonzalez 2009 saturation index si values can be influenced by a number of factors such as temperature and fluid composition morse et al 2007 for example dolomite is unlikely to precipitate at the relatively low ca mg ratios of the water used in our investigations folk and land 1975 morse et al 2007 at a ph of 9 0 the si indices used in the model were 3 for calcite 2 for aragonite and 2 for dolomite the results of preliminary experiments on softening the water used in our investigations as well as those from phreeqc modeling have confirmed these degrees of supersaturation a certain degree of supersaturation of cat was also required to obtain an adequate fit of the modeling results with the experimental results the degree of supersaturation required generally increased with edta concentration table 5 on the whole the model was able to reproduce the experimental results except at ph values of 9 5 and 10 0 where the modeled solubilities were higher and lower respectively than the experimental results fig 2a in the experiments the concentration of dissolved tinopal cbs x at ph 10 0 even exceeded the input concentrations but it remained within the range of experimental and analytical uncertainty 3 2 solubility of tinopal cbs x in selected aquifers bivalent and trivalent cations ph and temperature all have a significant influence on the precipitation of tinopalates and therefore on the solubility of tinopal cbs x groundwater chemistry can vary markedly between different aquifers and the solubility of tinopal cbs x may therefore differ by several orders of magnitude between different aquifers the solubility of tinopal cbs x was calculated to provide guidance with respect to its future use in different types of aquifer e g sand and gravel rhyolite or limestone aquifers in surface waters such as saline mining water and in acid sulfate chlorine springs table 6 and fig 3 the reaction temperature was set to 25 c for reasons of comparability but the ph was variable although the ionic strength of saline mining water sample 1 table 6 was high compared to that of other water samples in table 6 it had the highest tinopal cbs x solubility ranging from 1 gl 1 to more than 200 gl 1 fig 3 this was mainly due to the relatively low water hardness table 6 the ph also remained unaffected by increasing concentrations of edta and tinopal cbs x due to the high alkalinity of the water in all other water samples tinopal cbs x had a solubility of 1 gl 1 table 6 and fig 3 water from sand and gravel aquifers sample 2 table 6 shows a decrease in tinopal cbs x solubility at high edta concentrations due to the lower ph of the water the addition of edta in sample 5 had almost no effect the ph levels were relatively low and the concentrations of m edta 2 were therefore too low to significantly reduce the amount of ca2 in solution oversaturation of carbonates si 0 was observed in sample 4 a second model was therefore calculated taking into account the precipitation of carbonates under equilibrium conditions si 0 shaded area for sample 4 in fig 3 it is interesting to note that carbonate karst aquifers which is where tinopal cbs x has mostly been used showed the lowest solubility for the dye tracer with values in the range of 0 06 0 15 gl 1 this might prevent accurate quantification of transport parameters since there is no comprehensive set of thermodynamic data available on fe2 t al3 t and fe3 t solubilities could be lower for those aquifers that contain high concentrations of cations such as fe2 fe2 and al3 such cations in the samples investigated however these cations are present in relatively low concentrations and therefore have little impact on the results 3 3 effect of tinopal cbs x solubility on its transport geyer et al 2007 conducted a multi tracer test at the intensively investigated gallusquelle karst spring in south western germany the tracer used was a mixture of uranine 750 g sulforhodamine g 750 g and tinopal cbs x 1500 g dissolved in 1000l of drinking water from the same aquifer the mixture was then washed into the aquifer over 4 5 h using about 77 m3 of the same water low mass recovery a delay in breakthrough and unexpectedly long tailing of the breakthrough curve btc was observed for tinopal cbs x compared to the ideal unreactive fluorescent tracer uranine fig 4 a and table s1 the tailing can be approximated by a straight line with a slope of 0 093 for uranine and 0 047 for tinopal cbs x semi logarithmic plot of logarithmic concentration versus time fig 4a the β value of the transport model which is either the partitioning coefficient for r 1 or the mobile water fraction for r 1 toride et al 1999 has a direct influence on the tailing of the btc high β values close to one result in little tailing whereas low β values result in long tailings with shallow slopes and with the peaks also occurring earlier fig 4b geyer et al 2007 s interpretation assumed an instantaneous input of the tracer mixture represented by a dirac function which required to adapt transport parameter to fit each btc in particular the beta values of the transport were adapted the β values for the modelled btc in fig 4b were 0 94 for tinopal cbs x and 0 97 for uranine which is a significant difference considering fig 4b in view of the relatively low solubility of tinopal cbs x in carbonate aquifers precipitation of tinopalates from the tracer mixture would be expected to occur in the tracer experiment conducted by geyer et al 2007 as previously suggested by geyer et al 2007 and licha et al 2013 the solubility of tinopal cbs x in the karst aquifer that we investigated was expected to be much less than 100 mgl 1 table 6 and the input concentration of 1 5 gl 1 therefore exceeded its solubility by at least an order of magnitude the resulting tinopalate precipitates can be physically retained within the aquifer flushing them into the aquifer from the surface is therefore likely to result in subsequent interactions with the groundwater and the release of their dissolved counterparts the mass input therefore needs to differ from a dirac delta input function instantaneous mass input using a modified input function accounting for the dissolution of the compound could be more representative of the tracer experiment rather than modify the β value that suggests change in physical processes we therefore examined whether or not such an input function was able to adequately reproduce the btc for tinopal cbs x from the tracer test performed by geyer et al 2007 in this revisited interpretation the transport of tinopal cbs x was assumed to be ideal and therefore identical to that of uranine table s2 and the btc was assumed to only be affected by input functions that differ from a dirac input for the tracer experiment presented herein the input function consisted of two parts an instantaneous part derived from the dissolved fraction of the 1500 g tinopal cbs x within the initial tracer mixture and a second part derived from the dissolution of previously retained tinopalates that were introduced into the aquifer with the tracer mixture i e the remaining fraction of the 1500 g a new input function was therefore defined taking into account the following assumptions 1 a first dirac i e instantaneous input of 155 g mdirac that results from dissolution of tinopal cbs x within the barrel containing 1500 g of the tracer in 1000l of water based on equilibrium concentrations calculated using phreeqc software 2 a second input that results from the intense washing of the tracer for 4 5 h as described in geyer et al 2007 the function was modelled using an exponential input function that describes a continuous decline in input concentration 3 c exp 1 t c 1 e λ 1 t cexp1 t input concentration over time for the first exponential function c1 initial concentration for the first exponential function λ1 exponential decline constant for the first exponential function 3 a third input that is generated by the slow percolation of water within the vadose zone following the intense washing was implemented using a second exponential function 4 c e x p 2 t c 2 e λ 2 t cexp2 t input concentration over time for the second exponential function c2 initial concentration for the second exponential function λ2 exponential decline constant for the second exponential function the stanmod 2 08 software package computer software to evaluate solute transport developed by šimůnek et al 1999 which uses the cxtfit 2 1 code a code to solve the inverse problem by fitting a variety of analytical solutions of theoretical transport models developed by toride et al 1999 was used to model the btc based on this modified input function since there is no facility for applying multiple input functions in the software package the three inputs were added together and discretised over time to yield a multi pulse input table s3 the dirac input was applied using a 3 minute pulse which is equivalent to an instantaneous input compared to the relatively long mean transit time altogether five parameters mdirac c1 c2 λ1 and λ2 were step by step optimized to yield a model the forward model that approximates the original model by geyer et al 2007 without needing to modify any of the relevant transport parameters fig 5 the btc of the new transport model fig 6 a gives an r2 value coefficient of determination of 0 996 and a mean square error of 0 455 µgl 1 compared to the original model by geyer et al 2007 total mass recoveries after 65 h were 403 g for the model presented herein and 399 g for the model by geyer et al 2007 see fig 6b and table s2 the new model shows that the instantaneous input of 1710 µgl 1 tinopal cbs x over a period of 3 min contributes only 115 g 27 of the total mass recovered fig 6b this is about 25 less than expected from the equilibrium calculations 155 g but is still reasonable considering the differences between laboratory conditions and field conditions e g different super saturation levels and or slightly different water chemistries the first of the exponential input functions decreases rapidly starting with a concentration of about 163 4 µgl 1 and reaching 5 µgl 1 about 4 5 h after the first input fig 5 it contributes 32 g 8 to the total recovered mass fig 6b this fraction of tinopalates may have consisted of the larger crystals which are easily retained within the vadose zone and require more time to dissolve using this approach leaves about 0 4 µgl 1 still being leached from the aquifer after 80 h which is the time at which the concentration of tinopal cbs x at the gallusquelle spring falls below the lod the results demonstrate that a modified input function with input concentrations that decrease progressively over time can adequately reproduce the observed shift in the concentration peak and the long tailing of the btc in the tracer study performed by geyer et al 2007 this supports the assumption of progressive dissolution of precipitated tinopalates within the aquifer however this model is not unique the dissolution could be even more gradual and could take place closer to the spring assuming ongoing dissolution of tinopalates during transport within the saturated zone which would result in a much more complex input the transport of tinopal cbs x could also differ slightly from that of uranine 3 4 sensitivity analyses the sensitivity of the transport model to variations in the input function parameters mdirac c1 λ1 c2 λ2 was investigated by comparing the root mean square errors rsmes of the model with those of the original model by geyer et al 2007 this analysis showed that the parameters chosen for the transport model give minimum rsme values fig 7 even when the values of the parameters were varied between 50 and 50 of those used in the model no other minimum becomes visible i e parameters of the model are expected to represent the parameters that result in the lowest rmse values plots of the rmse values for all parameters variations except λ1 exhibit symmetrical shapes the rmse of λ1 tends to be smaller for positive deviations from the ideal values than for negative deviations the result show that the first exponential input function parameters c1 and λ1 and the dirac input mass mdirac have the greatest impact on the transport model while the second exponential input function parameters c2 and λ2 has only limited impact the concentration parameter c1 mainly affects the height of the concentration peak in the btc whereas λ1 affects not only the height of the concentration peak in the btc but also its timing fig 8 a the input mass of the dirac input has less impact on the transport model than the first exponential input function it mainly shifts the concentration peak towards either higher or lower concentrations fig 8c the second input has the least effect on the model as this fraction of the overall input function which makes only a small contribution to the total concentration mainly affects the tailing of the btc fig 8b 4 conclusions tinopal cbs x has a lower solubility in many water types than other frequently used fluorescent dye tracers and the tracer mixture in the experiments reported herein was found to be oversaturated in tinopal cbs x this may explain the long tailings or non detection reported in certain contexts the solubility of tinopal cbs x is relatively low especially in waters with large quantities of bivalent and or trivalent cations this renders the compound unsuitable for use as an ideal tracer in aquatic systems with high water hardness such as that found in dolomite or calcite karst aquifers despite this fact tracer tests using tinopal cbs x have in the past been mostly conducted in carbonate karst aquifers where the water hardness is usually high these investigations have revealed that a large quantity of edta would need to be added for the tinopal cbs x to be completely dissolved which is not feasible for field applications due to environmental concerns even though it might be acceptable in laboratory investigations even with similar molar concentrations of edta and tinopal cbs x only about 75 of the tinopal cbs x could be dissolved at a ph of 7 6 the solubility of tinopal cbs x in the tested water chemistry was enhanced by carbonate precipitation which started at a ph of approximately 9 rather than by chelation by edta the dye tracer was completely dissolved at ph values of 9 5 and 10 irrespective of the edta concentrations softening the water by for example adding naoh may therefore be a reasonable alternative for enhancing the solubility of tinopal cbs x in tracer mixtures during field applications results have provided no evidence of rapid tinopalcbs x sorption to or co precipitation with carbonates however precipitation of tinopal cbs x may occur during injection of the tracer mixture into groundwater that contains large quantities of bivalent and or trivalent cations the precipitation and subsequent dissolution of tracer compounds in tracer experiments generates an input function that differs from an instantaneous dirac input if this effect is not taken into account the transport parameters modeled for tracer breakthrough curves are likely to deviate from the actual values travel time and attenuation by incompletely dissolved tracers therefore tend to be overestimated which affects the reliability of contaminant transport predictions and the delineation of water protection zones the retardation of the tracer study by geyer et al 2007 and the retardation that results from the new input function differ by 5 this could result in the area calculated for a circular water protection zone being underestimated by 10 tinopal cbs x can generally be used as a conservative tracer in groundwater systems with high flow volumes low water hardness high alkalinity and a high ph fractured aquifers may be more suitable than porous media as they would tend to avoid the filtering out of previously precipitated tinopal cbs x if these preconditions are not fulfilled but tinopal cbs x still has to be used then its solubility can be calculated using the phreeqc script provided in this publication and the required tracer concentrations modified accordingly declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

6110,tinopal cbs x has been described in published literature as a fluorescent dye that is suitable for use as a tracer in groundwater investigations however several of these field tests have yielded unexpected results in this study the influence that the complexation agent edta ethylenediaminetetraacetate and ph have on the solubility of tinopal cbs x have been systematically investigated in the laboratory and the results obtained validated with thermodynamic calculations using the phreeqc software modeling indicated that the amount of edta required for complete tinopal cbs x dissolution is in many aquifers so great that its use is no longer feasible however softening the water by adding naoh appears to be a promising way to increase tinopal cbs x solubility water with a low availability of bivalent and or trivalent ions yielded solubilities up to two orders of magnitude higher than waters from limestone aquifers with a high ca2 ion content results revealed that the spectrum of tinopal cbs x applicability as a conservative tracer in aquatic environments is limited to a limited range of specific water chemistries the long tailing in the breakthrough curve and the retarded breakthrough of tinopal cbs x in a previously reported carbonate karst aquifer field tracer test was accurately reproduced by a transport model with a modified input function based on solubility modeling travel times and attenuation by incompletely dissolved tracers are tend to be overestimated which can be problematic with regard to predictions of contaminant transport or the delineation of water protection zones the use of tinopal cbs x as a conservative tracer and the concentrations required needs therefore to be carefully evaluated with respect to water hardness ph alkalinity and dilution rates an input script for phreeqc is provided to help estimate appropriate concentrations of tinopal cbs x thus enhancing its potential and reliability for future groundwater research

typical tracer input concentrations of a few grams per liter e g gombert et al 2017 exceed the solubilities reported for tinopal cbs x 6 50 mg l 1 licha et al 2013 by about two orders of magnitude licha et al 2013 concluded that low recoveries of tinopal cbs x in tracer tests were due to its complexation mainly with omnipresent mg2 and ca2 divalent cations the long tailing was suspected to be a result of precipitation and subsequent re dissolution of precipitates the complexation agent edta ethylenediaminetetraacetate for additional information see dwyer 1964 flaschka 1964 has been suggested by some authors käss 2004 licha et al 2013 as an additive that if mixed with the tracer solution before adding the tracer would prevent tinopal cbs x precipitating together with divalent and or trivalent cations theoretical calculations by licha et al 2013 of the edta concentrations that would be required in tinopal cbs x tracer solutions remain to be systematically validated and their practical use has yet to be evaluated in field tracer tests the dissolution of tracer precipitates during tracer input into an aquifer has also not previously been taken into consideration only the chemical behavior of possible input solutions the objective of these investigations was to validate the required edta concentrations calculated by licha et al 2013 and to derive practical guidelines regarding the application and applicability of tinopal cbs x in different aquifers in particular with respect to their water chemistries to this end the solubility of tinopal cbs x was systematically investigated for different edta concentrations and at different ph values both experimentally and by equilibrium modeling using phreeqc software the results obtained were then used to calculate the solubility of tinopal cbs x in waters from selected aquifers in order to provide a basis for decision making on the applicability of tinopal cbs x for these specific aquifers finally the influence that the limited solubility of tinopal cbs x has on the breakthrough of the tracer was investigated using data from a previous field tracer test geyer et al 2007 in a carbonate karst aquifer the results are expected to provide valuable guidance for the future use of tinopal cbs x in tracer investigations and to reduce the risk of failure 2 analytical and laboratory methods 2 1 chemicals tinopal cbs x with 98 purity was purchased as sodium salt relevant physico chemical properties of the compound are listed in table 1 the solubility of tinopal cbs x in deionized water is reported to be in the range of 0 4 0 5 gl 1 at 10 c and 25 gl 1 at 25 c käss 2004 table 1 ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta was purchased as titriplex ii from merck kgaa cas 60 00 4 relevant physico chemical properties are again listed in table 1 berlin tap water was used as the matrix water for all experiments its chemistry is comparable to that of water from limestone karst aquifers e g white et al 1963 licha et al 2013 where tracer tests using tinopal cbs x have been frequently conducted concentrations of the most abundant ions in the matrix water are included in table 2 the ph was adjusted using hcl and naoh for this purpose a concentration of 1 moll 1 sodium hydroxide was prepared from concentrated sodium hydroxide stock solution analysis quality acquired from merck kgaa while hcl was added as 0 1 moll 1 hydrochloric acid titripur quality also acquired from merck kgaa hexamethylenetetramine cas 100 97 0 and hydrazine sulfate cas 10034 93 2 both from merck kgaa were used to prepare a formazin standard for turbidity calibrations 2 2 chemical analyses tinopal cbs x concentrations were measured using a field fluorometer ggun fl 30 albillia co neuchâtel switzerland the tinopal cbs x has been found be subject to photo degradation during analysis poiger et al 1996 due to isomerization processes only the first concentration measurements were therefore considered in each case no photo degradation was observed during short periods several minutes of exposure to sunlight calibration was performed for four different concentrations 0 01 0 1 0 5 and 1 mgl 1 with three repetitions for each calibration and using freshly prepared concentration standards in each case the mean standard deviations 1σ for all sets of three concentration standards n 12 were less than 3 the lower limit of detection llod in matrix water with a ph of 7 6 was determined to be 2 ppb and the limit of quantitation 6 7 ppb the upper limit of detection was approximately 1 mgl 1 giving an operating range of 2 µgl 1 to 1 mgl 1 the fluorescence intensity of tinopal cbs x was constant within a ph range of 6 1 10 which is in accordance with other studies käss 2004 a formazine standard for calibrating turbidity was prepared using hexamethylenetetramine and following din en iso 7027 the ph was measured using an hq40d portable multi meter and an intellical phc201 ph electrode both from hach lange gmbh düsseldorf germany with the smallest detectable change being less than 0 1 the edta and tinopal cbs x input concentrations were calculated from their respective masses errors are estimated to be less than 5 calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 and sodium na were analyzed using atomic absorption spectroscopy analytik jena ag novaa 400g anion concentrations were determined using ion chromatography dx 120 dionex and hco3 concentrations using gran titration 2 3 precipitation experiments precipitation experiments were carried out using batches of samples each comprising 100 ml of matrix water with identical tinopal cbs x concentrations but varying edta concentrations compositions listed in table 2 and with different ph values table 3 all experiments were conducted at 25 2 c with continuous mixing by magnetic stirrer five different edta concentrations were prepared for each batch by adding 0 10 26 40 and 52 mg of the compound the ph was varied for each edta concentration by adding either naoh to obtain ph values of 7 6 9 0 9 5 and 10 0 or hcl to obtain a ph of 6 1 resulting in 25 samples altogether and hence 25 experiments following complete dissolution of the edta after 30 min and stabilization of the ph values 10 ml of tinopal cbs x stock solution were added for each of the ph values 10 7 ml at ph 6 1 yielding a tinopal cbs x concentration of 909 mgl 1 975 mgl 1 for ph 6 1 the solution was then mixed for 24 h using a magnetic stirrer in order to ensure equilibration the samples were then centrifuged for 60 min at 25 c and 3000 rpm in a temperature controlled centrifuge sorvall rc 3b refrigerated centrifuge a 50 µl volume of the supernatant solution was then extracted from each sample taken from the uppermost part of the solution by pipetting and then diluted to 100 ml with matrix water fluorescence intensities were then measured the samples and stock solution were thoroughly protected from direct sunlight with aluminum foil although the analytical error in the fluorescence measurements was quite low 1σ 3 for nine individual prepared calibration standards additional errors could have been introduced during sample preparation e g during centrifugation and dilution but these are estimated to have been less than 5 for tinopal cbs x concentrations in the solution the total methodical error is therefore estimated to have been less than 10 2 4 geochemical modeling the phreeqc program version 3 3 12 12704 parkhurst and appelo 2013 was used to calculate the equilibrium chemistries of the solutions in the batches in order to be consistent with chemical nomenclature the anion of tinopal cbs x will be called tinopalate t2 and its respective salts tinopalates met or me2t3 where me represent bivalent and or trivalent cations selected input scripts used to calculate equilibrium conditions can be found in the supplementary file script s 1 the minteq v4 dat database was used and data on solubility products and the enthalpies of tinopalates were implemented according to licha et al 2013 table 4 referring to the reaction 1 met me 2 t 2 with met being the tinopalate me2 the related cation and t2 the tinopal cbs x in solution the solubility product of met is then defined as 2 k sp met a me 2 a t 2 with ksp met being the solubility product a me 2 the activity of the bivalent cation and a t 2 the activity of the tinopal cbs x anion data on fe2 fe3 and al3 were not used because of missing values for standard solution enthalpies formation constants for metal edta complexes e g ca edta 2 were calculated using experimental data obtained at 25 c identical to our conditions from arena et al 1983 and then used in the phreeqc program since variations in the ionic strengths of the solutions used in our investigations had no significant effect on the equilibrium constants logkca 10 5 12 2 logkmg 8 7 10 3 equilibrium constants were calculated for the input water matrix only is 9 7 kca 11 88 kmg 10 00 and only a minor error introduced as a result acidity constants for edta were taken directly from the phreeqc database and not adjusted to ionic strength no significant change in acidity constants were expected due to the low ionic strength in most cases battaglia et al 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of edta and ph on tinopal cbs x solubility preliminary modeling was used to predict the influence of edta input concentration 236 mgl 1 on tinopal cbs x solubility input concentration 1 gl 1 at increasing ph values fig 1 the matrix water in the model was the same as that used in the experiments table 2 the modeling indicated that edta at approximately half the molar concentration of tinopal cbs x has only a minor effect on its solubility even though the concentration of the ca2 species decreases significantly between ph 3 and ph 5 5 due to chelation by edta the solubility of tinopal cbs x is hardly affected at ph 8 1 the saturation index of calcite approaches zero and the solubility of calcite is exceeded resulting in an abrupt reduction in the ca2 species in solution the solubility of tinopal cbs x increases as the ph increases until it is completely dissolved at ph 8 8 the modeling indicated that the precipitation of carbonates first calcite and then dolomite is the main factor affecting the solubility of tinopal cbs x under equilibrium conditions for the applied water chemistry as the ph approached 10 edta favored na edta 3 over ca edta 2 resulting in ca2 precipitation the molality of na2t also increased abstracting already dissolved t 2 from the solution the experimental results show similar trends in tinopal cbs x solubility to the preliminary modeling fig 2 b edta had a significant effect on the solubility of tinopal cbs x at low ph values fig 2a for example at ph 6 1 the concentration of tinopal cbs x in solution increased progressively from 100 mgl 1 to 670 mgl 1 following the addition of 473 mgl 1 of edta increasing concentrations of edta increased the proportion of its four valent species which chelates bivalent and trivalent cations thus inhibiting the precipitation of tinopalates however complete solution of tinopal cbs x was not achieved for ph values between 6 and 9 even though the input concentration by mass of edta was up to half that of tinopal cbs x and almost the same by molar concentration except at ph6 1 where edta input had only 94 molar concentration compared to tinopal cbs x as in the preliminary modeling the experimental data show a rapid increase in tinopal cbs x solubility at elevated ph values this effect is clearly visible if the tinopal cbs x solubility is plotted against the ph fig 2b both the modeling and the experimental data therefore indicate that softening decarbonisation of the solution due to the precipitation of carbonates is the main factor affecting tinopal cbs x dissolution in the particular matrix water used in our investigations however the sudden increase in tinopal cbs x solubility occurred at higher ph values in the experiments than in the preliminary modeling the experimental results were therefore used to calibrate the model in the preliminary modeling tinopal cbs x was already completely dissolved at ph9 0 for modeling the experiments supersaturation of carbonates was required to be taken into account at the same ph in order to obtain relatively low tinopalcbs x solubilities fig 1 oversaturation of carbonates is a common phenomenon especially when homogeneous nucleation occurs where no seeds for crystallization are present morse et al 2007 de choudens sanchez and gonzalez 2009 saturation index si values can be influenced by a number of factors such as temperature and fluid composition morse et al 2007 for example dolomite is unlikely to precipitate at the relatively low ca mg ratios of the water used in our investigations folk and land 1975 morse et al 2007 at a ph of 9 0 the si indices used in the model were 3 for calcite 2 for aragonite and 2 for dolomite the results of preliminary experiments on softening the water used in our investigations as well as those from phreeqc modeling have confirmed these degrees of supersaturation a certain degree of supersaturation of cat was also required to obtain an adequate fit of the modeling results with the experimental results the degree of supersaturation required generally increased with edta concentration table 5 on the whole the model was able to reproduce the experimental results except at ph values of 9 5 and 10 0 where the modeled solubilities were higher and lower respectively than the experimental results fig 2a in the experiments the concentration of dissolved tinopal cbs x at ph 10 0 even exceeded the input concentrations but it remained within the range of experimental and analytical uncertainty 3 2 solubility of tinopal cbs x in selected aquifers bivalent and trivalent cations ph and temperature all have a significant influence on the precipitation of tinopalates and therefore on the solubility of tinopal cbs x groundwater chemistry can vary markedly between different aquifers and the solubility of tinopal cbs x may therefore differ by several orders of magnitude between different aquifers the solubility of tinopal cbs x was calculated to provide guidance with respect to its future use in different types of aquifer e g sand and gravel rhyolite or limestone aquifers in surface waters such as saline mining water and in acid sulfate chlorine springs table 6 and fig 3 the reaction temperature was set to 25 c for reasons of comparability but the ph was variable although the ionic strength of saline mining water sample 1 table 6 was high compared to that of other water samples in table 6 it had the highest tinopal cbs x solubility ranging from 1 gl 1 to more than 200 gl 1 fig 3 this was mainly due to the relatively low water hardness table 6 the ph also remained unaffected by increasing concentrations of edta and tinopal cbs x due to the high alkalinity of the water in all other water samples tinopal cbs x had a solubility of 1 gl 1 table 6 and fig 3 water from sand and gravel aquifers sample 2 table 6 shows a decrease in tinopal cbs x solubility at high edta concentrations due to the lower ph of the water the addition of edta in sample 5 had almost no effect the ph levels were relatively low and the concentrations of m edta 2 were therefore too low to significantly reduce the amount of ca2 in solution oversaturation of carbonates si 0 was observed in sample 4 a second model was therefore calculated taking into account the precipitation of carbonates under equilibrium conditions si 0 shaded area for sample 4 in fig 3 it is interesting to note that carbonate karst aquifers which is where tinopal cbs x has mostly been used showed the lowest solubility for the dye tracer with values in the range of 0 06 0 15 gl 1 this might prevent accurate quantification of transport parameters since there is no comprehensive set of thermodynamic data available on fe2 t al3 t and fe3 t solubilities could be lower for those aquifers that contain high concentrations of cations such as fe2 fe2 and al3 such cations in the samples investigated however these cations are present in relatively low concentrations and therefore have little impact on the results 3 3 effect of tinopal cbs x solubility on its transport geyer et al 2007 conducted a multi tracer test at the intensively investigated gallusquelle karst spring in south western germany the tracer used was a mixture of uranine 750 g sulforhodamine g 750 g and tinopal cbs x 1500 g dissolved in 1000l of drinking water from the same aquifer the mixture was then washed into the aquifer over 4 5 h using about 77 m3 of the same water low mass recovery a delay in breakthrough and unexpectedly long tailing of the breakthrough curve btc was observed for tinopal cbs x compared to the ideal unreactive fluorescent tracer uranine fig 4 a and table s1 the tailing can be approximated by a straight line with a slope of 0 093 for uranine and 0 047 for tinopal cbs x semi logarithmic plot of logarithmic concentration versus time fig 4a the β value of the transport model which is either the partitioning coefficient for r 1 or the mobile water fraction for r 1 toride et al 1999 has a direct influence on the tailing of the btc high β values close to one result in little tailing whereas low β values result in long tailings with shallow slopes and with the peaks also occurring earlier fig 4b geyer et al 2007 s interpretation assumed an instantaneous input of the tracer mixture represented by a dirac function which required to adapt transport parameter to fit each btc in particular the beta values of the transport were adapted the β values for the modelled btc in fig 4b were 0 94 for tinopal cbs x and 0 97 for uranine which is a significant difference considering fig 4b in view of the relatively low solubility of tinopal cbs x in carbonate aquifers precipitation of tinopalates from the tracer mixture would be expected to occur in the tracer experiment conducted by geyer et al 2007 as previously suggested by geyer et al 2007 and licha et al 2013 the solubility of tinopal cbs x in the karst aquifer that we investigated was expected to be much less than 100 mgl 1 table 6 and the input concentration of 1 5 gl 1 therefore exceeded its solubility by at least an order of magnitude the resulting tinopalate precipitates can be physically retained within the aquifer flushing them into the aquifer from the surface is therefore likely to result in subsequent interactions with the groundwater and the release of their dissolved counterparts the mass input therefore needs to differ from a dirac delta input function instantaneous mass input using a modified input function accounting for the dissolution of the compound could be more representative of the tracer experiment rather than modify the β value that suggests change in physical processes we therefore examined whether or not such an input function was able to adequately reproduce the btc for tinopal cbs x from the tracer test performed by geyer et al 2007 in this revisited interpretation the transport of tinopal cbs x was assumed to be ideal and therefore identical to that of uranine table s2 and the btc was assumed to only be affected by input functions that differ from a dirac input for the tracer experiment presented herein the input function consisted of two parts an instantaneous part derived from the dissolved fraction of the 1500 g tinopal cbs x within the initial tracer mixture and a second part derived from the dissolution of previously retained tinopalates that were introduced into the aquifer with the tracer mixture i e the remaining fraction of the 1500 g a new input function was therefore defined taking into account the following assumptions 1 a first dirac i e instantaneous input of 155 g mdirac that results from dissolution of tinopal cbs x within the barrel containing 1500 g of the tracer in 1000l of water based on equilibrium concentrations calculated using phreeqc software 2 a second input that results from the intense washing of the tracer for 4 5 h as described in geyer et al 2007 the function was modelled using an exponential input function that describes a continuous decline in input concentration 3 c exp 1 t c 1 e λ 1 t cexp1 t input concentration over time for the first exponential function c1 initial concentration for the first exponential function λ1 exponential decline constant for the first exponential function 3 a third input that is generated by the slow percolation of water within the vadose zone following the intense washing was implemented using a second exponential function 4 c e x p 2 t c 2 e λ 2 t cexp2 t input concentration over time for the second exponential function c2 initial concentration for the second exponential function λ2 exponential decline constant for the second exponential function the stanmod 2 08 software package computer software to evaluate solute transport developed by šimůnek et al 1999 which uses the cxtfit 2 1 code a code to solve the inverse problem by fitting a variety of analytical solutions of theoretical transport models developed by toride et al 1999 was used to model the btc based on this modified input function since there is no facility for applying multiple input functions in the software package the three inputs were added together and discretised over time to yield a multi pulse input table s3 the dirac input was applied using a 3 minute pulse which is equivalent to an instantaneous input compared to the relatively long mean transit time altogether five parameters mdirac c1 c2 λ1 and λ2 were step by step optimized to yield a model the forward model that approximates the original model by geyer et al 2007 without needing to modify any of the relevant transport parameters fig 5 the btc of the new transport model fig 6 a gives an r2 value coefficient of determination of 0 996 and a mean square error of 0 455 µgl 1 compared to the original model by geyer et al 2007 total mass recoveries after 65 h were 403 g for the model presented herein and 399 g for the model by geyer et al 2007 see fig 6b and table s2 the new model shows that the instantaneous input of 1710 µgl 1 tinopal cbs x over a period of 3 min contributes only 115 g 27 of the total mass recovered fig 6b this is about 25 less than expected from the equilibrium calculations 155 g but is still reasonable considering the differences between laboratory conditions and field conditions e g different super saturation levels and or slightly different water chemistries the first of the exponential input functions decreases rapidly starting with a concentration of about 163 4 µgl 1 and reaching 5 µgl 1 about 4 5 h after the first input fig 5 it contributes 32 g 8 to the total recovered mass fig 6b this fraction of tinopalates may have consisted of the larger crystals which are easily retained within the vadose zone and require more time to dissolve using this approach leaves about 0 4 µgl 1 still being leached from the aquifer after 80 h which is the time at which the concentration of tinopal cbs x at the gallusquelle spring falls below the lod the results demonstrate that a modified input function with input concentrations that decrease progressively over time can adequately reproduce the observed shift in the concentration peak and the long tailing of the btc in the tracer study performed by geyer et al 2007 this supports the assumption of progressive dissolution of precipitated tinopalates within the aquifer however this model is not unique the dissolution could be even more gradual and could take place closer to the spring assuming ongoing dissolution of tinopalates during transport within the saturated zone which would result in a much more complex input the transport of tinopal cbs x could also differ slightly from that of uranine 3 4 sensitivity analyses the sensitivity of the transport model to variations in the input function parameters mdirac c1 λ1 c2 λ2 was investigated by comparing the root mean square errors rsmes of the model with those of the original model by geyer et al 2007 this analysis showed that the parameters chosen for the transport model give minimum rsme values fig 7 even when the values of the parameters were varied between 50 and 50 of those used in the model no other minimum becomes visible i e parameters of the model are expected to represent the parameters that result in the lowest rmse values plots of the rmse values for all parameters variations except λ1 exhibit symmetrical shapes the rmse of λ1 tends to be smaller for positive deviations from the ideal values than for negative deviations the result show that the first exponential input function parameters c1 and λ1 and the dirac input mass mdirac have the greatest impact on the transport model while the second exponential input function parameters c2 and λ2 has only limited impact the concentration parameter c1 mainly affects the height of the concentration peak in the btc whereas λ1 affects not only the height of the concentration peak in the btc but also its timing fig 8 a the input mass of the dirac input has less impact on the transport model than the first exponential input function it mainly shifts the concentration peak towards either higher or lower concentrations fig 8c the second input has the least effect on the model as this fraction of the overall input function which makes only a small contribution to the total concentration mainly affects the tailing of the btc fig 8b 4 conclusions tinopal cbs x has a lower solubility in many water types than other frequently used fluorescent dye tracers and the tracer mixture in the experiments reported herein was found to be oversaturated in tinopal cbs x this may explain the long tailings or non detection reported in certain contexts the solubility of tinopal cbs x is relatively low especially in waters with large quantities of bivalent and or trivalent cations this renders the compound unsuitable for use as an ideal tracer in aquatic systems with high water hardness such as that found in dolomite or calcite karst aquifers despite this fact tracer tests using tinopal cbs x have in the past been mostly conducted in carbonate karst aquifers where the water hardness is usually high these investigations have revealed that a large quantity of edta would need to be added for the tinopal cbs x to be completely dissolved which is not feasible for field applications due to environmental concerns even though it might be acceptable in laboratory investigations even with similar molar concentrations of edta and tinopal cbs x only about 75 of the tinopal cbs x could be dissolved at a ph of 7 6 the solubility of tinopal cbs x in the tested water chemistry was enhanced by carbonate precipitation which started at a ph of approximately 9 rather than by chelation by edta the dye tracer was completely dissolved at ph values of 9 5 and 10 irrespective of the edta concentrations softening the water by for example adding naoh may therefore be a reasonable alternative for enhancing the solubility of tinopal cbs x in tracer mixtures during field applications results have provided no evidence of rapid tinopalcbs x sorption to or co precipitation with carbonates however precipitation of tinopal cbs x may occur during injection of the tracer mixture into groundwater that contains large quantities of bivalent and or trivalent cations the precipitation and subsequent dissolution of tracer compounds in tracer experiments generates an input function that differs from an instantaneous dirac input if this effect is not taken into account the transport parameters modeled for tracer breakthrough curves are likely to deviate from the actual values travel time and attenuation by incompletely dissolved tracers therefore tend to be overestimated which affects the reliability of contaminant transport predictions and the delineation of water protection zones the retardation of the tracer study by geyer et al 2007 and the retardation that results from the new input function differ by 5 this could result in the area calculated for a circular water protection zone being underestimated by 10 tinopal cbs x can generally be used as a conservative tracer in groundwater systems with high flow volumes low water hardness high alkalinity and a high ph fractured aquifers may be more suitable than porous media as they would tend to avoid the filtering out of previously precipitated tinopal cbs x if these preconditions are not fulfilled but tinopal cbs x still has to be used then its solubility can be calculated using the phreeqc script provided in this publication and the required tracer concentrations modified accordingly declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

inermis trifolium repens panicum virgatum medicago sativa and miscanthus sinensis an automatic measurement system of point source device was used to quantify the soil infiltration rate results showed that swc significantly affected the initial infiltration rate p 0 05 but plant roots gradually became the main factor affecting soil infiltration rate as the increasing infiltration time the percentage of root volume pv of 0 2 mm was positively correlated with infiltration rate while the pv of 4 5 mm was negatively correlated with infiltration rate our results indicated that fine roots could increase soil organic matters and form soil pores thus more determining the potential of soil infiltration than soil water content during the short term vegetation restoration in semi arid

replenishment in the semi arid regions which influences the vegetation restoration potential soil erosion and groundwater recharge zhao et al 2013 leung et al 2015 sun et al 2018 infiltration is the process of rainfall transform into soil water by downward or gravitational flow huang et al 2017 soil infiltration capacity could be determined for example the initial infiltration rate steady infiltration rate and mean infiltration rate sun et al 2018 as an important hydrological parameter wu et al 2016 the quantification of infiltration capacity is a crucial issue for vegetation maintenance and land management previous studies have found that soil infiltration capacity was generally affected by various soil properties and vegetation characteristics such as porosity organic matters bulk density and roots bormann and klaassen 2008 leung et al 2015 franzluebbers 2002 indicated that soil organic matters and soil aggregation improved water infiltration nearly threefold alaoui 2015 investigated the hydrological parameters of four representative grassland soils on the swiss plateau and found that the interaction between bulk density and macroporsity could facilitate water infiltration conversely some studies have reported that soil bulk density is weakly related to macropore flow meek et al 1989 fischer et al 2014 moreover soil water content swc is also key factor determining soil infiltration capacity in semi arid regions archer et al 2002 zehe and blöschl 2004 cerdà 1996 reported that soil infiltration rate was higher in summer than wet seasons because of the higher soil moisture contents soil water content is susceptible to the changes of external environments such as rainfall temperature and vegetation type in semi arid regions the lower initial soil water content increases the potential for infiltration alaoui 2015 grassland is the most typical vegetation restoration species in semi arid areas because of its drought resistance and good adaptability to severe climate and poor soil conditions cui et al 2018 grassland had abundant root systems which could cause remarkable changes in soil physicochemical properties and thus had a vital effect on soil infiltration capacity fu et al 2000 mwendera and saleem 2010 wu et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 evaluated the soil infiltrability of five grasslands of successive age classes they found that long term grassland restoration accumulated organic matter and improved soil structural properties thus significantly enhancing soil infiltration capacity and reducing soil erosion the different types of artificial grassland may cause different changes in soil properties and then affect soil infiltration in varying degrees angers and caron 1998 bormann and klaassen 2008 huang et al 2017 found that legume grasslands had higher infiltration capacity than gramineous grasslands in the arid region which could be attributed to the below ground biomass wu et al 2016 legume grasslands had higher below ground biomass improving total soil porosity and soil organic matters thus enhancing soil infiltration capacity archer et al 2002 reported that the abundant root network of grassland could clog the soil pore space and decrease soil infiltration rate in general soil infiltration rate was affected by vegetation type soil porosity organic matters soil water content and root system previous studies have mainly focused on the effects of soil water content and root biomass on the whole infiltration process however the effects of different root diameters on infiltration rate and the relative importance of root diameter and soil water content during different infiltration stages are poorly understood in this study we measured soil infiltration rate by the point source device at five

other soil properties tp soc and mwd on soil infiltration rate and 2 identify the main factor affecting soil infiltration rate at different infiltration stages this study could provide the opportunity to clarify the relative importance of root diameter and soil water content during infiltration process and further provide new insights into soil infiltration for vegetation restoration 2 materials

medicago sativa m sativa and miscanthus sinensis m sinensis in 2012 these artificial grasslands were high quality forages which were widely planted in this area three replicate plots 3 m 5 m were constructed on each grassland type various grasses used the same planting time and were irrigated to ensure grass survival during the beginning of the growing period the amount of flood irrigation in each plot was 3375 kg later on grass growth entirely depended on rainfall without fertilization or human intervention this ensured that the conditions in all of the plots were similar but also that any differences were solely due to the grassland type therefore it could be assumed that any differences in soil physical properties and soil water content could be attributed to the type of artificial grassland all experiment processes were conducted in september 2015 july and september 2016 2 3 infiltration measurement the soil infiltration rates under the different artificial grasslands were determined by a soil infiltration capacity automatic measurement system wu et al 2016 huang et al 2017 the automatic measurement system consists of a computer a camera a tripod and a peristaltic pump as the peristaltic pump supplies water to the soil surface at constant rate the camera automatically captures images of the wet area of soil surface every 3 min under the control of the computer soil infiltration rate was calculated by using a numerical algorithm based on the change of wet area 1 p n q i 1 n 1 p n δ s n i 1 δ s n n 1 2 3 where q is the rate of water supply l h 1 pn is the soil infiltration rate at time n mm h 1 δsn is the change of the wet area in a given time period tn tn 1 mm2 the full standing vegetation at ground level was cut off and the litter from the soil surface was removed before measuring since soil infiltration rate generally reached a stable level within 75 90 min we chose 90 min as the time for each infiltration measurement in this study according to the dynamic process of infiltration we took the mean infiltration rate of the first 3 min as the initial infiltration rate iir and then took the average infiltration rate of 3 15 min as the average infiltration rate of stage i airs i likewise the average infiltration rate of stage ii airs ii was for the period 15 45 min and the average infiltration rate of stage iii airs iii was for the period 45 75 min the average infiltration rate of the final 15 min 75 90 min was taken as the steady infiltration rate sir 2 4 soil sampling and analysis in each plot soil samples were collected at soil depth of 10 cm 20 cm and 30 cm respectively these soil samples were taken back to the laboratory to measure soil water content soil organic carbon soil bulk and soil aggregates among these parameters soil water content was measured before infiltration measurement and other parameters were measured after infiltration measurement gravimetric soil water content was measured by using a soil auger 5 cm in diameter before infiltration measurement the soil samples were sealed immediately in airtight aluminum cylinders weighed and brought to the laboratory moist soil samples were oven dried at 105 c until constant weight for the determination of gravimetric soil water content unit g g 1 volumetric soil water content was calculated using eq 3 all the field sampling and laboratory work of soil water content were completed in 3 days 2 swc swc g bd where swc is the volumetric soil water content cm3 cm 3 bd is the soil bulk density g cm 3 swcg is the gravimetric soil water content g g 1 a stainless steel cylindrical ring of 100 cm3 volume was used for collecting moist soil samples and oven dried at105 c until constant weight for calculating soil bulk density bd total porosity tp of soil was calculated using eq 1 based on the measured bulk density and assuming a soil particle density of 2 65 g cm 3 wu et al 2016 3 tp 1 bd ds 100 where tp is the total soil porosity bd is the soil bulk density g cm 3 ds is the soil particle density g cm 3 the measurement of soil organic carbon soc was determined by oxidation with potassium chromate method walkley and black 1934 before measuring soc soil samples were air dried at room temperature until constant weight and removed large roots the aluminum containers were used to collect undisturbed soil samples after the removal of visible plant residues for the measurement of soil aggregates subsequently all the soil samples were transported to the laboratory within 2 days much attention was paid to the soil samples to maintain their structures intact during the transportation the composition of soil aggregates was determined with the routine dry and wet sieving methods liu et al 1996 the large soil clods while still moist were gently broken along natural fracture lines by hand passed through a 10 mm sieve fu et al 2000 and then air dried at room temperature for measurement the air dried soil samples were sieved manually on a column of five sieves 5 2 1 0 5 and 0 25 mm resulting in the collection of six aggregate size fractions 5 10 mm 2 5 mm 1 2 mm 0 5 1 mm 0 25 0 5 mm and 0 0 25 mm the weight percentage of each aggregate size fraction was calculated composite soil samples for wet sieving were made by blending all fractions of dry aggregates proportionally exactly 50 g of soil integrated from the above steps was put on the first sieve of the same set in a water bucket containing deionized water and was gently moistened for 30 min so as to drive entrapped air from the aggregates the aggregates were separated by moving the sieve vertically with a speed of 30 s min 1 for 1 min lastly soil fractions remaining on the sieves were separately collected oven dried and weighed to get a constant mass the soil mean weight diameter mwd was calculated as follows parent et al 2012 4 mwd i 1 n x i w i where xi is the assumed diameter for ith fraction wi is the weight fraction remained on the ith sieve size n is the number of sieves 2 5 root parameters measurement after each infiltration measurement a flat square cornered box 10 cm 10 cm 10 cm was used to sample soil from depth of 0 30 cm and every 10 cm intervals the soil samples were washed with water for the laboratory measurement of root parameters root diameter analyses were measured using winrhizo winrhizo pro 2009b winrhizo is an image analysis system specifically designed for root measurement it consists of a computer program and image acquisition components and can be used in morphology i e length area and volume topology architecture and color analysis then all roots were oven dried at 75 c for 48 h until constant weight and weighed for belowground biomass bgb after root diameter analysis the percentage of root volume pv of various root diameter sizes was calculated using eq 5 5 pv v i v where v is the volume of total roots vi is the volume of roots on the ith diameter size 2 6 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was employed to analyze the differences of mean values among treatments significant differences were determined at the 0 05 level unary linear regression and correlation analysis were used to analyze the relationship between roots swc soc mwd tp and soil infiltration rate in order to reduce numerous correlated variables down to a smaller number of principal components principal components analysis pca was used to further investigate the variation in pv kaiser meyer olkin measure kmo 0 50 and bartlett s test of sphericity p 0 05 were conducted to test the sampling adequacy of individual

analysis ln is the natural log function r is the value of the correlation coefficient matrix r structural equation model is a statistical method to analyze the relationship between variables based on the covariance matrix of variables and it is an important tool for multivariate data analysis we used structural equation model to explain the direct and indirect effect of pc1 and pc2 on soil infiltration through soc mwd and tp data were fitted to the model using the maximum likelihood estimation method the model adequacy was determined by using a pearson s chi square test comparative fit

square test p 0 05 high cfi 0 9 and gfi 0 9 indicate an adequate model fit all graphs were drawn using the cor r 3 5 1 3 results 3 1 effects of swc and other soil properties on infiltration rate the results of regression analysis showed that the effects of swc on soil infiltration rate were different at various infiltration stages fig 1 swc 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm had a significant effect on iir airs i and airs ii p 0 01 however swc of different soil depth had no significant effect on airs iii and sir p 0 05 the correlation analysis between the tp mwd soc and infiltration rate were shown in fig 2 there was a significant positive correlation between tp and infiltration rate at different infiltration stages p 0 01 the correlation analysis revealed that mwd was strongly correlated with airs ii airs iii and sir p 0 05 whereas mwd was not significantly correlated with iir and airs i p 0 05 except for iir each infiltration stage airs i airs ii airs iii and sir was significantly correlated with soc p 0 01 3 2 effects of roots on infiltration rate we used regression analysis to investigate the relationship between total root weigh and soil infiltration rate at various infiltration stages fig 3 there was a significant negative correlation between total root weigh and soil infiltration rate airs i airs ii airs iii and sir p 0 01 except for iir the results of covariance analysis showed that grassland types had a significant effect on soil infiltration rate at different infiltration stages table 1 there were significant differences in the pv of various root diameter sizes among different grasslands p 0 05 fig 4 both b inermis and t repens showed the highest pv of 0 2 mm root diameter in the soil depth of 0 30 cm average 81 92 and 61 01 respectively whereas m sitiva and m sinensis showed the highest pv of 4 5 mm root diameter in the soil depth of 0 30 cm average 76 51 and 71 08 respectively the pv of various root diameter sizes of p virgatum was relatively well distributed based on this we conducted a correlation analysis to explain the pv of various root diameter sizes effects of on soil infiltration rate at various infiltration stages fig 5 in the initial infiltration stage the pv of various root diameter sizes was weakly correlated with infiltration rate p 0 05 the pv of 0 1 mm and 1 2 mm root diameter was positively correlated with infiltration rate airs ii airs iii and sir and the correlation coefficient increased with infiltration time p 0 01 in addition the pv of 2 3 mm and 3 4 5 mm root diameter was weakly correlated with infiltration rate airs i airs ii airs iii and sir while the pv of 4 5 mm root diameter showed a significant negative correlation with infiltration rate airs ii airs iii and sir and the correlation coefficient increased with infiltration time p 0 01 3 3 relationships between roots swc other soil properties and soil infiltration rate the parameters with higher weight in the first principal component pc1 were pv 1 pv 2 and pv 5 the highly loaded parameters in the second principal component pc2 were pv 3 and pv 4 fig 6 b inermis and t repens had a lower score in pc1 indicating the higher pv 0 2 mm and lower pv 4 5 mm p virgatum had the lowest score in pc2 indicating the higher pv 2 4 5 mm we used a structural equation model to explain the direct and indirect effects of pc1 and pc2 on soil infiltration rate through soc mwd and tp the model taking into account all parameters showed good fit criteria χ2 1 53 p 0 47 χ2 df 1 0 77 gfi 0 96 cfi 0 97 and 85 of variance in mwd was explained fig 7 a pc1 had a direct negative effect on soc and mwd while pc1 had a weak positive effect on tp pc1had an indirect effect on tp and mwd because of its direct negative effect on soc whereas pc2 had a direct negative effect on mwd and pc2 showed a weak effect on soc and tp referring to path coefficient pc1 had the strongest direct or indirect effect on soc tp and mwd far greater than pc2 the relationship of swc mwd tp and soil infiltration rate were shown in fig 7 the final model explained 83 of variance in soil infiltration rate with good fit criteria χ2 0 84 p 0 36 χ2 df 1 0 338 gfi 0 97 cfi 0 98 in the initial infiltration stage swc showed a significantly negative correlation with infiltration rate while the tp was weakly correlated with iir as the infiltration time increased the impacts of swc on infiltration rate gradually decreased whereas the tp and mwd significantly affected infiltration rate referring to path coefficient of 0 81 swc had the strongest direct effect on iir much more than other parameters the results revealed that the direct effect of tp upon airs i and airs ii r 0 74 r 0 76 was nearly three times that of mwd and swc fig 6c and d mwd and tp showed the similar importance on affecting sir pc1 and pc2 had an indirect effect on soil infiltration rate at different infiltration stages through its direct or indirect effect on soc tp and mwd therefore soil infiltration rate was influenced by pc1 pc2 and swc as the increase of infiltration time the impacts of swc on infiltration rate gradually weakened while the impacts of pc1 and pc2 on infiltration rate gradually increased swc was the main factor affecting the steady infiltration rate referring to path coefficient pc1 was the main factor affecting the steady infiltration rate far exceeding than those of swc and pc2 on steady infiltration rate 4 discussion it is well known that soil infiltration capacity is generally controlled by both vegetation characteristics and soil physical properties leung et al 2015 many studies have reported that below ground biomass soil water content soil organic matters total soil porosity and soil aggregate are the main factors to determine the soil infiltration capacity huang et al 2017 wu et al 2016 in the present study we conducted a regression and correlation analysis to determine the relationship between roots soc mwd tp and soil infiltration rate at various infiltration stages the results showed that there was a significantly positive correlation between other soil properties soc mwd and tp and soil infiltration rate airs ii airs iii and sir this was consistent with wu et al 2016 who found that the higher soil porosity increased the soil infiltration capacity in semiarid region huang et al 2017 also found that tp soc and soil aggregate were the vital factor for stable change stage of infiltration rates and the increased soil porosity soc and soil aggregate would improve infiltration capacity neris et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 fischer et al 2014 roots system plays a most important role in soil infiltration process and higher infiltration rate is related to higher bgb huang et al 2017 however this was not consistent with our results that total root weight had a significantly negative effect on soil infiltration rate fig 3 therefore a covariance analysis was conducted to explain this problem follows the results showed that both grassland types had a significant effect on soil infiltration rate at various infiltration stages p 0 05 table 1 based on this we conducted a correlation analysis to compare the differences in root distribution characteristics of different grassland types fig 4 these could be attributed that t repens and b inermis had higher volume ratio of 0 2 mm root diameter average 81 92 and 61 01 respectively while m sitiva and m sinensis had more coarse roots fig 2 root characteristics i e root diameter and root distribution could explain the differences of infiltration capacity among different species huang et al 2017 leung et al 2017 wu et al 2017a the results showed that there was a significantly positive correlation between the pv of 0 2 mm root diameter and soil infiltration rate airs ii airs iii and sir in addition the pv of 2 4 5 mm root diameter was weakly correlated with infiltration rate while the pv of 4 5 mm root diameter showed a significantly negative correlation with infiltration rate airs ii airs iii and sir the decomposition of roots could increase soil infiltration capacity fischer et al 2014 luna et al 2017 root diameter is a key factor determining root decomposition because it integrates both chemical and physical properties associated with root development coarse roots differ markedly from fine roots in decomposition rate zhang and wang 2015 found that fine roots decomposed significantly faster than coarse roots in middle latitude areas which could prove that our results were reasonable fine roots track changes in aboveground phenology and temperature moisture and nutrient in soils cheng and bledsoe 2002 with consequent seasonal changes in biomass and distribution and high annual turnover rates wells and eissenstat 2001 eissenstat et al 2000 coarse roots decayed depending on climate especially annual temperature and annual rainfall than did fine root zhang and wang 2015 many studies have reported that plant rooting features are closely related to the changes in soil structure and in turn influence soil infiltration capacity during vegetation restoration neris et al 2012 huang et al 2017 wu et al 2016 roots enmesh and realign soil particles and release exudates which result in the modifications of soil properties and enhancing aggregation bronick and lal 2005 fischer et al 2014 indicated that decaying roots increased soil organic matters and formed soil pores and thus influenced infiltration capacity due to change in burrowing activity and biomass of earthworms in the present study soil water content had the strongest direct effect on iir fig 7b this was consistent with alaoui 2015 who found that the lower initial soil water content increased the potential for soil infiltration rate in semiarid regions the topsoil was dry which would accelerate infiltration rate at the initial stage as the increase of infiltration time soil water content gradually increased thus the infiltration rate was greatly affected by other factors the results showed that airs iii and sir were directly affected by both tp and mwd fig 7e and f and the direct positive effect of tp upon airs iii r 0 72 was more than twice that of mwd r 0 33 soil pores are the channels of preferential flow promoting vertical water movement towards deeper horizons luna et al 2017 van schaik 2009 reported that root channels improved the soil porosity resulting in higher infiltration capacity than expected the results showed that the pc1 had an indirect effect on soil infiltration rate airs ii airs iii and sir because of its direct or indirect effect on soc tp and mwd which was much more than pc2 fig 7 decomposition of mature roots increased soil organic matters and formed soil pores which promoted vertical water movement towards deeper horizons and thus influenced infiltration capacity fischer et al 2014 luna et al 2017 many studies have reported that root decomposition represents a large carbon cost to plants and serves as a potential soil organic matter source john et al 2002 zhang and wang 2015 redelstein et al 2018 fine roots have the high decomposition rate increasing soil porosity and soil organic matters thus enhanced soil infiltration capacity in semiarid areas where dry and rainless non perishable coarse roots can compact soil and block water flow thereby decreasing soil infiltration rate this negative effect masked the positive effect of fine root to a certain extent leading to the result that total root weigh was negative correlated with soil infiltration rate differing from previous studies fig 3 in conclusion our results show that soil infiltration rate was affected by both soil water content and pv swc was the main factor affecting the initial infiltration rate far exceeding those of pv on initial infiltration rate as the increase of infiltration time the impacts of swc on infiltration rate gradually weakened while the impacts of pv on infiltration rate gradually increased pv of 0 2 mm and 4 5 mm was the main factor affecting the steady infiltration rate far exceeding than those of swc and pv of 2 4 5 mm on steady infiltration rate although our results determined the effects of pv and soil water content on soil infiltration during the whole process there are still some limitations the results of the relationship between pv and infiltration capacity which are based on short term experiment in semiarid regions should be treated with great caution the factors that best correlate with rates of early root decomposition are often not the same as those related to long term root decomposition consequently further research is needed to clarify the relationship between root diameter and infiltration response during long term vegetation restoration in semiarid regions 5 conclusion in conclusion our results show that soil infiltration rate is affected by both swc and pv during infiltration process fine roots 0 2 mm of root diameter were positively correlated with infiltration rate while coarse roots 4 5 mm of root diameter were negatively correlated with infiltration rate soil water content is negatively related to soil infiltration rate but the impacts of soil water content on soil infiltration gradually weaken as the increase of infiltration time pv is the main factor influencing infiltration rate with the increasing infiltration time the results contribute to clarify the relative importance of pv and soil water content during infiltration process and provide new insights into soil infiltration for

6111,soil water is the key limiting factor for achieving sustainable revegetation soil infiltration rate plays an important role in determining the inputs from precipitation which is important for the plant growth and groundwater recharge in semi arid regions soil infiltration rate is generally influenced by belowground biomass bgb soil water content swc and other soil properties total soil

percentage of root volume pv of 0 2 mm was positively correlated with infiltration rate while the pv of 4 5 mm was negatively correlated with infiltration rate our results indicated that fine roots

regions keywords plant root diameter soil infiltration soil water content infiltration process semiarid grassland 1 introduction precipitation infiltration is the main source of soil water replenishment in the semi arid regions which influences the vegetation restoration potential soil erosion and groundwater recharge zhao et al 2013 leung et al 2015 sun et al 2018 infiltration is the process of rainfall transform into soil water by downward or gravitational flow huang et al 2017 soil infiltration capacity could be determined for example the initial infiltration rate steady infiltration rate and mean infiltration rate sun et al 2018 as an important hydrological parameter wu et al 2016 the quantification of infiltration capacity is a crucial issue for vegetation maintenance and land management previous studies have found that soil infiltration capacity was generally affected by various soil properties and vegetation characteristics such as porosity organic matters bulk density and roots bormann and klaassen 2008 leung et al 2015 franzluebbers 2002 indicated that soil organic matters and soil aggregation improved water infiltration nearly threefold alaoui 2015 investigated the hydrological parameters of four representative grassland soils on the swiss plateau and found that the interaction between bulk density and macroporsity could facilitate water infiltration conversely some studies have reported that soil bulk density is weakly related to macropore flow meek et al 1989 fischer et al 2014 moreover soil water content swc is also key factor determining soil infiltration capacity in semi arid regions archer et al 2002 zehe and blöschl 2004 cerdà 1996 reported that soil infiltration rate was higher in summer than wet seasons because of the higher soil moisture contents soil water content is susceptible to the changes of external environments such as rainfall temperature and vegetation type in semi arid regions the lower initial soil water content increases the potential for infiltration alaoui 2015 grassland is the most typical vegetation restoration species in semi arid areas because of its drought resistance and good adaptability to severe climate and poor soil conditions cui et al 2018 grassland had abundant root systems which could cause remarkable changes in soil physicochemical properties and thus had a vital effect on soil infiltration capacity fu et al 2000 mwendera and saleem 2010 wu et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 evaluated the soil infiltrability of five grasslands of successive age classes they found that long term grassland restoration accumulated organic matter and improved soil structural properties thus significantly enhancing soil infiltration capacity and reducing soil erosion the different types of artificial grassland may cause different changes in soil properties and then affect soil infiltration in varying degrees angers and caron 1998 bormann and klaassen 2008 huang et al 2017 found that legume grasslands had higher infiltration capacity than gramineous grasslands in the arid region which could be attributed to the below ground biomass wu et al 2016 legume grasslands had higher below ground biomass improving total soil porosity and soil organic matters thus enhancing soil infiltration capacity archer et al 2002 reported that the abundant root network of grassland could clog the soil pore space and decrease soil infiltration rate in general soil infiltration rate was affected by vegetation type soil porosity organic matters soil water content and root system previous studies have mainly focused on the effects of soil water content and root biomass on the whole infiltration process however the effects of different root diameters on infiltration rate and the relative importance of root diameter and soil water content during different infiltration stages are poorly understood in this study we measured soil infiltration rate by the point source device at five typical grasslands i e bromus inermis trifolium repens panicum virgatum medicago sativa and miscanthus sinensis the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the effects of roots diameters and other soil properties tp soc and mwd on soil infiltration rate and 2 identify the main factor affecting soil infiltration rate at different infiltration stages this study could provide the opportunity to clarify the relative importance of root diameter and soil water content during infiltration process and further provide new insights into soil infiltration for vegetation restoration 2 materials

unsaturated soil layer is deep and groundwater is located at a depth of 50 80 m below the soil surface since the 1970s natural vegetation in this area has been gradually substituted by artificial forestlands and grasslands 2 2 experimental design five typical artificial grasslands were established on the farmland trifolium repens t repens bromus inermis b inermis panicum virgatum p virgatum

constructed on each grassland type various grasses used the same planting time and were irrigated to ensure grass survival during the beginning of the growing period the amount of flood irrigation in each plot was 3375 kg later on grass growth entirely depended on rainfall without fertilization or human intervention this ensured that the conditions in all of the plots were similar but also that any differences were solely due to the grassland type therefore it could be assumed that any differences in soil physical properties and soil water content could be attributed to the type of

anova was employed to analyze the differences of mean values among treatments significant differences were determined at the 0 05 level unary linear regression and correlation analysis were used to analyze the relationship between roots swc soc mwd tp and soil infiltration rate in order to reduce numerous correlated variables down to a smaller number of principal components principal components analysis pca was used to further investigate the variation in pv kaiser meyer olkin measure kmo 0 50 and bartlett s test of sphericity p 0 05 were conducted to test the sampling adequacy of individual

the covariance matrix of variables and it is an important tool for multivariate data analysis we used structural equation model to explain the direct and indirect effect of pc1 and pc2 on soil infiltration through soc mwd and tp data were fitted to the model using the maximum likelihood estimation method the model adequacy was determined by using a pearson s chi square test comparative fit

results of regression analysis showed that the effects of swc on soil infiltration rate were different at various infiltration stages fig 1 swc 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm had a significant effect on iir airs i and airs ii p 0 01 however swc of different soil depth had no significant effect on airs iii and sir p 0 05 the correlation analysis between the tp mwd soc and infiltration rate were shown in fig 2 there was a significant positive correlation between tp and infiltration rate at different infiltration stages p 0 01 the correlation analysis revealed that mwd was strongly correlated with airs ii airs iii and sir p 0 05 whereas mwd was not significantly correlated with iir and airs i p 0 05 except for iir each infiltration stage airs i airs ii airs iii and sir was significantly correlated with soc p 0 01 3 2 effects of roots on infiltration rate we used regression analysis to investigate the relationship between total root weigh and soil infiltration rate at various infiltration stages fig 3 there was a significant negative correlation between total root weigh and soil infiltration rate airs i airs ii airs iii and sir p 0 01 except for iir the results of covariance analysis showed that grassland types had a significant effect on soil infiltration rate at different infiltration stages table 1 there were significant differences in the pv of various root diameter sizes among different grasslands p 0 05 fig 4 both b inermis and t repens showed the highest pv of 0 2 mm root diameter in the soil depth of 0 30 cm average 81 92 and 61 01 respectively whereas m sitiva and m sinensis showed the highest pv of 4 5 mm root diameter in the soil depth of 0 30 cm average 76 51 and 71 08 respectively the pv of various root diameter sizes of p virgatum was relatively well distributed based on this we conducted a correlation analysis to explain the pv of various root diameter sizes effects of on soil infiltration rate at various infiltration stages fig 5 in the initial infiltration stage the pv of various root diameter sizes was weakly correlated with infiltration rate p 0 05 the pv of 0 1 mm and 1 2 mm root diameter was positively correlated with infiltration rate airs ii airs iii and sir and the correlation coefficient increased with infiltration time p 0 01 in addition the pv of 2 3 mm and 3 4 5 mm root diameter was weakly correlated with infiltration rate airs i airs ii airs iii and sir while the pv of 4 5 mm root diameter showed a significant negative correlation with infiltration rate airs ii airs iii and sir and the correlation coefficient increased with infiltration time p 0 01 3 3 relationships between roots swc other soil properties and soil infiltration rate the parameters with higher weight in the first principal component pc1 were pv 1 pv 2 and pv 5 the highly loaded parameters in the second principal component pc2 were pv 3 and pv 4 fig 6 b inermis and t repens had a lower score in pc1 indicating the higher pv 0 2 mm and lower pv 4 5 mm p virgatum had the lowest score in pc2 indicating the higher pv 2 4 5 mm we used a structural equation model to explain the direct and indirect effects of pc1 and pc2 on soil infiltration rate through soc mwd and tp the model taking into account all parameters showed good fit criteria χ2 1 53 p 0 47 χ2 df 1 0 77 gfi 0 96 cfi 0 97 and 85 of variance in mwd was explained fig 7 a pc1 had a direct negative effect on soc and mwd while pc1 had a weak positive effect on tp pc1had an indirect effect on tp and mwd because of its direct negative effect on soc whereas pc2 had a direct negative effect on mwd and pc2 showed a weak effect on soc and tp referring to path coefficient pc1 had the strongest direct or indirect effect on soc tp and mwd far greater than pc2 the relationship of swc mwd tp and soil infiltration rate were shown in fig 7 the final model explained 83 of variance in soil infiltration rate with good fit criteria χ2 0 84 p 0 36 χ2 df 1 0 338 gfi 0 97 cfi 0 98 in the initial infiltration stage swc showed a significantly negative correlation with infiltration rate while the tp was weakly correlated with iir as the infiltration time increased the impacts of swc on infiltration rate gradually decreased whereas the tp and mwd significantly affected infiltration rate referring to path coefficient of 0 81 swc had the strongest direct effect on iir much more than other parameters the results revealed that the direct effect of tp upon airs i and airs ii r 0 74 r 0 76 was nearly three times that of mwd and swc fig 6c and d mwd and tp showed the similar importance on affecting sir pc1 and pc2 had an indirect effect on soil infiltration rate at different infiltration stages through its direct or indirect effect on soc tp and mwd therefore soil infiltration rate was influenced by pc1 pc2 and swc as the increase of infiltration time the impacts of swc on infiltration rate gradually weakened while the impacts of pc1 and pc2 on infiltration rate gradually increased swc was the main factor affecting the steady infiltration rate referring to path coefficient pc1 was the main factor affecting the steady infiltration rate far exceeding than those of swc and pc2 on steady infiltration rate 4 discussion it is well known that soil infiltration capacity is generally controlled by both vegetation characteristics and soil physical properties leung et al 2015 many studies have reported that below ground biomass soil water content soil organic matters total soil porosity and soil aggregate are the main factors to determine the soil infiltration capacity huang et al 2017 wu et al 2016 in the present study we conducted a regression and correlation analysis to determine the relationship between roots soc mwd tp and soil infiltration rate at various infiltration stages the results showed that there was a significantly positive correlation between other soil properties soc mwd and tp and soil infiltration rate airs ii airs iii and sir this was consistent with wu et al 2016 who found that the higher soil porosity increased the soil infiltration capacity in semiarid region huang et al 2017 also found that tp soc and soil aggregate were the vital factor for stable change stage of infiltration rates and the increased soil porosity soc and soil aggregate would improve infiltration capacity neris et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 fischer et al 2014 roots system plays a most important role in soil infiltration process and higher infiltration rate is related to higher bgb huang et al 2017 however this was not consistent with our results that total root weight had a significantly negative effect on soil infiltration rate fig 3 therefore a covariance analysis was conducted to explain this problem follows the results showed that both grassland types had a significant effect on soil infiltration rate at various infiltration stages p 0 05 table 1 based on this we conducted a correlation analysis to compare the differences in root distribution characteristics of different grassland types fig 4 these could be attributed that t repens and b inermis had higher volume ratio of 0 2 mm root diameter average 81 92 and 61 01 respectively while m sitiva and m sinensis had more coarse roots fig 2 root characteristics i e root diameter and root distribution could explain the differences of infiltration capacity among different species huang et al 2017 leung et al 2017 wu et al 2017a the results showed that there was a significantly positive correlation between the pv of 0 2 mm root diameter and soil infiltration rate airs ii airs iii and sir in addition the pv of 2 4 5 mm root diameter was weakly correlated with infiltration rate while the pv of 4 5 mm root diameter showed a significantly negative correlation with infiltration rate airs ii airs iii and sir the decomposition of roots could increase soil infiltration capacity fischer et al 2014 luna et al 2017 root diameter is a key factor determining root decomposition because it integrates both chemical and physical properties associated with root development coarse roots differ markedly from fine roots in decomposition rate zhang and wang 2015 found that fine roots decomposed significantly faster than coarse roots in middle latitude areas which could prove that our results were reasonable fine roots track changes in aboveground phenology and temperature moisture and nutrient in soils cheng and bledsoe 2002 with consequent seasonal changes in biomass and distribution and high annual turnover rates wells and eissenstat 2001 eissenstat et al 2000 coarse roots decayed depending on climate especially annual temperature and annual rainfall than did fine root zhang and wang 2015 many studies have reported that plant rooting features are closely related to the changes in soil structure and in turn influence soil infiltration capacity during vegetation restoration neris et al 2012 huang et al 2017 wu et al 2016 roots enmesh and realign soil particles and release exudates which result in the modifications of soil properties and enhancing aggregation bronick and lal 2005 fischer et al 2014 indicated that decaying roots increased soil organic matters and formed soil pores and thus influenced infiltration capacity due to change in burrowing activity and biomass of earthworms in the present study soil water content had the strongest direct effect on iir fig 7b this was consistent with alaoui 2015 who found that the lower initial soil water content increased the potential for soil infiltration rate in semiarid regions the topsoil was dry which would accelerate infiltration rate at the initial stage as the increase of infiltration time soil water content gradually increased thus the infiltration rate was greatly affected by other factors the results showed that airs iii and sir were directly affected by both tp and mwd fig 7e and f and the direct positive effect of tp upon airs iii r 0 72 was more than twice that of mwd r 0 33 soil pores are the channels of preferential flow promoting vertical water movement towards deeper horizons luna et al 2017 van schaik 2009 reported that root channels improved the soil porosity resulting in higher infiltration capacity than expected the results showed that the pc1 had an indirect effect on soil infiltration rate airs ii airs iii and sir because of its direct or indirect effect on soc tp and mwd which was much more than pc2 fig 7 decomposition of mature roots increased soil organic matters and formed soil pores which promoted vertical water movement towards deeper horizons and thus influenced infiltration capacity fischer et al 2014 luna et al 2017 many studies have reported that root decomposition represents a large carbon cost to plants and serves as a potential soil organic matter source john et al 2002 zhang and wang 2015 redelstein et al 2018 fine roots have the high decomposition rate increasing soil porosity and soil organic matters thus enhanced soil infiltration capacity in semiarid areas where dry and rainless non perishable coarse roots can compact soil and block water flow thereby decreasing soil infiltration rate this negative effect masked the positive effect of fine root to a certain extent leading to the result that total root weigh was negative correlated with soil infiltration rate differing from previous studies fig 3 in conclusion our results show that soil infiltration rate was affected by both soil water content and pv swc was the main factor affecting the initial infiltration rate far exceeding those of pv on initial infiltration rate as the increase of infiltration time the impacts of swc on infiltration rate gradually weakened while the impacts of pv on infiltration rate gradually increased pv of 0 2 mm and 4 5 mm was the main factor affecting the steady infiltration rate far exceeding than those of swc and pv of 2 4 5 mm on steady infiltration rate although our results determined the effects of pv and soil water content on soil infiltration during the whole process there are still some limitations the results of the relationship between pv and infiltration capacity which are based on short term experiment in semiarid regions should be treated with great caution the factors that best correlate with rates of early root decomposition are often not the same as those related to long term root decomposition consequently further research is needed to clarify the relationship between root diameter and infiltration response during long term vegetation restoration in semiarid regions 5 conclusion in conclusion our results show that soil infiltration rate is affected by both swc and pv during infiltration process fine roots 0 2 mm of root diameter were positively correlated with infiltration rate while coarse roots 4 5 mm of root diameter were negatively correlated with infiltration rate soil water content is negatively related to soil infiltration rate but the impacts of soil water content on soil infiltration gradually weaken as the increase of infiltration time pv is the main factor influencing infiltration rate with the increasing infiltration time the results contribute to clarify the relative importance of pv and soil water content during infiltration process and provide new insights into soil infiltration for

6112,environmental engineering geological patterns eegps are the generalized manifestation of environmental engineering geology with the protection of phreatic water resources as the core especially in mining areas with fragile eco geological environment based on the formation mechanism of mining induced eegps with the aim of win win between protection of phreatic water resources and exploitation of coal resources this study presents a zoning method for eegps taking the yushenfu mining area in northern shaanxi china as a case study four types of eegps basically unaffected model gradually restored model after destruction gradually deteriorated model and disaster model were defined separately on the basis of the degree of influence of mining activities on phreatic aquifer the zoning method for eegps was proposed firstly the height of water flowing fractured zone wffz and the residual aquifuge thickness were calculated using multivariate linear regression method secondly according to the relationship among phreatic water leakage groundwater recharge and variation in groundwater level the thickness of laterite loess and bedrock as the thresholds between the eegps were separately determined thirdly based on the thresholds between eegps and the linear variation of residual aquifuge thickness combination the zoning criteria for eegps were formulated finally the zoning results were obtained furthermore the verification of the types of eegps in coalfaces and the comparison between the zoning results obtained using variable weight theory and those given in the present study indicated that the zoning results presented in the current study are more accurate and reasonable the research results can provide theoretical basis for solving the contradiction between coal resource exploitation and eco geological environmental protection keywords underground coal mining protection of phreatic water resources environmental engineering geological patterns residual aquifuge thickness zoning criteria 1 introduction coal is the primary energy source in china contributes to around 70 of the county s energy production and consumption and plays an important role in china s economic development zhu 1987 wang et al 2018 with the depletion of coal resources in eastern china and the increasing imbalance between resources and environmental sustainability in central and northeastern china the overall layout of china s coal development is to compress the eastern mining areas limit the central and northeastern mining areas and optimize the western mining areas in this regard shanbei huanglong shendong ningdong and xinjiang are the five major coal bases in western china in 2020 coal production in western china was estimated to be 2 31 billion tons which accounted for around 59 2 of the country s total output national development and reform commission and national energy administration 2016 the average annual precipitation in arid and semi arid areas of western china is below 400 mm and the water resources account for only 1 6 of the whole country feng et al 2000 ji et al 2006 the lack of water resources has resulted in extremely fragile eco geological environment in northwest china in recent years large scale high intensity and extensive mining of coal resources in northwest china has destroyed the originally fragile eco geological environment and brought serious impacts on the production and life of the local people engineering geology can be defined as the combination of geological conditions and engineering activities the environmental engineering geology can be defined as a synthesis of environmental issues and engineering geological conditions furthermore environmental engineering geology patterns eegps are defined as a generalization of the manifestation of environmental engineering geology which reflects the relationship among geological conditions engineering activities and environmental changes therefore it is very urgent to regionalize the environmental engineering geological patterns eegps of mining areas which is conducive to planning mining activities guiding the sustainable use of coal resources and protecting the eco geological environment numerous studies have been carried out about the effects of mining activities on the eco geological environment and public health which include water shortages and pollution zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 saatsaz et al 2013 bondaruk et al 2015 wang et al 2016 gaaloul et al 2017 ma et al 2019 decrease of groundwater tables qiao et al 2017 death

typical cases of negative environmental effects caused by mining hu 1998 proposed various environmental geological types analyzed the characteristics of each type and put forward evaluation methods and techniques to analyze the negative environmental impacts in order to reduce the impact of mining activities on the eco geological environment green mining technology qian 2003 2010 coal development path based on sustainable development peng et al 2014 coal production threshold based on water carrying capacity xie 2016 reconstruction of aquifuges li et al 2017 zhang 2006 and basic principles of geological environment edward 1988 were proposed which supported the scientific development of coal in theory and technology and promoted the protection and management of eco geological environment in mining areas from the perspective of types of mines stages of developing a mine and the different problems faced for certain mines wu 2003 put forward three kinds of classification schemes for geological environmental problems in mines in china li et al 2000 analyzed the main problems of environmental engineering geology for the development of coal resources and made a prediction and evaluation of changes in the geological environmental quality after mining which has strong significance for the rational development of coal resources the current state achievements substantial tasks and evolution of ecological geology were described whereas the principles and methods used to assess the eco geological system formulated the fundamentals of ecological geology trofimov 2013 a new geo environmental zoning approach for producing automatic integrated self organized optimum zoning maps using comprehensive geological and geophysical data was proposed which included techniques for finding the optimal structure that best fits the natural pattern of a given area without the benefit of any a priori class information zamani et al 2015 similarly based on the hydrographic basin compartmentalization and codification technique known as the ottobasin method a geo environmental zoning method was also put forward fontes and pejon 2008 additionally large spatiotemporal data were applied to the evaluation of synthetic geo ecological environment of a coastal coal mining city he et al 2017 in view of the contradiction between the abundant coal resources and the scarcity of water resources in the eco geologically fragile mining areas the leakage of phreatic water the decline of groundwater level and the destruction of vegetation ecosystem caused by mining activities were pointed out and the response of vegetation to changes in groundwater level was investigated ma et al 2017 wang et al 2008 yang et al 2006 moreover mathematical methods including support vector machine du 2012 neural network method arkoc et al 2016 latifovic et al 2018 variable weight theory liu et al 2018a liu and li 2019 bayes or fisher discriminant analysis he et al 2012 hu and li 2012 multi scale evaluation method chen et al 2010 cluster analysis novak and renema 2018 wei et al 2018 and topsis method khan et al 2018 li et al 2013a b have been used for the evaluation and zoning of environmental engineering geology in the abovementioned literatures on one hand the research content focuses on the evaluation of environmental engineering geology whereas the evaluation results are often expressed as large medium and small although four types of eegps have been proposed these types have not been defined adequately in literature liu et al 2018a on the other hand mathematical methods are often used in environmental engineering geological evaluation though they cannot reflect the evolution mechanism of engineering activities on eegps therefore this paper studied the zoning method for eegps resulting from mining activities based on the formation mechanism of eegps caused by underground coal mining from the perspective of field investigations and the mechanism of eegps caused by mining four types of eegps were put forward and defined on this basis the zoning method for eegps was proposed firstly residual aquifuge thickness was calculated subsequently according to the relationship among phreatic water leakage groundwater recharge and variation in water level thresholds among the eegps were determined then the zoning criteria for eegps were identified finally the zoning results were obtained and verified 2 study site the yushenfu mining area whose geographical coordinates are 109 08 24 e 110 27 59 e and 38 19 33 n 39 11 23 n is located in the northern part of yulin city shaanxi province china its total area is about 6334 km2 as shown in fig 1 the maximum length in the east west direction is approximately 97 km while the maximum width along the north south direction is approximately 95 km the elevation of the study site is 967 1435 m li et al 2018 additionally the study area is located on the border of maowusu desert and the loess plateau of northern shaanxi province which has a continental monsoon climate in arid and semi arid regions furthermore the overall topography of the region is high in the northwest and low in the southeast directions according to the morphological origins of each topography unit the study area includes three types of topographies namely the blown sand and bottomland region the hilly loess region and the river valley region pei 2017 from east to west the surface water system of the study area consists of kuye river tuwei river and yuxi river in view of the coal resources the yushenfu mining area which is the core construction site of shanbei coal base includes the yushen and shenfu mining areas the yushen mining area consists of four planning areas namely the 1 2 3 and 4 planning areas both the 1 and 2 planning areas and shenfu mining area are being exploited on a large scale while the 3 and 4 planning areas are at the exploration stage based on the current data obtained from drill holes and previously acquired geological data the strata of this region include the yan an formation zhiluo formation and anding formation from the jurassic system as well as the deposits from the neogene and quaternary system the stratigraphic lithologic and hydrogeological characteristics of the area are described in detail in fig 2 there are five layers of first mined coal seam which are distributed in different areas of yushenfu mining area and are named as 1 2 2 2 3 1 4 2 and 5 2 coal seams as shown in fig 3 the unconsolidated phreatic aquifer formed by the salawusu formation and quaternary aeolian sand is the only natural subsurface water resource having ecological significance and the capability to supply water to widely distributed localities within the area of study therefore it is the target aquifer for water preserved coal mining the depth of its groundwater level is mostly 10 m or less while the aquifer has the unit water inflow of 0 008 4 321 l s m last but not the least the water richness of the aquifer ranges from weak to strong the lishi formation loess and baode formation laterite form the vital impermeable layers for water resource preservation in the study area a large section of lithologically dense mudstones sandy mudstones argillaceous mudstones and rock sections consisting of intercalations of these rocks may be found between the middle upper sections of the anding and zhiluo formations and the coal seams of yan an formation this layer is an impermeable layer within the bedrock as it has extremely low permeability coefficients the damage caused by coal mining to these impermeable layers determines the level of impact that coal mining has on the target aquifer and ultimately has a varying degree of adverse effects on the eco geology environment 3 types of mining induced eegps prior to the coal seam mining the groundwater rock and soil mass are in the balanced state of natural stress after the coal seam mining the overlying rock and soil mass move and deform which are damaged to varying degrees and result in the formation of water flowing fractured zone wffz liu et al 2018b c the distance between the top interface of wffz and the bottom interface of the phreatic aquifer is called the residual aquifuge layer which plays an important role in realizing the water preserved coal mining and protection of phreatic water resources the thickness lithology and its combination of residual aquifuge determine the degree of impact of coal mining on phreatic water resources in general smaller the thickness of residual aquifuge greater is the impact of coal mining on phreatic water resources mining induced eegps represent the relationship between mining activities and eco geological environment and help study the ways to avoid and reform the influence of unfavorable geological factors on engineering which in turn help in predicting and evaluating the trend and intensity of eco geological environment caused by mining activities such information can provide theoretical basis for the rationality of environmental protection environmental governance and development plan of coal resources therefore according to the degree of influence of coal seam mining on phreatic aquifer and field investigations four types of eegps were put forward they were the basically unaffected model the gradually restored model after destruction the gradually deteriorated model and the disaster model fig 4 shows the typical section sketch maps of the four types of eegps 3 1 basically unaffected model after the coal seam mining the top interface of wffz develops into the bedrock or the water resisting clay layer and the thickness of the residual bedrock or the water resisting clay layer becomes relatively large under such circumstances the phreatic water level is only affected by the floor subsidence of water resisting layer and the coal seam mining has little effect on phreatic aquifer therefore the surface ecological environment basically remains unaffected 3 2 gradually restored model after destruction after the coal seam mining the top interface of wffz develops into the bedrock or the water resisting clay layer and the thickness of the residual bedrock or the water resisting clay layer becomes relatively small however the residual water resisting layer still has certain effective water resistance the phreatic water may seep slightly although the water level after the seepage will not be lower than the average water level of the hydrogeological unit furthermore the water level can be restored within a hydrological year therefore the surface ecological environment is slightly affected 3 3 gradually deteriorated model after the coal seam mining the top interface of wffz develops into the bedrock or the water resisting clay layer and the thickness of the residual bedrock or water resisting clay layer becomes very small a large amount of phreatic water leakage will occur which cannot be completely compensated in a hydrological year additionally the phreatic water level continues to decline slowly therefore the surface ecological environment slowly and continuously deteriorates 3 4 disaster model after the coal seam mining the wffz penetrates the bedrock or the water resisting clay layer into the phreatic aquifer and there is no residual water resisting layer the phreatic water completely leaks out while the groundwater level drops rapidly furthermore the surface ecological environment deteriorates obviously in a short period of time 4 methodology the zoning method for eegps can be divided into three steps of calculating the thickness of residual aquifuge determining the thresholds between eegps and determining the zoning criteria for eegps 4 1 calculating the thickness of residual aquifuge the height of wffz is the basis for calculating the thickness of residual aquifuge if the wffz develops to the surface the eegp is obviously the disaster model however if the wffz develops into the bedrock or clay layer it is necessary to calculate the thickness of residual aquifuge 4 1 1 calculating the wffz height in yushenfu mining area 32 field measurements of wffz were collected furthermore the multivariate nonlinear regression equation for wffz was fitted as given by eq 1 liu et al 2018d 1 y 77 109 m c o a l 0 414 0 075 h 44 759 where mcoal is the mining thickness m and h is the burial depth of coal seam m in yushenfu mining area the 203 drilling data were first sorted out whereas the location is shown in fig 1 subsequently the thematic maps of the first mined coal seam thickness coal seam buried depth and the cumulative thickness of the aeolian sand and sara wusu formation aquifer were obtained using arcgis software mou 2012 as shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 5b the burial depth of the first mined coal seam increases gradually from east to west in the study site then the thematic map of the wffz was obtained based upon eq 1 as shown in fig 6 on this basis the thematic map of the residual aquifuge thickness was obtained based on the arcgis spatial analysis function in order to achieve this the wffz height value was subtracted from the coal seam buried depth value and then the cumulative thickness value of the aeolian sand and sara wusu formation aquifer was subtracted from the resultant as shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the residual aquifuge thickness is negative which means that the height of wffz develops to the surface or the phreatic aquifer under this condition eegp in the area is represented by the disaster model if the thickness of the residual aquifuge is positive the height of wffz develops into the bedrock laterite or loess layer and further calculations for the residual thickness of loess laterite or bedrock will be needed 4 1 2 calculating the residual loess laterite and bedrock thickness the area of the study site is 6334 km2 whereas the number of boreholes is 203 this means that the area of each borehole is around 31 2 km2 obviously the density of boreholes in the study area is too small in order to improve the accuracy of calculations the study area was divided into basic unit using the square regular mesh generation method in arcgis software mou 2012 furthermore the area of the basic unit is 300 m 300 m in order to obtain the residual thickness of loess laterite or bedrock in the basic unit first based on the borehole strata statistical data the thickness of loess laterite or bedrock in the basic unit was extracted before mining using the arcgis software then the residual thickness of loess laterite or bedrock in each basic unit was calculated separately on the basis of the top interface location of wffz 4 2 determining the thresholds among eegps the thresholds of eegps determine the critical values of residual loess laterite or bedrock thickness between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction and between the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model and the gradually deteriorated model and the disaster model according to the relationship among phreatic water leakage groundwater recharge and variation in water level the residual thickness of loess laterite or bedrock as thresholds between various eegps was determined 4 2 1 threshold between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction according to the definitions of basically unaffected model and gradually restored model after destruction the relationship between the phreatic water leakage and the lateral recharge s increased flow caused by the settlement was used to determine the threshold between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction as represented by eq 2 2 q leakage 1 q lateral r e c h a r g e where q leakage 1 is the phreatic water leakage q lateral r e c h a r g e is the lateral recharge s increased flow caused by the settlement m3 according to darcy s law domenico and schwartz 1998 the phreatic water leakage is expressed using eq 3 3 q leakage 1 k p δ h m f t 1 where k p is the permeability coefficient of residual loess laterite or bedrock m d δh is the allowable maximum drawdown of phreatic water level for vegetation in yushenfu mining area δh 3 m m is the thresholds between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction m f is the leakage area of phreatic water f l w 2 l w is the width of the working face m and t 1 is the recovery time during which the permeability coefficient of the disturbed residual aquifuge is restored to the original permeability coefficient the laterite aquifuge is basically restored in the time of advancing 300 m in working face while the loess aquifuge is basically restored in the time of advancing 1000 m in working face liu 2018 the working face s advance rate is 20 m d meanwhile the laterite recovery time is t 1 r 15 d and the loess recovery time is t 1 y 50 d the lateral recharge s increased flow caused by the settlement is expressed using eq 4 4 q lateral r e c h a r g e k phreatic i a where k phreatic is the permeability coefficient of phreatic aquifer m d k phreatic 3 73 m d and i is the hydraulic gradient all other symbols in eq 4 carry the same meaning and units as described previously according to the subsidence caused by coal mining he 1991 i 0 7hcoal l w 2 where hcoal is the mining thickness m a is the incremental area of phreatic replenishment m2 a 4 l w 0 7 hcoal and l w is the width of the working face m the threshold between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction was calculated using eqs 2 3 and 4 in the combination of which results into eq 5 5 m k p 3 t 1 14 6216 l w h coal 2 where all the symbols carry the same meaning and units as given in eqs 2 3 and 4 according to the definition of the basically unaffected model the permeability coefficient of residual aquifuge can be considered to remain undisturbed due to mining activities in the gradually restored model after destruction the permeability coefficient of residual aquifuge will be slightly disturbed in order to calculate the accurate thresholds the permeability coefficient of the residual aquifuge in the gradually restored model after destruction is taken as the permeability coefficient threshold between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction according to many field investigations before and after the mining n1114 coalface in ningtiaota colliery and 108 coalface in jinjitan colliery belong to the gradually restored model after destruction in n1114 coalface of ningtiaota colliery the values of l w and hcoal were found to be 280 m and 5 7 m respectively the laterite layer of baode formation is exposed to the surface after mining 2 2 coal seam the wffz height develops to the laterite layer and the residual aquifuge is only laterite furthermore the permeability coefficient of disturbed residual laterite in n1114 coalface was tested based upon the field pressure water tests in two boreholes of n1 and n2 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2003 and the corresponding results are presented in table 1 in 108 coalface of jinjitan colliery a part of loess and laterite is exposed separately to the surface where l w 300 m and hcoal 11 3 m where the loess is exposed the residual aquifuge is only loess and the permeability coefficient of disturbed residual loess in 108 coalface was tested using the field pressure water tests in the two boreholes of j1 and j2 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2003 and the corresponding results are presented in table 1 where the laterite is exposed the residual aquifuge is only the laterite and the permeability coefficient of disturbed residual laterite in 108 coalface was tested using the field pressure water tests in the borehole of j3 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2003 the corresponding results are presented in table 1 on the basis of eq 5 the thickness thresholds of residual loess and laterite between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction are found to be 36 m and 22 m respectively in the yushenfu mining area the bedrock is exposed near valleys and after mining there is no mining coalface with only residual bedrock aquifuge it is assumed that there is only bedrock in the residual aquifuge after the mining and the residual bedrock will be damaged to varying extents by the disturbance therefore the permeability coefficients of residual bedrock aquifuge in the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model are determined respectively according to the changes and evolution of permeability in the non penetrating fractured zone as proposed by liu 2018 therefore the non penetrating fracture zone which is a part of the bending subsidence zone is the strata that keep the original stratiform structure above the top interface of wffz furthermore a part of the stratum has deformation and movement similar to continuity though it has cracks in the stratum which are not connected to each other the steps to determine the permeability coefficient of residual bedrock are as follows in the experiments of the evolution of permeability of non penetrating fracture zone the permeability coefficient of argillaceous sandstone at the position of non penetrating fracture zone before coal seam mining was measured using field water pressure tests the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2003 then the triaxial creep permeability tests were carried out on the upper middle and lower rock samples of the non through fracture zone which means that the permeability changes of argillaceous sandstone in the upper middle and lower parts of the non through fracture zone under 1 5 mpa stress recovery grade were tested and analyzed the results show that the permeability coefficient of argillaceous sandstone in the upper part of the non penetrating fracture zone can basically restore the original permeability before the mining and that of argillaceous sandstone in the lower part of the non penetrating fracture zone cannot be restored to the original permeability on this basis the permeability coefficient of the argillaceous sandstone in the upper part of the non penetrating fracture zone was taken as the permeability coefficient of the residual bedrock aquifuge in the gradually restored model after destruction this means that the permeability coefficient was 0 012858 m d the permeability coefficient of the argillaceous sandstone in the lower part of the non penetrating fracture zone was taken as the permeability coefficient of the residual bedrock aquifuge in the gradually deteriorated model which means that the permeability coefficient was 0 017260 m d previous mining practices have shown that the stable time of wffz development height in bedrock is generally within 1 2 months after coal seam mining wang 2008 furthermore it can be considered that the time for the permeability coefficient of residual bedrock aquifuge to recover to the original permeability coefficient is around 1 2 months therefore the recovery time of the argillaceous sandstone s permeability coefficient to the original value is t 1 j 60 d the threshold of permeability coefficient between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction is 0 012858 m d according to a large number of mining practices in yushenfu mining area the values of l w and hcoal are found to be 280 m and 10 m respectively on the basis of eq 5 the thickness of residual bedrock is 124 098 m and which is usually taken to be 125 m in engineering practices this means that the thickness threshold of residual bedrock between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction is 125 m generally the thickness thresholds of residual loess laterite and bedrock between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction are 36 m 22 m and 125 m respectively 4 2 2 threshold between the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model according to the definition of the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model the relationship between the phreatic water leakage and the phreatic water recharge capacity in a hydrologic year was used to determine the threshold between the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model see eq 6 6 q leakage 2 q water r e c h a r g e where q leakage 2 is the phreatic water leakage and q water r e c h a r g e is the phreatic water recharge capacity in a hydrologic year m3 according to darcy s law domenico and schwartz 1998 the phreatic water leakage is expressed using eq 7 7 q leakage 2 k p f t 2 δ h m where k p δh m and f carry the same meaning and units as described in eq 2 whereas t 2 is a hydrological year time period equivalent to 365 d based on groundwater storage a hydrologic year s phreatic water recharge capacity was also defined see eq 8 zhang 1995 8 q water r e c h a r g e f δ s μ where f is the leakage area of phreatic water m2 δs is the difference in water level between the wet season and the dry season in a hydrologic year m and μ is the specific yield of water bearing media according to the results of the regional water level the water level difference between the wet season and the dry season is 1 2 1 6 m in yushenfu mining area which means that δs 1 4 m since the lithology of the phreatic aquifer is siltstone chen and zhang 2011 the value of μ is taken to be 0 15 the threshold between the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model was calculated using eqs 6 7 and 8 which when combined produce eq 9 9 m 5214 4 k p where all the symbols carry the same meaning and units as described in eq 3 under the same lithology of residual aquifuge compared with the permeability coefficient of residual aquifuge in the gradually restored model after destruction the permeability coefficient of the residual aquifuge in the gradually deteriorated model is more disturbed in order to calculate the accurate thresholds the permeability coefficient of the residual aquifuge in the gradually deteriorated model is taken as the permeability coefficient threshold between the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model according to many field investigations before and after the mining 10103 coalface in xiangshuihe colliery and 15212 coalface in hongliulin colliery belong to the gradually deteriorated model in 10103 coalface of xiangshuihe colliery the loess layer of lishi formation is exposed to the surface and the residual aquifuge is only loess the permeability coefficient of the disturbed residual loess in 10103 coalface was tested using the field pressure water tests in the two boreholes of x1 and x2 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2003 the corresponding results are provided in table 2 in 15212 coalface in hongliulin colliery the laterite layer of baode formation is exposed to the surface and the residual aquifuge is only laterite the permeability coefficient of the disturbed residual laterite in 15212 coalface was tested using the field pressure water tests in the two boreholes of h1 and h2 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2003 the corresponding results are presented in table 2 on the basis of eq 9 the thickness thresholds of residual loess and laterite between the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model are found to be 27 m and 16 m respectively according to the determination method for residual bedrock thickness threshold between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction in the experiments for analyzing the evolution of permeability of non penetrating fracture zone the permeability coefficient in the lower part of the non penetrating fracture zone cannot be restored to the original permeability value therefore the permeability coefficient in the lower part of the non penetrating fracture zone was taken as the permeability coefficient of the residual bedrock aquifuge in the gradually deteriorated model this means that the threshold of permeability coefficient between the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model is 0 017260 m d on the basis of eq 9 the thickness of residual bedrock is 90 m which means that the thickness threshold of residual bedrock between the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model is 90 m generally the thickness thresholds of residual loess laterite and bedrock between the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model are 27 m 16 m and 90 m respectively 4 2 3 threshold between the gradually deteriorated model and the disaster model in the gradually deteriorated model and the disaster model the residual aquifuge is thin or even non existent which cannot effectively prevent the leakage of phreatic water and therefore leads to damage to eco geological environment after the coal seam mining the evolution of the wffz height is such that it first increases then decreases and finally tends to stabilize regardless of the site measurements theoretical calculations or simulations the development height of wffz is difficult to be accurately determined due to which there will always be some error in its value however the results of the wffz height can still provide an important theoretical basis for safe mining in this paper the error values of the wffz height are used as the thresholds between the gradually deteriorated model and the disaster model on the basis of engineering practice and theoretical calculations the thicknesses of laterite loess and bedrock were determined to be 5 m 10 m and 15 m respectively 4 3 determining the zoning criteria for eegps 4 3 1 combined relationship among residual thicknesses of laterite loess and bedrock the threshold calculations among eegps are based on a single aquifuge factor and do not consider any combination of the two or three aquifuge factors thickness relationships actually the thickness of the residual aquifuge is usually the combined thickness of three or two factors therefore it is particularly necessary to study the combined relationship among residual thicknesses of loess laterite or bedrock for determining the zoning criteria for eegps the equivalent permeability coefficient of the combined two or three thicknesses is given in eq 10 10 k p m i m i k i where k p is the equivalent permeability coefficient of the combined two or three thicknesses m d mi is the single aquifuge thickness m and ki is the single aquifuge permeability coefficient m d combined with eqs 2 10 the following conclusions are reached when q leakage 1 q lateral r e c h a r g e the combined thickness relationship between any of the two factors is as follows 11 k 1 k 2 δ h f k phreatic a i k 2 m 1 k 1 m 2 the combined thickness relationship of loess laterite and bedrock is given by eq 12 12 k 1 k 2 k 3 δ h f k phreatic a i k 2 k 3 m 1 k 1 k 3 m 2 k 1 k 2 m 3 when q leakage 2 q water r e c h a r g e the combined thickness relationship between any of the two factors is given by eq 13 13 k 1 k 2 δ h δ s μ k 2 m 1 k 1 m 2 the combined thickness relationship of loess laterite and bedrock is given by eq 14 14 k 1 k 2 k 3 δ h δ s μ k 2 k 3 m 1 k 1 k 3 m 2 k 1 k 2 m 3 obviously the combined relationship of residual thicknesses of laterite loess and bedrock presents a linear correlation 4 3 2 zoning criteria for eegps zoning criteria for eegps were determined based on the thresholds among eegps and the linear correlation of combined residual aquifuge thicknesses the determination method for eegps zoning criteria map is as follows first the thickness thresholds of residual laterite loess and bedrock were labeled in x y and z axes of the coordinate system then on the basis of the linear variation in combined residual aquifuge thicknesses the corresponding marking points on different axes were connected this means that there are three faces in the coordinate system whereas the three faces are the interfaces between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model and the gradually deteriorated model and the disaster model see fig 8 in order to better apply the zoning criteria to engineering practice the zoning discriminant equation of eegps was determined as follows 1 discriminant equation for the disaster model 15 x 5 y 10 z 15 1 0 where x is the thickness of residual laterite m y is the thickness of residual loess m and z is the thickness of residual bedrock m 2 discriminant equation for the gradually deteriorated model 16 x 5 y 10 z 15 1 0 x 16 y 27 z 90 1 0 where x y and z carry the same meaning and units as described in eq 15 3 discriminant equation for the gradually restored model after destruction 17 x 16 y 27 z 90 1 0 x 22 y 36 z 125 1 0 where x y and z carry the same meaning and units as described in eq 15 4 discriminant equation for the basically unaffected model 18 x 22 y 36 z 125 1 0 where x y and z carry the same meaning and units as eq 15 based on the above analysis the zoning method for eegps was further illustrated as follows first combined with the zoning discriminant equation for eegps the residual loess laterite or bedrock thicknesses of each basic unit in section 4 1 2 was calculated using the matlab platform the eegps of each basic unit were obtained subsequently the zoning for eegps was carried out using the arcgis spatial analysis function then considering the wffz height penetrating the surface or the phreatic aquifer the zoning results for eegps in the study site were eventually obtained 5 results the zoning map for eegps was obtained for the yushenfu mining area as shown in fig 9 the results show that the disaster model area is mainly distributed in the northeastern part of the 1 planning area the southwestern and eastern parts of the 2 planning area and the southeastern part of the shenfu mining area this area is represented by the southern part of mahuangliang colliery the northeastern part of the jinjitan colliery hexingliang minefield zhujiata minefield the northeast of dabaodang colliery the qingshuigou exploration area the eastern part of the liangshuijing colliery the southern and northern parts of the xiangshuihe colliery the eastern part of the hongliulin colliery the central part of the ningtiaota colliery the eastern part of zhangjiamao colliery the eastern part of the haiwan minefield and the northern part of zhaojialiang colliery the gradually deteriorated model area is mainly distributed in the periphery of the disaster model area and the area of the gradually restored model after destruction is mainly distributed in the periphery of the gradually deteriorated model area the basically unaffected model area is mainly distributed in 3 and 4 planning areas the southwest of 1 planning area the central part of 2 planning area and the northwest of shenfu mining area furthermore the grid numbers area and percentage of the four eegps zoning results were also sorted out and the corresponding results are presented in table 3 the results show that the area percentages of basically unaffected model disaster model gradually deteriorated model and gradually restored model after destruction are 72 25 14 285 6 86 and 6 61 respectively 6 discussion 6 1 verification of the zoning results in order to verify the accuracy of the zoning results for eegps based on the formation mechanism of mining induced eegps in the present study the 112201 coalface in xiaobaodang colliery 103 coalface in jinjitan colliery 20119 coalface in yushuwan colliery and 122106 coalface in caojiatan colliery were selected in different regions of the zoning results and their locations were marked as r s t and p respectively see fig 9 according to many field investigations before and after the mining the types of eegps for the 112201 coalface in xiaobaodang colliery the 20119 coalface in yushuwan colliery and the 122106 coalface in caojiatan colliery are basically represented by the unaffected model while that of the 103 coalface in jinjitan colliery is represented by the gradually restored model after destruction these results are consistent with the zoning results additionally in section 4 2 the types of eegps of the n1114 coalface in ningtiaota colliery and the 108 coalface in jinjitan colliery are represented by the gradually restored model after destruction whereas those in the 10103 in ningtiaota colliery and 15212 coalface in hongliulin colliery are represented by the gradually deteriorated model these results further verify the effectiveness and authenticity of zoning results therefore the zoning method of eegps as proposed in the present study is feasible and effective 6 2 comparison of the zoning results a comparison was carried out between the zoning results obtained from the formation mechanism of mining induced eegps and those obtained using the variable weight theory the eegps zoning results obtained using the variable weight theory were verified in the 42112 coalface in liangshuijing colliery the 5101 coalface in zhaojialiang colliery the 31112 coalface in jinjie colliery and the 5108 coalface in zhaojialiang colliery whose locations are marked as u v w and x respectively see fig 9 the corresponding types of eegps are represented by the disaster model the gradually restored model after destruction the gradually deteriorated model and the basically unaffected model liu et al 2018a therefore the types of eegps for the 42112 coalface in liangshuijing colliery and the 31112 coalface in jinjie colliery were consistent with the mechanism zoning results obtained in the present study which can effectively validate the mechanism zoning results as shown in fig 9 however the eegps types of 5101 and 5108 coalfaces in zhaojialiang colliery were not consistent with the mechanism zoning results obtained in the present study in the formation mechanism of mining induced eegps the wffz height penetrates the surface or the phreatic aquifer in the 5101 and 5108 coalfaces in zhaojialiang colliery which are represented by the disaster model and differ from the zoning results obtained using the variable weight theory additionally in the jinjie colliery the exploration zone of qingshuigou and zhujiata and hexingliang minefield areas there is no residual aquifuge thickness fig 7 obviously the types of eegps belong to disaster model in those areas which are verified using the results presented in fig 9 and differ from the zoning results obtained using the variable weight theory for the most of western part of the study area the types of eegps are represented by the basically unaffected model as shown in fig 9 while the zoning results mainly present three types of eegps based upon the variable weight theory these three eegps are represented by the gradually restored model after destruction the gradually deteriorated model and the disaster model liu et al 2018a in these areas the residual aquifuge thickness is greater than 150 m fig 7 which means that there exists enough thickness of residual aquifuge to protect the phreatic aquifer and eco geological environment combined with the zoning criteria discriminant equations for eegps types it is indicated that the types of eegps in these areas are represented by the basically unaffected model which is also consistent with the zoning results obtained in this work generally the main reasons for the differences in the zoning results are the following two aspects on one hand various influencing factors are taken as the subject in mathematical models and the mathematical structural formalization language step is used to obtain the zoning results which does not involve the formation mechanism of eegps on the other hand from the perspective of the complexity of influencing factors the formation process of eegps involves many factors and the interaction of various factors is not considered however the zoning results based on the formation mechanism of eegps can reflect the interaction of various factors therefore the mechanism zoning method proposed in the present work is a scientific research method to find out the development by analyzing and studying the internal mechanism of the system furthermore the zoning results based on the formation mechanism of eegps are more reasonable and accurate than those based on the mathematical method 6 3 uncertainty of the parameters in this zoning model especially in determining the thresholds of eegps many parameters are involved including the permeability coefficient of disturbed aquifuge mining thickness of the coal seam width of the working face and the recovery time within which the permeability coefficient of the disturbed aquifuge is restored to the original permeability coefficient these parameters contain uncertainties for the permeability coefficient many factors such as lithology tectonic activity and sedimentary characteristics will affect the distribution of permeability coefficient which result in the spatial heterogeneity of permeability coefficient especially for the permeability coefficient of the aquifuge disturbed by the mining activities in the study area the tectonic activity is simple and belongs to the relatively stable tectonic area in the ordos basin pei 2017 the same lithology has similar sedimentary characteristics strata are formed in the same geological period and have the same sedimentary environment therefore the same lithology has similar sedimentary characteristics in addition the quantitative relationship between the disturbed aquifer and its permeability coefficient has not been reported in literature on this basis according to the field investigations of the types of eegps and the measured data of permeability coefficient in coalface the permeability coefficient of the disturbed aquifuge in n1114 coalface in ningtiaota colliery and 108 coalface in jinjitan colliery is used as the permeability coefficient of aquifuge under the condition of gradually restored model after destruction the permeability coefficient of the disturbed aquifuge in 10103 coalface in xiangshuihe colliery and 15212 coalface in hongliulin colliery is used as the permeability coefficient of the aquifuge under the condition of gradually deteriorated model for the mining thickness of coal seam width of the working face and the recovery time within which the permeability coefficient of the disturbed aquifuge is restored to the original permeability coefficient these values are also uncertain in every coalface these values depend upon the coal mining techniques coalface layout mode and coal mining speed in general the width of working face is 260 300 m while the mining thickness is 6 14 m furthermore the mining speed is 15 25 m d in the present study the mean values for the width of working face mining thickness and mining speed are adopted 6 4 future prospects in the present study the zoning method for eegps was established and applied to yushenfu mining area northern shaanxi china for other mining areas in the world this idea can be used for reference however there are still some deficiencies in the current research for example the influences of geomorphology and mining techniques on eegps are not taken into account in the zoning method therefore the effect of geomorphology on eegps the influence of mining techniques on the thickness of residual aquifuge and the quantitative evaluation of permeability coefficient of aquifuge disturbed by the mining activities will be considered in a future research additionally the current zoning results have been validated by field investigations furthermore based on the definitions of four types of eegps the phreatic water level varies with the types of eegps on this basis the monitoring of phreatic water level in the whole process of coal mining will be carried out to verify the types of eegps 7 conclusions according to the degree of influence of underground coal mining on phreatic aquifer with the aim of win win between protection of phreatic water resources and exploitation of coal resources four types of eegps were defined furthermore the zoning method for eegps was proposed which involves calculating the residual aquifuge thickness based on the wffz height determining the thresholds among various eegps establishing the zoning criteria for eegps and obtaining the zoning results for eegps the salawusu formation phreatic aquifer is the target aquifer for water preserved coal mining which has ecological significance and the capability to supply water to widely distributed localities within the yushenfu mining area with the large scale exploitation of coal resources the contradiction between the exploitation of coal resources and the protection of phreatic water resources is aggravating on this basis the zoning method for eegps considering the degree of influence of mining activities on phreatic aquifer was applied in yushenfu mining area northern shaanxi china the zoning results showed that the gradually deteriorated model area is mainly distributed in the periphery of the disaster model area while the gradually restored model after destruction area is mainly distributed in the periphery of the gradually deteriorated model area additionally the basically unaffected model area is mainly distributed in the western part of the study site the thicknesses of laterite loess and bedrock as the thresholds between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction were 22 m 36 m and 125 m respectively the thicknesses of laterite loess and bedrock as the thresholds between the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model were 16 m 27 m and 90 m respectively the thicknesses of laterite loess and bedrock as the thresholds between the gradually deteriorated model and the disaster model were 5 m 10 m and 15 m respectively additionally the verification of eegps types in the coalfaces and the comparison between the zoning results obtained using the variable weight theory and those reported in the current work indicates that the zoning results reported in this work are more accurate and reasonable in future with the continuous large scale mining in yushenfu mining area the verification of the types of eegps in coalfaces will be conducted the research documents how the four types of eegps considering the degree of influence of mining activities on phreatic aquifer can be defined and divided which can provide theoretical basis for solving the

6112,environmental engineering geological patterns eegps are the generalized manifestation of environmental engineering geology with the protection of phreatic water resources as the core especially in mining areas with fragile eco geological environment based on the formation mechanism of mining induced eegps with the aim of win win between protection of phreatic water resources and exploitation of coal resources this study presents a zoning method for eegps taking the yushenfu mining area in northern shaanxi china as a case study four types of eegps basically unaffected model gradually restored model after destruction gradually deteriorated model and disaster model were defined separately on the basis of the degree of influence of mining activities on phreatic aquifer the zoning method for eegps was proposed firstly the height of water flowing fractured zone wffz and the residual aquifuge thickness were calculated using multivariate linear regression method secondly according to the relationship among phreatic water leakage groundwater recharge and variation in groundwater level the thickness of laterite loess and bedrock as the thresholds between the eegps were separately determined thirdly based on the thresholds between eegps and the linear variation of residual aquifuge thickness combination the zoning criteria for eegps were formulated finally the zoning results were obtained furthermore the verification of the types of eegps in coalfaces and the comparison between the zoning results obtained using variable weight theory and those given in the present study indicated that the zoning results presented in the current study are more accurate and reasonable the research results can provide theoretical basis for solving the contradiction between coal resource

economic development zhu 1987 wang et al 2018 with the depletion of coal resources in eastern china and the increasing imbalance between resources and environmental sustainability in central and northeastern china the overall layout of china s coal development is to compress the eastern mining areas limit the central and northeastern mining areas and optimize the western mining areas in this regard shanbei huanglong shendong ningdong and xinjiang are the five major coal bases in western china in 2020 coal production in western china was estimated to be 2 31 billion tons which accounted for around 59 2 of the country s total output national development and reform commission and national energy administration 2016 the average annual precipitation in arid and semi arid areas of western china is below 400 mm and the water resources account for only 1 6 of the whole country feng et al 2000 ji et al 2006 the lack of water resources has resulted in extremely fragile eco geological environment in northwest china in recent years large scale high intensity and extensive mining of coal resources in northwest china has destroyed the originally fragile eco geological environment and brought serious impacts on the production and life of the local people engineering geology can be defined as the combination of geological conditions and engineering activities the environmental engineering geology can be defined as a synthesis of environmental issues and engineering geological conditions furthermore environmental engineering geology patterns eegps are defined as a generalization of the manifestation of environmental engineering geology which reflects the relationship among geological conditions engineering activities and environmental changes therefore it is very urgent to regionalize the environmental engineering geological patterns eegps of mining areas which is conducive to planning mining activities guiding the sustainable use of coal resources and protecting the eco geological environment numerous studies have been carried out about the effects of mining activities on the eco geological environment and public health which include water shortages and pollution zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 saatsaz et al 2013 bondaruk et al 2015 wang et al 2016 gaaloul et al 2017 ma et al 2019 decrease of groundwater tables qiao et al 2017 death

schemes for geological environmental problems in mines in china li et al 2000 analyzed the main problems of environmental engineering geology for the development of coal resources and made a prediction and evaluation of changes in the geological environmental quality after mining which has strong significance for the rational development of coal resources the current state achievements substantial tasks and evolution of ecological geology were described whereas the principles and methods used to assess the eco geological system formulated the fundamentals of ecological geology trofimov 2013 a new geo environmental zoning approach for producing automatic integrated self organized optimum zoning maps using comprehensive geological and geophysical data was proposed which included techniques for finding the optimal structure that best fits the natural pattern of a given area without the benefit of any a priori class information zamani et al 2015 similarly based on the hydrographic basin compartmentalization and codification technique known as the ottobasin method a geo environmental zoning method was also put forward fontes and pejon 2008 additionally large spatiotemporal data were applied to the evaluation of synthetic geo ecological environment of a coastal coal mining city he et al 2017 in view of the contradiction between the abundant coal resources and the scarcity of water resources in the eco geologically fragile mining areas the leakage of phreatic water the decline of groundwater level and the destruction of vegetation ecosystem caused by mining activities were pointed out and the response of vegetation to changes in groundwater level was investigated ma et al 2017 wang et al 2008 yang et al 2006 moreover mathematical methods including support vector machine du 2012 neural network method arkoc et al 2016 latifovic et al 2018 variable weight theory liu et al 2018a liu and li 2019 bayes or fisher discriminant analysis he et al 2012 hu and li 2012 multi scale evaluation method chen et al 2010 cluster analysis novak and renema 2018 wei et al 2018 and topsis method khan et al 2018 li et al 2013a b have been used for the evaluation and zoning of environmental engineering geology in the abovementioned literatures on one hand the research content focuses on the evaluation of environmental engineering geology whereas the evaluation results are often expressed as large medium and small although four types of eegps have been proposed these types have not been defined adequately in literature liu et al 2018a on the other hand mathematical methods are often used in environmental engineering geological evaluation though they cannot reflect the evolution mechanism of engineering activities on eegps therefore this paper studied the zoning method for eegps resulting from mining activities based on the formation mechanism of eegps caused by underground coal mining from the perspective of field investigations and the mechanism of eegps caused by mining four types of eegps were put forward and defined on this basis the zoning method for eegps was proposed firstly residual aquifuge thickness was calculated subsequently according to the relationship among phreatic water leakage groundwater recharge and variation in water level thresholds among the eegps were determined then the zoning criteria for eegps were identified finally the zoning results were obtained and verified 2 study site the yushenfu mining area whose geographical coordinates are 109 08 24 e 110 27 59 e and 38 19 33 n 39 11 23 n is located in the northern part of yulin city shaanxi province china its total area is about 6334 km2 as shown in fig 1 the maximum length in the east west direction is approximately 97 km while the maximum width along the north south direction is approximately 95 km the elevation of the study site is 967 1435 m li et al 2018 additionally the study area is located on the border of maowusu desert and the loess plateau of northern shaanxi province which has a continental monsoon climate in arid and semi arid regions furthermore the overall topography of the region is high in the northwest and low in the southeast directions according to the morphological origins of each topography unit the study area includes three types of topographies namely the blown sand and bottomland region the hilly loess region and the river valley region pei 2017 from east to west the surface water system of the study area consists of kuye river tuwei river and yuxi river in view of the coal resources the yushenfu mining area which is the core construction site of shanbei coal base includes the yushen and shenfu mining areas the yushen mining area consists of four planning areas namely the 1 2 3 and 4 planning areas both the 1 and 2 planning areas and shenfu mining area are being exploited on a large scale while the 3 and 4 planning areas are at the exploration stage based on the current data obtained from drill holes and previously acquired geological data the strata of this region include the yan an formation zhiluo formation and anding formation from the jurassic system as well as the deposits from the neogene and quaternary system the stratigraphic lithologic and hydrogeological characteristics of the area are described in detail in fig 2 there are five layers of first mined coal seam which are distributed in different areas of yushenfu mining area and are named as 1 2 2 2 3 1 4 2 and 5 2 coal seams as shown in fig 3 the unconsolidated phreatic aquifer formed by the salawusu formation and quaternary aeolian sand is the only natural subsurface water resource having ecological significance and the capability to supply water to widely distributed localities within the area of study therefore it is the target aquifer for water preserved coal mining the depth of its groundwater level is mostly 10 m or less while the aquifer has the unit water inflow of 0 008 4 321 l s m last but not the least the water richness of the aquifer ranges from weak to strong the lishi formation loess and baode formation laterite form the vital impermeable layers for water resource preservation in the study area a large section of lithologically dense mudstones sandy mudstones argillaceous mudstones and rock sections consisting of intercalations of these rocks may be found between the middle upper sections of the anding and zhiluo formations and the coal seams of yan an formation this layer is an impermeable layer within the bedrock as it has extremely low permeability coefficients the damage caused by coal mining to these impermeable layers determines the level of impact that coal mining has on the target aquifer and ultimately has a varying degree of adverse effects on the eco geology environment 3 types of mining induced eegps prior to the coal seam mining the groundwater rock and soil mass are in the balanced state of natural stress after the coal seam mining the overlying rock and soil mass move and deform which are damaged to varying degrees and result in the formation of water flowing fractured zone wffz liu et al 2018b c the distance between the top interface of wffz and the bottom interface of the phreatic aquifer is called the residual aquifuge layer which plays an important role in realizing the water preserved coal mining and protection of phreatic water resources the thickness lithology and its combination of residual aquifuge determine the degree of impact of coal mining on phreatic water resources in general smaller the thickness of residual aquifuge greater is the impact of coal mining on phreatic water resources mining induced eegps represent the relationship between mining activities and eco geological environment and help study the ways to avoid and reform the influence of unfavorable geological factors on engineering which in turn help in predicting and evaluating the trend and intensity of eco geological environment caused by mining activities such information can provide theoretical basis for the rationality of environmental protection environmental governance and development plan of coal resources therefore according to the degree of influence of coal seam mining on phreatic aquifer and field investigations four types of eegps were put forward they were the basically unaffected model the gradually restored model after destruction the gradually deteriorated model and the disaster model fig 4 shows the typical section sketch maps of the four types of eegps 3 1 basically unaffected model after the coal seam mining the top interface of wffz develops into the bedrock or the water resisting clay layer and the thickness of the residual bedrock or the water resisting clay layer becomes relatively large under such circumstances the phreatic water level is only affected by the floor subsidence of water resisting layer and the coal seam mining has little effect on phreatic aquifer therefore the surface ecological environment basically remains unaffected 3 2 gradually restored model after destruction after the coal seam mining the top interface of wffz develops into the bedrock or the water resisting clay layer and the thickness of the residual bedrock or the water resisting clay layer becomes relatively small however the residual water resisting layer still has certain effective water resistance the phreatic water may seep slightly although the water level after the seepage will not be lower than the average water level of the hydrogeological unit furthermore the water level can be restored within a hydrological year therefore the surface ecological environment is slightly affected 3 3 gradually deteriorated model after the coal seam mining the top interface of wffz develops into the bedrock or the water resisting clay layer and the thickness of the residual bedrock or water resisting clay layer becomes very small a large amount of phreatic water leakage will occur which cannot be completely compensated in a hydrological year additionally the phreatic water level continues to decline slowly therefore the surface ecological environment slowly and continuously deteriorates 3 4 disaster model after the coal seam mining the wffz penetrates the bedrock or the water resisting clay layer into the phreatic aquifer and there is no residual water resisting layer the phreatic water completely leaks out while the groundwater level drops rapidly furthermore the surface ecological environment deteriorates obviously in a short period of time 4 methodology the zoning method for eegps can be divided into three steps of calculating the thickness of residual aquifuge determining the thresholds between eegps and determining the zoning criteria for eegps 4 1 calculating the thickness of residual aquifuge the height of wffz is the basis for calculating the thickness of residual aquifuge if the wffz develops to the surface the eegp is obviously the disaster model however if the wffz develops into the bedrock or clay layer it is necessary to calculate the thickness of residual aquifuge 4 1 1 calculating the wffz height in yushenfu mining area 32 field measurements of wffz were collected furthermore the multivariate nonlinear regression equation for wffz was fitted as given by eq 1 liu et al 2018d 1 y 77 109 m c o a l 0 414 0 075 h 44 759 where mcoal is the mining thickness m and h is the burial depth of coal seam m in yushenfu mining area the 203 drilling data were first sorted out whereas the location is shown in fig 1 subsequently the thematic maps of the first mined coal seam thickness coal seam buried depth and the cumulative thickness of the aeolian sand and sara wusu formation aquifer were obtained using arcgis software mou 2012 as shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 5b the burial depth of the first mined coal seam increases gradually from east to west in the study site then the thematic map of the wffz was obtained based upon eq 1 as shown in fig 6 on this basis the thematic map of the residual aquifuge thickness was obtained based on the arcgis spatial analysis function in order to achieve this the wffz height value was subtracted from the coal seam buried depth value and then the cumulative thickness value of the aeolian sand and sara wusu formation aquifer was subtracted from the resultant as shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the residual aquifuge thickness is negative which means that the height of wffz develops to the surface or the phreatic aquifer under this condition eegp in the area is represented by the disaster model if the thickness of the residual aquifuge is positive the height of wffz develops into the bedrock laterite or loess layer and further calculations for the residual thickness of loess laterite or bedrock will be needed 4 1 2 calculating the residual loess laterite and bedrock thickness the area of the study site is 6334 km2 whereas the number of boreholes is 203 this means that the area of each borehole is around 31 2 km2 obviously the density of boreholes in the study area is too small in order to improve the accuracy of calculations the study area was divided into basic unit using the square regular mesh generation method in arcgis software mou 2012 furthermore the area of the basic unit is 300 m 300 m in order to obtain the residual thickness of loess laterite or bedrock in the basic unit first based on the borehole strata statistical data the thickness of loess laterite or bedrock in the basic unit was extracted before mining using the arcgis software then the residual thickness of loess laterite or bedrock in each basic unit was calculated separately on the basis of the top interface location of wffz 4 2 determining the thresholds among eegps the thresholds of eegps determine the critical values of residual loess laterite or bedrock thickness between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction and between the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model and the gradually deteriorated model and the disaster model according to the relationship among phreatic water leakage groundwater recharge and variation in water level the residual thickness of loess laterite or bedrock as thresholds between various eegps was determined 4 2 1 threshold between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction according to the definitions of basically unaffected model and gradually restored model after destruction the relationship between the phreatic water leakage and the lateral recharge s increased flow caused by the settlement was used to determine the threshold between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction as represented by eq 2 2 q leakage 1 q lateral r e c h a r g e where q leakage 1 is the phreatic water leakage q lateral r e c h a r g e is the lateral recharge s increased flow caused by the settlement m3 according to darcy s law domenico and schwartz 1998 the phreatic water leakage is expressed using eq 3 3 q leakage 1 k p δ h m f t 1 where k p is the permeability coefficient of residual loess laterite or bedrock m d δh is the allowable maximum drawdown of phreatic water level for vegetation in yushenfu mining area δh 3 m m is the thresholds between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction m f is the leakage area of phreatic water f l w 2 l w is the width of the working face m and t 1 is the recovery time during which the permeability coefficient of the disturbed residual aquifuge is restored to the original permeability coefficient the laterite aquifuge is basically restored in the time of advancing 300 m in working face while the loess aquifuge is basically restored in the time of advancing 1000 m in working face liu 2018 the working face s advance rate is 20 m d meanwhile the laterite recovery time is t 1 r 15 d and the loess recovery time is t 1 y 50 d the lateral recharge s increased flow caused by the settlement is expressed using eq 4 4 q lateral r e c h a r g e k phreatic i a where k phreatic is the permeability coefficient of phreatic aquifer m d k phreatic 3 73 m d and i is the hydraulic gradient all other symbols in eq 4 carry the same meaning and units as described previously according to the subsidence caused by coal mining he 1991 i 0 7hcoal l w 2 where hcoal is the mining thickness m a is the incremental area of phreatic replenishment m2 a 4 l w 0 7 hcoal and l w is the width of the working face m the threshold between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction was calculated using eqs 2 3 and 4 in the combination of which results into eq 5 5 m k p 3 t 1 14 6216 l w h coal 2 where all the symbols carry the same meaning and units as given in eqs 2 3 and 4 according to the definition of the basically unaffected model the permeability coefficient of residual aquifuge can be considered to remain undisturbed due to mining activities in the gradually restored model after destruction the permeability coefficient of residual aquifuge will be slightly disturbed in order to calculate the accurate thresholds the permeability coefficient of the residual aquifuge in the gradually restored model after destruction is taken as the permeability coefficient threshold between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction according to many field investigations before and after the mining n1114 coalface in ningtiaota colliery and 108 coalface in jinjitan colliery belong to the gradually restored model after destruction in n1114 coalface of ningtiaota colliery the values of l w and hcoal were found to be 280 m and 5 7 m respectively the laterite layer of baode formation is exposed to the surface after mining 2 2 coal seam the wffz height develops to the laterite layer and the residual aquifuge is only laterite furthermore the permeability coefficient of disturbed residual laterite in n1114 coalface was tested based upon the field pressure water tests in two boreholes of n1 and n2 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2003 and the corresponding results are presented in table 1 in 108 coalface of jinjitan colliery a part of loess and laterite is exposed separately to the surface where l w 300 m and hcoal 11 3 m where the loess is exposed the residual aquifuge is only loess and the permeability coefficient of disturbed residual loess in 108 coalface was tested using the field pressure water tests in the two boreholes of j1 and j2 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2003 and the corresponding results are presented in table 1 where the laterite is exposed the residual aquifuge is only the laterite and the permeability coefficient of disturbed residual laterite in 108 coalface was tested using the field pressure water tests in the borehole of j3 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2003 the corresponding results are presented in table 1 on the basis of eq 5 the thickness thresholds of residual loess and laterite between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction are found to be 36 m and 22 m respectively in the yushenfu mining area the bedrock is exposed near valleys and after mining there is no mining coalface with only residual bedrock aquifuge it is assumed that there is only bedrock in the residual aquifuge after the mining and the residual bedrock will be damaged to varying extents by the disturbance therefore the permeability coefficients of residual bedrock aquifuge in the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model are determined respectively according to the changes and evolution of permeability in the non penetrating fractured zone as proposed by liu 2018 therefore the non penetrating fracture zone which is a part of the bending subsidence zone is the strata that keep the original stratiform structure above the top interface of wffz furthermore a part of the stratum has deformation and movement similar to continuity though it has cracks in the stratum which are not connected to each other the steps to determine the permeability coefficient of residual bedrock are as follows in the experiments of the evolution of permeability of non penetrating fracture zone the permeability coefficient of argillaceous sandstone at the position of non penetrating fracture zone before coal seam mining was measured using field water pressure tests the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2003 then the triaxial creep permeability tests were carried out on the upper middle and lower rock samples of the non through fracture zone which means that the permeability changes of argillaceous sandstone in the upper middle and lower parts of the non through fracture zone under 1 5 mpa stress recovery grade were tested and analyzed the results show that the permeability coefficient of argillaceous sandstone in the upper part of the non penetrating fracture zone can basically restore the original permeability before the mining and that of argillaceous sandstone in the lower part of the non penetrating fracture zone cannot be restored to the original permeability on this basis the permeability coefficient of the argillaceous sandstone in the upper part of the non penetrating fracture zone was taken as the permeability coefficient of the residual bedrock aquifuge in the gradually restored model after destruction this means that the permeability coefficient was 0 012858 m d the permeability coefficient of the argillaceous sandstone in the lower part of the non penetrating fracture zone was taken as the permeability coefficient of the residual bedrock aquifuge in the gradually deteriorated model which means that the permeability coefficient was 0 017260 m d previous mining practices have shown that the stable time of wffz development height in bedrock is generally within 1 2 months after coal seam mining wang 2008 furthermore it can be considered that the time for the permeability coefficient of residual bedrock aquifuge to recover to the original permeability coefficient is around 1 2 months therefore the recovery time of the argillaceous sandstone s permeability coefficient to the original value is t 1 j 60 d the threshold of permeability coefficient between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction is 0 012858 m d according to a large number of mining practices in yushenfu mining area the values of l w and hcoal are found to be 280 m and 10 m respectively on the basis of eq 5 the thickness of residual bedrock is 124 098 m and which is usually taken to be 125 m in engineering practices this means that the thickness threshold of residual bedrock between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction is 125 m generally the thickness thresholds of residual loess laterite and bedrock between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction are 36 m 22 m and 125 m respectively 4 2 2 threshold between the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model according to the definition of the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model the relationship between the phreatic water leakage and the phreatic water recharge capacity in a hydrologic year was used to determine the threshold between the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model see eq 6 6 q leakage 2 q water r e c h a r g e where q leakage 2 is the phreatic water leakage and q water r e c h a r g e is the phreatic water recharge capacity in a hydrologic year m3 according to darcy s law domenico and schwartz 1998 the phreatic water leakage is expressed using eq 7 7 q leakage 2 k p f t 2 δ h m where k p δh m and f carry the same meaning and units as described in eq 2 whereas t 2 is a hydrological year time period equivalent to 365 d based on groundwater storage a hydrologic year s phreatic water recharge capacity was also defined see eq 8 zhang 1995 8 q water r e c h a r g e f δ s μ where f is the leakage area of phreatic water m2 δs is the difference in water level between the wet season and the dry season in a hydrologic year m and μ is the specific yield of water bearing media according to the results of the regional water level the water level difference between the wet season and the dry season is 1 2 1 6 m in yushenfu mining area which means that δs 1 4 m since the lithology of the phreatic aquifer is siltstone chen and zhang 2011 the value of μ is taken to be 0 15 the threshold between the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model was calculated using eqs 6 7 and 8 which when combined produce eq 9 9 m 5214 4 k p where all the symbols carry the same meaning and units as described in eq 3 under the same lithology of residual aquifuge compared with the permeability coefficient of residual aquifuge in the gradually restored model after destruction the permeability coefficient of the residual aquifuge in the gradually deteriorated model is more disturbed in order to calculate the accurate thresholds the permeability coefficient of the residual aquifuge in the gradually deteriorated model is taken as the permeability coefficient threshold between the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model according to many field investigations before and after the mining 10103 coalface in xiangshuihe colliery and 15212 coalface in hongliulin colliery belong to the gradually deteriorated model in 10103 coalface of xiangshuihe colliery the loess layer of lishi formation is exposed to the surface and the residual aquifuge is only loess the permeability coefficient of the disturbed residual loess in 10103 coalface was tested using the field pressure water tests in the two boreholes of x1 and x2 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2003 the corresponding results are provided in table 2 in 15212 coalface in hongliulin colliery the laterite layer of baode formation is exposed to the surface and the residual aquifuge is only laterite the permeability coefficient of the disturbed residual laterite in 15212 coalface was tested using the field pressure water tests in the two boreholes of h1 and h2 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2003 the corresponding results are presented in table 2 on the basis of eq 9 the thickness thresholds of residual loess and laterite between the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model are found to be 27 m and 16 m respectively according to the determination method for residual bedrock thickness threshold between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction in the experiments for analyzing the evolution of permeability of non penetrating fracture zone the permeability coefficient in the lower part of the non penetrating fracture zone cannot be restored to the original permeability value therefore the permeability coefficient in the lower part of the non penetrating fracture zone was taken as the permeability coefficient of the residual bedrock aquifuge in the gradually deteriorated model this means that the threshold of permeability coefficient between the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model is 0 017260 m d on the basis of eq 9 the thickness of residual bedrock is 90 m which means that the thickness threshold of residual bedrock between the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model is 90 m generally the thickness thresholds of residual loess laterite and bedrock between the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model are 27 m 16 m and 90 m respectively 4 2 3 threshold between the gradually deteriorated model and the disaster model in the gradually deteriorated model and the disaster model the residual aquifuge is thin or even non existent which cannot effectively prevent the leakage of phreatic water and therefore leads to damage to eco geological environment after the coal seam mining the evolution of the wffz height is such that it first increases then decreases and finally tends to stabilize regardless of the site measurements theoretical calculations or simulations the development height of wffz is difficult to be accurately determined due to which there will always be some error in its value however the results of the wffz height can still provide an important theoretical basis for safe mining in this paper the error values of the wffz height are used as the thresholds between the gradually deteriorated model and the disaster model on the basis of engineering practice and theoretical calculations the thicknesses of laterite loess and bedrock were determined to be 5 m 10 m and 15 m respectively 4 3 determining the zoning criteria for eegps 4 3 1 combined relationship among residual thicknesses of laterite loess and bedrock the threshold calculations among eegps are based on a single aquifuge factor and do not consider any combination of the two or three aquifuge factors thickness relationships actually the thickness of the residual aquifuge is usually the combined thickness of three or two factors therefore it is particularly necessary to study the combined relationship among residual thicknesses of loess laterite or bedrock for determining the zoning criteria for eegps the equivalent permeability coefficient of the combined two or three thicknesses is given in eq 10 10 k p m i m i k i where k p is the equivalent permeability coefficient of the combined two or three thicknesses m d mi is the single aquifuge thickness m and ki is the single aquifuge permeability coefficient m d combined with eqs 2 10 the following conclusions are reached when q leakage 1 q lateral r e c h a r g e the combined thickness relationship between any of the two factors is as follows 11 k 1 k 2 δ h f k phreatic a i k 2 m 1 k 1 m 2 the combined thickness relationship of loess laterite and bedrock is given by eq 12 12 k 1 k 2 k 3 δ h f k phreatic a i k 2 k 3 m 1 k 1 k 3 m 2 k 1 k 2 m 3 when q leakage 2 q water r e c h a r g e the combined thickness relationship between any of the two factors is given by eq 13 13 k 1 k 2 δ h δ s μ k 2 m 1 k 1 m 2 the combined thickness relationship of loess laterite and bedrock is given by eq 14 14 k 1 k 2 k 3 δ h δ s μ k 2 k 3 m 1 k 1 k 3 m 2 k 1 k 2 m 3 obviously the combined relationship of residual thicknesses of laterite loess and bedrock presents a linear correlation 4 3 2 zoning criteria for eegps zoning criteria for eegps were determined based on the thresholds among eegps and the linear correlation of combined residual aquifuge thicknesses the determination method for eegps zoning criteria map is as follows first the thickness thresholds of residual laterite loess and bedrock were labeled in x y and z axes of the coordinate system then on the basis of the linear variation in combined residual aquifuge thicknesses the corresponding marking points on different axes were connected this means that there are three faces in the coordinate system whereas the three faces are the interfaces between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model and the gradually deteriorated model and the disaster model see fig 8 in order to better apply the zoning criteria to engineering practice the zoning discriminant equation of eegps was determined as follows 1 discriminant equation for the disaster model 15 x 5 y 10 z 15 1 0 where x is the thickness of residual laterite m y is the thickness of residual loess m and z is the thickness of residual bedrock m 2 discriminant equation for the gradually deteriorated model 16 x 5 y 10 z 15 1 0 x 16 y 27 z 90 1 0 where x y and z carry the same meaning and units as described in eq 15 3 discriminant equation for the gradually restored model after destruction 17 x 16 y 27 z 90 1 0 x 22 y 36 z 125 1 0 where x y and z carry the same meaning and units as described in eq 15 4 discriminant equation for the basically unaffected model 18 x 22 y 36 z 125 1 0 where x y and z carry the same meaning and units as eq 15 based on the above analysis the zoning method for eegps was further illustrated as follows first combined with the zoning discriminant equation for eegps the residual loess laterite or bedrock thicknesses of each basic unit in section 4 1 2 was calculated using the matlab platform the eegps of each basic unit were obtained subsequently the zoning for eegps was carried out using the arcgis spatial analysis function then considering the wffz height penetrating the surface or the phreatic aquifer the zoning results for eegps in the study site were eventually obtained 5 results the zoning map for eegps was obtained for the yushenfu mining area as shown in fig 9 the results show that the disaster model area is mainly distributed in the northeastern part of the 1 planning area the southwestern and eastern parts of the 2 planning area and the southeastern part of the shenfu mining area this area is represented by the southern part of mahuangliang colliery the northeastern part of the jinjitan colliery hexingliang minefield zhujiata minefield the northeast of dabaodang colliery the qingshuigou exploration area the eastern part of the liangshuijing colliery the southern and northern parts of the xiangshuihe colliery the eastern part of the hongliulin colliery the central part of the ningtiaota colliery the eastern part of zhangjiamao colliery the eastern part of the haiwan minefield and the northern part of zhaojialiang colliery the gradually deteriorated model area is mainly distributed in the periphery of the disaster model area and the area of the gradually restored model after destruction is mainly distributed in the periphery of the gradually deteriorated model area the basically unaffected model area is mainly distributed in 3 and 4 planning areas the southwest of 1 planning area the central part of 2 planning area and the northwest of shenfu mining area furthermore the grid numbers area and percentage of the four eegps zoning results were also sorted out and the corresponding results are presented in table 3 the results show that the area percentages of basically unaffected model disaster model gradually deteriorated model and gradually restored model after destruction are 72 25 14 285 6 86 and 6 61 respectively 6 discussion 6 1 verification of the zoning results in order to verify the accuracy of the zoning results for eegps based on the formation mechanism of mining induced eegps in the present study the 112201 coalface in xiaobaodang colliery 103 coalface in jinjitan colliery 20119 coalface in yushuwan colliery and 122106 coalface in caojiatan colliery were selected in different regions of the zoning results and their locations were marked as r s t and p respectively see fig 9 according to many field investigations before and after the mining the types of eegps for the 112201 coalface in xiaobaodang colliery the 20119 coalface in yushuwan colliery and the 122106 coalface in caojiatan colliery are basically represented by the unaffected model while that of the 103 coalface in jinjitan colliery is represented by the gradually restored model after destruction these results are consistent with the zoning results additionally in section 4 2 the types of eegps of the n1114 coalface in ningtiaota colliery and the 108 coalface in jinjitan colliery are represented by the gradually restored model after destruction whereas those in the 10103 in ningtiaota colliery and 15212 coalface in hongliulin colliery are represented by the gradually deteriorated model these results further verify the effectiveness and authenticity of zoning results therefore the zoning method of eegps as proposed in the present study is feasible and effective 6 2 comparison of the zoning results a comparison was carried out between the zoning results obtained from the formation mechanism of mining induced eegps and those obtained using the variable weight theory the eegps zoning results obtained using the variable weight theory were verified in the 42112 coalface in liangshuijing colliery the 5101 coalface in zhaojialiang colliery the 31112 coalface in jinjie colliery and the 5108 coalface in zhaojialiang colliery whose locations are marked as u v w and x respectively see fig 9 the corresponding types of eegps are represented by the disaster model the gradually restored model after destruction the gradually deteriorated model and the basically unaffected model liu et al 2018a therefore the types of eegps for the 42112 coalface in liangshuijing colliery and the 31112 coalface in jinjie colliery were consistent with the mechanism zoning results obtained in the present study which can effectively validate the mechanism zoning results as shown in fig 9 however the eegps types of 5101 and 5108 coalfaces in zhaojialiang colliery were not consistent with the mechanism zoning results obtained in the present study in the formation mechanism of mining induced eegps the wffz height penetrates the surface or the phreatic aquifer in the 5101 and 5108 coalfaces in zhaojialiang colliery which are represented by the disaster model and differ from the zoning results obtained using the variable weight theory additionally in the jinjie colliery the exploration zone of qingshuigou and zhujiata and hexingliang minefield areas there is no residual aquifuge thickness fig 7 obviously the types of eegps belong to disaster model in those areas which are verified using the results presented in fig 9 and differ from the zoning results obtained using the variable weight theory for the most of western part of the study area the types of eegps are represented by the basically unaffected model as shown in fig 9 while the zoning results mainly present three types of eegps based upon the variable weight theory these three eegps are represented by the gradually restored model after destruction the gradually deteriorated model and the disaster model liu et al 2018a in these areas the residual aquifuge thickness is greater than 150 m fig 7 which means that there exists enough thickness of residual aquifuge to protect the phreatic aquifer and eco geological environment combined with the zoning criteria discriminant equations for eegps types it is indicated that the types of eegps in these areas are represented by the basically unaffected model which is also consistent with the zoning results obtained in this work generally the main reasons for the differences in the zoning results are the following two aspects on one hand various influencing factors are taken as the subject in mathematical models and the mathematical structural formalization language step is used to obtain the zoning results which does not involve the formation mechanism of eegps on the other hand from the perspective of the complexity of influencing factors the formation process of eegps involves many factors and the interaction of various factors is not considered however the zoning results based on the formation mechanism of eegps can reflect the interaction of various factors therefore the mechanism zoning method proposed in the present work is a scientific research method to find out the development by analyzing and studying the internal mechanism of the system furthermore the zoning results based on the formation mechanism of eegps are more reasonable and accurate than those based on the mathematical method 6 3 uncertainty of the parameters in this zoning model especially in determining the thresholds of eegps many parameters are involved including the permeability coefficient of disturbed aquifuge mining thickness of the coal seam width of the working face and the recovery time within which the permeability coefficient of the disturbed aquifuge is restored to the original permeability coefficient these parameters contain uncertainties for the permeability coefficient many factors such as lithology tectonic activity and sedimentary characteristics will affect the distribution of permeability coefficient which result in the spatial heterogeneity of permeability coefficient especially for the permeability coefficient of the aquifuge disturbed by the mining activities in the study area the tectonic activity is simple and belongs to the relatively stable tectonic area in the ordos basin pei 2017 the same lithology has similar sedimentary characteristics strata are formed in the same geological period and have the same sedimentary environment therefore the same lithology has similar sedimentary characteristics in addition the quantitative relationship between the disturbed aquifer and its permeability coefficient has not been reported in literature on this basis according to the field investigations of the types of eegps and the measured data of permeability coefficient in coalface the permeability coefficient of the disturbed aquifuge in n1114 coalface in ningtiaota colliery and 108 coalface in jinjitan colliery is used as the permeability coefficient of aquifuge under the condition of gradually restored model after destruction the permeability coefficient of the disturbed aquifuge in 10103 coalface in xiangshuihe colliery and 15212 coalface in hongliulin colliery is used as the permeability coefficient of the aquifuge under the condition of gradually deteriorated model for the mining thickness of coal seam width of the working face and the recovery time within which the permeability coefficient of the disturbed aquifuge is restored to the original permeability coefficient these values are also uncertain in every coalface these values depend upon the coal mining techniques coalface layout mode and coal mining speed in general the width of working face is 260 300 m while the mining thickness is 6 14 m furthermore the mining speed is 15 25 m d in the present study the mean values for the width of working face mining thickness and mining speed are adopted 6 4 future prospects in the present study the zoning method for eegps was established and applied to yushenfu mining area northern shaanxi china for other mining areas in the world this idea can be used for reference however there are still some deficiencies in the current research for example the influences of geomorphology and mining techniques on eegps are not taken into account in the zoning method therefore the effect of geomorphology on eegps the influence of mining techniques on the thickness of residual aquifuge and the quantitative evaluation of permeability coefficient of aquifuge disturbed by the mining activities will be considered in a future research additionally the current zoning results have been validated by field investigations furthermore based on the definitions of four types of eegps the phreatic water level varies with the types of eegps on this basis the monitoring of phreatic water level in the whole process of coal mining will be carried out to verify the types of eegps 7 conclusions according to the degree of influence of underground coal mining on phreatic aquifer with the aim of win win between protection of phreatic water resources and exploitation of coal resources four types of eegps were defined furthermore the zoning method for eegps was proposed which involves calculating the residual aquifuge thickness based on the wffz height determining the thresholds among various eegps establishing the zoning criteria for eegps and obtaining the zoning results for eegps the salawusu formation phreatic aquifer is the target aquifer for water preserved coal mining which has ecological significance and the capability to supply water to widely distributed localities within the yushenfu mining area with the large scale exploitation of coal resources the contradiction between the exploitation of coal resources and the protection of phreatic water resources is aggravating on this basis the zoning method for eegps considering the degree of influence of mining activities on phreatic aquifer was applied in yushenfu mining area northern shaanxi china the zoning results showed that the gradually deteriorated model area is mainly distributed in the periphery of the disaster model area while the gradually restored model after destruction area is mainly distributed in the periphery of the gradually deteriorated model area additionally the basically unaffected model area is mainly distributed in the western part of the study site the thicknesses of laterite loess and bedrock as the thresholds between the basically unaffected model and the gradually restored model after destruction were 22 m 36 m and 125 m respectively the thicknesses of laterite loess and bedrock as the thresholds between the gradually restored model after destruction and the gradually deteriorated model were 16 m 27 m and 90 m respectively the thicknesses of laterite loess and bedrock as the thresholds between the gradually deteriorated model and the disaster model were 5 m 10 m and 15 m respectively additionally the verification of eegps types in the coalfaces and the comparison between the zoning results obtained using the variable weight theory and those reported in the current work indicates that the zoning results reported in this work are more accurate and reasonable in future with the continuous large scale mining in yushenfu mining area the verification of the types of eegps in coalfaces will be conducted the research documents how the four types of eegps considering the degree of influence of mining activities on phreatic aquifer can be defined and divided which can provide theoretical basis for solving the contradiction between coal resource exploitation and phreatic water resources protection declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgements the authors

editor in chief meteorological and hydrological droughts are inherently correlated but with a time lag a prolonged precipitation deficiency propagates to surface water bodies and may give rise to hydrological drought in the subsequent time period establishing links between these two drought types is of great significance for water resources planning and for developing drought resistant measures this study proposes a copula based method employing conditional probability distribution to depict the structure of dependence between the characteristics of meteorological and hydrological droughts the time series of grid based standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and standardized runoff index sri were derived from the simulations of the variable infiltration capacity vic model over the yellow river basin yrb during 1961 2012 then using a three dimensional time latitude longitude drought identification method three drought characteristics including duration area and severity were extracted for meteorological and hydrological droughts for analyzing drought characteristics return periods and connection between meteorological and hydrological droughts a probabilistic framework using the copula function was developed results showed that there was a general drying tendency both for meteorological and hydrological droughts with longer duration and larger spatial extent according to the trivariate joint distribution of duration area and severity the most severe meteorological and hydrological droughts over the yrb occurred around 1998 2000 with return periods exceeding 50 years in terms of establishing the dependence between characteristics of meteorological and hydrological droughts traditional statistical models like the linear exponential and power functions presented significant deviations especially for severe or extreme drought conditions in contrast the copula based conditional distribution method provided a satisfactorily probabilistic prediction of hydrological drought characteristics given the information of meteorological drought characteristics the stability test suggested compared to the length of data sample the incorporation of typical major drought events with long persistence and wide spatial extent is more important for reliable drought prediction keywords meteorological drought hydrological drought probabilistic link copula conditional distribution 1 introduction drought is widely recognized as a complex and multifaceted phenomenon hao and singh 2015 konapala and mishra 2017 it originates from the precipitation deficit over a prolonged time period and broad spatial extent and may also cause substantial impacts on the hydrological system ecological environment and human community van loon 2015 liu et al 2017 according to the usage of water drought is generally categorized into four types i e the meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic wilhite and glantz 1985 mishra and singh 2010 to facilitate drought management and reduce damages it is essential to characterize the properties of different drought types as well as to establish their causative links drought is typically characterized by several features such as the duration depicting the persistent period which also contains information of the initial and termination time of a drought event area indicating the spatial coverage and severity which reflects the overall magnitude of a dry event sheffield and wood 2007 this suggests that drought characterization should essentially be a spatiotemporal issue having the time latitude longitude dimensions lloyd hughes 2012 previous studies mostly reduced drought analysis into lower subspaces for instance analyzing the time series of drought indices for individual sites or area averaged hydro meteorological variables or investigating the spatial pattern of drought for a specific time period mishra and singh 2011 such treatments ignored the evolution of drought over time and space simultaneously herrera estrada et al 2017 to address this issue andreadis et al 2005 introduced a clustering algorithm and proposed the severity area duration sad curves which allowed tracking the spatiotemporal variations of droughts along with their duration lloyd hughes 2012 modified and extended this algorithm to three dimensions this three dimensional approach has been applied for characterizing meteorological and soil moisture agricultural droughts at regional or global scales e g sheffield et al 2009 wang et al 2011 xu et al 2015a b haslinger and blöschl 2017 but rarely for hydrological drought to develop an understanding of the drought mechanism statistical models such as the linear regression and markov chains were employed to analyze relationships among different drought types e g sharma and panu 2012 zhu et al 2016 huang et al 2017 given the flexibility in combing multiple drought related variables recent years have witnessed a popularity of the copula function for probabilistic drought analysis common ways of using copulas included constructing the joint distribution of multiple drought related variables development of comprehensive drought indices and drought risk assessments based on return periods ma et al 2013 aghakouchak 2015 liu et al 2019 from a prediction perspective several studies explored the potential of using copula based conditional distribution to link meteorological and hydrological droughts for instance the properties of hydrological drought such as duration and severity can be derived from those of the preceding meteorological drought features by establishing their cross dependence model e g wong et al 2013 wetterhall et al 2015 hao et al 2016 predicted 2 month time series of hydrological drought by incorporating both the persistence of hydrological drought and its antecedent meteorological drought condition with the meta gaussian copula since the response of hydrological process to atmospheric conditions essentially is a nonlinear probabilistic issue the copula could be served as a powerful tool to characterize the temporal and spatial dependences between meteorological and hydrological droughts given this this study further extended the application of copulas from lower subspaces to three dimensions to explore the characteristics of drought propagation process the present study therefore aimed at developing a probabilistic method to construct links between the characteristics of meteorological drought and those of hydrological drought and evaluating the stability of the proposed method for hydrological drought prediction specifically a three dimensional drought characterization approach was employed to extract the duration area and severity of meteorological and hydrological droughts then a copula function was employed to derive joint distributions of drought characteristics of the two drought types the predictive information of hydrological drought characteristics was acquired through the conditional probabilistic distribution of a given meteorological drought characteristic finally two scenarios incorporating different data samples were employed to construct the conditional distribution and their predictive results were assessed to examine the stability of the conditional probabilistic approach the reminder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a brief description of the study area and data used in this study in section 3 a detailed description of the methods including hydrological model simulation drought characterization and the copula based prediction model is presented section 4 deals with the characterization of meteorological and hydrological droughts their return periods and the performance and stability of the proposed probabilistic model for hydrological drought prediction conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 study area and data the yellow river basin yrb ranked as the second largest river basin in china was selected for this study fig 1 with a drainage area of 795 000 km2 the river flows through nine provinces and spans over four climate zones i e arid semiarid semihumid and humid zones from northwest to southeast influenced by atmospheric circulation and monsoon climate yrb presents significant seasonal differences where summer is generally rainy and hot and winter is dry and cold hydro meteorological data used for meteorological and hydrological drought characterization included daily observations 1961 2012 from 101 national meteorological stations and 10 streamflow stations situated in the upper middle and downstream parts of yrb see fig 1 for geographic distribution besides the geographical information required for hydrological modeling was also collected elevation images with a 3 arc second about 90 m spatial resolution were retrieved from the shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model http srtm csi cgiar org land cover images and vegetation characteristics were derived from the university of maryland s 1 km global land cover production hansen et al 2000 and soil data with a 30 arc second about 1 km spatial resolution was collected from the 5 min food and agriculture organization dataset allen et al 1998 3 methodology the methods employed in this study are described in five sections section 3 1 discusses the implementation of the vic model over yrb and the treatment of model outputs for drought indices computation section 3 2 describes how meteorological and hydrological droughts were characterized with drought indices in the three dimensional space section 3 3 introduces the procedure for linking meteorological and hydrological drought events section 3 4 discusses the algorithm of copula function for establishing the cross dependencies between the characteristics of meteorological and hydrological drought combined with its conditional distribution for drought prediction finally a general flowchart of the study is presented in section 3 5 3 1 hydrological simulation and computation of drought indices the physically based macroscale variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 with extensive applications for drought assessments at regional and global scales e g sheffield et al 2009 xia et al 2014 was employed for hydrological simulation specially the basin was divided into 1500 grids at a spatial resolution of 0 25 and at each grid scale vic was run at a time step of 24 h to simulate the land surface water and energy balances the model was calibrated during 1961 1990 and validated during 1991 2012 through two evaluation criteria nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce and bias see liu et al 2015 for detail simulation results showed that the absolute values of nsce varied between 0 68 and 0 94 and bias ranged from 0 3 to 10 8 indicating the calibrated model was generally capable to capture the variability of hydro graph in yrb fig s1 the generated grid based hydrological variables were further used for calculating drought indices specifically the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and the standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 were employed to indicate meteorological and hydrological droughts respectively similar to the mathematical algorithm of the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 calculating spei and sri also involves two sections cumulative treatment of moisture deficit in any predetermined time period e g 1 24 months and standardizing the indices to make them comparable over time and space in this study both spei and sri were accumulated at a 3 month time scale 3 2 characterization of drought events the three dimensional i e time latitude longitude identification method developed by andreadis et al 2005 and lloyd hughes 2012 was employed for characterizing meteorological and hydrological droughts the algorithm generally contains two separate parts namely spatial clustering and temporal connection for each month a grid with an spei sri below a predetermined value 1 in this study is considered as drought with a 3 3 spatial filter the drought grids are further merged into one drought patch or split into different groups smaller clusters no more than the minimum area threshold are filtered out which no longer participate in the following calculation the remaining clusters are viewed as individual drought patches for the current month then a temporal linkage is implemented for drought patches in two adjacent months when their overlapping area exceeds a predefined minimum area threshold a detailed illustration of this approach is referred to andreadis et al 2005 and lloyd hughes 2012 obviously this threshold plays an important role in characterizing drought events because an inappropriate setting would result in either overestimation or underestimation of drought conditions e g drought patches with tenuous connectivity would be incorrectly combined with a smaller threshold or related patches would be separated as independent events with a larger threshold wang et al 2011 made a sensitivity test and suggested a minimum threshold of 150 000 km2 equivalent to 1 5 of the study area for whole china xu et al 2015a b used a similar criterion for analyzing droughts in non arid regions of china in this study the same threshold standard namely an area of 20 pixels approximately 1 5 of the yrb area was employed as the minimum area threshold in three dimensions drought duration d is related to the status of all incorporated drought grids within the drought event which represents the temporal span between the earliest initiation time and the latest termination time of related drought grids the total drought area a of a drought event represents the union of affected areal extent in each month 1 a a r e a 1 a r e a i a r e a n where n represents the duration period of a drought event area i represents the identified drought areal extent in month i which is variable with time drought severity s reflects the total water deficit accumulated over the whole drought duration and areal extent and is expressed as 2 s i 1 n j 1 area i s ij where s i j represents the drought severity for the ith month i 1 2 10 and the jth grid j 1 2 area i 3 3 linking meteorological and hydrological drought events the links between meteorological and hydrological drought events were established based on the properties of their duration and area extracted from the three dimensional space fig 2 presents a sketch describing how these two drought types are connected different from lower dimensions such as the right panel of fig 2 where only the temporal overlap is considered a strong link in the three dimensions latitude longitude time would be recognized when both temporal and spatial intersections are satisfied for the sake of convenience the status of one meteorological and one hydrological drought event during a certain time period was simplified as a rectangle and ellipse respectively with their drought area varying along the timeline left panel in fig 2 it can be seen that the no 1 meteorological drought is initiated earlier than the hydrological drought then in the following evolution stages t2 t4 these two events spatiotemporally overlap which constitutes a connection with the termination of no 1 meteorological drought event the magnitude of hydrological drought may attenuate e g reduced drought area gradually but would also step into a new developing stage affected by another meteorological drought event such as the case of no 2 meteorological drought in fig 2 this gives a simplified example when two meteorological drought events jointly trigger one hydrological drought event in reality the relationship between two drought types would be more complex e g one large meteorological drought event induces several hydrological droughts in different regions or a couple of meteorological drought events successively trigger several hydrological drought events similar to the three dimensional drought identification method the overlapping of duration and drought area is employed to judge whether a link exists between meteorological and hydrological drought events spatially their overlapping area such as the shading parts in fig 2 should no smaller than 20 grids which is in accordance with the threshold in the three dimensional drought identification approach section 3 2 as for the temporal case a non null overlap of duration is the premise for a successful temporal connection between meteorological and hydrological drought events for some unusual cases when hydrological droughts occur earlier than meteorological droughts an additional constraint is needed to avoid misjudgments when meteorological and hydrological droughts are temporally overlapped by coincidence for our study there were 14 such cases we summarized the statistics of their duration and found one third of the minimum duration of related meteorological and hydrological drought events e g minimum t2 t11 t7 t10 in fig 2 was the most suitable value this variable form of threshold enabled to consider the temporal links under different conditions for instance 1 month overlap is reasonable for meteorological and hydrological droughts in short duration no more than 3 months however for events with longer persistence e g 9 months or more this threshold value seems insufficient to filter strongly linked meteorological and hydrological drought events and a larger threshold value is more suitable like other empirical parameters application of this temporal overlapping threshold for other regions needs to be tested before using it directly 3 4 copula based probability analysis this section provides a detailed illustration on how copula function is used for constructing the probabilistic links and for drought prediction to this end the joint distribution of meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics is first established this can be further used to assess drought risks by computing the bivariate or trivariate return periods of drought events on this basis the conditional probability distribution derived from the joint probability distribution can be constructed to model the dependence between predictand and predictors 3 4 1 joint distribution based on copulas the joint distribution provides an effective way to characterize the multi faceted properties of droughts among various approaches copulas are most often used due to their flexibility to model the dependence structure among random variables regardless of their marginals according to sklar s theorem for n dimensional continuous random variables x1 x2 xn there always exists an n copula which could combine n univariate marginal distributions f1 x1 f2 x2 fn xn into a joint distribution function h 3 h x 1 x 2 x n c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n where h represents the joint distribution of random variables c is the copula function satisfying 0 1 n 0 1 fi xi denotes the marginal distribution constructing such a copula based joint distribution mainly involves two steps one refers to fitting the marginal distributions of random variables and the other is to estimate the copula function c to model the dependence structure among variables in this study 10 theoretical distributions including exponential exp gamma gam gaussian log normal logn uniform logistic log log logistic weibull wbl general extreme value gev and generalized pareto gpa were employed to fit the univariate probability distributions of each drought characteristic five copulas including two meta elliptical student t and gaussian types and three archimedean clayton frank and gumbel hougaard were employed to construct the joint probability distribution function parameters of univariate marginal distribution and copula function were both estimated by the method of maximum likelihood estimation mle and their fitting results were assessed with the goodness of fit statistics including root mean square error rmse kolmogorov smirnov test k s at the 5 significance level akaike and bayesian information criteria test aic and bic detailed description of these statistical test methods is referred to zhang 2005 3 4 2 return period the return period is defined as the average time elapsing between two successive realizations of the given event which can be calculated as the inverse of exceedance probability salvadori and de michele 2010 for drought analysis return period is commonly related to the probability of one certain drought feature e g duration severity and area or their combination such as duration severity or duration severity area exceeding a specific value salvadori et al 2011 for a random variable x the return period can be expressed as 4 t x e l p x x e l 1 p x x where e l is the expectation of time intervals of drought events p x x is the cdf value of a given value x this univariate case can be further extended to calculate the joint return period when considering multiple drought characteristics for mutually independent ramdom variables x and y the bivariate form of return period can be expressed as xu et al 2015a b 5 t xy e l p x x y y e l 1 f x x f y y c xy f x x f y y where cxy is the copula function describing the joint distribution of random variables x and y similarly for the case of three random variables x y and z 6 p x x y y z z 1 f x x f y y f z z c xy f x x f y y c xz f x x f z z c yz f y y f z z c xyz f x x f y y f z z 7 t xyz e l p x x y y z z where cxyz is the copula function for constructing the joint distribution of random variables x y and z 3 4 3 conditional probability distribution and drought prediction one appealing application of the conditional distribution is for probabilistic drought prediction by establishing the nonlinear dependence between the predictand and predictors hao et al 2018 here we give the general form of bivariate conditional distribution let x and y be random variables with marginal distributions as u fx x v fy y the conditional distribution of y given x x can be derived as 8 f y x y p y y x x f x y x d f x x dx c u v u 9 f y x y f x y f x x c u v f x x f y y f x x c u v f y y where fx x and fy y denote the probability density function of random variables x and y respectively fy x y is the conditional probability distribution function and fy x y is relevant probability density function c u v is the copula function and c u v is corresponding probability density function fig 3 provides an example of predicting hydrological drought duration with the meteorological drought information using eqs 3 8 and 9 one can easily derive the conditional probability distribution of hydrological drought characteristics namely y given meteorological drought characteristics namely x fig 3a exhibits the bivariate conditional probability distribution contours between x and y it can be seen that for a given value of meteorological drought duration x0 the hydrological drought duration may be any value of 0 20 months but with different probabilities and the one with maximum probability is adopted as the predicted value fig 3a from fig 3b it is seen that the peak marked as the red star in fig 3b of the conditional probability density distribution curve red dashed line is exactly the value we want which could be derived from the first order partial derivative of the probability density function 10 d f y x y dy 0 the derived y in eq 10 is the predicted value corresponding to x0 in addition the upper and lower limits of predicted values for any confidence intervals can also be given through their conditional cumulative probability distribution blue solid line in fig 3b 3 5 framework the general flowchart of copula based drought probability analysis is presented in fig 4 the vic 3l simulations three dimensional drought characterization combined with the connection of meteorological and hydrological drought events corresponding to sections 3 1 3 3 all belonged to data processing part which provided the material for drought probability analysis with generated meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics the marginal distributions of drought duration area and severity for meteorological denoted as fd md fa ma and fs ms and hydrological fd hd fa ha and fs hs droughts respectively were derived first then five candidate copulas were employed to construct the bivariate and trivariate joint distributions of drought characteristics which included two scenarios i e the joint distribution of duration area and severity for either meteorological or hydrological drought e g bivariate case c fd md fa ma and trivariate case c fd hd fa ha fs hs and the cross dependencies between two drought types such as c fd md fd hd c fa ma fa ha and c fs ms fs hs drought risks were assessed by calculating the return periods of bivariate and trivariate cases for hydrological drought prediction the bivariate conditional joint distribution of duration area and severity between meteorological and hydrological drought were constructed given a value of meteorological drought characteristic e g duration 2 months the corresponding feature of hydrological drought was derived through the conditional joint distribution the predicted values were further compared with several commonly used methods e g the linear regression model and the exponential or power functions in addition the stability of the prediction network was assessed through two modeling scenarios in the first scenario only the calibration 1961 1999 period was employed to construct the conditional probability distribution for the second scenario information of the most severe drought event was excluded to build a new prediction model by comparing the predicted results of these two scenarios with observations the stability of the prediction model was evaluated 4 results 4 1 meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics following the three dimensional drought identification method described above a total of 320 meteorological and 348 hydrological drought events were detected during 1961 2012 fig 5 presents the evolution of four large meteorological and hydrological drought events in the time latitude longitude dimensions from where one can clearly see the dynamics of these drought events over time and space consider the meteorological drought that occurred during may 1965 july 1966 as an example fig 5a it initiated in a small drought area and with moderate severity and reached its peak in september november with an expanded area and enhanced drought severity then the drought magnitude attenuated gradually and terminated in july of the following year compared with lower subspaces the three dimensional perspective is more promising for portraying the real status of drought events table 1 further summarizes the decadal statistics of four main features of these events including the number of drought events duration area and severity for meteorological drought the number of drought events continuously increased from the 1960s to the 2000s implying aggravated drought frequencies in this region likewise the drought duration also exhibited a general increasing pattern in terms of decadal average statistics however for peak values the 1960s and the 1990s experienced longest droughts with the maximum persistent period reaching up to 17 months the drought area and severity generally exhibited a similar temporal variation as did duration in addition the number of durations longer than 3 months and area exceeding 50 more than half of yrb were under droughts were also analyzed among five decades the drought conditions in the 2000s seemed most severe which suffered 27 events longer than 3 months and 10 events with affected area exceeding 50 these indicated that there was a gradually drying tendency with enhanced magnitude from the 1960s to the 2000s for meteorological drought the hydrological drought showed a different pattern from meteorological drought according to the number of drought events the 2000s ranked as the highest occurrence decade with 85 drought events occurring during this period followed by the 1980s and the 1970s as for the statistics of duration area and severity the 1960s and the 1990s were considered as two most severe dry decades with peak values observed for all three features with respect to the number of drought events with duration longer than 3 months hydrological drought also exhibited a lengthening tendency with relevant statistics increasing from 19 in the 1960s to 27 in the 2000s however no significant difference was observed among these five decades in the case of statistics of drought area exceeding 50 4 2 return period analysis 4 2 1 selection of optimal marginal distribution and copula ten theoretical distributions were employed to fit the three features of meteorological and hydrological droughts by comparing the difference between empirical and estimated theoretical probabilities the best fit was selected when the minimum value of rmse was obtained as shown in fig 6 the gev logn log logistic and gp distributions generally performed well with corresponding rmses varying between 0 02 and 0 05 specifically the marginal distributions of duration area and severity for meteorological drought were best fitted by logn gev and gp distributions respectively as for hydrological drought the logn gev and loglogistic distributions were employed to fit the time series of duration area and severity with derived marginal distributions five candidate copulas were employed to establish the bivariate distributions of drought characteristics by considering three combination cases namely the joint distributions of duration area d a duration severity d s and area severity a s for meteorological and hydrological droughts respectively as for the triplet of duration area and severity denoted as d a s the direct application of archimedean copulas become difficult due to their severe restrictions on the pairwise mutual dependencies among marginals kao and govindaraju 2008 therefore only two meta elliptical student t and gaussian types were adopted to combine these three drought features table s1 lists the goodness of fit results for meteorological drought where the student t copula performed best for the joint behaviors of d a a s and d a s and d s was best modeled by the clayton copula for hydrological drought the joint distributions of d a and d a s were best fitted by the student t copula and the frank copula outperformed the other copulas in modeling the dependence structures of d s and a s table s2 4 2 2 return periods of identified drought events based on the selected copulas the return periods of identified meteorological and hydrological drought events were computed using eqs 2 5 fig 7 compares the return periods considering different drought features and a good agreement would be expected when scatters are close to the 1 1 line as shown in fig 7a for the univariate case meteorological drought the return periods derived from duration area and severity denoted as td ta and ts respectively were significantly different with scatters dramatically deviated from the 1 1 line specifically the return periods derived from drought area was overall underestimated compared to those of duration and severity this actually reflects one type of drought events with small area but long duration and the drought magnitude and risks would be greatly misjudged by ta similarly td may also underestimate the return periods of drought events with shorter duration but larger area in other words there exist considerable uncertainties for the return periods derived from one single drought characteristic the univariate case of hydrological drought generally followed an analogous pattern as the meteorological drought fig 7b for the bivariate case the difference among the joint return periods of tda tds and tas was significantly reduced indicating an improved agreement between these combined forms fig 7c d this suggests that a comprehensive consideration of multiple drought features would reduce the estimation error of drought risks to some extent fig 7e presents the trivariate return periods tads of identified meteorological and hydrological drought events by using the student t copula it can be seen that for the majority of meteorological and hydrological drought events the corresponding return periods were no more than 20 years with several extraordinary large values exceeding 50 years the hydrological drought on the whole exhibited higher drought risks than meteorological drought among these the hydrological drought event lasting from june 1998 to april 2001 was recognized as the top severe one corresponding return period exceeded 100 years while the most severe meteorological one occurred between august 1998 and january 2000 with return period of 70 years these were generally in accordance with previous studies in which the three consecutive years of droughts from 1998 to 2000 over yrb were reported liu et al 2016 4 3 probabilistic links based on conditional distribution due to the complicated impacts of climate variability and catchment control the response of hydrological system to meteorological drought tends to be nonlinear wong et al 2013 van loon 2015 therefore in this study a probabilistic approach was adopted to describe the link between the two drought types similar to the bivariate distributions of drought characteristics for one individual drought type in this section the copula based joint distribution method was applied to model the cross dependencies of duration area and severity between meteorological and hydrological droughts a preliminary work for constructing such a joint distribution is to acquire pairwise meteorological and hydrological drought events using the matching procedure described in section 3 3 a total of 99 pairs were produced then following eqs 8 10 the gumbel hougaard copula was employed to construct the conditional distribution of paired events in view of its satisfying performance the parameter of gumbel hougaard copula was also inferred using the mle method and the fitting results all passed the goodness of fit tests and were not shown consequently the likelihood of hydrological drought features under different meteorological initial situations was derived fig 8 provides an example of the conditional probability distribution of hydrological drought features given different meteorological drought characteristics here we use the quantile the original sequence was in ascending order to represent different severity levels of drought overall the three cases exhibited a similar pattern that with enhanced magnitude of meteorological drought the corresponding magnitude of hydrological drought also tended to be larger meanwhile the probability of the most likely value i e the peak of the conditional distribution curve was reduced this suggests that the occurrence of a meteorological drought event was more likely to trigger a subsequent hydrological drought event of analogous magnitude at the same time the uncertainty of predicted values may also arise accompanied with the boosted levels of drought severity fig 9 compares observed hydrological drought characteristics with estimated ones derived from three approaches i e the most probable values combined with the upper and lower limit of 90 prediction intervals grey shadings in fig 9 from the conditional distribution method the linear regression function and the exponential power duration was best fit by the exponential function and the power function for area and severity function among three methods the copula based conditional distribution method performed the best with the inferred hydrological drought characteristics most approaching the observed ones values of rmse for duration area and severity were 1 48 13 8 and 1 25 respectively as for the linear exponential and power functions they generally exhibited a good agreement with the observed values under the mild or moderate drought conditions in terms of severe or extreme situations the power law performed better than the linear method although both methods presented considerable deviations even their estimated values may exceed the boundary of the 90 prediction intervals of the copula based method in other words there existed much uncertainty for the two simplified statistical models in reality the severe or extreme drought status is more devastating than mild or moderate droughts therefore the conditional distribution method which provided more reliable probabilistic information is recommended to use 4 4 stability of the prediction framework as a statistical method one may concern how much difference would be produced if using different datasets e g different data lengths or the representativeness of the sample to construct the conditional distribution model as well as their influence on the estimated values given this two scenarios were simulated to evaluate the stability of the conditional distribution method in the first case drought characteristics during 1961 1999 were employed to establish the conditional distribution model then the model was applied to infer hydrological drought characteristics given observed meteorological drought characteristics during 2000 2012 with the parameters of calibrated copulas unchanged in the second case the most severe meteorological and hydrological drought events were excluded to construct the conditional distribution model which aimed to test the sensitivity of the established model to major drought events likewise the linear regression and power exponential function for duration functions followed the same treatment as the conditional distribution method fig 10 presents the performances of three statistical approaches in estimating hydrological drought characteristics under two scenarios it can be seen that among three statistical approaches both scenarios revealed that the conditional distribution method performed best in modeling all three hydrological drought features with the inferred values namely the most probable values most close to the observed ones taking the case of drought duration as an example values of rmse under scenario 1 were 1 57 1 79 and 1 67 for the conditional distribution method linear regression and exponential function respectively and 2 19 3 16 and 2 45 under scenario 2 for two reference methods they generally performed well for the mild moderate drought status but again underestimated overestimated all three hydrological drought characteristics under extreme drought conditions similar to fig 9 in addition for the performance of two scenarios all three estimation methods revealed that case 2 exhibited larger estimation errors i e larger values of rmse than those of case 1 this suggests that compared to the length of data sample the incorporation of typical mega drought events with long persistence and wide spatial extent is more important for reliable drought prediction 5 discussion and conclusions meteorological and hydrological droughts are inherently related and investigating their links has great significance for reliable drought monitoring assessment and prediction in view of relevant literatures the relationship between these two drought types was mostly demonstrated in lower subspaces which neglected their spatiotemporal connections simultaneously e g wong et al 2013 van loon and laaha 2015 barker et al 2016 from a new perspective this study attempted to explore and re establish the cross dependencies between meteorological and hydrological droughts in time latitude longitude spaces this was implemented by introducing a three dimensional drought identification method developed by andreadis et al 2005 and lloyd hughes 2012 which allowed to provide a stereoscopic display of the dynamics of drought events over time and space as in fig 5 several previous studies such as sheffield et al 2009 wang et al 2011 xu et al 2015a b and herrera estrada et al 2017 at global or regional scales applied this identification procedure for characterizing one individual drought type but was rarely used for two or more drought types in this study we further extended this three dimensional scheme to match meteorological and hydrological drought events similar to the original procedure when linking drought events of two different types both their temporal and spatial interactions should be considered as in fig 2 accordingly cases for such a higher dimensional link become more complicated e g one meteorological drought event with wide spatial extent causes several minor hydrological ones in different areas or several minor meteorological drought events jointly promote the development of one hydrological drought event etc comparing to lower subspaces the three dimensional perspective enables to provide comprehensive and intricate links between meteorological and hydrological droughts over time and space which are more close to the reality another key point of this study is to use copulas to depict the relationship between pairwise meteorological and hydrological drought events similar to wong et al 2013 and hao et al 2016 the conditional probability distribution function was adopted for constructing the dependence structure moreover we explored the potential of using this probabilistic network for hydrological drought prediction from fig 3 we know that for a given meteorological drought feature a set of hydrological drought characteristics with different probabilities could be predicted from their conditional distribution on this basis a general formula for calculating the most probable predicted value the one with maximum probability is given i e the derivative of the bivariate conditional probability density function eq 10 this finding is not limited to one specific copula type but can be applied to any bivariate conditional probability density function like other statistical models the overall performance of this copula based approach also relies on the representativeness of data samples since droughts are extreme phenomenon the incorporation of typical mega drought events to construct the model is a premise for reliable prediction of hydrological drought features generally the contribution of this study is twofold 1 the three dimensional drought identification method was introduced to establish links between meteorological and hydrological droughts and 2 from a probabilistic aspect a copula based conditional distribution method was proposed for depicting the cross dependencies between two drought types as well as for quantitative hydrological prediction results show that there is an overall drying trend towards longer persistence and larger spatial extent both for meteorological and hydrological droughts according to the three dimensional drought characterization results the trivariate joint distribution of duration area and severity suggests that the most severe meteorological and hydrological droughts over yrb occurred around 1998 2000 with relevant return periods exceeding 50 years the copula based conditional probability distribution method performed well in describing the nonlinear relationship between the two drought types given the information of meteorological drought reliable prediction of hydrological drought can be provided by this probabilistic approach when adequate data samples are employed this study has implications for understanding the nexus between meteorological and hydrological droughts in high dimensions future researches for better understanding drought mechanisms and introducing more sophisticated models for improving hydrological drought prediction are needed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

editor in chief meteorological and hydrological droughts are inherently correlated but with a time lag a prolonged precipitation deficiency propagates to surface water bodies and may give rise to hydrological drought in the subsequent time period establishing links between these two drought types is of great significance for water resources planning and for developing drought resistant measures this study proposes a copula based method employing conditional probability distribution to depict the structure of dependence between the characteristics of meteorological and hydrological droughts the time series of grid based standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and standardized runoff index sri were derived from the simulations of the variable infiltration capacity vic model over the yellow river basin yrb during 1961 2012 then using a three dimensional time latitude longitude drought identification method three drought characteristics including duration area and severity were extracted for meteorological and hydrological droughts for analyzing drought characteristics return periods and connection between meteorological and hydrological droughts a probabilistic framework using the copula function was developed results showed that there was a general drying tendency both for meteorological and hydrological droughts with longer duration and larger spatial extent according to the trivariate joint distribution of duration area and severity the most severe meteorological and hydrological droughts over the yrb occurred around 1998 2000 with return periods exceeding 50 years in terms of establishing the dependence between characteristics of meteorological and hydrological droughts traditional statistical models like the linear exponential and power functions presented significant deviations especially for severe or extreme drought conditions in contrast the copula based conditional distribution method provided a satisfactorily probabilistic prediction of hydrological drought characteristics given the information of meteorological drought characteristics the stability test suggested compared to the length of data sample the incorporation of typical major drought events with long persistence and wide spatial extent is more important for reliable drought prediction keywords meteorological drought hydrological drought probabilistic link copula conditional distribution 1 introduction drought is widely recognized as a complex and multifaceted phenomenon hao and singh 2015 konapala and mishra 2017 it originates from the precipitation deficit over a prolonged time period and broad spatial extent and may also cause substantial impacts on the hydrological system ecological environment and human community van loon 2015 liu et al 2017 according to the usage of water drought is generally categorized into four types i e the meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic wilhite and glantz 1985 mishra and singh 2010 to facilitate drought management and reduce damages it is essential to characterize the properties of different drought types as well as to establish their causative links drought is typically characterized by several features such as the duration depicting the persistent period which also contains information of the initial and termination time of a drought event area indicating the spatial coverage and severity which reflects the overall magnitude of a dry event sheffield and wood 2007 this suggests that drought characterization should essentially be a spatiotemporal issue having the time latitude longitude dimensions lloyd hughes 2012 previous studies mostly reduced drought analysis into lower subspaces for instance analyzing the time series of drought indices for individual sites or area averaged hydro meteorological variables or investigating the spatial pattern of drought for a specific time period mishra and singh 2011 such treatments ignored the evolution of drought over time and space simultaneously herrera estrada et al 2017 to address this issue andreadis et al 2005 introduced a clustering algorithm and proposed the severity area duration sad curves which allowed tracking the spatiotemporal variations of droughts along with their duration lloyd hughes 2012 modified and extended this algorithm to three dimensions this three dimensional approach has been applied for characterizing meteorological and soil moisture agricultural droughts at regional or global scales e g sheffield et al 2009 wang et al 2011 xu et al 2015a b haslinger and blöschl 2017 but rarely for hydrological drought to develop an understanding of the drought mechanism statistical models such as the linear regression and markov chains were employed to analyze relationships among different drought types e g sharma and panu 2012 zhu et al 2016 huang et al 2017 given the flexibility in combing multiple drought related variables recent years have witnessed a popularity of the copula function for probabilistic drought analysis common ways of using copulas included constructing the joint distribution of multiple drought related variables development of comprehensive drought indices and drought risk assessments based on return periods ma et al 2013 aghakouchak 2015 liu et al 2019 from a prediction perspective several studies explored the potential of using copula based conditional distribution to link meteorological and hydrological droughts for instance the properties of hydrological drought such as duration and severity can be derived from those of the preceding meteorological drought features by establishing their cross dependence model e g wong et al 2013 wetterhall et al 2015 hao et al 2016 predicted 2 month time series of hydrological drought by incorporating both the persistence of hydrological drought and its antecedent meteorological drought condition with the meta gaussian copula since the response of hydrological process to atmospheric conditions essentially is a nonlinear probabilistic issue the copula could be served as a powerful tool to characterize the temporal and spatial dependences between meteorological and hydrological droughts given this this study further extended the application of copulas from lower subspaces to three dimensions to explore the characteristics of drought propagation process the present study therefore aimed at developing a probabilistic method to construct links between the characteristics of meteorological drought and those of hydrological drought and evaluating the stability of the proposed method for hydrological drought prediction specifically a three dimensional drought characterization approach was employed to extract the duration area and severity of meteorological and hydrological droughts then a copula function was employed to derive joint distributions of drought characteristics of the two drought types the predictive information of hydrological drought characteristics was acquired through the conditional probabilistic distribution of a given meteorological drought characteristic finally two scenarios incorporating different data samples were employed to construct the conditional distribution and their predictive results were assessed to examine the stability of the conditional probabilistic approach the reminder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a brief description of the study area and data used in this study in section 3 a detailed description of the methods including hydrological model simulation drought characterization and the copula based prediction model is presented section 4 deals with the characterization of meteorological and hydrological droughts their return periods and the performance and stability of the proposed probabilistic model for hydrological drought prediction conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 study area and data the yellow river basin yrb ranked as the second largest river basin in china was selected for this study fig 1 with a drainage area of 795 000 km2 the river flows through nine provinces and spans over four climate zones i e arid semiarid semihumid and humid zones from northwest to southeast influenced by atmospheric circulation and monsoon climate yrb presents significant seasonal differences where summer is generally rainy and hot and winter is dry and cold hydro meteorological data used for meteorological and hydrological drought characterization included daily observations 1961 2012 from 101 national meteorological stations and 10 streamflow stations situated in the upper middle and downstream parts of yrb see fig 1 for geographic distribution besides the geographical information required for hydrological modeling was also collected elevation images with a 3 arc second about 90 m spatial resolution were retrieved from the shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model http srtm csi cgiar org land cover images and vegetation characteristics were derived from the university of maryland s 1 km global land cover production hansen et al 2000 and soil data with a 30 arc second about 1 km spatial resolution was collected from the 5 min food and agriculture organization dataset allen et al 1998 3 methodology the methods employed in this study are described in five sections section 3 1 discusses the implementation of the vic model over yrb and the treatment of model outputs for drought indices computation section 3 2 describes how meteorological and hydrological droughts were characterized with drought indices in the three dimensional space section 3 3 introduces the procedure for linking meteorological and hydrological drought events section 3 4 discusses the algorithm of copula function for establishing the cross dependencies between the characteristics of meteorological and hydrological drought combined with its conditional distribution for drought prediction finally a general flowchart of the study is presented in section 3 5 3 1 hydrological simulation and computation of drought indices the physically based macroscale variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 with extensive applications for drought assessments at regional and global scales e g sheffield et al 2009 xia et al 2014 was employed for hydrological simulation specially the basin was divided into 1500 grids at a spatial resolution of 0 25 and at each grid scale vic was run at a time step of 24 h to simulate the land surface water and energy balances the model was calibrated during 1961 1990 and validated during 1991 2012 through two evaluation criteria nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce and bias see liu et al 2015 for detail simulation results showed that the absolute values of nsce varied between 0 68 and 0 94 and bias ranged from 0 3 to 10 8 indicating the calibrated model was generally capable to capture the variability of hydro graph in yrb fig s1 the generated grid based hydrological variables were further used for calculating drought indices specifically the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and the standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 were employed to indicate meteorological and hydrological droughts respectively similar to the mathematical algorithm of the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 calculating spei and sri also involves two sections cumulative treatment of moisture deficit in any predetermined time period e g 1 24 months and standardizing the indices to make them comparable over time and space in this study both spei and sri were accumulated at a 3 month time scale 3 2 characterization of drought events the three dimensional i e time latitude longitude identification method developed by andreadis et al 2005 and lloyd hughes 2012 was employed for characterizing meteorological and hydrological droughts the algorithm generally contains two separate parts namely spatial clustering and temporal connection for each month a grid with an spei sri below a predetermined value 1 in this study is considered as drought with a 3 3 spatial filter the drought grids are further merged into one drought patch or split into different groups smaller clusters no more than the minimum area threshold are filtered out which no longer participate in the following calculation the remaining clusters are viewed as individual drought patches for the current month then a temporal linkage is implemented for drought patches in two adjacent months when their overlapping area exceeds a predefined minimum area threshold a detailed illustration of this approach is referred to andreadis et al 2005 and lloyd hughes 2012 obviously this threshold plays an important role in characterizing drought events because an inappropriate setting would result in either overestimation or underestimation of drought conditions e g drought patches with tenuous connectivity would be incorrectly combined with a smaller threshold or related patches would be separated as independent events with a larger threshold wang et al 2011 made a sensitivity test and suggested a minimum threshold of 150 000 km2 equivalent to 1 5 of the study area for whole china xu et al 2015a b used a similar criterion for analyzing droughts in non arid regions of china in this study the same threshold standard namely an area of 20 pixels approximately 1 5 of the yrb area was employed as the minimum area threshold in three dimensions drought duration d is related to the status of all incorporated drought grids within the drought event which represents the temporal span between the earliest initiation time and the latest termination time of related drought grids the total drought area a of a drought event represents the union of affected areal extent in each month 1 a a r e a 1 a r e a i a r e a n where n represents the duration period of a drought event area i represents the identified drought areal extent in month i which is variable with time drought severity s reflects the total water deficit accumulated over the whole drought duration and areal extent and is expressed as 2 s i 1 n j 1 area i s ij where s i j represents the drought severity for the ith month i 1 2 10 and the jth grid j 1 2 area i 3 3 linking meteorological and hydrological drought events the links between meteorological and hydrological drought events were established based on the properties of their duration and area extracted from the three dimensional space fig 2 presents a sketch describing how these two drought types are connected different from lower dimensions such as the right panel of fig 2 where only the temporal overlap is considered a strong link in the three dimensions latitude longitude time would be recognized when both temporal and spatial intersections are satisfied for the sake of convenience the status of one meteorological and one hydrological drought event during a certain time period was simplified as a rectangle and ellipse respectively with their drought area varying along the timeline left panel in fig 2 it can be seen that the no 1 meteorological drought is initiated earlier than the hydrological drought then in the following evolution stages t2 t4 these two events spatiotemporally overlap which constitutes a connection with the termination of no 1 meteorological drought event the magnitude of hydrological drought may attenuate e g reduced drought area gradually but would also step into a new developing stage affected by another meteorological drought event such as the case of no 2 meteorological drought in fig 2 this gives a simplified example when two meteorological drought events jointly trigger one hydrological drought event in reality the relationship between two drought types would be more complex e g one large meteorological drought event induces several hydrological droughts in different regions or a couple of meteorological drought events successively trigger several hydrological drought events similar to the three dimensional drought identification method the overlapping of duration and drought area is employed to judge whether a link exists between meteorological and hydrological drought events spatially their overlapping area such as the shading parts in fig 2 should no smaller than 20 grids which is in accordance with the threshold in the three dimensional drought identification approach section 3 2 as for the temporal case a non null overlap of duration is the premise for a successful temporal connection between meteorological and hydrological drought events for some unusual cases when hydrological droughts occur earlier than meteorological droughts an additional constraint is needed to avoid misjudgments when meteorological and hydrological droughts are temporally overlapped by coincidence for our study there were 14 such cases we summarized the statistics of their duration and found one third of the minimum duration of related meteorological and hydrological drought events e g minimum t2 t11 t7 t10 in fig 2 was the most suitable value this variable form of threshold enabled to consider the temporal links under different conditions for instance 1 month overlap is reasonable for meteorological and hydrological droughts in short duration no more than 3 months however for events with longer persistence e g 9 months or more this threshold value seems insufficient to filter strongly linked meteorological and hydrological drought events and a larger threshold value is more suitable like other empirical parameters application of this temporal overlapping threshold for other regions needs to be tested before using it directly 3 4 copula based probability analysis this section provides a detailed illustration on how copula function is used for constructing the probabilistic links and for drought prediction to this end the joint distribution of meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics is first established this can be further used to assess drought risks by computing the bivariate or trivariate return periods of drought events on this basis the conditional probability distribution derived from the joint probability distribution can be constructed to model the dependence between predictand and predictors 3 4 1 joint distribution based on copulas the joint distribution provides an effective way to characterize the multi faceted properties of droughts among various approaches copulas are most often used due to their flexibility to model the dependence structure among random variables regardless of their marginals according to sklar s theorem for n dimensional continuous random variables x1 x2 xn there always exists an n copula which could combine n univariate marginal distributions f1 x1 f2 x2 fn xn into a joint distribution function h 3 h x 1 x 2 x n c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n where h represents the joint distribution of random variables c is the copula function satisfying 0 1 n 0 1 fi xi denotes the marginal distribution constructing such a copula based joint distribution mainly involves two steps one refers to fitting the marginal distributions of random variables and the other is to estimate the copula function c to model the dependence structure among variables in this study 10 theoretical distributions including exponential exp gamma gam gaussian log normal logn uniform logistic log log logistic weibull wbl general extreme value gev and generalized pareto gpa were employed to fit the univariate probability distributions of each drought characteristic five copulas including two meta elliptical student t and gaussian types and three archimedean clayton frank and gumbel hougaard were employed to construct the joint probability distribution function parameters of univariate marginal distribution and copula function were both estimated by the method of maximum likelihood estimation mle and their fitting results were assessed with the goodness of fit statistics including root mean square error rmse kolmogorov smirnov test k s at the 5 significance level akaike and bayesian information criteria test aic and bic detailed description of these statistical test methods is referred to zhang 2005 3 4 2 return period the return period is defined as the average time elapsing between two successive realizations of the given event which can be calculated as the inverse of exceedance probability salvadori and de michele 2010 for drought analysis return period is commonly related to the probability of one certain drought feature e g duration severity and area or their combination such as duration severity or duration severity area exceeding a specific value salvadori et al 2011 for a random variable x the return period can be expressed as 4 t x e l p x x e l 1 p x x where e l is the expectation of time intervals of drought events p x x is the cdf value of a given value x this univariate case can be further extended to calculate the joint return period when considering multiple drought characteristics for mutually independent ramdom variables x and y the bivariate form of return period can be expressed as xu et al 2015a b 5 t xy e l p x x y y e l 1 f x x f y y c xy f x x f y y where cxy is the copula function describing the joint distribution of random variables x and y similarly for the case of three random variables x y and z 6 p x x y y z z 1 f x x f y y f z z c xy f x x f y y c xz f x x f z z c yz f y y f z z c xyz f x x f y y f z z 7 t xyz e l p x x y y z z where cxyz is the copula function for constructing the joint distribution of random variables x y and z 3 4 3 conditional probability distribution and drought prediction one appealing application of the conditional distribution is for probabilistic drought prediction by establishing the nonlinear dependence between the predictand and predictors hao et al 2018 here we give the general form of bivariate conditional distribution let x and y be random variables with marginal distributions as u fx x v fy y the conditional distribution of y given x x can be derived as 8 f y x y p y y x x f x y x d f x x dx c u v u 9 f y x y f x y f x x c u v f x x f y y f x x c u v f y y where fx x and fy y denote the probability density function of random variables x and y respectively fy x y is the conditional probability distribution function and fy x y is relevant probability density function c u v is the copula function and c u v is corresponding probability density function fig 3 provides an example of predicting hydrological drought duration with the meteorological drought information using eqs 3 8 and 9 one can easily derive the conditional probability distribution of hydrological drought characteristics namely y given meteorological drought characteristics namely x fig 3a exhibits the bivariate conditional probability distribution contours between x and y it can be seen that for a given value of meteorological drought duration x0 the hydrological drought duration may be any value of 0 20 months but with different probabilities and the one with maximum probability is adopted as the predicted value fig 3a from fig 3b it is seen that the peak marked as the red star in fig 3b of the conditional probability density distribution curve red dashed line is exactly the value we want which could be derived from the first order partial derivative of the probability density function 10 d f y x y dy 0 the derived y in eq 10 is the predicted value corresponding to x0 in addition the upper and lower limits of predicted values for any confidence intervals can also be given through their conditional cumulative probability distribution blue solid line in fig 3b 3 5 framework the general flowchart of copula based drought probability analysis is presented in fig 4 the vic 3l simulations three dimensional drought characterization combined with the connection of meteorological and hydrological drought events corresponding to sections 3 1 3 3 all belonged to data processing part which provided the material for drought probability analysis with generated meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics the marginal distributions of drought duration area and severity for meteorological denoted as fd md fa ma and fs ms and hydrological fd hd fa ha and fs hs droughts respectively were derived first then five candidate copulas were employed to construct the bivariate and trivariate joint distributions of drought characteristics which included two scenarios i e the joint distribution of duration area and severity for either meteorological or hydrological drought e g bivariate case c fd md fa ma and trivariate case c fd hd fa ha fs hs and the cross dependencies between two drought types such as c fd md fd hd c fa ma fa ha and c fs ms fs hs drought risks were assessed by calculating the return periods of bivariate and trivariate cases for hydrological drought prediction the bivariate conditional joint distribution of duration area and severity between meteorological and hydrological drought were constructed given a value of meteorological drought characteristic e g duration 2 months the corresponding feature of hydrological drought was derived through the conditional joint distribution the predicted values were further compared with several commonly used methods e g the linear regression model and the exponential or power functions in addition the stability of the prediction network was assessed through two modeling scenarios in the first scenario only the calibration 1961 1999 period was employed to construct the conditional probability distribution for the second scenario information of the most severe drought event was excluded to build a new prediction model by comparing the predicted results of these two scenarios with observations the stability of the prediction model was evaluated 4 results 4 1 meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics following the three dimensional drought identification method described above a total of 320 meteorological and 348 hydrological drought events were detected during 1961 2012 fig 5 presents the evolution of four large meteorological and hydrological drought events in the time latitude longitude dimensions from where one can clearly see the dynamics of these drought events over time and space consider the meteorological drought that occurred during may 1965 july 1966 as an example fig 5a it initiated in a small drought area and with moderate severity and reached its peak in september november with an expanded area and enhanced drought severity then the drought magnitude attenuated gradually and terminated in july of the following year compared with lower subspaces the three dimensional perspective is more promising for portraying the real status of drought events table 1 further summarizes the decadal statistics of four main features of these events including the number of drought events duration area and severity for meteorological drought the number of drought events continuously increased from the 1960s to the 2000s implying aggravated drought frequencies in this region likewise the drought duration also exhibited a general increasing pattern in terms of decadal average statistics however for peak values the 1960s and the 1990s experienced longest droughts with the maximum persistent period reaching up to 17 months the drought area and severity generally exhibited a similar temporal variation as did duration in addition the number of durations longer than 3 months and area exceeding 50 more than half of yrb were under droughts were also analyzed among five decades the drought conditions in the 2000s seemed most severe which suffered 27 events longer than 3 months and 10 events with affected area exceeding 50 these indicated that there was a gradually drying tendency with enhanced magnitude from the 1960s to the 2000s for meteorological drought the hydrological drought showed a different pattern from meteorological drought according to the number of drought events the 2000s ranked as the highest occurrence decade with 85 drought events occurring during this period followed by the 1980s and the 1970s as for the statistics of duration area and severity the 1960s and the 1990s were considered as two most severe dry decades with peak values observed for all three features with respect to the number of drought events with duration longer than 3 months hydrological drought also exhibited a lengthening tendency with relevant statistics increasing from 19 in the 1960s to 27 in the 2000s however no significant difference was observed among these five decades in the case of statistics of drought area exceeding 50 4 2 return period analysis 4 2 1 selection of optimal marginal distribution and copula ten theoretical distributions were employed to fit the three features of meteorological and hydrological droughts by comparing the difference between empirical and estimated theoretical probabilities the best fit was selected when the minimum value of rmse was obtained as shown in fig 6 the gev logn log logistic and gp distributions generally performed well with corresponding rmses varying between 0 02 and 0 05 specifically the marginal distributions of duration area and severity for meteorological drought were best fitted by logn gev and gp distributions respectively as for hydrological drought the logn gev and loglogistic distributions were employed to fit the time series of duration area and severity with derived marginal distributions five candidate copulas were employed to establish the bivariate distributions of drought characteristics by considering three combination cases namely the joint distributions of duration area d a duration severity d s and area severity a s for meteorological and hydrological droughts respectively as for the triplet of duration area and severity denoted as d a s the direct application of archimedean copulas become difficult due to their severe restrictions on the pairwise mutual dependencies among marginals kao and govindaraju 2008 therefore only two meta elliptical student t and gaussian types were adopted to combine these three drought features table s1 lists the goodness of fit results for meteorological drought where the student t copula performed best for the joint behaviors of d a a s and d a s and d s was best modeled by the clayton copula for hydrological drought the joint distributions of d a and d a s were best fitted by the student t copula and the frank copula outperformed the other copulas in modeling the dependence structures of d s and a s table s2 4 2 2 return periods of identified drought events based on the selected copulas the return periods of identified meteorological and hydrological drought events were computed using eqs 2 5 fig 7 compares the return periods considering different drought features and a good agreement would be expected when scatters are close to the 1 1 line as shown in fig 7a for the univariate case meteorological drought the return periods derived from duration area and severity denoted as td ta and ts respectively were significantly different with scatters dramatically deviated from the 1 1 line specifically the return periods derived from drought area was overall underestimated compared to those of duration and severity this actually reflects one type of drought events with small area but long duration and the drought magnitude and risks would be greatly misjudged by ta similarly td may also underestimate the return periods of drought events with shorter duration but larger area in other words there exist considerable uncertainties for the return periods derived from one single drought characteristic the univariate case of hydrological drought generally followed an analogous pattern as the meteorological drought fig 7b for the bivariate case the difference among the joint return periods of tda tds and tas was significantly reduced indicating an improved agreement between these combined forms fig 7c d this suggests that a comprehensive consideration of multiple drought features would reduce the estimation error of drought risks to some extent fig 7e presents the trivariate return periods tads of identified meteorological and hydrological drought events by using the student t copula it can be seen that for the majority of meteorological and hydrological drought events the corresponding return periods were no more than 20 years with several extraordinary large values exceeding 50 years the hydrological drought on the whole exhibited higher drought risks than meteorological drought among these the hydrological drought event lasting from june 1998 to april 2001 was recognized as the top severe one corresponding return period exceeded 100 years while the most severe meteorological one occurred between august 1998 and january 2000 with return period of 70 years these were generally in accordance with previous studies in which the three consecutive years of droughts from 1998 to 2000 over yrb were reported liu et al 2016 4 3 probabilistic links based on conditional distribution due to the complicated impacts of climate variability and catchment control the response of hydrological system to meteorological drought tends to be nonlinear wong et al 2013 van loon 2015 therefore in this study a probabilistic approach was adopted to describe the link between the two drought types similar to the bivariate distributions of drought characteristics for one individual drought type in this section the copula based joint distribution method was applied to model the cross dependencies of duration area and severity between meteorological and hydrological droughts a preliminary work for constructing such a joint distribution is to acquire pairwise meteorological and hydrological drought events using the matching procedure described in section 3 3 a total of 99 pairs were produced then following eqs 8 10 the gumbel hougaard copula was employed to construct the conditional distribution of paired events in view of its satisfying performance the parameter of gumbel hougaard copula was also inferred using the mle method and the fitting results all passed the goodness of fit tests and were not shown consequently the likelihood of hydrological drought features under different meteorological initial situations was derived fig 8 provides an example of the conditional probability distribution of hydrological drought features given different meteorological drought characteristics here we use the quantile the original sequence was in ascending order to represent different severity levels of drought overall the three cases exhibited a similar pattern that with enhanced magnitude of meteorological drought the corresponding magnitude of hydrological drought also tended to be larger meanwhile the probability of the most likely value i e the peak of the conditional distribution curve was reduced this suggests that the occurrence of a meteorological drought event was more likely to trigger a subsequent hydrological drought event of analogous magnitude at the same time the uncertainty of predicted values may also arise accompanied with the boosted levels of drought severity fig 9 compares observed hydrological drought characteristics with estimated ones derived from three approaches i e the most probable values combined with the upper and lower limit of 90 prediction intervals grey shadings in fig 9 from the conditional distribution method the linear regression function and the exponential power duration was best fit by the exponential function and the power function for area and severity function among three methods the copula based conditional distribution method performed the best with the inferred hydrological drought characteristics most approaching the observed ones values of rmse for duration area and severity were 1 48 13 8 and 1 25 respectively as for the linear exponential and power functions they generally exhibited a good agreement with the observed values under the mild or moderate drought conditions in terms of severe or extreme situations the power law performed better than the linear method although both methods presented considerable deviations even their estimated values may exceed the boundary of the 90 prediction intervals of the copula based method in other words there existed much uncertainty for the two simplified statistical models in reality the severe or extreme drought status is more devastating than mild or moderate droughts therefore the conditional distribution method which provided more reliable probabilistic information is recommended to use 4 4 stability of the prediction framework as a statistical method one may concern how much difference would be produced if using different datasets e g different data lengths or the representativeness of the sample to construct the conditional distribution model as well as their influence on the estimated values given this two scenarios were simulated to evaluate the stability of the conditional distribution method in the first case drought characteristics during 1961 1999 were employed to establish the conditional distribution model then the model was applied to infer hydrological drought characteristics given observed meteorological drought characteristics during 2000 2012 with the parameters of calibrated copulas unchanged in the second case the most severe meteorological and hydrological drought events were excluded to construct the conditional distribution model which aimed to test the sensitivity of the established model to major drought events likewise the linear regression and power exponential function for duration functions followed the same treatment as the conditional distribution method fig 10 presents the performances of three statistical approaches in estimating hydrological drought characteristics under two scenarios it can be seen that among three statistical approaches both scenarios revealed that the conditional distribution method performed best in modeling all three hydrological drought features with the inferred values namely the most probable values most close to the observed ones taking the case of drought duration as an example values of rmse under scenario 1 were 1 57 1 79 and 1 67 for the conditional distribution method linear regression and exponential function respectively and 2 19 3 16 and 2 45 under scenario 2 for two reference methods they generally performed well for the mild moderate drought status but again underestimated overestimated all three hydrological drought characteristics under extreme drought conditions similar to fig 9 in addition for the performance of two scenarios all three estimation methods revealed that case 2 exhibited larger estimation errors i e larger values of rmse than those of case 1 this suggests that compared to the length of data sample the incorporation of typical mega drought events with long persistence and wide spatial extent is more important for reliable drought prediction 5 discussion and conclusions meteorological and hydrological droughts are inherently related and investigating their links has great significance for reliable drought monitoring assessment and prediction in view of relevant literatures the relationship between these two drought types was mostly demonstrated in lower subspaces which neglected their spatiotemporal connections simultaneously e g wong et al 2013 van loon and laaha 2015 barker et al 2016 from a new perspective this study attempted to explore and re establish the cross dependencies between meteorological and hydrological droughts in time latitude longitude spaces this was implemented by introducing a three dimensional drought identification method developed by andreadis et al 2005 and lloyd hughes 2012 which allowed to provide a stereoscopic display of the dynamics of drought events over time and space as in fig 5 several previous studies such as sheffield et al 2009 wang et al 2011 xu et al 2015a b and herrera estrada et al 2017 at global or regional scales applied this identification procedure for characterizing one individual drought type but was rarely used for two or more drought types in this study we further extended this three dimensional scheme to match meteorological and hydrological drought events similar to the original procedure when linking drought events of two different types both their temporal and spatial interactions should be considered as in fig 2 accordingly cases for such a higher dimensional link become more complicated e g one meteorological drought event with wide spatial extent causes several minor hydrological ones in different areas or several minor meteorological drought events jointly promote the development of one hydrological drought event etc comparing to lower subspaces the three dimensional perspective enables to provide comprehensive and intricate links between meteorological and hydrological droughts over time and space which are more close to the reality another key point of this study is to use copulas to depict the relationship between pairwise meteorological and hydrological drought events similar to wong et al 2013 and hao et al 2016 the conditional probability distribution function was adopted for constructing the dependence structure moreover we explored the potential of using this probabilistic network for hydrological drought prediction from fig 3 we know that for a given meteorological drought feature a set of hydrological drought characteristics with different probabilities could be predicted from their conditional distribution on this basis a general formula for calculating the most probable predicted value the one with maximum probability is given i e the derivative of the bivariate conditional probability density function eq 10 this finding is not limited to one specific copula type but can be applied to any bivariate conditional probability density function like other statistical models the overall performance of this copula based approach also relies on the representativeness of data samples since droughts are extreme phenomenon the incorporation of typical mega drought events to construct the model is a premise for reliable prediction of hydrological drought features generally the contribution of this study is twofold 1 the three dimensional drought identification method was introduced to establish links between meteorological and hydrological droughts and 2 from a probabilistic aspect a copula based conditional distribution method was proposed for depicting the cross dependencies between two drought types as well as for quantitative hydrological prediction results show that there is an overall drying trend towards longer persistence and larger spatial extent both for meteorological and hydrological droughts according to the three dimensional drought characterization results the trivariate joint distribution of duration area and severity suggests that the most severe meteorological and hydrological droughts over yrb occurred around 1998 2000 with relevant return periods exceeding 50 years the copula based conditional probability distribution method performed well in describing the nonlinear relationship between the two drought types given the information of meteorological drought reliable prediction of hydrological drought can be provided by this probabilistic approach when adequate data samples are employed this study has implications for understanding the nexus between meteorological and hydrological droughts in high dimensions future researches for better understanding drought mechanisms and introducing more sophisticated models for improving hydrological drought prediction are needed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

6114,a general analytical model for the problem of variable discharge of groundwater from a well in an anisotropic two layered aquifer system is developed by taking account of the interface flow between the two layers the well of infinitesimal radius partially penetrates the lower layer and is pumped at a variable discharge the horizontal as well as vertical flows in both layers are included and importantly the effects of constant head case 1 and no flux case 2 boundaries at the top of the upper layer are considered laplace domain solutions for drawdown in dimensionless form are derived with the help of hankel transform and are inverted to the time domain numerically the drawdown characteristics induced by an exponentially decayed rate of pumping are discussed and sensitivity analysis is also performed to explore the influence of different parameters on drawdown characteristics the results show that the drawdown around a partially penetrating well in the lower pumped layer induced by an exponential decreasing pumping rate usually contains three stages the effect of anisotropy and well configuration have great influences on the drawdown distribution near the pumping well and the horizontal flow and storativity of the upper unpumped layer cannot be ignored in determining the upper aquifer drawdown the sensitivity analysis also illustrates that the dimensionless drawdown in the lower pumped layer is very sensitive to well configuration parameters all the time it is only sensitive to the hydraulic parameters of the lower aquifer for case 1 and to the hydraulic parameters of the lower layer and the specific storage of the upper layer at late times the dimensionless drawdown of the upper layer is not sensitive to the variable well discharge parameters over the whole pumping period and is not sensitive to the storage parameters of both layers for case 1 however the drawdown in the upper layer is sensitive to all the hydraulic parameters and well configuration parameters for case 2 at late times keywords two layer system anisotropic well partial penetration variable pumping rate sensitivity analysis 1 introduction most groundwater flow theories involving pumping wells assume constant well discharges for the sake of simplicity under actual field conditions however the well discharge is rarely been constant because of a variety of reasons such as technical issues for maintaining constant discharges well head losses temporal power loss or other reasons hantush 1964a b sen and altunkaynak 2004 singh 2009 yeh and chang 2013 the variable pumping rate test performed in confined aquifers can be found in a number of studies such as abu zied and scott 1963 abu zied et al 1964 hantush 1964a b lai et al 1973 black and kipp 1981 butler and mcelwee 1990 sen and altunkaynak 2004 singh 2004 2009 mishra et al 2013 wen et al 2017 and li et al 2018 it is however common that one aquifer may have the hydraulic connection with adjacent layers in nature for pioneering work of non steady transient flow in layered or leaky confined aquifers hantush and jacob 1955 treated the leakage as a volumetric source sink term incorporated into the governing flow equation termed hantush jacob approximation hereinafter and obtained an analytical solution for flow to a fully penetrating well pumped at constant rate in a leaky confined aquifer the hantush jacob approximation is simple and is used in practice under the condition of a fully penetrating well or a relatively thin aquitard e g hantush 1959 1964a b neuman and witherspoon 1968 1969 hantush 1967a moench 1985 hunt and scott 2007 but the method fails to recognize the actual process of leakage in nature and may cause sizable error especially for a partially penetrating pumping well and a relatively thick aquitard hantush 1967a yeh and chang 2013 hantush 1967a developed the transient drawdown solution induced by a partially penetrating well with a constant discharge in an aquitard aquifer system in which the flow exchange between the upper aquitard and the lower pumped aquifer was regarded as a boundary condition the leakage treatments presented by hantush 1967a has been widely adopted subsequently for layered or leaky confined aquifers such as javandel and witherspoon 1980 1983 hunt 2005 bakker 2006 perina and lee 2006 malama 2007 2008 feng and zhan 2015 2016 2019 liang et al 2018 sedghi et al 2018 and others despite the widely available analytical models under the condition of a well pumped at constant discharge the researches on the pumping well with a variable discharge in a two layer aquifer system or leaky confined aquifer are very limited hantush 1964b was the first to present the solution induced by a fully penetrating well with three types of time dependent pumping rate in an isotropic leaky confined aquifer but the effect of aquitard storage was excluded and the flow in the aquitard was also neglected lai and su 1974 extended the solution of hantush 1964b to include the effect of wellbore storage for a large diameter pumping well with exponentially and linearly varying rates for a partially penetrating well with a variable discharge in a leaky confined aquifer hantush 1966 presented an analytical model to investigate the drawdown by applying the same variable discharge model as hantush 1964b but the solution of the model failed to investigate the response of the upper relatively thick aquitard in which the flow is anisotropic and the aquitard storage cannot be ignored rasmussen et al 2003 derived analytical drawdown solutions induced by fully and partially penetrating wells with sinusoidal pumping rates in an isotropic confined aquifer and also gave an analytical solution for a fully penetrating well with a sinusoidal discharge in a two layer aquifer consisting of an upper aquitard and a lower confined aquifer with exclusion of the upper aquitard flow process and it should be noted that in above studies the treatment of leakage was not expressed as an interface phenomenon thus was not accordance with the realistic condition in nature and needs to improve the aim of this study is to develop a new mathematical model of flow to a partially penetrating well with a variable pumping rate in an anisotropic two layer aquifer system with constant head case 1 and no flow case 2 top boundaries of the upper layer this two layer system is a generalization of the previously studied aquitard aquifer system in which the aquitard permeability must be at least two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the aquifer and horizontal flow in the aquitard is often neglected such a generalization makes the solutions developed in this study much more versatile as no constrains on permeability will be imposed and the horizontal flows in both layers are included each layer has an anisotropic hydraulic conductivity structure in particular the flow exchange between the two layers is imposed as head and flux continuity conditions at their interface semi analytical solutions for the dimensionless drawdown are derived by the application of laplace hankel transform and real time solutions are then obtained using numerical inversion methods moreover the drawdown characteristics is discussed under the condition of a partially penetrating well positioned in the lower layer with an exponentially decayed pumping rate the solution can be also derived straightforwardly if the well is positioned in the upper layer following the similar mathematical procedures of this study a sensitivity analysis is also conducted to evaluate the drawdown in response to the relative changes of hydraulic parameters of two layers and other related parameters with the help of the developed solutions one can explore the effects of variable pumping anisotropy well partial penetration aquifer storage and the top boundary on the drawdown around the pumping well the newly obtained solution can also be applied to determine the hydraulic parameters of the two layers by using a parameter estimation method furthermore the obtained solutions show a great applicable value in geotechnical engineering and water resource management as well 2 mathematical models fig 1 shows a well of infinitesimal diameter pumped at a variable rate q t in a two layer aquifer system of infinite lateral extent the vertical pumping well partially penetrates in an arbitrary location of the lower layer of the system with a well screen length l d where l and d are the top and bottom elevation of the well screen above the bottom of the pumped aquifer respectively both layers are homogeneous vertically anisotropic but horizontally isotropic and with finite thicknesses the flow exchange between the two layers is connected with continuities of drawdown and flux at their interface the bottom of the lower layer with a pumping well is impermeable and the top of the overlying layer can be constant head case 1 or no flux case 2 case 1 can be realized when a ponding surface body is presented above the upper layer case 2 can be seen when where is no water entering or leaving the top boundary of the upper layer when the upper layer is sufficiently thick and the time of interest is not sufficiently long the influence of the top boundary of the upper layer should diminish and above case 1 and case 2 should yield similar results the origin of the coordinate system is on the axis of the well at the pumped aquifer base based on the above conceptual model the governing flow equation in an anisotropic two layer aquifer can be written as 1 k ri 1 r s i r z t r k zi 2 s i r z t z 2 s si s i r z t t where s is drawdown l kr and kz respectively denote the hydraulic conductivities in the radial and vertical directions l t which are assumed to be uniform ss refer to specific storage 1 l and t is the pumping time t the subscripts i 1 2 represent the lower pumped and upper unpumped layers respectively hereinafter the initial conditions of drawdown in the two layers are 2 s i r z 0 0 the drawdown is zero at the infinite lateral boundary 3 s i z t 0 similar to a partially penetrating well pumped at constant rate the well face boundary condition with variable pumping rate can be written as hantush 1964a neuman 1974 malama et al 2007 2008 liang et al 2018 sedghi et al 2018 4 lim r 0 r s 1 r 0 l z b 1 q t 2 π k r 1 l d d z l 0 0 z d where q t is the variable pumping rate l3 t and is positive for pumping negative for injection b 1 is the thickness of the pumped layer l a large number of field pumping tests have suggested that the pumping rates were time dependent and usually declined with time during the early pumping time and eventually attained a stable discharge which can be expressed by an exponential function of pumping time as hantush 1964b 1966 sen and altunkaynak 2004 wen et al 2017 5 q t q q 1 q e α t where q is the final constant well discharge l3 t q 1 denotes the initial discharge of the pumping well l3 t and α refers to a constant determined by the available observed pumping data 1 t the well discharge expressed in the form of eq 5 will be used in this study for flow in the upper layer the following boundary condition should also be satisfied at the wellbore 6 lim r 0 r s 2 r 0 the no flow boundary condition at the bottom of the lower layer requires 7 s 1 z z 0 0 and the flow exchange at the two layer interface can be written in the manner of hantush 1967a malama 2008 liang et al 2018 and feng and zhan 2015 2019 that is 8 s 1 r z t s 2 r z t z b 1 and 9 k z 1 s 1 r z t z k z 2 s 2 r z t z z b 1 in this study the top boundary of the upper layer can be expressed in either a constant head boundary case 1 or a no flux boundary case 2 for case 1 drawdown at the top of the upper layer remains zero 10 s 2 r z t 0 z b 2 where b 2 is the elevation of the top boundary of the upper layer as for case 2 one has 11 s 2 r z t z 0 z b 2 it is worth noting that one or both of the top boundaries of the upper layer shown in eqs 10 11 are commonly used in many other studies e g hantush and jacob 1955 hantush 1964a 1967b neuman and witherspoon 1969 moench 1985 hunt 2005 hunt and scott 2007 sepúlveda 2008 feng and zhan 2015 2016 2019 3 solutions for simplifying the developed mathematical model using the dimensionless parameters defined in table 1 one can obtain the general dimensionless drawdown distributions in the two layers 3 1 dimensionless drawdown solutions for case 1 using the top boundary of the upper layer expressed in eq 10 and the variable pumping rate written in eq 5 the solutions in the two layers giving the dimensionless drawdown induced by a partially penetrating well with an exponentially decreasing pumping rate can be derived by successively applying laplace and hankel transforms with respect to t and r respectively the detailed derivation can be seen in supplementary materials the drawdown of the lower pumped layer in laplace domain is written as 12 s d 1 0 u d λ z d p 4 γ u d λ 1 p cosh ξ 2 b d 2 1 sinh ξ 1 z d χ 1 λ j 0 λ r d d λ where 13 u d λ z d p 2 δ u d ξ 1 z d cosh ξ 1

the zero order first kind bessel function p and λ are the laplace and hankel transform parameter with respect to the dimensionless time and the dimensionless distance respectively and over bar denotes the variable in laplace domain and over hat sign denotes the variable in hankel domain u d is the laplace hankel domain dimensionless drawdown in the lower layer induced by a partially penetrating well with an exponentially decreasing pumping rate and the subscript d represents the dimensionless terms the laplace domain dimensionless drawdown in the upper layer can be expressed as 16 s d 2 4 0

eq 5 the laplace domain drawdown solutions in the two layer aquifer system with a top no flux boundary of the upper layer can be derived following the similar procedures listed in supplementary materials and dimensionless drawdown in the lower pumped aquifer in laplace space can be written as 17 s d 1 0 u d λ z d p 4 γ u d λ 1 p sinh ξ 2 b d 2 1 sinh ξ 1 z d χ 2 λ j 0 λ r d d λ the laplace domain dimensionless drawdown in the upper layer is expressed as 18 s d 2 4 0 u d λ 1 p χ 2 sinh ξ 1 cosh ξ 2 b d 2 z d λ j 0 λ r d d λ it should be noted that the definitions of functions χ 1 and χ 2 can be found in supplement materials as well 3 3 special solutions 3 3 1 reduction to solutions without considering radial flow in the upper layer when kr 2 0 one can obtain the laplace domain dimensionless drawdown in the two layer system considering the vertical flow only in the upper layer and the final expression for this case is written in eqs 12 16 18 under the condition of k rd α d r 2 0 and ξ 2 2 p α d z 2 this is the case often encountered in an aquitard aquifer system when the upper aquitard permeability is several orders of magnitude smaller than the lower aquifer as demonstrated previously by neuman and witherspoon 1968 if this requirement is not satisfied however the radial flow in the upper layer has to be included as pointed out by malama 2007 2008 3 3 2 reduction to solutions for a constant rate pumping well in a two layer aquifer system if the pumping rate maintains constant over the entire pumping time let q 1 d 1 in eqs 12 16 18 the detailed expressions of dimensionless drawdown solutions in laplace domain can be obtained for describing flow to a partially penetrating well pumped at a constant rate in a two layer system with constant head or no flux top boundary which is also a new one that has never been developed before 3 3 3 reduction to solutions in a single layer aquifer system with a fully penetrating well when excluding the leakage form the upper layer and let ld 1 dd 0 eq 13 can reduce to the solution of a single layer confined aquifer with a fully penetrating well as 19 s d λ z d p 2 0 1 λ 2 p 1 p q 1 d 1 p α d λ j 0 λ

0 t d 1 t e r d 2 4 t e α d t d t d t eq 20 agrees with the dimensionless drawdown of wen et al 2017 eq 5 for a pumping test with an exponentially decayed rate of pumping in a single confined aquifer and the theis solution in dimensionless form is also recovered by setting q 1 d 1 3 4 numerical inversion of the solutions the newly obtained dimensionless drawdown solutions for different cases are in laplace space and the detail expressions listed in eqs 12 16 18 show that it is of difficulty to analytically inverse the laplace transform however the de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 of the numerical inverse laplace method performs very well to obtain the time domain solutions for similar flow problems in groundwater hydrology which have been proven in the studies of malama et al 2007 2011 2014 tartakovsky and neuman 2007 mishra et al 2012 samani and sedghi 2015 sedghi et al 2018 and liang et al 2017a b 2018 additionally one can find that an integration related with the inverse hankel transform is contained in the developed dimensionless drawdown expressions of the laplace transform wieder 1999 presented that the hankel transform can be usually inverted numerically by splitting the infinite integral into finite integrals each finite integral interval can be evaluated by quadrature formulas such as the qxgs automatic integration routine favati et al 1991 and gauss lobatto kronrod quadrature malama 2007 2008 2014 sedghi et al 2018 ogata 2005 presented an efficient alternative formula with the zeros of the bessel functions as nodes to calculate the infinite integral including the integral of the hankel transformation type recently liang et al 2018 derived semi analytical solutions of hydraulic heads and recharge rate induced by a vadose zone infiltration well with the aid of laplace hankel transforms and attested that the method of ogata 2005 was sufficiently accurate and robust to inverse the hankel transform thus similar to the study of liang et al 2018 the inverse hankel transform is calculated using the method of ogata 2005 and the inverse laplace transform is performed with the de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 in this study the type curves of sd versus td not shown here obtained on the basis of eq 19 agrees well with that of eq 20 4 results and discussion in this section the dimensionless drawdown characteristics induced by a variable pumping rate prescribed with an exponentially decaying function of time at a partially penetrating well are analyzed in detail a sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate how sensitive drawdown with respect to different hydraulic parameters well configuration and variable pumping rate parameters in the following analysis the default values of the parameters for the two layer system are given as feng and zhan 2015 2019 wen et al 2017 b 1 20 m kr 1 10 4 m s kz 1 10 5 m s ss 1 2 10 5 m 1 b 2 30 m kr 2 10 6 m s kz 2 10 7 m s ss 2 10 3 m 1 q 1 0 005 m3 s q 0 002 m3 s α 0 005 m 1 from the values of hydraulic parameters for the upper layer one can easily know that the two layer system becomes an aquitard aquifer system which is commonly encountered in nature and is widely investigated by many researchers e g hantush and jacob 1955 hantush 1964a b 1967a b rasmussen et al 2003 hunt 2005 perina and lee 2006 feng and zhan 2015 so the hydraulic response of the two layer aquitard aquifer system are mainly explored in this study 4 1 comparison with other solutions fig 2 shows the dimensionless drawdown versus the dimensionless time at rd 0 1 and zd 0 5 calculated by the present solution of case 1 and the solutions of theis wen et al 2017 modified hantush 1964a and modified feng and zhan 2015 without considering the effect of well radius the cases with constant and variable pumping rates have been considered in the figure as a reference for a well pumped at time dependent discharge q 1 d 2 5 αd 0 8 at early time the pumping rate completely comes from groundwater stored in the pumped aquifer the drawdown developed in this study for case 1 coincides with that of the modified hantush 1964a solution and the modified feng and zhan 2015 solution with a variable discharge at intermediate and late times the drawdown in the nonleaky confined aquifer modified solution of hantush 1964a is larger than that in the leaky confined system the solution of this study and the modified feng and zhan 2015 with leakage from the aquitard and also due to the additional water provided from the constant head top aquitard boundary the drawdown in the aquitard aquifer system approaches steady state at late times as illustrated in fig 2 besides the drawdown for the case of a constant rate pumping is similar to that for the variable discharge case which is easily obtained by the study of theis hantush 1964a and feng and zhan 2015 as shown in this figure what is more comparing the features of drawdown induced by a well with constant q 1 d 1 and variable discharges q 1 d 2 5 αd 0 8 one can see that the drawdown for the variable pumping case is obviously larger than that for the constant rate pumping case at early and intermediate times due to a well discharge larger than the final constant pumping rate note that a short period of decrease of drawdown for the variable pumping case can be found at the stage of the decayed pumping rate a feature firstly found and explained by wen et al 2017 however at the late pumping times because of the same constant pumping rate the drawdown for both cases is in good agreement with each other finally it is interesting to note that the drawdown solution obtained in this study is the same as that in feng and zhan 2015 when only considering the vertical flow in the aquitard indicating that the horizontal flow can be neglected when krd kzd 0 01 this finding agrees with previous study of neuman and witherspoon 1968 4 2 effect of different top aquitard boundaries on drawdown fig 3 illustrates the response of the dimensionless drawdown in the pumped aquifer zd 0 5 and in the upper aquitard zd 1 25 at rd 0 1 under the consideration of well partial penetration ld 0 75 dd 0 25 and different top aquitard boundaries case 1 for constant head boundary and case 2 for no flux boundary the no leaky case is also considered in this figure for reference one can see that the drawdown at the middle of the pumped confined aquifer agrees well with each other during the early and intermediate pumping times no matter what the top aquitard boundary is a noticeable feature of temporal decline of drawdown as reported by wen et al 2017 can also be found at the declining well discharge stage during the late pumping times the drawdown for case 2 is larger than that for case 1 because of the block of flow by the presence of no flux boundary at the aquitard top for case 2 on the other hand the presence of a constant head boundary at the aquitard top for case 1 provides additional water supply for the pumped aquifer thus releases stress of pumping from aquifer storage and leads to less drawdown in addition the values of the pumped aquifer drawdown for case 1 and case 2 are always smaller than that of the case for no leakage except at early pumping times this is obviously due to the contribution of leakage from the aquitard to the pumped aquifer the response of drawdown in the aquitard occurs at the dimensionless pumping time td 10 attributed to the release of water stored in the aquitard except for the intermediate times the general drawdown characteristics in the aquitard is similar to that of the pumped aquifer and the only difference is that the effect of variable discharge is much less recognizable for the aquitard drawdown additionally the drawdown in the aquitard as expected is smaller than that of the pumped aquifer what is more the cases for neglecting the horizontal radial flow in the aquitard are incorporated in this figure considering the fact that the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the pumped aquifer the effect of the radial flow in the aquitard on the drawdown of the pumped aquifer can be ignored during the whole pumping period in contrast the influence of the horizontal radial flow in the aquitard on the aquitard drawdown is significant at the late pumping stage thus ignoring this influence will lead to overestimation of the aquitard drawdown at the late pumping stage no matter what the upper boundary condition of the aquitard is this finding suggests that if the aquitard drawdown is the major concern of the problem the horizontal radial flow in the aquitard is generally not negligible particularly for late times to further investigate the drawdown characteristics along the z direction under different top aquitard boundaries fig 4 demonstrates the profile of dimensionless drawdown at rd 0 1 in the aquitard aquifer zone for four specific pumping times td 0 1 1 10 102 and 103 note that the partially penetrating well having a dimensionless screen length of ld dd 0 5 is in the middle of the pumped aquifer it can be found that the drawdown at different depths of aquitard aquifer zone is the same with each other for case 1 and case2 except at the relatively late pumping time of td 103 the aquitard top boundaries affect the drawdown significantly and closer to the aquitard top the more apparent difference is between case 1 and case 2 as shown in fig 4 this indicates that one should not only be aware of the hydraulic relationship between the aquitard and the pumped aquifer but also needs to consider the influence of the type of aquitard top boundary if using the late time drawdown data to determine the hydraulic parameters of the pumped aquifer and the aquitard a notable point is that the drawdown induced by a partially penetrating pumping well at different depths of the aquitard aquifer system are different at the same radial distance from the pumping well this is due to two reasons first a partially penetrating well will inevitably generate vertical flow components of flow which vary with depth second treating the leakage from the aquitard to the pumped aquifer as an interface source rather than a depth averaged volumetric source as done with the hantush jacob approximation will lead to different vertical flow components at different depths the combination of these two reasons will lead to different drawdowns at different depth even with the same horizontal radial distance from the pumping well this finding implies that the location of the piezometer including the r and z coordinates must be clearly determined if the drawdown data collected from the piezometer are used for estimations of aquifer and aquitard hydraulic parameters for the purpose of illustration case 1 is chosen as an example to further analyze the drawdown responses in the following section one can use the same procedures to analyze the drawdown responses for case 2 if needed 4 3 effect of variable discharge parameters on drawdown in this section the dimensionless drawdown in the aquitard aquifer system is obtained under the condition of a partially penetrating well having an exponentially decayed discharge with time and the parameters used to describe the variable discharge are q 1 d and αd shown in eqs 5 and 13 fig 5 shows the response of the dimensionless drawdown in the pumped aquifer zd 0 5 and in the aquitard zd 1 1 at rd 0 1 for different q 1 d obviously q 1 d 1 denotes the special case of a constant rate the effect of q 1 d on drawdown in the pumped aquifer occurs only at early and intermediate pumping stages a larger q 1 d implies that the initial well discharge is much higher resulting in a larger drawdown as shown in the figure when the pumping rate approaches its late time constant drawdowns for different q 1 d approach the same value the drawdown close to the aquitard aquifer interface in the aquitard zd 1 1 however is influenced by the change of q 1 d at the initial stage of pumping this is because a greater volume of water has to be released from the aquitard storage to enter the pumped aquifer when a larger q 1 d is used thus generating a larger aquitard drawdown accordingly at late times however the aquitard drawdowns also approach the same asymptote similar to the situation in the pumped aquifer fig 6 demonstrates the dimensionless drawdown versus dimensionless time in the pumped aquifer zd 0 5 and in the aquitard zd 1 1 at rd 0 1 for different αd the drawdown in the pumped aquifer for the constant pumping rate case is also included in this figure as reference one can see that during the entire pumping period the pumped aquifer drawdowns somewhat agrees with each other for different decay constants with some minor to moderate discrepancies at the intermediate pumping stage a larger αd means that the pumping rate drops more quickly to its asymptotic constant discharge rate thus leading to smaller drawdowns at intermediate times 4 4 effect of anisotropy on drawdown fig 7 displays the drawdown response in the anisotropic pumped aquifer zd 0 5 for different anisotropy ratios kd 1 kz 1 kr 1 and in the isotropic aquitard zd 1 25 at rd 0 1 it can be seen from this figure that the aquifer anisotropy impacts the drawdowns in both aquitard and aquifer significantly over the whole pumping time a smaller aquifer anisotropy indicates that the permeability in the horizontal direction is larger than the permeability in the vertical direction so the horizontal flow component is dominant in the aquifer or the vertical flow component in the aquifer is suppressed resulting in more water released at early and intermediate pumping stages and greater drawdowns in the aquifer during those stages a smaller aquifer anisotropy also means that the time required for aquitard to response to aquifer pumping will be longer resulting in delayed drawdown in the aquitard as seen from fig 7 as well fig 8 illustrates the drawdowns in an isotropic aquifer kz 1 kr 1 10 4 m s and zd 0 9 and an anisotropic aquitard zd 1 25 for different unpumped layer anisotropy ratios at rd 0 1 the partially penetrating well is screened at the upper part of the pumped aquifer ld 1 0 and dd 0 5 to maximize the drawdown response and interaction between the two layers it should be noted that in fig 8 a the unpumped layer hydraulic conductivity in the vertical direction is fixed kz 2 10 6 m s and only the upper layer hydraulic conductivity in the horizontal direction kr 2 is changed on the contrary kr 2 is fixed and kz 2 is the changing parameter in fig 8 b the isotropic case for the upper layer kr 2 kz 2 is also included in this figure as a reference of comparison from fig 8 a one can easily see that the change of kr 2 has no influence on the aquifer drawdown adjacent to the interface between the aquitard and the pumped aquifer at early time the drawdown in the pumped aquifer is not affected when kr 2 kz 2 at intermediate and late times but when kr 2 increases above kz 2 the change of kr 2 on aquifer drawdown is evident at intermediate and late times however the response of aquitard drawdown is significant to the change of kr 2 especially at late time for the case of kz 2 kr 2 the aquifer drawdown at a location of zd 0 9 that is relatively close to the interface of flow exchange between the two layers zd 1 0 is greatly influenced by the change of kz 2 during the intermediate and late pumping periods as seen in fig 8 b a larger kz 2 will induce more leakage across the interface thus leads to a smaller aquifer drawdown at late time for drawdown in the upper layer because the well screen is located in the vicinity of the interface between the two layers when the vertical flow in the upper layer is dominant and vertical hydraulic conductivity for the upper layer is nearly close to that for the pumped aquifer in the case of kz 2 kr 2 the drawdown in the upper layer is affected by the variable pumping discharge and the decreasing stage of the drawdown can also be found it should be noted that above discussion is applicable for a general two layer system as the hydraulic conductivity of the upper layer is not always much smaller than that of the lower layer an assumption adopted for an aquitard aquifer system finally to further investigate the effect of anisotropy on the drawdown in the pumped aquifer the type curves of sd versus td for different anisotropy between the upper and lower layers are plotted in fig 9 where kd 1 kz 1 kr 1 kd 2 kz 2 kr 2 krd kr 2 kr 1 kzd kz 2 kz 2 kd and rd 0 1 and the case of single layer aquifer no leakage for different anisotropy and the case of a constant pumping rate are also included for comparison it is shown in this figure that the drawdown in the pumped aquifer is gradually close to that in a single confined aquifer with the decreasing of the permeability contrast between the upper and lower layers one can see that the upper layer can be regarded as an impermeable layer when kd 10 4 and the flow exchange between the two layers is significant at a relatively large pumping time 4 5 effect of well configuration and aquitard storage on drawdown for a partially penetrating well in aquitard aquifer system the drawdowns in the aquitard and the pumped aquifer are influenced by the location and length of the well screen fig 10 displays the late time drawdown response td 104 zd 0 9 and 1 25 at different radial distances for the change of different screen locations and lengths fig 10 a shows that the effect of the screen location on the drawdown is sufficient in vicinity of the pumping well the similar phenomenon can also be found for a well with different screen lengths as shown in fig 10 b note that the top elevation of the well screen is fixed at the aquitard aquifer interface ld 1 and a smaller drawdown can be found for a larger well screen length it can also be seen from the figure that the effect of the well configuration on drawdown can be ignored at the dimensionless rd 1 to explore the effect of the aquitard storage on drawdown fig 11 shows the dimensionless drawdown response in the aquitard zd 1 1 and in the pumped aquifer zd 0 5 for different aquitard aquifer specific storage ratio ssd at rd 0 1 it should be noted that the no leakage case is also considered in this figure one can see that the effect of the aquitard storage is mainly significant at intermediate times and a smaller ssd means less water provided by the aquitard leading to a larger drawdown which is closer to that for the case without leakage feng and zhan 2015 on the other hand a greater ssd indicates that the time for the influence of the aquitard storage is much earlier and lasts longer accordingly the storativity cannot be neglected for a relatively thick aquitard 4 6 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is often adopted to reveal how different parameters could influence the drawdown in groundwater literature kabala 2001 huang and yeh 2007 sedghi et al 2018 feng and zhan 2019 the method of the normalized sensitivity analysis presented by huang and yeh 2007 is used in this study and the sensitivity coefficient is defined as 21 x i j p j o i p j p j o i p j δ p j o i p j δ p j in which x i j refers to the normalized sensitivity caused by the j th parameter pj at the i th time oi indicates the dimensionless drawdown response and δpj denotes a small increment and δpj 10 2 pj in the following analysis note that the absolute normalized sensitivity of x i j is used here for comparison the default parameter values are given as b 1 20 m kr 1 10 4 m s kz 1 10 5 m s ss 1 2 10 5 m 1 b 2 30 m kr 2 10 5 m s kz 2 10 6 m s ss 2 10 3 m 1 q 1 0 005 m3 s q 0 002 m3 s α 0 005 m 1 r 2 m l 15 m d 5 m z 10 m and 25 m note that the well screen is located at the middle part of the pumped aquifer and the responses of the drawdown at the middle of the pumped aquifer sd 1 and the aquitard sd 2 are observed respectively figs 12 and 13 demonstrate respectively the sensitivity of sd 1 and the sd 2 for case 1 and case 2 to the pumped aquifer hydraulic parameters kr 1 kz 1 ss 1 the aquitard hydraulic parameters kr 2 kz 2 ss 2 the variable discharge parameters q 1 α and well structure parameters l d from fig 12 a and b one can see that the degree of sensitivity of sd 1 for cases 1 and 2 with respect to the corresponding parameters are almost the same except at t d 104 one can find in these two figures that the change of l and d has great influence on sd 1 during the entire pumping time and maintains constant at late times the effect of the relative variation of q 1 on sd 1 increases gradually with pumping time arrives at the peak value near td 0 4 then decreases gradually until near td 0 4 when the well discharge is stabilized and the relative degree of sensitivity q 1 is higher than that to d and smaller than that to l when 10 4 td 10 it is note that the effects of kr 1 ss 1 kz 1 and α on sd 1 are significant in the period 0 1 td 50 and the sensitivities with respect to ss 1 and α are the same which is larger than that to kz 1 and smaller than that to kr 1 another phenomenon for the disappearance of the influence of α on sd 1 can be found with the pumping rate maintaining constant as expected during the period 50 td 104 sd 1 is moderately sensitive to the change of kr 1 and kz 1 meanwhile the influences of kz 2 ss 1 and ss 2 on sd 1 are minor and the influences of others can be neglected at the late pumping time however fig 12 a shows that sd 1 for case1 is only moderately affected by the change of kr 1 which has a larger sensitivity than that for kz 1 and kz 2 with the same sensitivity fig 12 b demonstrates that the effects of kr 1 kz 1 ss 1 and ss 2 on sd 1 for case 2 are significant and are somewhat the same fig 12 suggests that the effect of kr 2 on sd 1 can be ignored during the whole pumping stage fig 13 shows that the changes of q 1 and α have no influence on sd 2 in addition the sensitivity of sd 2 with respect to l and d starts at near td 120 and approaches their largest stable value at late time and the degree of sensitivity to l is larger than that to d fig 13 a implies that the effects of ss 1 and ss 2 on sd 2 are only significant in the period 100 td 4 104 and their sensitivities are the same moreover sd 2 is very sensitive to the change of kr 1 and kz 2 in the period 100 td 4 104 and becomes moderately sensitive those parameters at the late pumping time the effects of kr 2 and kz 1 on sd 2 are similar to that of l in general sd 2 for case 1 is very sensitive to the change of l and is moderately sensitive to kr 1 kr 2 kz 1 kz 2 and d at late times and the sensitivities for kr 1 kr 2 kz 1 and kz 2 are almost the same fig 13 b demonstrates that the sensitivities of sd 2 for case 2 with respect to ss 1 ss 2 kr 1 and kz 2 begin to increase from td near 100 reach their maximum values and then decrease gradually until approaching their respective asymptotes at late time additionally the effects of kr 2 and kz 1 on sd 2 are similar to that of l which is not repeated here what is more the degrees of sensitivity to ss 1 and ss 2 are somewhat the same and the degrees of sensitivity to d and kz 2 are also almost the same with each other all the hydraulic parameters in the pumped aquifer and the aquitard have significant influence on sd 2 for case 2 specifically at late times sd 2 for case 2 is most sensitive to the change of l and the effects of kr 2 and kz 2 on sd 2 are moderate finally one can see that the degree of sensitivity to different hydraulic parameters for case 1 is a slightly smaller than that for case 2 5 application of the solution the newly developed solution can be applied to predict the drawdown response to the pumping in an observation well or piezometer investigate the effects of variable pumping rate anisotropy aquitard storage well screen length and its location and the type of top boundary on the drawdown and determine the hydraulic parameters of aquitard and pumped aquifer in aquifer tests and data analyses additionally our solutions also have a great potential application value in other related field such as in petroleum engineering geotechnical engineering and geothermal engineering there are some suggestions for using the solution from this study firstly the well configuration should be known when using the drawdown data in vicinity of the pumping well and the type of the top boundary of the upper layer should be especially noted when collecting the late time drawdown data secondly the dimensionless drawdown in the pumped layer for different cases is sensitive to kr 1 kz 1 and ss 1 at intermediate time so the drawdown data collected in this stage are more valuable to obtain their values if the pumping time is enough large the late time drawdown data can also be used to estimate the values of the hydraulic conductivity in the horizontal and vertical direction for the lower layer and to determine ss 1 for case 2 thirdly the data of drawdown in the upper layer at intermediate time are more reliable to estimate kz 2 and ss 2 and the drawdown data at late time is more suitable for determining the value of horizontal hydraulic conductivity values of the upper aquitard fourthly if reversing the pumping to injection by simply change the sign of q from positive to negative one can use the solution developed here for assessing the two layer aquifer response to managed artificial recharge mar lastly the reason to choose an aquitard aquifer system as examples in the analysis of section 4 is mostly for the purpose of comparison with previous studies which almost exclusively concentrated on an aquitard aquifer system with distinctively different aquitard and aquifer permeability values in fact the solution developed in this study is much more general with essentially no constrains on the permeability contrast of the two layers therefore the developed solution can be directly applied to a two layer system with moderate permeability contrast the solution may also be applied to a system consisting of an aquifer and a highly permeable layer such as a filled fracture or a fault gauge this study also has a few limitations that should be addressed briefly first the pumping rate is expected to follow an exponential function of time if the pumping rate varies with time with a different function then the solution needs to be redeveloped one may consult the details of supplementary materials for any other types of pumping functions second like most analytical works this study does not address the aquifer heterogeneity problem therefore the solution developed here may be regarded as the averaged solution of an ensemble of statistically similar but heterogeneous aquifers 6 summary and conclusions a semi analytical dimensionless drawdown solution for flow to a partially penetrating constant well with time dependent pumping rate in an anisotropic two layer aquifer system is obtained by the method of laplace hankel transform with considering the interface flow between the two layers note that the effect of different top boundary including constant head case1 and no flux boundary case 2 conditions at the top of the upper layer has been taken into account the spatiotemporal solutions are obtained by numerically performing the inverse laplace hankel transforms the characteristics of the drawdown induced by a partially penetrating well with an exponentially decaying discharge are discussed for a two layer aquifer system and sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate how sensitive the drawdown is to different parameters under different cases the following findings can be concluded from this study 1 the drawdown around a partially penetrating well in the pumped lower layer induced by an exponential decreasing pumping rate usually contains three stages that is the stage associated with the initial high well discharge at early time the stage associated with the decreasing well discharge at intermediate time and the stage associated with the final constant well discharge at late time the drawdown decreases with time momentarily at the intermediate pumping stage 2 the drawdowns at the any depth of the two layer system are affected by different top boundaries of the upper layer at late times only and the drawdowns for case 1 is generally large than that for case 2 significant deviations between case 1 and case 2 can be found in the vicinity of the top boundary of the upper layer 3 a larger initial pumping rate leads to a larger drawdown in the pumped lower aquifer over time except at the final constant pumping stage and a larger decay constant of the variable discharge results in a smaller drawdown only at the declining discharge pumping stage a larger initial discharge and a smaller decay constant cause a larger drawdown in the upper layer near the interface of the two layers initially and their influences die out at late times 4 the effect of anisotropy of the pumped lower aquifer has great influence on the drawdown distribution in both layers the effect of the horizontal flow in the upper layer can be neglected when the horizontal hydraulic conductivity in the upper layer is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the hydraulic conductivity in the lower layer i e a typical aquitard aquifer system but it is generally not negligible at late times 5 the pumping well screen length and location have significant influence on the drawdown close to the pumping well and the influences can be neglected at a radial distance from the pumping well greater than the thickness of the lower layer additionally the storage of the upper layer cannot be ignored in calculating the drawdowns in both lower pumped and upper unpumped layers 6 the drawdown in the lower layer is very sensitive to the change of well configuration during the entire pumping time and is only sensitive to the change of kr 1 kz 1 and kz 2 for case 1 and to the change of kr 1 kz 1 ss 1 and ss 2 for case 2 at late times 7 the drawdown in the upper layer is not sensitive to the change of variable well discharge parameters over the whole pumping period and is not sensitive to the variation of ss 1 and ss 2 for case 1 as well however it is sensitive to all the hydraulic parameters and well configuration parameters for case 2 at late times declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

6114,a general analytical model for the problem of variable discharge of groundwater from a well in an anisotropic two layered aquifer system is developed by taking account of the interface flow between the two layers the well of infinitesimal radius partially penetrates the lower layer and is pumped at a variable discharge the horizontal as well as vertical flows in both layers are included and importantly the effects of constant head case 1 and no flux case 2 boundaries at the top of the upper layer are considered laplace domain solutions for drawdown in dimensionless form are derived with the help of hankel transform and are inverted to the time domain numerically the drawdown characteristics induced by an exponentially decayed rate of pumping are discussed and sensitivity analysis is also performed to explore the influence of different parameters on drawdown characteristics the results show that the drawdown around a partially penetrating well in the lower pumped layer induced by an exponential decreasing pumping rate usually contains three stages the effect of anisotropy and well configuration have great influences on the drawdown distribution near the pumping well and the horizontal flow and storativity of the upper unpumped layer cannot be ignored in determining the upper aquifer drawdown the sensitivity analysis also illustrates that the dimensionless drawdown in the lower pumped layer is very sensitive to well configuration parameters all the time it is only sensitive to the hydraulic parameters of the lower aquifer for case 1 and to the hydraulic parameters of the lower layer and the specific storage of the upper layer at late times the dimensionless drawdown of the upper layer is not sensitive to the variable well discharge parameters over the whole pumping period and is not sensitive to the storage parameters of both layers for case 1 however the drawdown in the upper layer is sensitive to all the hydraulic parameters and well configuration parameters for case 2 at late times keywords two layer system anisotropic well partial penetration variable pumping rate sensitivity analysis 1 introduction most groundwater flow theories involving pumping wells assume constant well discharges for the sake of simplicity under actual field conditions however the well discharge is rarely been constant because of a variety of reasons such as technical issues for maintaining constant discharges well head losses temporal power loss or other reasons hantush 1964a b sen and altunkaynak 2004 singh 2009 yeh and chang 2013 the variable pumping rate test performed in confined aquifers can be found in a number of studies such as abu zied and scott 1963 abu zied et al 1964 hantush 1964a b lai et al 1973 black and kipp 1981 butler and mcelwee 1990 sen and altunkaynak 2004 singh 2004 2009 mishra et al 2013 wen et al 2017 and li et al 2018 it is however common that one aquifer may have the hydraulic connection with adjacent layers in nature for pioneering work of non steady transient flow in layered or leaky confined aquifers hantush and jacob 1955 treated the leakage as a volumetric source sink term incorporated into the governing flow equation termed hantush jacob approximation hereinafter and obtained an analytical solution for flow to a fully penetrating well pumped at constant rate in a leaky confined aquifer the hantush jacob approximation is simple and is used in practice under the condition of a fully penetrating well or a relatively thin aquitard e g hantush 1959 1964a b neuman and witherspoon 1968 1969 hantush 1967a moench 1985 hunt and scott 2007 but the method fails to recognize the actual process of leakage in nature and may cause sizable error especially for a partially penetrating pumping well and a relatively thick aquitard hantush 1967a yeh and chang 2013 hantush 1967a developed the transient drawdown solution induced by a partially penetrating well with a constant discharge in an aquitard aquifer system in which the flow exchange between the upper aquitard and the lower pumped aquifer was regarded as a boundary condition the leakage treatments presented by hantush 1967a has been widely adopted subsequently for layered or leaky confined aquifers such as javandel and witherspoon 1980 1983 hunt 2005 bakker 2006 perina and lee 2006 malama 2007 2008 feng and zhan 2015 2016 2019 liang et al 2018 sedghi et al 2018 and others despite the widely available analytical models under the condition of a well pumped at constant discharge the researches on the pumping well with a variable discharge in a two layer aquifer system or leaky confined aquifer are very limited hantush 1964b was the first to present the solution induced by a fully penetrating well with three types of time dependent pumping rate in an isotropic leaky confined aquifer but the effect of aquitard storage was excluded and the flow in the aquitard was also neglected lai and su 1974 extended the solution of hantush 1964b to include the effect of wellbore storage for a large diameter pumping well with exponentially and linearly varying rates for a partially penetrating well with a variable discharge in a leaky confined aquifer hantush 1966 presented an analytical model to investigate the drawdown by applying the same variable discharge model as hantush 1964b but the solution of the model failed to investigate the response of the upper relatively thick aquitard in which the flow is anisotropic and the aquitard storage cannot be ignored rasmussen et al 2003 derived analytical drawdown solutions induced by fully and partially penetrating wells with sinusoidal pumping rates in an isotropic confined aquifer and also gave an analytical solution for a fully penetrating well with a sinusoidal discharge in a two layer aquifer consisting of an upper aquitard and a lower confined aquifer with exclusion of the upper aquitard flow process and it should be noted that in above studies the treatment of leakage was not expressed as an interface phenomenon thus was not accordance with the realistic condition in nature and needs to improve the aim of this study is to develop a new mathematical model of flow to a partially penetrating well with a variable pumping rate in an anisotropic two layer aquifer system with constant head case 1 and no flow case 2 top boundaries of the upper layer this two layer system is a generalization of the previously studied aquitard aquifer system in which the aquitard permeability must be at least two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the aquifer and horizontal flow in the aquitard is often neglected such a generalization makes the solutions developed in this study much more versatile as no constrains on permeability will be imposed and the horizontal flows in both layers are included each layer has an anisotropic hydraulic conductivity structure in particular the flow exchange between the two layers is imposed as head and flux continuity conditions at their interface semi analytical solutions for the dimensionless drawdown are derived by the application of laplace hankel transform and real time solutions are then obtained using numerical inversion methods moreover the drawdown characteristics is discussed under the condition of a partially penetrating well positioned in the lower layer with an exponentially decayed pumping rate the solution can be also derived straightforwardly if the well is positioned in the upper layer following the similar mathematical procedures of this study a sensitivity analysis is also conducted to evaluate the drawdown in response to the relative changes of hydraulic parameters of two layers and other related parameters with the help of the developed solutions one can explore the effects of variable pumping anisotropy well partial penetration aquifer storage and the top boundary on the drawdown around the pumping well the newly obtained solution can also be applied to determine the hydraulic parameters of the two layers by using a parameter estimation method furthermore the obtained solutions show a great applicable value in geotechnical engineering and water resource management as well 2 mathematical models fig 1 shows a well of infinitesimal diameter pumped at a variable rate q t in a two layer aquifer system of infinite lateral extent the vertical pumping well partially penetrates in an arbitrary location of the lower layer of the system with a well screen length l d where l and d are the top and bottom elevation of the well screen above the bottom of the pumped aquifer respectively both layers are homogeneous vertically anisotropic but horizontally isotropic and with finite thicknesses the flow exchange between the two layers is connected with continuities of drawdown and flux at their interface the bottom of the lower layer with a pumping well is impermeable and the top of the overlying layer can be constant head case 1 or no flux case 2 case 1 can be realized when a ponding surface body is presented above the upper layer case 2 can be seen when where is no water entering or leaving the top boundary of the upper layer when the upper layer is sufficiently thick and the time of interest is not sufficiently long the influence of the top boundary of the upper layer should diminish and above case 1 and case 2 should yield similar results the origin of the coordinate system is on the axis of the well at the pumped aquifer base based on the above conceptual model the governing flow equation in an anisotropic two layer aquifer can be written as 1 k ri 1 r s i r z t r k zi 2 s i r z t z 2 s si s i r z t t where s is drawdown l kr and kz respectively denote the hydraulic conductivities in the radial and vertical directions l t which are assumed to be uniform ss refer to specific storage 1 l and t is the pumping time t the subscripts i 1 2 represent the lower pumped and upper unpumped layers respectively hereinafter the initial conditions of drawdown in the two layers are 2 s i r z 0 0 the drawdown is zero at the infinite lateral boundary 3 s i z t 0 similar to a partially penetrating well pumped at constant rate the well face boundary condition with variable pumping rate can be written as hantush 1964a neuman 1974 malama et al 2007 2008 liang et al 2018 sedghi et al 2018 4 lim r 0 r s 1 r 0 l z b 1 q t 2 π k r 1 l d d z l 0 0 z d where q t is the variable pumping rate l3 t and is positive for pumping negative for injection b 1 is the thickness of the pumped layer l a large number of field pumping tests have suggested that the pumping rates were time dependent and usually declined with time during the early pumping time and eventually attained a stable discharge which can be expressed by an exponential function of pumping time as hantush 1964b 1966 sen and altunkaynak 2004 wen et al 2017 5 q t q q 1 q e α t where q is the final constant well discharge l3 t q 1 denotes the initial discharge of the pumping well l3 t and α refers to a constant determined by the available observed pumping data 1 t the well discharge expressed in the form of eq 5 will be used in this study for flow in the upper layer the following boundary condition should also be satisfied at the wellbore 6 lim r 0 r s 2 r 0 the no flow boundary condition at the bottom of the lower layer requires 7 s 1 z z 0 0 and the flow exchange at the two layer interface can be written in the manner of hantush 1967a malama 2008 liang et al 2018 and feng and zhan 2015 2019 that is 8 s 1 r z t s 2 r z t z b 1 and 9 k z 1 s 1 r z t z k z 2 s 2 r z t z z b 1 in this study the top boundary of the upper layer can be expressed in either a constant head boundary case 1 or a no flux boundary case 2 for case 1 drawdown at the top of the upper layer remains zero 10 s 2 r z t 0 z b 2 where b 2 is the elevation of the top boundary of the upper layer as for case 2 one has 11 s 2 r z t z 0 z b 2 it is worth noting that one or both of the top boundaries of the upper layer shown in eqs 10 11 are commonly used in many other studies e g hantush and jacob 1955 hantush 1964a 1967b neuman and witherspoon 1969 moench 1985 hunt 2005 hunt and scott 2007 sepúlveda 2008 feng and zhan 2015 2016 2019 3 solutions for simplifying the developed mathematical model using the dimensionless parameters defined in table 1 one can obtain the general dimensionless drawdown distributions in the two layers 3 1 dimensionless drawdown solutions for case 1 using the top boundary of the upper layer expressed in eq 10 and the variable pumping rate written in eq 5 the solutions in the two layers giving the dimensionless drawdown induced by a partially penetrating well with an exponentially decreasing pumping rate can be derived by successively applying laplace and hankel transforms with respect to t and r respectively the detailed derivation can be seen in supplementary materials the drawdown of the lower pumped layer in laplace domain is written as 12 s d 1 0 u d λ z d p 4 γ u d λ 1 p cosh ξ 2 b d 2 1 sinh ξ 1 z d χ 1 λ j 0 λ r d d λ where 13 u d λ z d p 2 δ u d ξ 1 z d cosh ξ 1

the zero order first kind bessel function p and λ are the laplace and hankel transform parameter with respect to the dimensionless time and the dimensionless distance respectively and over bar denotes the variable in laplace domain and over hat sign denotes the variable in hankel domain u d is the laplace hankel domain dimensionless drawdown in the lower layer induced by a partially penetrating well with an exponentially decreasing pumping rate and the subscript d represents the dimensionless terms the laplace domain dimensionless drawdown in the upper layer can be expressed as 16 s d 2 4 0

eq 5 the laplace domain drawdown solutions in the two layer aquifer system with a top no flux boundary of the upper layer can be derived following the similar procedures listed in supplementary materials and dimensionless drawdown in the lower pumped aquifer in laplace space can be written as 17 s d 1 0 u d λ z d p 4 γ u d λ 1 p sinh ξ 2 b d 2 1 sinh ξ 1 z d χ 2 λ j 0 λ r d d λ the laplace domain dimensionless drawdown in the upper layer is expressed as 18 s d 2 4 0 u d λ 1 p χ 2 sinh ξ 1 cosh ξ 2 b d 2 z d λ j 0 λ r d d λ it should be noted that the definitions of functions χ 1 and χ 2 can be found in supplement materials as well 3 3 special solutions 3 3 1 reduction to solutions without considering radial flow in the upper layer when kr 2 0 one can obtain the laplace domain dimensionless drawdown in the two layer system considering the vertical flow only in the upper layer and the final expression for this case is written in eqs 12 16 18 under the condition of k rd α d r 2 0 and ξ 2 2 p α d z 2 this is the case often encountered in an aquitard aquifer system when the upper aquitard permeability is several orders of magnitude smaller than the lower aquifer as demonstrated previously by neuman and witherspoon 1968 if this requirement is not satisfied however the radial flow in the upper layer has to be included as pointed out by malama 2007 2008 3 3 2 reduction to solutions for a constant rate pumping well in a two layer aquifer system if the pumping rate maintains constant over the entire pumping time let q 1 d 1 in eqs 12 16 18 the detailed expressions of dimensionless drawdown solutions in laplace domain can be obtained for describing flow to a partially penetrating well pumped at a constant rate in a two layer system with constant head or no flux top boundary which is also a new one that has never been developed before 3 3 3 reduction to solutions in a single layer aquifer system with a fully penetrating well when excluding the leakage form the upper layer and let ld 1 dd 0 eq 13 can reduce to the solution of a single layer confined aquifer with a fully penetrating well as 19 s d λ z d p 2 0 1 λ 2 p 1 p q 1 d 1 p α d λ j 0 λ r d λ and considering the fact of 0 1 λ 2 p λ j 0 λ r d λ k 0 r d p p l 1 1 p 1 l 1 1 p α d e α d t d l 1 k 0 r d p e r d 2 4 t d eq 19 reduces to 20 s d r d z d t d 0 t d 1 t e r d 2 4 t d t q 1 d 1 0 t d 1 t e r d 2 4 t e α d t d t d t eq 20 agrees with the dimensionless drawdown of wen et al 2017 eq 5 for a pumping test with an exponentially decayed rate of pumping in a single confined aquifer and the theis solution in dimensionless form is also recovered by setting q 1 d 1 3 4 numerical inversion of the solutions the newly obtained dimensionless drawdown solutions for different cases are in laplace space and the detail expressions listed in eqs 12 16 18 show that it is of difficulty to analytically inverse the laplace transform however the de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 of the numerical inverse laplace method performs very well to obtain the time domain solutions for similar flow problems in groundwater hydrology which have been proven in the studies of malama et al 2007 2011 2014 tartakovsky and neuman 2007 mishra et al 2012 samani and sedghi 2015 sedghi et al 2018 and liang et al 2017a b 2018 additionally one can find that an integration related with the inverse hankel transform is contained in the developed dimensionless drawdown expressions of the laplace transform wieder 1999 presented that the hankel transform can be usually inverted numerically by splitting the infinite integral into finite integrals each finite integral interval can be evaluated by quadrature formulas such as the qxgs automatic integration routine favati et al 1991 and gauss lobatto kronrod quadrature malama 2007 2008 2014 sedghi et al 2018 ogata 2005 presented an efficient alternative formula with the zeros of the bessel functions as nodes to calculate the infinite integral including the integral of the hankel transformation type recently liang et al 2018 derived semi analytical solutions of hydraulic heads and recharge rate induced by a vadose zone infiltration well with the aid of laplace hankel transforms and attested that the method of ogata 2005 was sufficiently accurate and robust to inverse the hankel transform thus similar to the study of liang et al 2018 the inverse hankel transform is calculated using the method of ogata 2005 and the inverse laplace transform is performed with the de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 in this study the type curves of sd versus td not shown here obtained on the basis of eq 19 agrees well with that of eq 20 4 results and discussion in this section the dimensionless drawdown characteristics induced by a variable pumping rate prescribed with an exponentially decaying function of time at a partially penetrating well are analyzed in detail a sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate how sensitive drawdown with respect to different hydraulic parameters well configuration and variable pumping rate parameters in the following analysis the default values of the parameters for the two layer system are given as feng and zhan 2015 2019 wen et al 2017 b 1 20 m kr 1 10 4 m s kz 1 10 5 m s ss 1 2 10 5 m 1 b 2 30 m kr 2 10 6 m s kz 2 10 7 m s ss 2 10 3 m 1 q 1 0 005 m3 s q 0 002 m3 s α 0 005 m 1 from the values of hydraulic parameters for the upper layer one can easily know that the two layer system becomes an aquitard aquifer system which is commonly encountered in nature and is widely investigated by many researchers e g hantush and jacob 1955 hantush 1964a b 1967a b rasmussen et al 2003 hunt 2005 perina and lee 2006 feng and zhan 2015 so the hydraulic response of the two layer aquitard aquifer system are mainly explored in this study 4 1 comparison with other solutions fig 2 shows the dimensionless drawdown versus the dimensionless time at rd 0 1 and zd 0 5 calculated by the present solution of case 1 and the solutions of theis wen et al 2017 modified hantush 1964a and modified feng and zhan 2015 without considering the effect of well radius the cases with constant and variable pumping rates have been considered in the figure as a reference for a well pumped at time dependent discharge q 1 d 2 5 αd 0 8 at early time the pumping rate completely comes from groundwater stored in the pumped aquifer the drawdown developed in this study for case 1 coincides with that of the modified hantush 1964a solution and the modified feng and zhan 2015 solution with a variable discharge at intermediate and late times the drawdown in the nonleaky confined aquifer modified solution of hantush 1964a is larger than that in the leaky confined system the solution of this study and the modified feng and zhan 2015 with leakage from the aquitard and also due to the additional water provided from the constant head top aquitard boundary the drawdown in the aquitard aquifer system approaches steady state at late times as illustrated in fig 2 besides the drawdown for the case of a constant rate pumping is similar to that for the variable discharge case which is easily obtained by the study of theis hantush 1964a and feng and zhan 2015 as shown in this figure what is more comparing the features of drawdown induced by a well with constant q 1 d 1 and variable discharges q 1 d 2 5 αd 0 8 one can see that the drawdown for the variable pumping case is obviously larger than that for the constant rate pumping case at early and intermediate times due to a well discharge larger than the final constant pumping rate note that a short period of decrease of drawdown for the variable pumping case can be found at the stage of the decayed pumping rate a feature firstly found and explained by wen et al 2017 however at the late pumping times because of the same constant pumping rate the drawdown for both cases is in good agreement with each other finally it is interesting to note that the drawdown solution obtained in this study is the same as that in feng and zhan 2015 when only considering the vertical flow in the aquitard indicating that the horizontal flow can be neglected when krd kzd 0 01 this finding agrees with previous study of neuman and witherspoon 1968 4 2 effect of different top aquitard boundaries on drawdown fig 3 illustrates the response of the dimensionless drawdown in the pumped aquifer zd 0 5 and in the upper aquitard zd 1 25 at rd 0 1 under the consideration of well partial penetration ld 0 75 dd 0 25 and different top aquitard boundaries case 1 for constant head boundary and case 2 for no flux boundary the no leaky case is also considered in this figure for reference one can see that the drawdown at the middle of the pumped confined aquifer agrees well with each other during the early and intermediate pumping times no matter what the top aquitard boundary is a noticeable feature of temporal decline of drawdown as reported by wen et al 2017 can also be found at the declining well discharge stage during the late pumping times the drawdown for case 2 is larger than that for case 1 because of the block of flow by the presence of no flux boundary at the aquitard top for case 2 on the other hand the presence of a constant head boundary at the aquitard top for case 1 provides additional water supply for the pumped aquifer thus releases stress of pumping from aquifer storage and leads to less drawdown in addition the values of the pumped aquifer drawdown for case 1 and case 2 are always smaller than that of the case for no leakage except at early pumping times this is obviously due to the contribution of leakage from the aquitard to the pumped aquifer the response of drawdown in the aquitard occurs at the dimensionless pumping time td 10 attributed to the release of water stored in the aquitard except for the intermediate times the general drawdown characteristics in the aquitard is similar to that of the pumped aquifer and the only difference is that the effect of variable discharge is much less recognizable for the aquitard drawdown additionally the drawdown in the aquitard as expected is smaller than that of the pumped aquifer what is more the cases for neglecting the horizontal radial flow in the aquitard are incorporated in this figure considering the fact that the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the pumped aquifer the effect of the radial flow in the aquitard on the drawdown of the pumped aquifer can be ignored during the whole pumping period in contrast the influence of the horizontal radial flow in the aquitard on the aquitard drawdown is significant at the late pumping stage thus ignoring this influence will lead to overestimation of the aquitard drawdown at the late pumping stage no matter what the upper boundary condition of the aquitard is this finding suggests that if the aquitard drawdown is the major concern of the problem the horizontal radial flow in the aquitard is generally not negligible particularly for late times to further investigate the drawdown characteristics along the z direction under different top aquitard boundaries fig 4 demonstrates the profile of dimensionless drawdown at rd 0 1 in the aquitard aquifer zone for four specific pumping times td 0 1 1 10 102 and 103 note that the partially penetrating well having a dimensionless screen length of ld dd 0 5 is in the middle of the pumped aquifer it can be found that the drawdown at different depths of aquitard aquifer zone is the same with each other for case 1 and case2 except at the relatively late pumping time of td 103 the aquitard top boundaries affect the drawdown significantly and closer to the aquitard top the more apparent difference is between case 1 and case 2 as shown in fig 4 this indicates that one should not only be aware of the hydraulic relationship between the aquitard and the pumped aquifer but also needs to consider the influence of the type of aquitard top boundary if using the late time drawdown data to determine the hydraulic parameters of the pumped aquifer and the aquitard a notable point is that the drawdown induced by a partially penetrating pumping well at different depths of the aquitard aquifer system are different at the same radial distance from the pumping well this is due to two reasons first a partially penetrating well will inevitably generate vertical flow components of flow which vary with depth second treating the leakage from the aquitard to the pumped aquifer as an interface source rather than a depth averaged volumetric source as done with the hantush jacob approximation will lead to different vertical flow components at different depths the combination of these two reasons will lead to different drawdowns at different depth even with the same horizontal radial distance from the pumping well this finding implies that the location of the piezometer including the r and z coordinates must be clearly determined if the drawdown data collected from the piezometer are used for estimations of aquifer and aquitard hydraulic parameters for the purpose of illustration case 1 is chosen as an example to further analyze the drawdown responses in the following section one can use the same procedures to analyze the drawdown responses for case 2 if needed 4 3 effect of variable discharge parameters on drawdown in this section the dimensionless drawdown in the aquitard aquifer system is obtained under the condition of a partially penetrating well having an exponentially decayed discharge with time and the parameters used to describe the variable discharge are q 1 d and αd shown in eqs 5 and 13 fig 5 shows the response of the dimensionless drawdown in the pumped aquifer zd 0 5 and in the aquitard zd 1 1 at rd 0 1 for different q 1 d obviously q 1 d 1 denotes the special case of a constant rate the effect of q 1 d on drawdown in the pumped aquifer occurs only at early and intermediate pumping stages a larger q 1 d implies that the initial well discharge is much higher resulting in a larger drawdown as shown in the figure when the pumping rate approaches its late time constant drawdowns for different q 1 d approach the same value the drawdown close to the aquitard aquifer interface in the aquitard zd 1 1 however is influenced by the change of q 1 d at the initial stage of pumping this is because a greater volume of water has to be released from the aquitard storage to enter the pumped aquifer when a larger q 1 d is used thus generating a larger aquitard drawdown accordingly at late times however the aquitard drawdowns also approach the same asymptote similar to the situation in the pumped aquifer fig 6 demonstrates the dimensionless drawdown versus dimensionless time in the pumped aquifer zd 0 5 and in the aquitard zd 1 1 at rd 0 1 for different αd the drawdown in the pumped aquifer for the constant pumping rate case is also included in this figure as reference one can see that during the entire pumping period the pumped aquifer drawdowns somewhat agrees with each other for different decay constants with some minor to moderate discrepancies at the intermediate pumping stage a larger αd means that the pumping rate drops more quickly to its asymptotic constant discharge rate thus leading to smaller drawdowns at intermediate times 4 4 effect of anisotropy on drawdown fig 7 displays the drawdown response in the anisotropic pumped aquifer zd 0 5 for different anisotropy ratios kd 1 kz 1 kr 1 and in the isotropic aquitard zd 1 25 at rd 0 1 it can be seen from this figure that the aquifer anisotropy impacts the drawdowns in both aquitard and aquifer significantly over the whole pumping time a smaller aquifer anisotropy indicates that the permeability in the horizontal direction is larger than the permeability in the vertical direction so the horizontal flow component is dominant in the aquifer or the vertical flow component in the aquifer is suppressed resulting in more water released at early and intermediate pumping stages and greater drawdowns in the aquifer during those stages a smaller aquifer anisotropy also means that the time required for aquitard to response to aquifer pumping will be longer resulting in delayed drawdown in the aquitard as seen from fig 7 as well fig 8 illustrates the drawdowns in an isotropic aquifer kz 1 kr 1 10 4 m s and zd 0 9 and an anisotropic aquitard zd 1 25 for different unpumped layer anisotropy ratios at rd 0 1 the partially penetrating well is screened at the upper part of the pumped aquifer ld 1 0 and dd 0 5 to maximize the drawdown response and interaction between the two layers it should be noted that in fig 8 a the unpumped layer hydraulic conductivity in the vertical direction is fixed kz 2 10 6 m s and only the upper layer hydraulic conductivity in the horizontal direction kr 2 is changed on the contrary kr 2 is fixed and kz 2 is the changing parameter in fig 8 b the isotropic case for the upper layer kr 2 kz 2 is also included in this figure as a reference of comparison from fig 8 a one can easily see that the change of kr 2 has no influence on the aquifer drawdown adjacent to the interface between the aquitard and the pumped aquifer at early time the drawdown in the pumped aquifer is not affected when kr 2 kz 2 at intermediate and late times but when kr 2 increases above kz 2 the change of kr 2 on aquifer drawdown is evident at intermediate and late times however the response of aquitard drawdown is significant to the change of kr 2 especially at late time for the case of kz 2 kr 2 the aquifer drawdown at a location of zd 0 9 that is relatively close to the interface of flow exchange between the two layers zd 1 0 is greatly influenced by the change of kz 2 during the intermediate and late pumping periods as seen in fig 8 b a larger kz 2 will induce more leakage across the interface thus leads to a smaller aquifer drawdown at late time for drawdown in the upper layer because the well screen is located in the vicinity of the interface between the two layers when the vertical flow in the upper layer is dominant and vertical hydraulic conductivity for the upper layer is nearly close to that for the pumped aquifer in the case of kz 2 kr 2 the drawdown in the upper layer is affected by the variable pumping discharge and the decreasing stage of the drawdown can also be found it should be noted that above discussion is applicable for a general two layer system as the hydraulic conductivity of the upper layer is not always much smaller than that of the lower layer an assumption adopted for an aquitard aquifer system finally to further investigate the effect of anisotropy on the drawdown in the pumped aquifer the type curves of sd versus td for different anisotropy between the upper and lower layers are plotted in fig 9 where kd 1 kz 1 kr 1 kd 2 kz 2 kr 2 krd kr 2 kr 1 kzd kz 2 kz 2 kd and rd 0 1 and the case of single layer aquifer no leakage for different anisotropy and the case of a constant pumping rate are also included for comparison it is shown in this figure that the drawdown in the pumped aquifer is gradually close to that in a single confined aquifer with the decreasing of the permeability contrast between the upper and lower layers one can see that the upper layer can be regarded as an impermeable layer when kd 10 4 and the flow exchange between the two layers is significant at a relatively large pumping time 4 5 effect of well configuration and aquitard storage on drawdown for a partially penetrating well in aquitard aquifer system the drawdowns in the aquitard and the pumped aquifer are influenced by the location and length of the well screen fig 10 displays the late time drawdown response td 104 zd 0 9 and 1 25 at different radial distances for the change of different screen locations and lengths fig 10 a shows that the effect of the screen location on the drawdown is sufficient in vicinity of the pumping well the similar phenomenon can also be found for a well with different screen lengths as shown in fig 10 b note that the top elevation of the well screen is fixed at the aquitard aquifer interface ld 1 and a smaller drawdown can be found for a larger well screen length it can also be seen from the figure that the effect of the well configuration on drawdown can be ignored at the dimensionless rd 1 to explore the effect of the aquitard storage on drawdown fig 11 shows the dimensionless drawdown response in the aquitard zd 1 1 and in the pumped aquifer zd 0 5 for different aquitard aquifer specific storage ratio ssd at rd 0 1 it should be noted that the no leakage case is also considered in this figure one can see that the effect of the aquitard storage is mainly significant at intermediate times and a smaller ssd means less water provided by the aquitard leading to a larger drawdown which is closer to that for the case without leakage feng and zhan 2015 on the other hand a greater ssd indicates that the time for the influence of the aquitard storage is much earlier and lasts longer accordingly the storativity cannot be neglected for a relatively thick aquitard 4 6 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is often adopted to reveal how different parameters could influence the drawdown in groundwater literature kabala 2001 huang and yeh 2007 sedghi et al 2018 feng and zhan 2019 the method of the normalized sensitivity analysis presented by huang and yeh 2007 is used in this study and the sensitivity coefficient is defined as 21 x i j p j o i p j p j o i p j δ p j o i p j δ p j in which x i j refers to the normalized sensitivity caused by the j th parameter pj at the i th time oi indicates the dimensionless drawdown response and δpj denotes a small increment and δpj 10 2 pj in the following analysis note that the absolute normalized sensitivity of x i j is used here for comparison the default parameter values are given as b 1 20 m kr 1 10 4 m s kz 1 10 5 m s ss 1 2 10 5 m 1 b 2 30 m kr 2 10 5 m s kz 2 10 6 m s ss 2 10 3 m 1 q 1 0 005 m3 s q 0 002 m3 s α 0 005 m 1 r 2 m l 15 m d 5 m z 10 m and 25 m note that the well screen is located at the middle part of the pumped aquifer and the responses of the drawdown at the middle of the pumped aquifer sd 1 and the aquitard sd 2 are observed respectively figs 12 and 13 demonstrate respectively the sensitivity of sd 1 and the sd 2 for case 1 and case 2 to the pumped aquifer hydraulic parameters kr 1 kz 1 ss 1 the aquitard hydraulic parameters kr 2 kz 2 ss 2 the variable discharge parameters q 1 α and well structure parameters l d from fig 12 a and b one can see that the degree of sensitivity of sd 1 for cases 1 and 2 with respect to the corresponding parameters are almost the same except at t d 104 one can find in these two figures that the change of l and d has great influence on sd 1 during the entire pumping time and maintains constant at late times the effect of the relative variation of q 1 on sd 1 increases gradually with pumping time arrives at the peak value near td 0 4 then decreases gradually until near td 0 4 when the well discharge is stabilized and the relative degree of sensitivity q 1 is higher than that to d and smaller than that to l when 10 4 td 10 it is note that the effects of kr 1 ss 1 kz 1 and α on sd 1 are significant in the period 0 1 td 50 and the sensitivities with respect to ss 1 and α are the same which is larger than that to kz 1 and smaller than that to kr 1 another phenomenon for the disappearance of the influence of α on sd 1 can be found with the pumping rate maintaining constant as expected during the period 50 td 104 sd 1 is moderately sensitive to the change of kr 1 and kz 1 meanwhile the influences of kz 2 ss 1 and ss 2 on sd 1 are minor and the influences of others can be neglected at the late pumping time however fig 12 a shows that sd 1 for case1 is only moderately affected by the change of kr 1 which has a larger sensitivity than that for kz 1 and kz 2 with the same sensitivity fig 12 b demonstrates that the effects of kr 1 kz 1 ss 1 and ss 2 on sd 1 for case 2 are significant and are somewhat the same fig 12 suggests that the effect of kr 2 on sd 1 can be ignored during the whole pumping stage fig 13 shows that the changes of q 1 and α have no influence on sd 2 in addition the sensitivity of sd 2 with respect to l and d starts at near td 120 and approaches their largest stable value at late time and the degree of sensitivity to l is larger than that to d fig 13 a implies that the effects of ss 1 and ss 2 on sd 2 are only significant in the period 100 td 4 104 and their sensitivities are the same moreover sd 2 is very sensitive to the change of kr 1 and kz 2 in the period 100 td 4 104 and becomes moderately sensitive those parameters at the late pumping time the effects of kr 2 and kz 1 on sd 2 are similar to that of l in general sd 2 for case 1 is very sensitive to the change of l and is moderately sensitive to kr 1 kr 2 kz 1 kz 2 and d at late times and the sensitivities for kr 1 kr 2 kz 1 and kz 2 are almost the same fig 13 b demonstrates that the sensitivities of sd 2 for case 2 with respect to ss 1 ss 2 kr 1 and kz 2 begin to increase from td near 100 reach their maximum values and then decrease gradually until approaching their respective asymptotes at late time additionally the effects of kr 2 and kz 1 on sd 2 are similar to that of l which is not repeated here what is more the degrees of sensitivity to ss 1 and ss 2 are somewhat the same and the degrees of sensitivity to d and kz 2 are also almost the same with each other all the hydraulic parameters in the pumped aquifer and the aquitard have significant influence on sd 2 for case 2 specifically at late times sd 2 for case 2 is most sensitive to the change of l and the effects of kr 2 and kz 2 on sd 2 are moderate finally one can see that the degree of sensitivity to different hydraulic parameters for case 1 is a slightly smaller than that for case 2 5 application of the solution the newly developed solution can be applied to predict the drawdown response to the pumping in an observation well or piezometer investigate the effects of variable pumping rate anisotropy aquitard storage well screen length and its location and the type of top boundary on the drawdown and determine the hydraulic parameters of aquitard and pumped aquifer in aquifer tests and data analyses additionally our solutions also have a great potential application value in other related field such as in petroleum engineering geotechnical engineering and geothermal engineering there are some suggestions for using the solution from this study firstly the well configuration should be known when using the drawdown data in vicinity of the pumping well and the type of the top boundary of the upper layer should be especially noted when collecting the late time drawdown data secondly the dimensionless drawdown in the pumped layer for different cases is sensitive to kr 1 kz 1 and ss 1 at intermediate time so the drawdown data collected in this stage are more valuable to obtain their values if the pumping time is enough large the late time drawdown data can also be used to estimate the values of the hydraulic conductivity in the horizontal and vertical direction for the lower layer and to determine ss 1 for case 2 thirdly the data of drawdown in the upper layer at intermediate time are more reliable to estimate kz 2 and ss 2 and the drawdown data at late time is more suitable for determining the value of horizontal hydraulic conductivity values of the upper aquitard fourthly if reversing the pumping to injection by simply change the sign of q from positive to negative one can use the solution developed here for assessing the two layer aquifer response to managed artificial recharge mar lastly the reason to choose an aquitard aquifer system as examples in the analysis of section 4 is mostly for the purpose of comparison with previous studies which almost exclusively concentrated on an aquitard aquifer system with distinctively different aquitard and aquifer permeability values in fact the solution developed in this study is much more general with essentially no constrains on the permeability contrast of the two layers therefore the developed solution can be directly applied to a two layer system with moderate permeability contrast the solution may also be applied to a system consisting of an aquifer and a highly permeable layer such as a filled fracture or a fault gauge this study also has a few limitations that should be addressed briefly first the pumping rate is expected to follow an exponential function of time if the pumping rate varies with time with a different function then the solution needs to be redeveloped one may consult the details of supplementary materials for any other types of pumping functions second like most analytical works this study does not address the aquifer heterogeneity problem therefore the solution developed here may be regarded as the averaged solution of an ensemble of statistically similar but heterogeneous aquifers 6 summary and conclusions a semi analytical dimensionless drawdown solution for flow to a partially penetrating constant well with time dependent pumping rate in an anisotropic two layer aquifer system is obtained by the method of laplace hankel transform with considering the interface flow between the two layers note that the effect of different top boundary including constant head case1 and no flux boundary case 2 conditions at the top of the upper layer has been taken into account the spatiotemporal solutions are obtained by numerically performing the inverse laplace hankel transforms the characteristics of the drawdown induced by a partially penetrating well with an exponentially decaying discharge are discussed for a two layer aquifer system and sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate how sensitive the drawdown is to different parameters under different cases the following findings can be concluded from this study 1 the drawdown around a partially penetrating well in the pumped lower layer induced by an exponential decreasing pumping rate usually contains three stages that is the stage associated with the initial high well discharge at early time the stage associated with the decreasing well discharge at intermediate time and the stage associated with the final constant well discharge at late time the drawdown decreases with time momentarily at the intermediate pumping stage 2 the drawdowns at the any depth of the two layer system are affected by different top boundaries of the upper layer at late times only and the drawdowns for case 1 is generally large than that for case 2 significant deviations between case 1 and case 2 can be found in the vicinity of the top boundary of the upper layer 3 a larger initial pumping rate leads to a larger drawdown in the pumped lower aquifer over time except at the final constant pumping stage and a larger decay constant of the variable discharge results in a smaller drawdown only at the declining discharge pumping stage a larger initial discharge and a smaller decay constant cause a larger drawdown in the upper layer near the interface of the two layers initially and their influences die out at late times 4 the effect of anisotropy of the pumped lower aquifer has great influence on the drawdown distribution in both layers the effect of the horizontal flow in the upper layer can be neglected when the horizontal hydraulic conductivity in the upper layer is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the hydraulic conductivity in the lower layer i e a typical aquitard aquifer system but it is generally not negligible at late times 5 the pumping well screen length and location have significant influence on the drawdown close to the pumping well and the influences can be neglected at a radial distance from the pumping well greater than the thickness of the lower layer additionally the storage of the upper layer cannot be ignored in calculating the drawdowns in both lower pumped and upper unpumped layers 6 the drawdown in the lower layer is very sensitive to the change of well configuration during the entire pumping time and is only sensitive to the change of kr 1 kz 1 and kz 2 for case 1 and to the change of kr 1 kz 1 ss 1 and ss 2 for case 2 at late times 7 the drawdown in the upper layer is not sensitive to the change of variable well discharge parameters over the whole pumping period and is not sensitive to the variation of ss 1 and ss 2 for case 1 as well however it is sensitive to all the hydraulic parameters and well configuration parameters for case 2 at late times declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
