analytical solutions of hydrodynamic pressure and hydrodynamic force on elliptical hollow cylinder are accurately derived by assigning reasonable boundary conditions and by solving the mathieu s differential equation in elliptical coordinate system added mass expressions distributed over the height of the cylinder are used to represent the hydrodynamic interaction effects which are extracted from the hydrodynamic force expressions these added mass expressions are so complicated that lead to their value difficult to be calculated therefore these added mass expressions are dealt with dimensionless method and are simplified by curve fitting method in this study the simplified formulas are only relevant to three dimensionless parameters including width depth ratio ratio of long to short axis of the ellipse and relative distance above base the calculation results show that the simplified formulas are in good agreement with the analytical solutions keywords earthquake hydrodynamic pressure elliptical cylinder added mass simplified formula 1 introduction offshore structures may be subjected to significant hydrodynamic pressures during earthquakes which influences the dynamic response and dynamic properties of these structures such as intake towers oil storage tanks and bridge piers therefore to design an offshore structure the evaluation of the hydrodynamic pressure on the structure is an important task the estimation of hydrodynamic pressure on a circular cylinder has been studied by many researchers liaw and chopra 1974 investigated the significance of hydrodynamic pressures on the earthquake response of cantilever circular cylinders the authors discovered that water compressibility was negligible for slender cylinders but important for squat cylinders vibrating at high frequency and the surface waves was significant only at very low frequencies moreover the effect of the hydrodynamic pressure can be conveniently modeled as an added mass when surface wave and water compressibility are ignored williams 1986 utilized the boundary integral method to calculate the dynamic response of circular cylinders subjected to high frequency horizontal ground excitation tanaka and hudspeth 1988 presented an eigenfunction for the dynamic response of circular cylinders to earthquake excitation in compressible water han and xu 1996 presented a theoretical model of an added mass representation for a flexible circular cylinder vibrating in water and presented a simple formula for evaluating the natural frequencies using the added mass representation chen 1997 developed a finite difference scheme to solve nonlinear hydrodynamic pressures acting on a circular cylinder during earthquakes liu et al 2008 presented hydrodynamic pressure expressions for circular hollow bridge piers caused by outer and inner water which were modified and simplified by li and yang 2013 in some extent du et al 2014 proposed a simplified formula of hydrodynamic force on circular cylinders in the time domain based on the analytical solution which is expressed in the form of added mass in low frequency vibration and in the form of added mass and added damping in high frequency vibration yang and li 2013a proposed the expanded morison equation to calculate the hydrodynamic force of hollow circular piers caused by inner water some researchers have also investigated the earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure on an axisymmetric cylinder liaw and chopra 1975 used the finite element method to analyze the response of axisymmetric tower partly submerged in water subjected to earthquake ground motion sun and nogami 1991 proposed a semi analytical and semi numerical approach for axisymmetric cylinders which can model accurately the water compressibility and gravity waves on the water surface park et al 1991 utilized the finite element technique incorporating the infinite element to evaluate hydrodynamic pressure on axisymmetric cylinders avilés and li 2001 proposed a boundary method to evaluate the hydrodynamic pressure on rigid axisymmetric cylinders in the compressible water on the flexible bedrock in addition goyal and chopra 1989 developed a simplified procedure to evaluate the added mass for intake tower with two symmetric axes cross section yang and li 2013b presented a new added mass method to calculate hydrodynamic pressure on piers with arbitrary cross section which was based on the fundamental frequency reduction rate of piers in this paper we investigate earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure on elliptical hollow cylinders caused by outer water and inner water the elliptical coordinates are used by williams 1985 and bhatta 2005 to deduce the analytical expressions for the wave force on vertical cylinders with elliptical cross section to derive the analytical solution for the earthquake induced hydrodynamic force on elliptical hollow cylinders we also use the elliptical coordinates in case of the ground motion along the major axis and along the minor axis the ellipse these analytical solutions are obtained in terms of circumferential mathieu functions and radial mathieu functions by using the method of separation of variables however those analytical solutions are not suitable for engineering application because their expressions are extremely complicated we use the self made programs based on special math software matlab to calculate the value of those expressions furthermore those complicated analytical expressions are simplified by curve fitting method comparing the simplified formula with the analytical solution the results show that the simplified formula is accurate and concise enough for engineering applications 2 differential equation and boundary condition the system of the interaction between the vertical cylinder and water is shown in fig 1 the vertical cylinder is simplified as an elliptical hollow cylinder with the bottom fixed at the rigid ground water is assumed to be incompressible and inviscid as shown in fig 1 a and b are outside semi major and semi minor axes a 1 and b 1 are inside semi major and semi minor axes of the elliptic cross section and the water depth is h the water is treated as calm before the action of earthquake and only the radiation wave would be simulated under earthquake a harmonic wave with frequency ω is considered here as the seismic excitation and the displacement response of the cylinder can be expressed as u t u e i ω t here u is the amplitude t is time frequency ω is considered here as the seismic excitation and the displacement response of the cylinder can be expressed as u t here u is the amplitude t is time it is a property of linear time invariant systems that when the excitation is a simple harmonic motion steady state response is also a simple harmonic motion at the same frequency liaw and chopra 1974 therefore the small amplitude irrotational motion is governed by the laplace s equation in cartesian coordinate system which can be expressed as 1 2 p x 2 2 p y 2 2 p z 2 0 where p x y z t denotes the hydrodynamic pressure the elliptic coordinate system is depicted in fig 2 the transformation from cartesian coordinate to elliptical coordinate is 2a x μ cosh ξ cos η 2b y μ sinh ξ sin η where μ a 2 b 2 ξ and η are orthogonally intersecting families of confocal ellipses and hyperbolas respectively the coordinate of the surface of the elliptical cylinder is expressed by 3 ξ ξ 0 tan 1 b a where a a and b b for outer water a a 1 and b b 1 for inner water the coordinate ξ 0 express the straight line of length thus eq 1 can be rewritten as 4 1 μ 2 cosh 2 ξ cos 2 η 2 p ξ 2 2 p η 2 2 p z 2 0 which is equivalent to 5 2 μ 2 cosh 2 ξ cos 2 η 2 p ξ 2 2 p η 2 2 p z 2 0 according to liaw and chopra 1974 the effects of surrounding water can be entirely equivalent to an added mass when water is incompressible in reality the cylinder is flexible li and yang 2013 investigated the added mass caused by elastic vibration and rigid motion of the flexible circular cylinder the results indicated that the added mass caused by elastic vibration is approximately equal to added mass caused by rigid motion of the cylinder thus the elliptical cylinder is assumed to be rigid in this study according to li and yang 2013 free surface wave with higher frequency has less effect on the hydrodynamic force on cylinders in deep water no matter the hydrodynamic force is caused by outer water or inner water namely free surface wave could be ignored if the frequency is higher in general the earthquake frequency and the structural frequency are higher liaw and chopra 1974 also found that free surface wave was of little consequence in the earthquake response of towers surrounded by water therefore free surface waves are assumed to be not generated in this study it is also assumed that the water domain is of infinite extend for outer water therefore the boundary conditions to be satisfied are as follows 1 no vertical motion at the boundary z 0 i e 6 p z z 0 0 2 the hydrodynamic pressure at the free surface of the water is zero 7 p z h 0 3 the outward normal acceleration of the water in contact with the elliptical cylinder is equal to that of the structural surface thus at the interface of structural and water in case of the ground motion in the direction of the major axis of elliptical cylinder p should satisfy 8 p ξ ξ ξ 0 ρ 2 u 2 t b cos η and in case of the ground motion in the direction of the minor axis of elliptical cylinder p should satisfy 9 p ξ ξ ξ 0 ρ 2 u 2 t a sin η 4 in case of the ground motion in the direction of the major axis of elliptical cylinder the symmetry conditions about η 0 plan are given by 10a p η η 0 0 10b p η 0 5 π 0 in case of the ground motion in the direction of the minor axis of elliptical cylinder the symmetry conditions about η 0 5π plan are given by 11a p η η 0 5 π 0 11b p η 0 0 5 for outer water the pressure waves propagate away from the structure and decay with the traveling distance so that the hydrodynamic pressure at infinite is zero 12 p ξ 0 3 solution of the differential equation under the above assumptions and the arrangement of the coordinate systems the hydrodynamic pressure is set as p p ξ η z e i ω t no matter it is caused by outer water or inner water therefore eq 5 can be rewritten as 13 2 μ 2 cosh 2 ξ cos 2 η 2 p ξ 2 2 p η 2 2 p z 2 0 the method of separation of variables is used to solve this problem and p ξ η z can be expressed as 14 p r ξ g η z z substituting eq 14 into eq 13 and separating z first the result can be written as 15 2 μ 2 cosh 2 ξ cos 2 η 1 f 2 f ξ 2 1 g 2 g η 2 1 z 2 z z 2 λ 2 where λ is the constant of separation separating the variables ξ and η the result can be written as 16 1 r 2 r ξ 2 μ 2 λ 2 2 cosh 2 ξ 1 g 2 g η 2 μ 2 λ 2 2 cos 2 η a 0 where a 0 is the constant of separation eqs 15 and 16 yield the following three ordinary differential equations 17 2 z z 2 λ 2 z 0 18 2 g η 2 a 0 2 q cos 2 η g 0 19 2 r ξ 2 a 0 2 q cosh 2 ξ r 0 in which q μ 2 λ 2 4 taking boundary conditions eqs 6 and 7 into consideration the solutions of eq 17 are 20 z z d j cos λ z where d j is unknown constant λ 2 j 1 π 2 h j 1 2 eq 18 is modified circumferential mathieu s differential equation whose solutions are periodic

and i o n ξ q are the modified radial first kind mathieu functions k e n ξ q and k o n ξ q are the modified radial second kind mathieu functions by mathematical analysis it is obvious that when independent variable ξ approaches to infinity the value of both k e n ξ q and k o n ξ q tend to 0 however i e n ξ q and i o n ξ q tend to infinity 3 1 outer water taking boundary conditions eqs 8 10

36 the hydrodynamic force on the elliptical cylinder caused by surrounding water under earthquake can be conveniently modeled as the product of an added mass of water and the acceleration of the structure furtherly the added mass for a cylinder associated with hydrodynamic effects of surrounding water can be conveniently modeled as the product of the added mass coefficient and the added mass per unit of height eqs 27 31 34 and 37 are the added mass coefficients in fact it is very troublesome to calculate the added mass coefficient because of the complexity of eqs 27 31 34 and 37 self made programs based on special math software such as mathematica matlab and maple seem to be indispensable for calculating the value of those complicate expressions that becomes an obstacle to block the engineering application of the presented analytical solutions therefore it is extremely necessary to simplify these complicated expressions in this section the added mass coefficient is dealt with dimensionless method and it is simplified by numerical analysis three dimensionless parameters are introduced to analyze the added mass coefficients which are width depth ratio l ratio of long to short axis δ and relative height z 38 l d h 39 δ a b 40 z z h in which d 2 b in case of the ground motion along the major axis and d 2 a in case of the ground motion along the minor axis eqs 27 31 34 and 37 indicate that the added mass coefficients m x o u t m y o u t m x i n and m y i n are dimensionless which are only relevant to parameters l δ and z the added mass coefficients under different l in the case of δ 2 and under different δ in the case of l 2 are shown in figs 3 and 4 it can be observed that the added mass coefficients decrease with increasing parameter z and the value is 0 when z is equal to 1 based on the above analysis the analytical expressions of the added mass coefficients can be replaced by the following simple expression 41 m z α 1 z e β z 1 in which α and β can be obtained by curve fitting method in this study with the curve fitting toolbox in matlab attaway 2013 the value of parameters α and β at different value of width depth ratio l and ratio of long to short axis δ can be calculated by using eq 41 to fit the analytical formula eqs 27 31 34 and 37 similarly parameters α and β can be further fitted as simple mathematical formulas which are the functions depend on variables l and δ by fitting the corresponding data in eq 41 these formulas for outer water and inner water are discussed in section 4 1 and 4 2 respectively 4 1 outer water

submerged in water subjected to earthquake ground motion sun and nogami 1991 proposed a semi analytical and semi numerical approach for axisymmetric cylinders which can model accurately the water compressibility and gravity waves on the water surface park et al 1991 utilized the finite element technique incorporating the infinite element to evaluate hydrodynamic pressure on axisymmetric cylinders avilés and li 2001 proposed a boundary method to evaluate the hydrodynamic pressure on rigid axisymmetric cylinders in the compressible water on the flexible bedrock in addition goyal and chopra 1989 developed a simplified procedure to evaluate the added mass for intake tower with two symmetric axes cross section yang and li 2013b presented a new added mass method to calculate hydrodynamic pressure on piers with arbitrary cross section which was based on the fundamental frequency reduction rate of piers in this paper we investigate earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure on elliptical hollow cylinders caused by outer water and inner water the elliptical coordinates are used by williams 1985 and bhatta 2005 to deduce the analytical expressions for the wave force on vertical cylinders with elliptical cross section to derive the analytical solution for the earthquake induced hydrodynamic force on elliptical hollow cylinders we also use the elliptical coordinates in case of the ground motion along the major axis and along the minor axis the ellipse these analytical solutions are obtained in terms of circumferential mathieu functions and radial mathieu functions by using the method of separation of variables however those analytical solutions are not suitable for engineering application because their expressions are extremely complicated we use the self made programs based on special math software matlab to calculate the value of those expressions furthermore those complicated analytical expressions are simplified by curve fitting method comparing the simplified formula with the analytical solution the results show that the simplified formula is accurate and concise enough for engineering applications 2 differential equation and boundary condition the system of the interaction between the vertical cylinder and water is shown in fig 1 the vertical cylinder is simplified as an elliptical hollow cylinder with the bottom fixed at the rigid ground water is assumed to be incompressible and inviscid as shown in fig 1 a and b are outside semi major and semi minor axes a 1 and b 1 are inside semi major and semi minor axes of the elliptic cross section and the water depth is h the water is treated as calm before the action of earthquake and only the radiation wave would be simulated under earthquake a harmonic wave with frequency ω is considered here as the seismic excitation and the displacement response of the cylinder can be expressed as u t u e i ω t here u is the amplitude t is time frequency ω is considered here as the seismic excitation and the displacement response of the cylinder can be expressed as u t here u is the amplitude t is time it is a property of linear time invariant systems that when the excitation is a simple harmonic motion steady state response is also a simple harmonic motion at the same frequency liaw and chopra 1974 therefore the small amplitude irrotational motion is governed by the laplace s equation in cartesian coordinate system which can be expressed as 1 2 p x 2 2 p y 2 2 p z 2 0 where p x y z t denotes the hydrodynamic pressure the elliptic coordinate system is depicted in fig 2 the transformation from cartesian coordinate to elliptical coordinate is 2a x μ cosh ξ cos η 2b y μ sinh ξ sin η where μ a 2 b 2 ξ and η are orthogonally intersecting families of confocal ellipses and hyperbolas respectively the coordinate of the surface of the elliptical cylinder is expressed by 3 ξ ξ 0 tan 1 b a where a a and b b for outer water a a 1 and b b 1 for inner water the coordinate ξ 0 express the straight line of length thus eq 1 can be rewritten as 4 1 μ 2 cosh 2 ξ cos 2 η 2 p ξ 2 2 p η 2 2 p z 2 0 which is equivalent to 5 2 μ 2 cosh 2 ξ cos 2 η 2 p ξ 2 2 p η 2 2 p z 2 0 according to liaw and chopra 1974 the effects of surrounding water can be entirely equivalent to an added mass when water is incompressible in reality the cylinder is flexible li and yang 2013 investigated the added mass caused by elastic vibration and rigid motion of the flexible circular cylinder the results indicated that the added mass caused by elastic vibration is approximately equal to added mass caused by rigid motion of the cylinder thus the elliptical cylinder is assumed to be rigid in this study according to li and yang 2013 free surface wave with higher frequency has less effect on the hydrodynamic force on cylinders in deep water no matter the hydrodynamic force is caused by outer water or inner water namely free surface wave could be ignored if the frequency is higher in general the earthquake frequency and the structural frequency are higher liaw and chopra 1974 also found that free surface wave was of little consequence in the earthquake response of towers surrounded by water therefore free surface waves are assumed to be not generated in this study it is also assumed that the water domain is of infinite extend for outer water therefore the boundary conditions to be satisfied are as follows 1 no vertical motion at the boundary z 0 i e 6 p z z 0 0 2 the hydrodynamic pressure at the free surface of the water is zero 7 p z h 0 3 the outward normal acceleration of the water in contact with the elliptical cylinder is equal to that of the structural surface thus at the interface of structural and water in case of the ground motion in the direction of the major axis of elliptical cylinder p should satisfy 8 p ξ ξ ξ 0 ρ 2 u 2 t b cos η and in case of the ground motion in the direction of the minor axis of elliptical cylinder p should satisfy 9 p ξ ξ ξ 0 ρ 2 u 2 t a sin η 4 in case of the ground motion in the direction of the major axis of elliptical cylinder the symmetry conditions about η 0 plan are given by 10a p η η 0 0 10b p η 0 5 π 0 in case of the ground motion in the direction of the minor axis of elliptical cylinder the symmetry conditions about η 0 5π plan are given by 11a p η η 0 5 π 0 11b p η 0 0 5 for outer water the pressure waves propagate away from the structure and decay with the traveling distance so that the hydrodynamic pressure at infinite is zero 12 p ξ 0 3 solution of the differential equation under the above assumptions and the arrangement of the coordinate systems the hydrodynamic pressure is set as p p ξ η z e i ω t no matter it is caused by outer water or inner water therefore eq 5 can be rewritten as 13 2 μ 2 cosh 2 ξ cos 2 η 2 p ξ 2 2 p η 2 2 p z 2 0 the method of separation of variables is used to solve this problem and p ξ η z can be expressed as 14 p r ξ g η z z substituting eq 14 into eq 13 and separating z first the result can be written as 15 2 μ 2 cosh 2 ξ cos 2 η 1 f 2 f ξ 2 1 g 2 g η 2 1 z 2 z z 2 λ 2 where λ is the constant of separation separating the variables ξ and η the result can be written as 16 1 r 2 r ξ 2 μ 2 λ 2 2 cosh 2 ξ 1 g 2 g η 2 μ 2 λ 2 2 cos 2 η a 0 where a 0 is the constant of separation eqs 15 and 16 yield the following three ordinary differential equations 17 2 z z 2 λ 2 z 0 18 2 g η 2 a 0 2 q cos 2 η g 0 19 2 r ξ 2 a 0 2 q cosh 2 ξ r 0 in which q μ 2 λ 2 4 taking boundary conditions eqs 6 and 7 into consideration the

and i o n ξ q are the modified radial first kind mathieu functions k e n ξ q and k o n ξ q are the modified radial second kind mathieu functions by mathematical analysis it is obvious that when independent variable ξ approaches to infinity the value of both k e n ξ q and k o n ξ q tend to 0 however i e n ξ q and i o n ξ q tend to infinity 3 1 outer water taking boundary conditions eqs 8 10

36 the hydrodynamic force on the elliptical cylinder caused by surrounding water under earthquake can be conveniently modeled as the product of an added mass of water and the acceleration of the structure furtherly the added mass for a cylinder associated with hydrodynamic effects of surrounding water can be conveniently modeled as the product of the added mass coefficient and the added mass per unit of height eqs 27 31 34 and 37 are the added mass coefficients in fact it is very troublesome to calculate the added mass coefficient because of the complexity of eqs 27 31 34 and 37 self made programs based on special math software such as mathematica matlab and maple seem to be indispensable for calculating the value of those complicate expressions that becomes an obstacle to block the engineering application of the presented analytical solutions therefore it is extremely necessary to simplify these complicated expressions in this section the added mass coefficient is dealt with dimensionless method and it is simplified by numerical analysis three dimensionless parameters are introduced to analyze the added mass coefficients which are width depth ratio l ratio of long to short axis δ and relative height z 38 l d h 39 δ a b 40 z z h in which d 2 b in case of the ground motion along the major axis and d 2 a in case of the ground motion along the minor axis eqs 27 31 34 and 37 indicate that the added mass coefficients m x o u t m y o u t m x i n and m y i n are dimensionless which are only relevant to parameters l δ and z the added mass coefficients under different l in the case of δ 2 and under different δ in the case of l 2 are shown in figs 3 and 4 it can be observed that the added mass coefficients decrease with increasing parameter z and the value is 0 when z is equal to 1 based on the above analysis the analytical expressions of the added mass coefficients can be replaced by the following simple expression 41 m z α 1 z e β z 1 in which α and β can be obtained by curve fitting method in this study with the curve fitting toolbox in matlab attaway 2013 the value of parameters α and β at different value of width depth ratio l and ratio of long to short axis δ can be calculated by using eq 41 to fit the analytical formula eqs 27 31 34 and 37 similarly parameters α and β can be further fitted as simple mathematical formulas which are the functions depend on variables l and δ by fitting the corresponding data in eq 41 these formulas for outer water and inner water are discussed in section 4 1 and 4 2 respectively 4 1 outer water

as sank hold flooding broke in two crushing bow bent down local hull girder failure etc during the period of seven years from 1968 to 1974 was drawn buckley 1978 turning to the other there were 150 bulk carriers which were lost with a loss of more than 12000 lives paik et al 1998 the loss of ships is classified into three categories namely loss of buoyancy or floating capacity hull girder collapse loss and loss of stability as in fig 1 in this regards hull girder loss includes the increase of hull girder loads and the decrease of hull girder strength hold flooding loading and unloading conditions or sea states lead to the change of hull girder loads while the factors related corrosion cracks and dents lead to the degradation of hull girder strength capacity even hull girder collapse yamamoto 2015 under the ultimate hull girder strength uhgs requirements the international association of classification societies common structural rules iacs csr requires that all of the bulk carriers and oil tankers equal to or greater than 150 m in length must be checked for the seagoing condition to ensure that they can satisfy the residual strength checking criteria iacs 2017 specifically the longitudinal strength of an aging ship must be greater than 90 of the original state of new building the aging ships always contain the influential factors such as initial imperfections including initial deflections and residual stresses and corrosion wastage including pitting corrosion and general corrosion denting and fatigue cracks which affect considerably on the

corrosion models were established to predict the corrosion wear and corrosion process and they can be classified into two main categories the first category covers all the models that do not include time of coating life in their assumptions this means that the corrosion appears immediately once ships begin operation the second category includes all other remaining models one major idea assumed by these corrosion models is that all coating protection systems remain effective during the coating life time hence no corrosion may occur throughout this period after that corrosion on the steel surface may either appear immediately or follow a transition time before emerging paik et al conducted a survey with a total of 7503 corrosion data for 16 primary member types in 44 existing bulk carriers then a probabilistic corrosion rate estimation model was developed hence we consider this model as the most suitable among other options in assessing the effect of corrosion on the hull girder ultimate strength of bulk carriers as indicated in fig 5 the corrosion model is divided into two phases one related the coating life and another concerned with the progress of corrosion but without transition duration paik et al 1998 the corrosion rate r t and corrosion wear d t are defined respectively as paik et al 2003a 7 r t c 1 8 d t c 1 t t 0 c 2 where c 1 is the annualized corrosion rate which follows the weibull distribution c 2 is the coefficient and assumed to be 1 0 t is the ship age and t 0 is the coating life the mean value of the annualized corrosion rate was collected and calculated for 23 different structural categories of a bulk carrier with two corrosion levels namely average and severe an average coating life was assumed as 7 5 years except for inner bottom plating and lower sloping plate which have the life of coating of 5 years paik et al 2003b 3 modification of the applied methods the ultimate compressive strength of elements are determined by equations 4 6 equations 4 5 are employed to calculate the ultimate compressive strength of plate elements with an average level of initial imperfections while equation 6 is applied to obtain the ultimate compressive strength of the plate stiffener combination elements to take into account the initial imperfections including initial distortions and residual stresses the effective width b e of attached plating is employed and replaced the attached plating b the effective width is determined as the following formula vhanmane and bhattacharya 2008 9 b e b σ x a v σ r x σ m a x where σ xav is the average value of the applied axial compressive stress σ max is maximum value of the axial compressive stresses and σ rx is the welding induced residual stress in the plating when the axial

to cover the corrosion wastage the corrosion wear d t is added into the attached plate thickness t p stiffener web thickness t w and stiffener flange thickness t f of each structural element as 10 1 t

the initial stiffener flange thickness following the above mentioned modifications the structures will be added both initial imperfections and corrosion wastage consequently the ultimate bending moment of ship hull associated the unperfected structures will be assessed this is also the methodology which can apply to investigate the effect of uncertain parameters on the ultimate strength of ships or ship shaped structures 4 selected ships and results 4 1 applied ships a capesize bulk carrier and a handymax bulk carrier are applied to assess the effect of uncertain factors on the ultimate vertical bending moment capacity table 2 presents the main principles of selected ships while figs 6 7 illustrate the structures of the mid ship sections 4 2 calculation results table 3 illustrates the height of the collapsed and yielded parts of selected bulk carriers as determined by the modified paik mansour method it is obvious that only capesize bulk carrier has the yielded area it means that the tension flange is allowed to expand the ultimate bending moment ubm of selected ships are obtained by eq 3 at the beginning the intact structure is considered and the ubm of ship a for hogging condition is m uh0 19 213 mpa while this value for sagging condition is m us0 17 984 mpa for ship b the ubm is 6578 mpa and 6464 mpa respectively the initial imperfections including initial distortions and residual stresses are taken into account to determine the ubm table 4 and fig 8 show the ubm changes for hogging and sagging conditions under three different levels of initial imperfections namely slight average and severe regarding to the effect of corrosion wastage on the ubm two levels of corrosion wastage namely average and severe are employed and the ratios of m u and m u0 are shown in table 5 combined with fig 9 in tables 6 and 7 sli is the slight level of initial imperfections ave is the average level of initial imperfections sev is the severe level of initial imperfections the effect of initial imperfections with corrosion wastage on the hull girder strength of selected bulk carriers is carried out the combination is made by the average corrosion level and three different levels of initial imperfections which is shown in table 6 and fig 10 meanwhile table 7 and fig 11 present the ubm reduction associated the severe corrosion level combined with different levels of initial imperfections 5 discussions 5 1 variations of the ultimate vertical bending moment the uncertain factors such as initial imperfections and corrosion wastage influence differently and significantly on the ubm of bulk carriers which depend on the type or degree of these factors the ubm is also affected by the combination between the uncertain factors this section will show the effect of them on the ubm as followings the ubm reduction is up and down 0 2 2 9 and 13 0 ship a or 0 2 1 8 and 9 6 ship b under the effect of slight level average level and severe level of initial imperfections respectively as in table 4 and fig 8 it can be seen that the ultimate bending moment of capesize bulk carrier does not satisfy the iacs requirement in case of severe level of initial imperfections in this case the residual strength of ship hull is not enough and safe to operate and it needs to be considered significantly to overcome the initial distortions and or residual stresses status in comparison with the initial imperfections the effect of the corrosion wastage on the ubm is bigger which is shown clearly in both table 5 and fig 9 specifically the ubm reduces by 9 4 ship a and 8 9 ship b in case of average corrosion wastage after 30 years of service time while these values in case of severe corrosion wastage are 30 2 and 28 7 respectively to compare with the effect of average corrosion wastage the ubm reduction due to severe corrosion wastage increases nearly three times fig 10 combined with table 6 illustrate the calculation results of ubm under the effect of the average corrosion level and three different levels of initial imperfections at the age of 30th service year the ubm degradation is most serious in case of average corrosion wastage and severe level of initial imperfections and the magnitudes are 22 8 for ship a and 19 8 for ship b this value is more than twice as much as it in case of average corrosion wastage and three times as much as it in case of average level of initial imperfections the influence of the severe corrosion level and different initial imperfections levels is shown in both fig 11 and table 7 the results indicate that the ubm plunges dramatically by 44 7 ship a and 41 4 ship b due to the combination of severe corrosion and severe level of initial imperfections it is the most serious case of uncertain factors and the ubm reduction is also the biggest fig 12 illustrates a comparison of the ubm variations due to different nine cases of uncertain factors for both ship a and b the iacs requirement and the point of dissatisfaction are also drawn in figs 12 and 1 is intact structure 2 is average corrosion without initial imperfections 3 is severe corrosion without initial imperfections 4 is average corrosion with slight initial imperfections 5 is average corrosion with average initial imperfections 6 is the average corrosion with severe initial imperfections 7 is severe corrosion with slight initial imperfections 8 is severe corrosion with average initial imperfections 9 is severe corrosion with severe initial imperfections table 8 illustrates the repair periods for bulk carriers associated the initial imperfections and corrosion wastage it can be seen that the hull girder strength of both capesize bulk carrier and handymax bulk carrier has enough strength under the effect of uncertain factors in cases such as a1 a3 b1 and b3 unpredictably under the uncertain factors as cases of a5 and a8 the longitudinal hull girder strength of capesize bulk carrier does not satisfy the iacs requirement it means that the ultimate bending moment is smaller than 90 of the original state consequently this type of ship under the severe level of unexpected structures cannot be operated another point can be noted that the repair time is almost the same for hogging condition and sagging condition 5 2 design and construction considerations for bulk carriers from the above results and analyses some important notices of design and construction considerations for bulk carriers can be drawn this can improve the safety and reliability of bulk carrier structures under the uncertainty it is no denial to say that the initial imperfections appear on every ship and offshore structures the fabrication causes the deflections on the plating and stiffeners while welding activities cause residual stresses these parameters affect the buckling strength ultimate strength even collapse of structures to reduce the degree of initial imperfections is essential to enhance the residual strength capacity of structures the insights of study show that the slight or average level of initial imperfections is acceptable in addition the fabrication activities should avoid the potential cracks or dents which can make the stress concentration on the structures turning to the effect of corrosion wastage which appears in every aging ships in different regions with various degrees the corrosion rate of hull structures is affected by many factors such as corrosion protection systems and operational parameters specifically the corrosion protection systems are always equipped on ship which are known as coatings with or without anodes meanwhile the operational factors contain the percentage of time in ballast frequency and method of hold cleaning maintenance and repair actions environment etc these factors must be kept in good conditions to lengthen the coating life time which decides the magnitude of corrosion wear when the corrosion wear is small the effect of it on the residual strength of structures is slight there are a large number of parameters including uncertain factors hold loading loading and unloading conditions or sea states which have large influence on the hull girder ultimate strength to determine the ultimate strength and post ultimate strength of hull girder in as built and aging condition is available by applying technology this has an important role to give the suitable decisions relative to plate replacement maintenance or repair actions and reduce the loss of ships cargo and lives 6 concluding remarks the ultimate bending moment capacity of a capesize bulk carrier and a handymax bulk carrier under the influences of initial imperfections and corrosion wastage is assessed and analysed the results and discussions are also presented and several concluding remarks can be drawn as listed below 1 the ubm of ship hull girder is affected in varying degrees by levels of initial imperfections and or corrosion wastage the overall degree of change increases along with the increase of initial imperfections level and or corrosion wastage level 2 the ubm reduction associated the corrosion wastage is larger than that in case of initial imperfections for the highest level of corrosion wastage or initial imperfections the ubm reduction is almost 30 and 10 respectively 3 the ubm reduction subjected to the combination of the influential factors increases significantly in comparison with that in case of structures under only initial imperfections or corrosion wastage specifically the ubm reduction rises 2 4 times and 1 5 times in case of average corrosion wastage and severe corrosion wastage respectively 4 the influential factors degrade significantly the time of repair period almost 10 years besides these factors also reduce the strength capacity of the ship hull consequently ubm is lower than 90 of the original state such as the cases of a5 or a8 as in fig 12 and table 8 5 the present approach helps ship designers and or ship owners to understand comprehensively the residual strength of aging bulk carriers the information from this study can be used as a tool to plan the maintenance actions or repair policies in addition the calculation results are also able to employ for general risk assessment or reliability assessment relative to decisions on corrosion margins and corrosion protection during construction 
23686,this paper focuses on the effect of initial imperfections and corrosion wastage on the age related strength degradation of bulk carriers at the beginning the initial imperfections including initial distortions and residual stresses are employed to assess the ultimate bending moment reduction then the effect of thickness degradation due to corrosion wastage on the ultimate hull girder

unperfected structures and a corrosion rate estimation model for bulk carriers are introduced a simplified method is also proposed to determine the ultimate vertical bending moment of ship hull girder subjected to initial imperfections and corrosion wastage additionally the design and construction considerations for bulk carriers are made keywords initial imperfections corrosion wastage ultimate strength ship hull girder 1 introduction facts indicate that there are a large number of vessel casualties with regards to commercial ships a casualty scenario of 13 ships with various accidents such as sank hold flooding broke in two crushing bow bent down local hull girder failure etc during the period of seven years from 1968 to 1974 was drawn buckley 1978 turning to the other there were 150 bulk carriers which were lost with a loss of more than 12000 lives paik et al 1998 the loss of ships is classified into three categories namely loss of buoyancy or floating capacity hull girder collapse loss and loss of stability as in fig 1 in this regards hull girder loss includes the increase of hull girder loads and the decrease of hull girder strength hold flooding loading and unloading conditions or sea states lead to the change of hull girder loads while the factors related corrosion cracks and dents lead to the degradation of hull girder strength capacity even hull girder collapse yamamoto 2015 under the ultimate hull girder strength uhgs requirements the international association of classification societies common structural rules iacs csr requires that all of the bulk carriers and oil tankers equal to or greater than 150 m in length must be checked for the seagoing condition to ensure that they can satisfy the residual strength checking criteria iacs 2017 specifically the longitudinal strength of an aging ship must be greater than 90 of the original state of new building the aging ships always contain the influential factors such as initial imperfections including initial deflections and residual stresses and corrosion wastage including pitting corrosion and general corrosion denting and fatigue cracks which affect considerably on the

corrosion rate which follows the weibull distribution c 2 is the coefficient and assumed to be 1 0 t is the ship age and t 0 is the coating life the mean value of the annualized corrosion rate was collected and calculated for 23 different structural categories of a bulk carrier with two corrosion levels namely average and severe an average coating life was assumed as 7 5 years except for inner bottom plating and lower sloping plate which have the life of coating of 5 years paik et al 2003b 3 modification of the applied methods the ultimate compressive strength of elements are determined by equations 4 6 equations 4 5 are employed to calculate the ultimate compressive strength of plate elements with an average level of initial imperfections while equation 6 is applied to obtain the ultimate compressive strength of the plate stiffener combination elements to take into account the initial imperfections including initial distortions and residual stresses the effective width b e of attached plating is employed and replaced the attached plating b the effective width is determined as the following formula vhanmane and bhattacharya 2008 9 b e b σ x a v σ r x σ m a x where σ xav is the average value of the applied axial compressive stress σ max is maximum value of the axial compressive stresses and σ rx is the welding induced residual stress in the plating when the axial compressive stresses σ max equal to yield stress of the plate σ yp at y b t or y b b t see fig 4 the corresponding axial compressive stress σ xav gives the ultimate stress of plating σ x u σ m a x σ x

to cover the corrosion wastage the corrosion wear d t is added into the attached plate thickness t p stiffener web thickness t w and stiffener flange thickness t f of each structural element as 10 1 t

the initial stiffener flange thickness following the above mentioned modifications the structures will be added both initial imperfections and corrosion wastage consequently the ultimate bending moment of ship hull associated the unperfected structures will be assessed this is also the methodology which can apply to investigate the effect of uncertain parameters on the ultimate strength of ships or ship shaped structures 4 selected ships and results 4 1 applied ships a capesize bulk carrier and a handymax bulk carrier are applied to assess the effect of uncertain factors on the ultimate vertical bending moment capacity table 2 presents the main principles of selected ships while figs 6 7 illustrate the structures of the mid ship sections 4 2 calculation results table 3 illustrates the height of the collapsed and yielded parts of selected bulk carriers as determined by the modified paik mansour method it is obvious that only capesize bulk carrier has the yielded area it means that the tension flange is allowed to expand the ultimate bending moment ubm of selected ships are obtained by eq 3 at the beginning the intact structure is considered and the ubm of ship a for hogging condition is m uh0 19 213 mpa while this value for sagging condition is m us0 17 984 mpa for ship b the ubm is 6578 mpa and 6464 mpa respectively the initial imperfections including initial distortions and residual stresses are taken into account to determine the ubm table 4 and fig 8 show the ubm changes for hogging and sagging conditions under three different levels of initial imperfections namely slight average and severe regarding to the effect of corrosion wastage on the ubm two levels of corrosion wastage namely average and severe are employed and the ratios of m u and m u0 are shown in table 5 combined with fig 9 in tables 6 and 7 sli is the slight level of initial imperfections ave is the average level of initial imperfections sev is the severe level of initial imperfections the effect of initial imperfections with corrosion wastage on the hull girder strength of selected bulk carriers is carried out the combination is made by the average corrosion level and three different levels of initial imperfections which is shown in table 6 and fig 10 meanwhile table 7 and fig 11 present the ubm reduction associated the severe corrosion level combined with different levels of initial imperfections 5 discussions 5 1 variations of the ultimate vertical bending moment the uncertain factors such as initial imperfections and corrosion wastage influence differently and significantly on the ubm of bulk carriers which depend on the type or degree of these factors the ubm is also affected by the combination between the uncertain factors this section will show the effect of them on the ubm as followings the ubm reduction is up and down 0 2 2 9 and 13 0 ship a or 0 2 1 8 and 9 6 ship b under the effect of slight level average level and severe level of initial imperfections respectively as in table 4 and fig 8 it can be seen that the ultimate bending moment of capesize bulk carrier does not satisfy the iacs requirement in case of severe level of initial imperfections in this case the residual strength of ship hull is not enough and safe to operate and it needs to be considered significantly to overcome the initial distortions and or residual stresses status in comparison with the initial imperfections the effect of the corrosion wastage on the ubm is bigger which is shown clearly in both table 5 and fig 9 specifically the ubm reduces by 9 4 ship a and 8 9 ship b in case of average corrosion wastage after 30 years of service time while these values in case of severe corrosion wastage are 30 2 and 28 7 respectively to compare with the effect of average corrosion wastage the ubm reduction due to severe corrosion wastage increases nearly three times fig 10 combined with table 6 illustrate the calculation results of ubm under the effect of the average corrosion level and three different levels of initial imperfections at the age of 30th service year the ubm degradation is most serious in case of average corrosion wastage and severe level of initial imperfections and the magnitudes are 22 8 for ship a and 19 8 for ship b this value is more than twice as much as it in case of average corrosion wastage and three times as much as it in case of average level of initial imperfections the influence of the severe corrosion level and different initial imperfections levels is shown in both fig 11 and table 7 the results indicate that the ubm plunges dramatically by 44 7 ship a and 41 4 ship b due to the combination of severe corrosion and severe level of initial imperfections it is the most serious case of uncertain factors and the ubm reduction is also the biggest fig 12 illustrates a comparison of the ubm variations due to different nine cases of uncertain factors for both ship a and b the iacs requirement and the point of dissatisfaction are also drawn in figs 12 and 1 is intact structure 2 is average corrosion without initial imperfections 3 is severe corrosion without initial imperfections 4 is average corrosion with slight initial imperfections 5 is average corrosion with average initial imperfections 6 is the average corrosion with severe initial imperfections 7 is severe corrosion with slight initial imperfections 8 is severe corrosion with average initial imperfections 9 is severe corrosion with severe initial imperfections table 8 illustrates the repair periods for bulk carriers associated the initial imperfections and corrosion wastage it can be seen that the hull girder strength of both capesize bulk carrier and handymax bulk carrier has enough strength under the effect of uncertain factors in cases such as a1 a3 b1 and b3 unpredictably under the uncertain factors as cases of a5 and a8 the longitudinal hull girder strength of capesize bulk carrier does not satisfy the iacs requirement it means that the ultimate bending moment is smaller than 90 of the original state consequently this type of ship under the severe level of unexpected structures cannot be operated another point can be noted that the repair time is almost the same for hogging condition and sagging condition 5 2 design and construction considerations for bulk carriers from the above results and analyses some important notices of design and construction considerations for bulk carriers can be drawn this can improve the safety and reliability of bulk carrier structures under the uncertainty it is no denial to say that the initial imperfections appear on every ship and offshore structures the fabrication causes the deflections on the plating and stiffeners while welding activities cause residual stresses these parameters affect the buckling strength ultimate strength even collapse of structures to reduce the degree of initial imperfections is essential to enhance the residual strength capacity of structures the insights of study show that the slight or average level of initial imperfections is acceptable in addition the fabrication activities should avoid the potential cracks or dents which can make the stress concentration on the structures turning to the effect of corrosion wastage which appears in every aging ships in different regions with various degrees the corrosion rate of hull structures is affected by many factors such as corrosion protection systems and operational parameters specifically the corrosion protection systems are always equipped on ship which are known as coatings with or without anodes meanwhile the operational factors contain the percentage of time in ballast frequency and method of hold cleaning maintenance and repair actions environment etc these factors must be kept in good conditions to lengthen the coating life time which decides the magnitude of corrosion wear when the corrosion wear is small the effect of it on the residual strength of structures is slight there are a large number of parameters including uncertain factors hold loading loading and unloading conditions or sea states which have large influence on the hull girder ultimate strength to determine the ultimate strength and post ultimate strength of hull girder in as built and aging condition is available by applying technology this has an important role to give the suitable decisions relative to plate replacement maintenance or repair actions and reduce the loss of ships cargo and lives 6 concluding remarks the ultimate bending moment capacity of a capesize bulk carrier and a handymax bulk carrier under the influences of initial imperfections and corrosion wastage is assessed and analysed the results and discussions are also presented and several concluding remarks can be drawn as listed below 1 the ubm of ship hull girder is affected in varying degrees by levels of initial imperfections and or corrosion wastage the overall degree of change increases along with the increase of initial imperfections level and or corrosion wastage level 2 the ubm reduction associated the corrosion wastage is larger than that in case of initial imperfections for the highest level of corrosion wastage or initial imperfections the ubm reduction is almost 30 and 10 respectively 3 the ubm reduction subjected to the combination of the influential factors increases significantly in comparison with that in case of structures under only initial imperfections or corrosion wastage specifically the ubm reduction rises 2 4 times and 1 5 times in case of average corrosion wastage and severe corrosion wastage respectively 4 the influential factors degrade significantly the time of repair period almost 10 years besides these factors also reduce the strength capacity of the ship hull consequently ubm is lower than 90 of the original state such as the cases of a5 or a8 as in fig 12 and table 8 5 the present approach helps ship designers and or ship owners to understand comprehensively the residual strength of aging bulk carriers the information from this study can be used as a tool to plan the maintenance actions or repair policies in addition the calculation results are also able to employ for general risk assessment or reliability assessment relative to decisions on corrosion margins and corrosion protection during construction 
23687,many breakwaters were failed due to the geo disaster caused by the 2011 off the pacific coast of tohoku earthquake and tsunami investigations were carried out and it was found that the breakwater failed mainly due to the failure of its foundation however mechanism of the failure of the breakwater has not yet been completely explained this paper focuses on the stability evaluation of a breakwater foundation subjected to an earthquake and a tsunami the main feature of the study is application of centrifuge technique for a geo disaster caused by an earthquake and a tsunami results of the study show that in the case of a geo disaster brought by an earthquake and a tsunami excessive pore water pressure generated in the sandy ground and consequently liquefaction occurred during the earthquake that resulted in deformation of the foundation ground and settlement of the breakwater during the tsunami scouring could occur around the harbor side mound and seepage took place beneath the breakwater these were the main reasons of decrease in bearing capacity of the foundation ground and failure of the breakwater numerical simulations were also performed to make clear the mechanism and behavior of the breakwater under an earthquake and a tsunami overall this study can be useful to understand the failure process of a breakwater under an earthquake and a tsunami and it can be helpful to develop countermeasures in order to reduce the earthquake and tsunami induced damage of a breakwater in the future keywords breakwater centrifuge model test earthquake foundation tsunami 1 introduction the 2011 off the pacific coast of tohoku earthquake struck the coast of japan on 11th march 2011 at 14 46 jst the main shock of the earthquake was preceded by several foreshocks and followed by hundreds of aftershocks one of the foreshocks was with moment magnitude mw of 7 3 the tsunami waves of height up to 40 5 m miyako iwate prefecture japan were triggered by the earthquake dong et al 2012 the tsunami led to the catastrophic losses for the population and structures near the coastlines hazarika et al 2012 2013 hara et al 2012 sugano et al 2014 kazama and noda 2012 takahashi et al 2011 lots of breakwaters were severely damaged by the earthquake and tsunami across the affected areas the world s deepest breakwater at kamaishi port iwate prefecture japan also collapsed and failed to stop the tsunami the caissons slid down from the mound toppled and sank into the seawater investigations arikawa et al 2012 2013 were carried out and it was found that the breakwater failed mainly due to the failure of its mound damage of the mound was the main reason of the failure of the breakwater rather than its main body countermeasures against geo disasters brought by an earthquake and a tsunami are very important for the construction of earthquake and tsunami resistant breakwaters which can reduce the damage brought by an earthquake and a tsunami in the future in order to develop countermeasures against such geo disaster it is extremely important to determine the failure mechanism of a breakwater subjected to an earthquake and a tsunami in the case of a geo disaster caused by a strong earthquake and a tsunami several factors e g seismic inertia forces on a breakwater excess pore water pressure in foundation tsunami wave forces on a breakwater seepage force in foundation scouring of mound and piping of seabed soils affect the stability of a breakwater and its foundation if a strong earthquake strikes the breakwater for a long period excess pore water pressure generates in the foundation ground and it may lead to liquefaction which causes reduction in bearing capacity of its foundation the foundation may deform severely and that results in settlement sliding and overturning of the breakwater during a tsunami scouring of harbor side mound occurs due to overflowing tsunami tsunami creates water level difference between the seaside and harbor side of the breakwater for a long duration this difference in the seawater level generates seepage of seawater beneath the breakwater and the seepage simultaneously generates seepage forces in the direction of flow it may cause piping and boiling of the foundation soils in addition tsunami waves impose tsunami forces on the breakwater these factors ultimately decrease the confining pressure stiffness and bearing capacity of the foundation the failure mechanism of a breakwater under tsunami overflow has not yet been completely known some research have been performed relating to the stability of a breakwater subjected to tsunami forces but all the forces which can act on a breakwater during a tsunami to destabilize it have not been considered in these studies only few destabilizing forces were considered in their studies for example takahashi et al 2014 investigated the effects of tsunami induced seepage on the stability of a breakwater and it was found that the seepage force decreased the bearing capacity of rubble foundation significantly but the effects of overflowing tsunami waves such as scouring of mound were not considered in the study kasama et al 2015 conducted a physical model test under 1 g gravitation field and described the stability of a breakwater subjected to tsunami induced seepage and it was observed that there was significant reduction in the bearing capacity of mound due to seepage of seawater beneath a caisson during the tsunami scouring of mound due to the overflowing tsunami is not considered in the study in addition seabed soils were also not considered beneath the mound which has significant impacts on the stability of a breakwater during tsunami e g seepage and piping of seabed soils imase et al 2012 and matsuda et al 2016 evaluated the stability of a breakwater during earthquake and tsunami but tsunami induced scouring of mound was not considered in their studies therefore physical processes of instability of a breakwater due to a tsunami e g combined effects of scouring of mound seepage and piping beneath breakwater could not explained by their studies dong et al 2012 chen et al 2013 and zen et al 2013 discussed both the pop out failure of armoured blocks and reduction of bearing capacity due to tsunami induced seepage by conducting model tests under 1 g gravitational field scouring of mound and seabed soils were not allowed during their physical model tests chaudhary et al 2017c described the stability of a breakwater under combined actions of an earthquake and tsunami but it is an analytical study and some important factors such as scouring of mound and pore water pressures in foundation were not considered in the study main factors for instability of a breakwater foundation during a tsunami are i tsunami wave forces on a caisson ii seepage of seawater beneath a caisson through mound and seabed soils iii piping of seabed soils and iv scouring of mound and seabed soils but all those studies considered either one or two of these factors such as tsunami induced seepage or tsunami induced scouring all the possible factors e g seepage scouring and piping which are responsible for the instability of a breakwater during a tsunami did not consider in their studies in fact most of the studies did not consider seabed soils as their mound rests on base of a soil box therefore effects of some important parameters such as scouring and piping of the seabed soils during a tsunami could not be understood thus instability of a breakwater during a tsunami could not be explained completely by these studies to the end the authors conducted a series of centrifuge model tests to evaluate the instability of a breakwater and its foundation subjected to a tsunami and all the possible factors are considered in this study which can affect the stability of a breakwater foundation during a tsunami the main novelty of this study is that all constraints are made free and tsunami overflow test was conducted under centrifuge gravitational field in such a way that it could represent the actual failure process of a breakwater during a tsunami which may occur in the real ground in addition stability evaluation of breakwater under earthquake loadings is also included in the study generally a tsunami is followed by an undersea earthquake ml 6 5 the foundation of a breakwater may damage severely during the earthquake due to high excess pore water pressure or liquefaction and a breakwater may settle heavily during the earthquake during a tsunami the tsunami induced seepage beneath a breakwater and scouring of mound impose instability to the breakwater in the present study the stability of a breakwater is determined under an earthquake and a tsunami to determine the effects of foundation soils on the performance of the breakwater two soil layers were used in the foundation beneath mound during the tests a series of centrifuge model tests were performed to determine the stability of the breakwater subjected to an earthquake and a tsunami numerical simulations were also conducted to make clear the mechanism however due to limitation of centrifuge devices effects of an earthquake on tsunami overflow could not be considered in the present study 2 centrifuge model tests the centrifuge technique has been often used to investigate various geotechnical problems since 1960s the main advantage of the technique is that high stress can be generated corresponding to a prototype which is necessary to simulate the non linear behavior of soil 2 1 experimental setup and procedures centrifuge model tests were conducted at dpri disaster prevention research institute kyoto university japan using a beam type geotechnical centrifuge machine the centrifuge machine has an effective radius of 2 5 m and it can be operated up to acceleration of 200 g for static tests and 50 g for dynamic tests soil box was made of steel and its front face was made of acrylic plates see fig 1 a water tank and movable gate were installed in the soil box to generate tsunami the moveable gate could be closed over water inlet hole located at the bottom of the water tank it can be opened by sending a signal from a remote computer and allow the water to release from the water tank once the water is released from the tank it flows across the soil box where the model is placed it is then captured in a drainage tank which is attached at the bottom of the soil box to avoid reflection of water waves generated due to the presence of the wall on opposite side see fig 1 2 2 model description the future earthquakes such as tokai earthquake nankai earthquake and tonankai earthquake are matters of great concern for the politicians policy makers and researchers of japan these are predicted to occur any time in the near future according to the report of the central disaster management council of the ministry of japan central disaster management council 2003 about 2 m seismic subsidence is expected due to the nankai earthquake in the kochi area shikoku island japan the miyazaki prefecture is predicted as one of the most affected areas by the nankai earthquake tsunami waves of height more than 15 m are predicted in this area it is the reason that the breakwater at miyazaki port miyazaki prefecture japan was chosen as a prototype for this study due to the limitations of the tsunami generation devices installed in the soil box the maximum centrifuge acceleration was limited to 25 g the prototype breakwater is 12 7 m high therefore if conventional scaling laws for the centrifuge model tests were applied the height of the model breakwater would be 50 8 cm in the scaled model under 25 g gravitational field and it was too large for the centrifuge machine arm length 2 5 m to overcome this limitation the generalized scaling law iai et al 2005 was adopted in this research which is a combination of the scaling laws for centrifuge tests and the laws for 1 g dynamic model tests in the generalized scaling law a model in geotechnical centrifuge is considered to be a small scaled model representing a virtual 1 g shaking table model the virtual 1 g model is again scaled down by applying a similitude centrifuge law using this method geometric scaling factor applied in 1 g test m can be multiplied with that for centrifuge test n resulting in much larger overall scaling factor n mn see table 1 tobita et al 2011 2012 validated the generalized scaling law for both dry and saturated sand by conducting a series of centrifuge model tests the prototype to model ratio n was adopted as 225 and the centrifuge tests were conducted under 25 g gravitational field the model of the breakwater foundation is shown in fig 2 the generalized scaling law m 9 and n 25 proposed by iai et al 2005 was adopted to determine the various parameters for the earthquake loadings and are shown in table 1 however the similitude relationship discussed by takahashi et al 2014 can be used for the tsunami overflow test this study deals with the behavior of a breakwater due to damage of its foundation therefore the breakwater was made strong enough to prevent any damage to its body during the tests the box type caisson breakwater was made of aluminum and filled with lead balls to adjust weight specific gravity 2 3 and center of gravity the model caisson is 56 4 mm high corresponding to 12 7 m for the prototype and 60 mm wide corresponding to 13 5 m for the prototype as the caisson length was spanning across the entire width of the soil box the caisson breakwater can be approximated as a plane strain situation a three dimensional schematic view of the model is shown in fig 3 in order to prevent side friction between the caisson and soil box lubricant was used on the side faces of the caisson vibration absorbing layers were used on both ends of the soil box in order to prevent seismic wave reflections during seismic loadings the seabed foundation soils was made of two layers of toyoura sands the lower soil layer was of relative density dr 85 approximate and the upper soil layer was of relative density dr 55 approximate the lower dense layer was assumed as hard strata representing bed rocks the thickness of the lower layer was 30 mm corresponding to 6 75 m for the prototype and the thickness of the upper layer was 50 mm corresponding to 11 25 m for the prototype the rubble mound was made of crushed stones the mean grain size d50 of the stones was 4 7 mm which corresponds to 1 1 m in the prototype scale table 2 shows properties of the foundation materials the mean grain size d50 of toyoura sands was 0 16 mm in the case of a centrifuge model test effects of soil particle size might become significant if ratio of foundation width to mean soil grain size falls below 40 ovesen 1975 as the ratio of the caisson width to the mean sand grain size is 375 in the present test so it can be said that the effects of the sand particle size is insignificant the dynamic characteristics of the toyoura sands and the crushed stones were determined against cyclic loadings by element tests and have been reported in hazarika et al 2016 2015 in order to observe deformation of the seabed soils during the earthquake loadings red membranes were used on the front wall of the soil box and fixed in such a way that they could move or deform with the soils during the earthquake loadings lines white color were drawn on the front face of the soil box to observe scouring during the tsunami see fig 1 however the membranes were not used during the tsunami overflow test as per the generalized similitude law see table 1 fluid of viscosity of 1 3 10 4 m2 s 130cst at 25 c was used in the tests the viscous fluid was made by mixing metolose with water 2 3 instrumentation instrumentations for the tests are shown in fig 4 four displacement gauges were installed two gauges for settlements of the caisson v1 and v2 and two gauges for horizontal displacements of the caisson h1 and h2 ten pore water pressure gauges p1 to p10 were installed to monitor pore water pressures in the foundation soils and mound four water pressure gauges w1 to w4 were installed to measure water pressures on the caisson and five accelerometers a1 to a5 were used to record accelerations history of the soils and structure at different locations of the model one accelerometer a4 was fixed at the base of the soil box to record the input seismic waves 2 4 earthquake loadings and tsunami overflow in the case of a strong earthquake main shock is preceded by several foreshocks in order to correlate this real ground fact two foreshocks and one main shock were used as earthquake loadings the earthquake loadings were applied at the bottom of the soil box in the form of sinusoidal acceleration waves the frequency f and time t were same for the foreshocks and main shock however the acceleration amplitude a was varied for the foreshocks and main shock the frequency was 83 hz which corresponds to 0 66 hz for the prototype and the time of the earthquake loading was 1 4 s 3 min in the prototype scale the 1st foreshock was of acceleration amplitude 2 5 g corresponds to 0 1 g in the prototype scale and the 2nd foreshock was of acceleration amplitude 5 0 g corresponds to 0 2 g in the prototype scale the acceleration amplitude for the main shock was 10 0 g corresponds to 0 4 g in the prototype scale the earthquake loadings are shown in fig 5 the foreshocks and main shock were applied to the same model sequentially a time interval was provided between two consecutive loadings so that pore water pressures could dissipate completely in the foundation soils and mound the earthquake loading was chosen in such a way that the input earthquake loading main shock is somehow equivalent to the 2011 off the pacific coast of tohoku earthquake which was a very long duration earthquake to observe the effects of acceleration amplitudes different acceleration amplitudes 0 1 g 0 2 g and 0 4 g in the prototype scale were used for the earthquake loadings in the forms of foreshocks and main shock for tsunami overflow test fresh model was developed and the tsunami overflow test was performed on the new fresh model under 25 g gravitational field 2 5 results and discussions stability of the breakwater is discussed in terms of the settlement horizontal displacement and tilt overturning of the caisson during the earthquake and the tsunami horizontal displacement of the caisson toward the harbor side is considered as positive 2 5 1 effects of the earthquake loadings the earthquake loadings were applied at the bottom of the soil box in terms of foreshocks and main shock and a time interval was provided between two consecutive earthquake loadings in order to dissipate excess pore water pressure in the foundation 2 5 1 1 acceleration response of the soil and the structure accelerations were recorded at different locations of the model by the accelerometers during the earthquake loadings and the acceleration histories of the soil and breakwater are shown in fig 6 which were recorded during the main shock a 10 0 g it can be observed that the acceleration at the bottom of the soil box a4 is 10 0 g it confirms that the experimental set up worked well during the centrifuge test the peak acceleration at the top of the lower soil layer a3 is less than the input peak acceleration acceleration amplitude decreases during passing through a dense soil layer and it was the reason that the peak acceleration at the top of the lower dense layer was less than that of the input acceleration furthermore acceleration amplifies during propagating through a loose soil layer and it was the reason that the peak acceleration at the top of the upper soil layer a5 is more than that at a3 the peak acceleration at a5 is almost 15 0 g the peak acceleration further increases during passing through the body of the caisson and the peak acceleration at the top of the caisson a1 is almost 17 5 g 2 5 1 2 excess pore water pressure in the foundation pore water pressures were monitored at different locations of the foundation ground during the foreshocks and main shock in order to see the increase in pore water pressure during the earthquake loadings the time history of the excess pore water pressure epwp recorded at p8 is shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the epwp increases with the increase in acceleration amplitude of the earthquake loadings it can be observed that the epwp increases to 0 8 kpa during the first foreshock and its value reaches to 1 75 kpa at the end of 2nd foreshock finally the epwp increases to a high value 4 58 kpa at the end of the main shock it can be observed that acceleration amplitude has significant impacts on the epwp and the epwp increases abruptly to a high value during the main shock hence acceleration amplitude needs attention during establishment of countermeasures and designing a new breakwater foundation subjected to an earthquake loading 2 5 1 3 settlement of the caisson in order to see the effects of acceleration amplitude on the performance of the breakwater settlement and horizontal displacement of the caisson were measured under different acceleration amplitudes foreshocks and main shock the settlement and horizontal displacement of the caisson are shown in figs 8 and 9 for different acceleration amplitudes 2 5 g 5 0 g and 10 0 g it can be observed that the settlement and horizontal displacement of the caisson increase with the increase in acceleration amplitude excess pore water pressure increases with the increase in acceleration amplitude it causes decrease in the shear strength and bearing capacity of the foundation and leads to increase in the settlement and horizontal displacement of the caisson in addition the seismic inertial forces and hydrodynamic forces increase with the acceleration these are the reasons for the increase in the settlement and horizontal displacement of the caisson with the increase in acceleration amplitude the settlement of the caisson measured at v1 is shown in fig 8 a it depicts that the settlement is 3 5 mm for the 1st foreshock a 2 5 g and increases to 7 4 mm during the 2nd foreshock a 5 0 g it further increases to 22 6 mm at the end of the main shock a 10 0 g it can be noted that the settlement increases to 2 1 times as the acceleration amplitude increases from 2 5 g to 5 0 g and increases to 6 5 times as the acceleration amplitude increases from 2 5 g to 10 0 g it can be noted that the settlement increases abruptly to a high value during the main shock compared to the foreshocks it may be possible that the foundation soil liquefied during the main shock and led to deformation of the foundation ground which resulted in the excess settlement of the caisson the settlement of the caisson measured at v2 is shown in fig 8 b it can be seen that the settlement is 2 4 mm for the 1st foreshock a 2 5 g it increases to 5 4 mm during the 2nd foreshock a 5 0 g and finally reached to 15 8 mm at the end of the main shock a 10 0 g it can be noted that the settlement increases to 2 3 times as the acceleration amplitude increases from 2 5 g to 5 0 g and increases to 6 6 times as the acceleration amplitude increases from 2 5 g to 10 0 g differential settlement of the caisson can be observed from fig 8 a and b during all the three earthquake loadings 2 5 g 5 0 g and 10 0 g 2 5 1 4 horizontal displacement of the caisson horizontal displacement of the caisson was measured for different acceleration amplitudes 2 5 g 5 0 g and 10 0 g and are shown in fig 9 it can be observed that the horizontal displacement of the caisson increases with the increase in acceleration amplitude of the earthquake loadings the horizontal displacement of the caisson measured at h1 is shown in fig 9 a the horizontal displacement is 0 2 mm for the 1st foreshock a 2 5 g and increases to 1 1 mm during the 2nd foreshock a 5 0 g its value further increases to 5 7 mm at the end of the main shock a 10 0 g it can be noted that the horizontal displacement increases to 5 5 times as the acceleration amplitude increases from 2 5 g to 5 0 g and increases to 28 5 times as the acceleration amplitude increases from 2 5 g to 10 0 g the horizontal displacement of the caisson measured at h2 is shown in fig 9 b it can be noticed that the horizontal displacement is 0 2 mm for the 1st foreshock a 2 5 g the horizontal displacement is 0 2 mm during the 2nd foreshock a 5 0 g its value increases to 4 0 mm at the end of the main shock a 10 0 g it can be noted that the horizontal displacement became high during the main shock 2 5 1 5 tilt of the caisson differential settlement of the caisson was observed during the centrifuge model tests which imposed tilt on the caisson to determine the tilt overturning of the caisson during the earthquake loadings the tilt angle of the caisson was calculated based on the settlements recorded at v1 and v2 by the displacement gauges the title angle is measured with respect to vertical and assumed positive in anticlockwise direction the tilt angle is determined for different acceleration amplitudes 2 5 g 5 0 g and 10 0 g and it is shown in fig 10 it can be observed that the tilt angle increases with the increase in acceleration amplitude the tilt angle is 0 4 during the 1st foreshock a 2 5 g it increases to 0 8 for the 2nd foreshock a 5 0 g finally the caisson tilted to 2 7 at the end of the main shock a 10 0 g it can be noted that the tilt angle increases to 2 times as the acceleration amplitude increases from 2 5 g to 5 0 g and increases to 6 8 times as the acceleration amplitude increases from 2 5 g to 10 0 g it can be noticed that the tilt angle became high at the end of the main shock 2 5 1 6 deformation of the foundation ground photographs were taken during the centrifuge model tests by a high speed camera in order to observe the behavior of the breakwater during the earthquake loadings the photographs taken at the end of each excitation 2 5 g 5 0 g and 10 0 g are shown in fig 11 the photograph of the model before the earthquake loadings is shown in fig 11 a fig 11 b shows photograph of the model at the end of the 1st foreshock a 2 5 g the model shows very small or negligible deformation during the 1st foreshock fig 11 c shows the photograph of the model at the end of the 2nd foreshock a 5 0 g small deformation of the foundation ground can be seen in the figure settlement and horizontal displacement of the caisson increased during the 2nd foreshock in addition the caisson tilted slightly toward the harbor side the model of the breakwater at the end of the main shock a 10 0 g is shown in fig 11 d it can be seen that the red membranes beneath the mound deformed severely which indicates that the seabed soils and rubble mound deformed during the earthquake loadings it is due the facts that the seabed soils beneath the caisson settled and deformed outward in lateral direction during the earthquake loading moreover the rubble mound almost collapsed it settled in the seabed soils and spread outward in the both sides of the mound the deformation of the seabed soils and rubble mound imposed settlement and horizontal displacement on the caisson these are the reasons for the settlement horizontal displacement and tilt of the caisson during the earthquake loadings 2 5 2 effects of the tsunami overflow to observe the performance of the breakwater and its foundation under tsunami induced forces tsunami overflow test was performed on the model breakwater fresh model was prepared for the tsunami overflow test performance of the model is discussed in terms of excess pore water pressure in the foundation ground settlement of the caisson horizontal displacement of the caisson and tsunami wave pressures on the caisson 2 5 2 1 tsunami wave pressure on the caisson during the tsunami there is intense interaction between the tsunami waves and breakwater rubble mound and seabed soils the tsunami waves imposed huge forces in the lateral direction on the breakwater the tsunami wave force on the breakwater is expressed in terms of tsunami wave pressures the water pressure gauges were installed on the caisson to measure the tsunami wave pressures on the caisson and the tsunami wave pressure are shown in fig 12 it can be observe that when the tsunami struck the breakwater it imposed huge wave pressures on the caisson due to the blocking of the tsunami waves by the caisson the tsunami wave pressure increased with the depth of the tsunami waves the tsunami pressure on the caisson is maximum for w4 w4 is located near the bottom of the caisson on the seaside therefore the water head was higher at the gauge compared to the other gauges it is the reason that the tsunami pressure is maximum at w4 compared to the other gauges w3 laid near the top of the caisson on the seaside and hence the water head at w3 is less compared to that at w4 it is the reason that the tsunami wave pressure at the gauge is less than that at w4 as w1 and w2 laid on the harbor side and the tsunami water did not reach to these gauges therefore no increase in water pressure was recorded by the gauges 2 5 2 2 increase in pore water pressure during the tsunami during the tsunami pore water pressure increased in the foundation ground mainly due to increase in the seawater level and the tsunami induced seepage increase in pore water pressure ipwp has significant impacts on the stability of a breakwater during a tsunami it can affect tsunami induced seepage scouring and bearing capacity of the foundation ground it was observed that there was a significant difference in ipwp at the same level between the seaside and harbor side during the tsunami to see the difference in ipwp on the seaside and harbor side at same level fig 13 shows the increase in pore water pressure in the seabed soils due to the tsunami at three different locations i p7 near the seaside end of the mound ii p8 beneath the caisson and iii p9 near the harbor side end of the mound it can be seen that the ipwp is high at p7 it is due to increase in the seawater level on the seaside during the tsunami due to the blocking of the tsunami waves by the breakwater seepage through the seabed soils is also responsible for the increase in the pore water pressure at the location the ipwp at p8 is less than that at p7 seepage of the seawater took place in large scale beneath the caisson through the mound and the seabed soils it is the main reason for the increase in pore water pressure at p8 the overflowing tsunami waves seawater above the caisson imposed additional pore water pressures at the location due to high seepage force piping of the seabed sands was also observed beneath the mound during the test at p9 the ipwp is less than those at p7 and p8 the ipwp at p9 is mainly due to the seepage and increase in the seawater level on the harbor side during the tsunami it is to be noted that the amount of seepage was less at this location compared to that at p8 2 5 2 3 settlement of the caisson to see the performance of the breakwater during the tsunami overflow average settlement of the breakwater is shown in fig 14 the average settlement of the caisson was calculated based on the settlements measured by the displacement gauges at v1 and v2 see fig 4 it can be observed that the average settlement of the caisson increased during the tsunami the harbor side rubble mound was scoured by the overflowing tsunami tsunami induced seepage took place beneath the caisson through the rubble mound and seabed soils the seepage imposed seepage force on the rubble of the rubble mound and the soil grains of the seabed soils in the direction of seepage the seepage caused pipping of the seabed soils beneath the mound furthermore increase in the seawater level during the tsunami overflow imposed an additional buoyancy force on the breakwater these factors reduced the confining pressure and shear strength and finally caused decrease in the bearing capacity of the foundation ground hence the average settlement of the caisson increased during the tsunami overflow it can be observed in fig 14 that the average settlement of the caisson increased to 2 1 mm at the end of the tsunami overflow test 2 5 2 4 horizontal displacement of the caisson when a tsunami strikes a breakwater it imposes impact forces in the lateral direction on a breakwater under the action of these impact forces the breakwater may slide over a mound and it may sink into a sea similar phenomenon happened during the 2011 off the pacific coast of tohoku earthquake and tsunami when caissons slid over the mound and sank into the sea and it became the reason of the failure of some breakwaters in japan in order to see the impact of tsunami waves on the horizontal displacement of the caisson average horizontal displacement of the caisson are shown in fig 15 the average horizontal displacement of the caisson was calculated based on the horizontal displacement measured by the displacement gauges at h1 and h2 see fig 4 it can be seen in the figure that the average horizontal displacement of the caisson reached to a high value at the end of the tsunami the average horizontal displacement of the caisson reached to 21 3 mm 4 8 m in the prototype scale during the tsunami overflow it was observed the caisson slid over the mound under the action of the tsunami waves it was the main reason for excess horizontal displacement of the caisson therefore for the safety of a breakwater it very important to develop countermeasures which can reduce horizontal displacement of the caisson during a tsunami 2 5 2 5 ground deformation to see the behavior of the breakwater foundation during the tsunami overflow the photograph taken after the tsunami overflow test is shown in fig 16 it can be seen that the rubble mound in front of the caisson on the harbor side was scoured by the overflowing tsunami the stones of the rubble mound were flown away by the tsunami waves and spread over the seabed on the harbor side the seabed was disturbed due to the tsunami waves and the seabed sands in front of the mound were scoured and blew out by the overflowing tsunami the sands piled up on the harbor side due to the blocking of the tsunami by the caisson the seawater level increased on the seaside of the caisson it resulted in increase in pore water on the seaside compared to that on the harbor side it caused one directional seepage beneath the caisson through the rubble mound and seabed sands from seaside to harbor side the seepage beneath the caisson started as soon as the seawater level increased in the seaside during the tsunami the rubble mound was made of crushed stones and had high voids which provide easy path for the seawater to pass through them it was the reason that the seepage was mostly concentrated through the mound but significant amount of seepage was observed through the upper loose soil layer the seepage decreased in downward direction due to high seepage forces piping of the seabed sands was also observed beneath the mound during the tsunami overflow test the seepage force supported scouring of the mound which was mainly caused by the overflowing tsunami the whole phenomenon was continue till the end of the tsunami overflow test these factors decreased the bearing capacity of the foundation ground and caused horizontal displacement and settlement of the caisson due to high lateral thrust imposed on the caisson by the tsunami waves the caisson slid over the mound and displaced towards harbor side which can be seen clearly in the figure 3 numerical simulation finite difference program flac was used for numerical simulation of the centrifuge model tests purpose of the numerical simulation is to make clear the mechanism and behavior of the breakwater and its foundation under the earthquake loadings tsunami induced seepage beneath the breakwater is also discussed by the numerical simulation 3 1 model and boundary conditions a grid of size 385 mm x and 385 mm was generated to develop numerical model of the breakwater under plane strain condition the whole grid was discretized into 3025 number of small zones both the soil layers of the seabed were made of toyoura sands and modelled as cohesionless and homogeneous material with elasto plastic response similar to the centrifuge model test the lower soil layer was made of toyoura sand of dr 85 and the upper soil layer was made of toyoura sand of dr 55 the thickness of the lower and upper layer were 30 mm and 50 mm respectively table 3 shows material properties of the foundation ground soil profile for both the layers were assumed homogeneous throughout the seabed profile the rubble mound was made of crushed stones and was modelled as elastic material because it has been the most commonly used to simulate ground behavior of a rubble foundation ye and wang 2015 takahashi et al 2014 the caisson was made of aluminum and modelled as elastic material during the modelling the seabed was created first and then the mound was created after the mound formation the gabion and the caisson were modelled after construction of the whole model the seawater level was raised up to height 40 mm above the seabed saturation level of the foundation soils and mound was made 1 0 fully saturated fig 17 shows numerical model of the breakwater for effective stress analysis the formula proposed by byrne 1991 was considered it is an incremental shear volume coupling equation and incorporates in a cyclic simple shear pore pressure element model it includes an elastic rebound modulus equation that allows the excess pore pressures to be computed for any prescribed cyclic shear strain history ye and wang 2015 and chaudhary et al 2016a c 2017a b also used the byrne model to simulate seismic behavior of seabed foundation of a breakwater all movements were restrained at the bottom plane of the model in order to determine the behavior of the breakwater at the end of construction the model was solved for static equilibrium before applying the seismic loadings the seismic loadings were applied in the form of sinusoidal velocity waves at the base of the model corresponding to 83 hz frequency and 1 4 s time the amplitudes of the seismic waves were equivalent to acceleration amplitudes 2 5 g 5 g and 10 g similar to the earthquake loadings of the centrifuge model tests to avoid wave reflections from the boundaries free field boundaries conditions were applied during the seismic excitations a damping ratio of 5 was assigned to the model during earthquake loadings in the case of the tsunami the tsunami wave forces which were obtained during the centrifuge model test were applied on the caisson to observed seepage flow beneath the caisson 3 2 validation of the model for conducting numerical analyses it is very important to validate numerical model with experimental data in order to validate the numerical model the responses obtained by the numerical simulations are compared with those of the centrifuge model tests validation of the numerical model is made in terms of i settlements of the caisson and ii excess pore water pressure in the foundation ground during the main shock the comparison for settlements of the caisson measured at v1 and v2 is shown in fig 18 for the main shock it can be seen that there are good agreements between the settlement of the caisson obtained from the numerical simulation and those of the centrifuge model test the time histories of excess pore water pressure measured at p8 is compared in fig 19 for the main shock it can be observed that there are close agreement between them thus the results show ability of the numerical model to capture the behavior of the physical model and hence it confirms validation of the numerical model 3 3 numerical analyses the physical model of the breakwater deformed during the centrifuge model tests to see the deformation of the model breakwater and its foundation at the end of the main shock displacement vectors are drawn by the numerical simulation and are shown in fig 20 it can be seen in the figure that flow of the seabed soils and rubbles of the rubble mound took place in large scale beneath the caisson the seabed soils settled in the downward direction and deformed in outward lateral direction furthermore the flow of the seabed soils is concentrate mostly within the upper layer loose soil layer of the seabed in addition deformation of the rubble mound can be seen clearly in the figure the rubble mound settled in the seabed soils and spread outward it resulted in collapse of almost whole rubble mound during the earthquake loading these are the reasons of settlement horizontal displacement and tilt of the caisson at the end of the main shock liquefaction may occur during an earthquake which causes damage of a foundation to observed liquefaction in the foundation ground pore water pressure pwp ratio was determined for different earthquake loadings by the numerical analyses fish programming language was used to define pwp ratio and it was coded in flac fish enables the user to define a new function which was either difficult or impossible with the existing program structures of flac pwp ratio was determined at a depth of 14 mm 3 2 m in the prototype scale beneath base of the mound and 63 mm 14 2 m in the prototype scale distance toward harbor side from harbor side edge of the caisson the pwp ratio is shown in fig 21 for different acceleration amplitudes it can be observed that the pwp ratio increases with the increase in acceleration amplitude deformation of the foundation ground increased with the increase in acceleration amplitude it resulted in increase in the shear strain with the increase in acceleration amplitude of the earthquake loadings the increase in shear strain caused increase in pore water pressure and hence pwp ratio increased with the increase in acceleration amplitude it can be seen in the figure that the pwp ratio is 0 15 for the 1st foreshock a 2 5 g and it increases to 0 32 during the 2nd foreshock a 5 0 g the pwp ratio reaches to 0 86 during the main shock a 10 0 g which is close to liquefaction hence liquefaction might occur in the foundation ground during the main shock it is one of the main reasons for high deformation of the mound and seabed soils which resulted in excess settlement and horizontal displacement of the caisson during the main shock of the earthquake loadings during physical model tests it was observed that a change in the seawater level affected the performance of the breakwater during the earthquake loadings to see the effects of change in the seawater level settlement of the caisson is determined for different seawater levels and it is shown in fig 22 the main shock is used as earthquake loading and the settlement of midpoint of the top surface of the caisson is determined for three different seawater levels d i d 20 mm corresponds to 4 5 m in the prototype scale above the seabed ii d 40 mm corresponds to 9 0 m in the prototype scale above the seabed and iii d 60 mm corresponds to 13 5 m in the prototype scale above the seabed it can be seen in the figure that the settlement of the caisson decreases with the increase in the seawater level buoyancy force acts on a breakwater due to its submergence in the seawater the buoyancy force increases with the increase in seawater level the increase in buoyancy force decreases effective weight of the breakwater and hence seismic inertia force on the caisson also decreases with the increase in seawater level it is the reason that the settlement of the caisson decreases with the increase in seawater level it can be seen in the figure that the settlement is 28 8 mm for d 20 mm and it decreases to 19 7 mm for d 40 mm the settlement further decreases to 10 2 mm for d 60 mm therefore seawater level needs attention for evaluating the stability of a breakwater during an earthquake loading deformation of the upper loose soil layer was one of the main reasons of the settlement of the caisson during the earthquake loadings thickness of the upper loose soil layer may affects settlement of the breakwater in order to observed the effects of thickness of the layer numerical simulation was carried out for different thickness of the layer and it is shown in fig 23 the settlement of midpoint of the top surface of the caisson was determine for three different thickness of the upper loose soil layer i thickness 30 mm corresponds to 6 8 m in the prototype scale ii thickness 50 mm corresponds to 11 3 m in the prototype scale and iii thickness 70 mm corresponds to 15 8 m in the prototype scale the main shock was used as earthquake loading it can be seen that the settlement increases with the increase in thickness of the upper loose soil layer of the seabed the deformation of the upper loose soil was one of the major reasons of settlement of the breakwater see fig 20 during the earthquake deformation of soils is more in a thick loose soil layer compared to a thin loose soil layer and hence a thick soil layer causes more settlement of the caisson compared to a thin layer therefore the settlement of the caisson increases with the increase in thickness of the upper loose soil layer it can be seen in the figure that the settlement is 22 2 mm for the thick soil layer d 70 mm and it decreases to 19 7 mm and 16 4 mm for the soil layer of thickness 50 mm and 30 mm respectively in order to observe seepage through the foundation ground beneath the breakwater flow vectors are shown in fig 24 the flow vectors around the caisson and inside the foundation ground mound and seabed soils can be seen in the figure the flow vectors for the mound indicate high seepage of water through the mound the mound had high permeability and provided easy path for water to flow through it hence the mound shows high seepage flow the seepage through the mound leads to generate seepage forces on the rubbles of the rubble mound and it supports tsunami waves in scouring of the harbor side mound during the tsunami overflow the foundation soils also show flow vectors seepage force may cause boiling or pipping of seabed sands for the foundation ground these factors decrease the confining pressure and shear strength of the foundation and finally reduce the bearing capacity of the foundation the seepage force is high at the bottom corned of the caisson harbor side which might initiate scouring from that point the seepage decreases in the downward direction the upper loose layer shows higher seepage as compared to the lower dense layer the seepage force in the upper layer may lead to scour of the soil of the upper layer beneath the mound during the tsunami it is to be noticed that in addition to the mound the seabed upper soil layer also shows significant seepage therefore consideration of seabed soils beneath a mound is important for the stability evaluation of a breakwater during a tsunami 4 conclusions the stability of a breakwater has been described under an earthquake and tsunami induced forces using centrifuge model tests two foreshocks and one main shock were used for the earthquake loadings in addition to the mound the seabed soils were also used as the foundation ground numerical analyses were performed to make clear the mechanism the following conclusions could be derived based on this research 1 in addition to the tsunami the earthquake imposed a great threat for the stability of the breakwater the main reasons for the settlement of the breakwater were subsidence and lateral flows of the seabed soils and the rubbles beneath the breakwater during the earthquake loadings these factors reduced the shear strength and finally caused decrease in the bearing capacity of the foundation these resulted in the settlement of the caisson during the earthquake loadings moreover almost whole rubble mound collapsed during the main shock the settlement horizontal displacement and tilt of the caisson increased with the increase in acceleration amplitude during the earthquake loadings 2 liquefaction of the foundation soil occurred beneath the mound during the main shock of the earthquake loadings it resulted in flow of the seabed soils and rubble mound in large scale beneath the caisson it was one of the main reasons of excess settlement horizontal displacement and tilt of the breakwater during the main shock of the earthquake loadings 3 during the tsunami overflow test the breakwater slid over the mound under the impact of the tsunami wave forces scouring of the mound on harbor side was observed during the tsunami overflow tests the seabed soils were also scoured and the soils were piled up on harbor side by the tsunami waves seepage of the seawater took place beneath the caisson and it was concentrated mostly through the mound but significant amount of seepage was also observed through the upper soil layer these factors reduced the confining pressure and shear strength and finally resulted in reduction of bearing capacity of the foundation ground during the tsunami these are the reasons for excess horizontal displacement and settlement of the breakwater during the tsunami overflow 4 settlement of the breakwater decreased with the increase in the seawater level during the earthquake loadings buoyancy force increases with the increase in seawater which decreases effective weight and seismic inertia force of a caisson and hence settlement of the caisson decreased with the increase in the seawater level settlement of the caisson increased with the increase in thickness of the upper loose soils layer of the seabed during the earthquake loadings

23687,many breakwaters were failed due to the geo disaster caused by the 2011 off the pacific coast of tohoku earthquake and tsunami investigations were carried out and it was found that the breakwater failed mainly due to the failure of its foundation however mechanism of the failure of the breakwater has not yet been completely explained this paper focuses on the stability evaluation of a breakwater foundation subjected to an earthquake and a tsunami the main feature of the study is application of centrifuge technique for a geo disaster caused by an earthquake and a tsunami results of the study show that in the case of a geo disaster brought by an earthquake and a tsunami excessive pore water pressure generated in the sandy ground and consequently liquefaction occurred during the earthquake that resulted in deformation of the foundation ground and settlement of the breakwater during the tsunami scouring could occur around the harbor side mound and seepage took place beneath the breakwater these were the main reasons of decrease in bearing capacity of the foundation ground and failure of the breakwater numerical simulations were also performed to make clear the mechanism and behavior of the breakwater under an earthquake and a tsunami overall this study can be useful to understand the failure process of a breakwater under an earthquake and a tsunami and it can be helpful to develop countermeasures in order to reduce the earthquake and tsunami induced damage of a breakwater in the future keywords breakwater centrifuge model test earthquake foundation tsunami 1 introduction the 2011 off the pacific coast of tohoku earthquake struck the coast of japan on 11th march 2011 at 14 46 jst the main shock of the earthquake was preceded by several foreshocks and followed by hundreds of aftershocks one of the foreshocks was with moment magnitude mw of 7 3 the tsunami waves of height up to 40 5 m miyako iwate prefecture japan were triggered by the earthquake dong et al 2012 the tsunami led to the catastrophic losses for the population and structures near the coastlines hazarika et al 2012 2013 hara et al 2012 sugano et al 2014 kazama and noda 2012 takahashi et al 2011 lots of breakwaters were severely damaged by the earthquake and tsunami across the affected areas the world s deepest breakwater at kamaishi port iwate prefecture japan also collapsed and failed to stop the tsunami the caissons slid down from the mound toppled and sank into the seawater investigations arikawa et al 2012 2013 were carried out and it was found that the breakwater failed mainly due to the failure of its mound damage of the mound was the main reason of the failure of the breakwater rather than its main body countermeasures against geo disasters brought by an earthquake and a tsunami are very important for the construction of earthquake and tsunami resistant breakwaters which can reduce the damage brought by an earthquake and a tsunami in the future in order to develop countermeasures against such geo disaster it is extremely important to determine the failure mechanism of a breakwater subjected to an earthquake and a tsunami in the case of a geo disaster caused by a strong earthquake and a tsunami several factors e g seismic inertia forces on a breakwater excess pore water pressure in foundation tsunami wave forces on a breakwater seepage force in foundation scouring of mound and piping of seabed soils affect the stability of a breakwater and its foundation if a strong earthquake strikes the breakwater for a long period excess pore water pressure generates in the foundation ground and it may lead to liquefaction which causes reduction in bearing capacity of its foundation the foundation may deform severely and that results in settlement sliding and overturning of the breakwater during a tsunami scouring of harbor side mound occurs due to overflowing tsunami tsunami creates water level difference between the seaside and harbor side of the breakwater for a long duration this difference in the seawater level generates seepage of seawater beneath the breakwater and the seepage simultaneously generates seepage forces in the direction of flow it may cause piping and boiling of the foundation soils in addition tsunami waves impose tsunami forces on the breakwater these factors ultimately decrease the confining pressure stiffness and bearing capacity of the foundation the failure mechanism of a breakwater under tsunami overflow has not yet been completely known some research have been performed relating to the stability of a breakwater subjected to tsunami forces but all the forces which can act on a breakwater during a tsunami to destabilize it have not been considered in these studies only few destabilizing forces were considered in their studies for example takahashi et al 2014 investigated the effects of tsunami induced seepage on the stability of a breakwater and it was found that the seepage force decreased the bearing capacity of rubble foundation significantly but the effects of overflowing tsunami waves such as scouring of mound were not considered in the study kasama et al 2015 conducted a physical model test under 1 g gravitation field and described the stability of a breakwater subjected to tsunami induced seepage and it was observed that there was significant reduction in the bearing capacity of mound due to seepage of seawater beneath a caisson during the tsunami scouring of mound due to the overflowing tsunami is not considered in the study in addition seabed soils were also not considered beneath the mound which has significant impacts on the stability of a breakwater during tsunami e g seepage and piping of seabed soils imase et al 2012 and matsuda et al 2016 evaluated the stability of a breakwater during earthquake and tsunami but tsunami induced scouring of mound was not considered in their studies therefore physical processes of instability of a breakwater due to a tsunami e g combined effects of scouring of mound seepage and piping beneath breakwater could not explained by their studies dong et al 2012 chen et al 2013 and zen et al 2013 discussed both the pop out failure of armoured blocks and reduction of bearing capacity due to tsunami induced seepage by conducting model tests under 1 g gravitational field scouring of mound and seabed soils were not allowed during their physical model tests chaudhary et al 2017c described the stability of a breakwater under combined actions of an earthquake and tsunami but it is an analytical study and some important factors such as scouring of mound and pore water pressures in foundation were not considered in the study main factors for instability of a breakwater foundation during a tsunami are i tsunami wave forces on a caisson ii seepage of seawater beneath a caisson through mound and seabed soils iii piping of seabed soils and iv scouring of mound and seabed soils but all those studies considered either one or two of these factors such as tsunami induced seepage or tsunami induced scouring all the possible factors e g seepage scouring and piping which are responsible for the instability of a breakwater during a tsunami did not consider in their studies in fact most of the studies did not consider seabed soils as their mound rests on base of a soil box therefore effects of some important parameters such as scouring and piping of the seabed soils during a tsunami could not be understood thus instability of a breakwater during a tsunami could not be explained completely by these studies to the end the authors conducted a series of centrifuge model tests to evaluate the instability of a breakwater and its foundation subjected to a tsunami and all the possible factors are considered in this study which can affect the stability of a breakwater foundation during a tsunami the main novelty of this study is that all constraints are made free and tsunami overflow test was conducted under centrifuge gravitational field in such a way that it could represent the actual failure process of a breakwater during a tsunami which may occur in the real ground in addition stability evaluation of breakwater under earthquake loadings is also included in the study generally a tsunami is followed by an undersea earthquake ml 6 5 the foundation of a breakwater may damage severely during the earthquake due to high excess pore water pressure or liquefaction and a breakwater may settle heavily during the earthquake during a tsunami the tsunami induced seepage beneath a breakwater and scouring of mound impose instability to the breakwater in the present study the stability of a breakwater is determined under an earthquake and a tsunami to determine the effects of foundation soils on the performance of the breakwater two soil layers were used in the foundation beneath mound during the tests a series of centrifuge model tests were performed to determine the stability of the breakwater subjected to an earthquake and a tsunami numerical simulations were also conducted to make clear the mechanism however due to limitation of centrifuge devices effects of an earthquake on tsunami overflow could not be considered in the present study 2 centrifuge model tests the centrifuge technique has been often used to investigate various geotechnical problems since 1960s the main advantage of the technique is that high stress can be generated corresponding to a prototype which is necessary to simulate the non linear behavior of soil 2 1 experimental setup and procedures centrifuge model tests were conducted at dpri disaster prevention research institute kyoto university japan using a beam type geotechnical centrifuge machine the centrifuge machine has an effective radius of 2 5 m and it can be operated up to acceleration of 200 g for static tests and 50 g for dynamic tests soil box was made of steel and its front face was made of acrylic plates see fig 1 a water tank and movable gate were installed in the soil box to generate tsunami the moveable gate could be closed over water inlet hole located at the bottom of the water tank it can be opened by sending a signal from a remote computer and allow the water to release from the water tank once the water is released from the tank it flows across the soil box where the model is placed it is then captured in a drainage tank which is attached at the bottom of the soil box to avoid reflection of water waves generated due to the presence of the wall on opposite side see fig 1 2 2 model description the future earthquakes such as tokai earthquake nankai earthquake and tonankai earthquake are matters of great concern for the politicians policy makers and researchers of japan these are predicted to occur any time in the near future according to the report of the central disaster management council of the ministry of japan central disaster management council 2003 about 2 m seismic subsidence is expected due to the nankai earthquake in the kochi area shikoku island japan the miyazaki prefecture is predicted as one of the most affected areas by the nankai earthquake tsunami waves of height more than 15 m are predicted in this area it is the reason that the breakwater at miyazaki port miyazaki prefecture japan was chosen as a prototype for this study due to the limitations of the tsunami generation devices installed in the soil box the maximum centrifuge acceleration was limited to 25 g the prototype breakwater is 12 7 m high therefore if conventional scaling laws for the centrifuge model tests were applied the height of the model breakwater would be 50 8 cm in the scaled model under 25 g gravitational field and it was too large for the centrifuge machine arm length 2 5 m to overcome this limitation the generalized scaling law iai et al 2005 was adopted in this research which is a combination of the scaling laws for centrifuge tests and the laws for 1 g dynamic model tests in the generalized scaling law a model in geotechnical centrifuge is considered to be a small scaled model representing a virtual 1 g shaking table model the virtual 1 g model is again scaled down by applying a similitude centrifuge law using this method geometric scaling factor applied in 1 g test m can be multiplied with that for centrifuge test n resulting in much larger overall scaling factor n mn see table 1 tobita et al 2011 2012 validated the generalized scaling law for both dry and saturated sand by conducting a series of centrifuge model tests the prototype to model ratio n was adopted as 225 and the centrifuge tests were conducted under 25 g gravitational field the model of the breakwater foundation is shown in fig 2 the generalized scaling law m 9 and n 25 proposed by iai et al 2005 was adopted to determine the various parameters for the earthquake loadings and are shown in table 1 however the similitude relationship discussed by takahashi et al 2014 can be used for the tsunami overflow test this study deals with the behavior of a breakwater due to damage of its foundation therefore the breakwater was made strong enough to prevent any damage to its body during the tests the box type caisson breakwater was made of aluminum and filled with lead balls to adjust weight specific gravity 2 3 and center of gravity the model caisson is 56 4 mm high corresponding to 12 7 m for the prototype and 60 mm wide corresponding to 13 5 m for the prototype as the caisson length was spanning across the entire width of the soil box the caisson breakwater can be approximated as a plane strain situation a three dimensional schematic view of the model is shown in fig 3 in order to prevent side friction between the caisson and soil box lubricant was used on the side faces of the caisson vibration absorbing layers were used on both ends of the soil box in order to prevent seismic wave reflections during seismic loadings the seabed foundation soils was made of two layers of toyoura sands the lower soil layer was of relative density dr 85 approximate and the upper soil layer was of relative density dr 55 approximate the lower dense layer was assumed as hard strata representing bed rocks the thickness of the lower layer was 30 mm corresponding to 6 75 m for the prototype and the thickness of the upper layer was 50 mm corresponding to 11 25 m for the prototype the rubble mound was made of crushed stones the mean grain size d50 of the stones was 4 7 mm which corresponds to 1 1 m in the prototype scale table 2 shows properties of the foundation materials the mean grain size d50 of toyoura sands was 0 16 mm in the case of a centrifuge model test effects of soil particle size might become significant if ratio of foundation width to mean soil grain size falls below 40 ovesen 1975 as the ratio of the caisson width to the mean sand grain size is 375 in the present test so it can be said that the effects of the sand particle size is insignificant the dynamic characteristics of the toyoura sands and the crushed stones were determined against cyclic loadings by element tests and have been reported in hazarika et al 2016 2015 in order to observe deformation of the seabed soils during the earthquake loadings red membranes were used on the front wall of the soil box and fixed in such a way that they could move or deform with the soils during the earthquake loadings lines white color were drawn on the front face of the soil box to observe scouring during the tsunami see fig 1 however the membranes were not used during the tsunami overflow test as per the generalized similitude law see table 1 fluid of viscosity of 1 3 10 4 m2 s 130cst at 25 c was used in the tests the viscous fluid was made by mixing metolose with water 2 3 instrumentation instrumentations for the tests are shown in fig 4 four displacement gauges were installed two gauges for settlements of the caisson v1 and v2 and two gauges for horizontal displacements of the caisson h1 and h2 ten pore water pressure gauges p1 to p10 were installed to monitor pore water pressures in the foundation soils and mound four water pressure gauges w1 to w4 were installed to measure water pressures on the caisson and five accelerometers a1 to a5 were used to record accelerations history of the soils and structure at different locations of the model one accelerometer a4 was fixed at the base of the soil box to record the input seismic waves 2 4 earthquake loadings and tsunami overflow in the case of a strong earthquake main shock is preceded by several foreshocks in order to correlate this real ground fact two foreshocks and one main shock were used as earthquake loadings the earthquake loadings were applied at the bottom of the soil box in the form of sinusoidal acceleration waves the frequency f and time t were same for the foreshocks and main shock however the acceleration amplitude a was varied for the foreshocks and main shock the frequency was 83 hz which corresponds to 0 66 hz for the prototype and the time of the earthquake loading was 1 4 s 3 min in the prototype scale the 1st foreshock was of acceleration amplitude 2 5 g corresponds to 0 1 g in the prototype scale and the 2nd foreshock was of acceleration amplitude 5 0 g corresponds to 0 2 g in the prototype scale the acceleration amplitude for the main shock was 10 0 g corresponds to 0 4 g in the prototype scale the earthquake loadings are shown in fig 5 the foreshocks and main shock were applied to the same model sequentially a time interval was provided between two consecutive loadings so that pore water pressures could dissipate completely in the foundation soils and mound the earthquake loading was chosen in such a way that the input earthquake loading main shock is somehow equivalent to the 2011 off the pacific coast of tohoku earthquake which was a very long duration earthquake to observe the effects of acceleration amplitudes different acceleration amplitudes 0 1 g 0 2 g and 0 4 g in the prototype scale were used for the earthquake loadings in the forms of foreshocks and main shock for tsunami overflow test fresh model was developed and the tsunami overflow test was performed on the new fresh model under 25 g gravitational field 2 5 results and discussions stability of the breakwater is discussed in terms of the settlement horizontal displacement and tilt overturning of the caisson during the earthquake and the tsunami horizontal displacement of the caisson toward the harbor side is considered as positive 2 5 1 effects of the earthquake loadings the earthquake loadings were applied at the bottom of the soil box in terms of foreshocks and main shock and a time interval was provided between two consecutive earthquake loadings in order to dissipate excess pore water pressure in the foundation 2 5 1 1 acceleration response of the soil and the structure accelerations were recorded at different locations of the model by the accelerometers during the earthquake loadings and the acceleration histories of the soil and breakwater are shown in fig 6 which were recorded during the main shock a 10 0 g it can be observed that the acceleration at the bottom of the soil box a4 is 10 0 g it confirms that the experimental set up worked well during the centrifuge test the peak acceleration at the top of the lower soil layer a3 is less than the input peak acceleration acceleration amplitude decreases during passing through a dense soil layer and it was the reason that the peak acceleration at the top of the lower dense layer was less than that of the input acceleration furthermore acceleration amplifies during propagating through a loose soil layer and it was the reason that the peak acceleration at the top of the upper soil layer a5 is more than that at a3 the peak acceleration at a5 is almost 15 0 g the peak acceleration further increases during passing through the body of the caisson and the peak acceleration at the top of the caisson a1 is almost 17 5 g 2 5 1 2 excess pore water pressure in the foundation pore water pressures were monitored at different locations of the foundation ground during the foreshocks and main shock in order to see the increase in pore water pressure during the earthquake loadings the time history of the excess pore water pressure epwp recorded at p8 is shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the epwp increases with the increase in acceleration amplitude of the earthquake loadings it can be observed that the epwp increases to 0 8 kpa during the first foreshock and its value reaches to 1 75 kpa at the end of 2nd foreshock finally the epwp increases to a high value 4 58 kpa at the end of the main shock it can be observed that acceleration amplitude has significant impacts on the epwp and the epwp increases abruptly to a high value during the main shock hence acceleration amplitude needs attention during establishment of countermeasures and designing a new breakwater foundation subjected to an earthquake loading 2 5 1 3 settlement of the caisson in order to see the effects of acceleration amplitude on the performance of the breakwater settlement and horizontal displacement of the caisson were measured under different acceleration amplitudes foreshocks and main shock the settlement and horizontal displacement of the caisson are shown in figs 8 and 9 for different acceleration amplitudes 2 5 g 5 0 g and 10 0 g it can be observed that the settlement and horizontal displacement of the caisson increase with the increase in acceleration amplitude excess pore water pressure increases with the increase in acceleration amplitude it causes decrease in the shear strength and bearing capacity of the foundation and leads to increase in the settlement and horizontal displacement of the caisson in addition the seismic inertial forces and hydrodynamic forces increase with the acceleration these are the reasons for the increase in the settlement and horizontal displacement of the caisson with the increase in acceleration amplitude the settlement of the caisson measured at v1 is shown in fig 8 a it depicts that the settlement is 3 5 mm for the 1st foreshock a 2 5 g and increases to 7 4 mm during the 2nd foreshock a 5 0 g it further increases to 22 6 mm at the end of the main shock a 10 0 g it can be noted that the settlement increases to 2 1 times as the acceleration amplitude increases from 2 5 g to 5 0 g and increases to 6 5 times as the acceleration amplitude increases from 2 5 g to 10 0 g it can be noted that the settlement increases abruptly to a high value during the main shock compared to the foreshocks it may be possible that the foundation soil liquefied during the main shock and led to deformation of the foundation ground which resulted in the excess settlement of the caisson the settlement of the caisson measured at v2 is shown in fig 8 b it can be seen that the settlement is 2 4 mm for the 1st foreshock a 2 5 g it increases to 5 4 mm during the 2nd foreshock a 5 0 g and finally reached to 15 8 mm at the end of the main shock a 10 0 g it can be noted that the settlement increases to 2 3 times as the acceleration amplitude increases from 2 5 g to 5 0 g and increases to 6 6 times as the acceleration amplitude increases from 2 5 g to 10 0 g differential settlement of the caisson can be observed from fig 8 a and b during all the three earthquake loadings 2 5 g 5 0 g and 10 0 g 2 5 1 4 horizontal displacement of the caisson horizontal displacement of the caisson was measured for different acceleration amplitudes 2 5 g 5 0 g and 10 0 g and are shown in fig 9 it can be observed that the horizontal displacement of the caisson increases with the increase in acceleration amplitude of the earthquake loadings the horizontal displacement of the caisson measured at h1 is shown in fig 9 a the horizontal displacement is 0 2 mm for the 1st foreshock a 2 5 g and increases to 1 1 mm during the 2nd foreshock a 5 0 g its value further increases to 5 7 mm at the end of the main shock a 10 0 g it can be noted that the horizontal displacement increases to 5 5 times as the acceleration amplitude increases from 2 5 g to 5 0 g and increases to 28 5 times as the acceleration amplitude increases from 2 5 g to 10 0 g the horizontal displacement of the caisson measured at h2 is shown in fig 9 b it can be noticed that the horizontal displacement is 0 2 mm for the 1st foreshock a 2 5 g the horizontal displacement is 0 2 mm during the 2nd foreshock a 5 0 g its value increases to 4 0 mm at the end of the main shock a 10 0 g it can be noted that the horizontal displacement became high during the main shock 2 5 1 5 tilt of the caisson differential settlement of the caisson was observed during the centrifuge model tests which imposed tilt on the caisson to determine the tilt overturning of the caisson during the earthquake loadings the tilt angle of the caisson was calculated based on the settlements recorded at v1 and v2 by the displacement gauges the title angle is measured with respect to vertical and assumed positive in anticlockwise direction the tilt angle is determined for different acceleration amplitudes 2 5 g 5 0 g and 10 0 g and it is shown in fig 10 it can be observed that the tilt angle increases with the increase in acceleration amplitude the tilt angle is 0 4 during the 1st foreshock a 2 5 g it increases to 0 8 for the 2nd foreshock a 5 0 g finally the caisson tilted to 2 7 at the end of the main shock a 10 0 g it can be noted that the tilt angle increases to 2 times as the acceleration amplitude increases from 2 5 g to 5 0 g and increases to 6 8 times as the acceleration amplitude increases from 2 5 g to 10 0 g it can be noticed that the tilt angle became high at the end of the main shock 2 5 1 6 deformation of the foundation ground photographs were taken during the centrifuge model tests by a high speed camera in order to observe the behavior of the breakwater during the earthquake loadings the photographs taken at the end of each excitation 2 5 g 5 0 g and 10 0 g are shown in fig 11 the photograph of the model before the earthquake loadings is shown in fig 11 a fig 11 b shows photograph of the model at the end of the 1st foreshock a 2 5 g the model shows very small or negligible deformation during the 1st foreshock fig 11 c shows the photograph of the model at the end of the 2nd foreshock a 5 0 g small deformation of the foundation ground can be seen in the figure settlement and horizontal displacement of the caisson increased during the 2nd foreshock in addition the caisson tilted slightly toward the harbor side the model of the breakwater at the end of the main shock a 10 0 g is shown in fig 11 d it can be seen that the red membranes beneath the mound deformed severely which indicates that the seabed soils and rubble mound deformed during the earthquake loadings it is due the facts that the seabed soils beneath the caisson settled and deformed outward in lateral direction during the earthquake loading moreover the rubble mound almost collapsed it settled in the seabed soils and spread outward in the both sides of the mound the deformation of the seabed soils and rubble mound imposed settlement and horizontal displacement on the caisson these are the reasons for the settlement horizontal displacement and tilt of the caisson during the earthquake loadings 2 5 2 effects of the tsunami overflow to observe the performance of the breakwater and its foundation under tsunami induced forces tsunami overflow test was performed on the model breakwater fresh model was prepared for the tsunami overflow test performance of the model is discussed in terms of excess pore water pressure in the foundation ground settlement of the caisson horizontal displacement of the caisson and tsunami wave pressures on the caisson 2 5 2 1 tsunami wave pressure on the caisson during the tsunami there is intense interaction between the tsunami waves and breakwater rubble mound and seabed soils the tsunami waves imposed huge forces in the lateral direction on the breakwater the tsunami wave force on the breakwater is expressed in terms of tsunami wave pressures the water pressure gauges were installed on the caisson to measure the tsunami wave pressures on the caisson and the tsunami wave pressure are shown in fig 12 it can be observe that when the tsunami struck the breakwater it imposed huge wave pressures on the caisson due to the blocking of the tsunami waves by the caisson the tsunami wave pressure increased with the depth of the tsunami waves the tsunami pressure on the caisson is maximum for w4 w4 is located near the bottom of the caisson on the seaside therefore the water head was higher at the gauge compared to the other gauges it is the reason that the tsunami pressure is maximum at w4 compared to the other gauges w3 laid near the top of the caisson on the seaside and hence the water head at w3 is less compared to that at w4 it is the reason that the tsunami wave pressure at the gauge is less than that at w4 as w1 and w2 laid on the harbor side and the tsunami water did not reach to these gauges therefore no increase in water pressure was recorded by the gauges 2 5 2 2 increase in pore water pressure during the tsunami during the tsunami pore water pressure increased in the foundation ground mainly due to increase in the seawater level and the tsunami induced seepage increase in pore water pressure ipwp has significant impacts on the stability of a breakwater during a tsunami it can affect tsunami induced seepage scouring and bearing capacity of the foundation ground it was observed that there was a significant difference in ipwp at the same level between the seaside and harbor side during the tsunami to see the difference in ipwp on the seaside and harbor side at same level fig 13 shows the increase in pore water pressure in the seabed soils due to the tsunami at three different locations i p7 near the seaside end of the mound ii p8 beneath the caisson and iii p9 near the harbor side end of the mound it can be seen that the ipwp is high at p7 it is due to increase in the seawater level on the seaside during the tsunami due to the blocking of the tsunami waves by the breakwater seepage through the seabed soils is also responsible for the increase in the pore water pressure at the location the ipwp at p8 is less than that at p7 seepage of the seawater took place in large scale beneath the caisson through the mound and the seabed soils it is the main reason for the increase in pore water pressure at p8 the overflowing tsunami waves seawater above the caisson imposed additional pore water pressures at the location due to high seepage force piping of the seabed sands was also observed beneath the mound during the test at p9 the ipwp is less than those at p7 and p8 the ipwp at p9 is mainly due to the seepage and increase in the seawater level on the harbor side during the tsunami it is to be noted that the amount of seepage was less at this location compared to that at p8 2 5 2 3 settlement of the caisson to see the performance of the breakwater during the tsunami overflow average settlement of the breakwater is shown in fig 14 the average settlement of the caisson was calculated based on the settlements measured by the displacement gauges at v1 and v2 see fig 4 it can be observed that the average settlement of the caisson increased during the tsunami the harbor side rubble mound was scoured by the overflowing tsunami tsunami induced seepage took place beneath the caisson through the rubble mound and seabed soils the seepage imposed seepage force on the rubble of the rubble mound and the soil grains of the seabed soils in the direction of seepage the seepage caused pipping of the seabed soils beneath the mound furthermore increase in the seawater level during the tsunami overflow imposed an additional buoyancy force on the breakwater these factors reduced the confining pressure and shear strength and finally caused decrease in the bearing capacity of the foundation ground hence the average settlement of the caisson increased during the tsunami overflow it can be observed in fig 14 that the average settlement of the caisson increased to 2 1 mm at the end of the tsunami overflow test 2 5 2 4 horizontal displacement of the caisson when a tsunami strikes a breakwater it imposes impact forces in the lateral direction on a breakwater under the action of these impact forces the breakwater may slide over a mound and it may sink into a sea similar phenomenon happened during the 2011 off the pacific coast of tohoku earthquake and tsunami when caissons slid over the mound and sank into the sea and it became the reason of the failure of some breakwaters in japan in order to see the impact of tsunami waves on the horizontal displacement of the caisson average horizontal displacement of the caisson are shown in fig 15 the average horizontal displacement of the caisson was calculated based on the horizontal displacement measured by the displacement gauges at h1 and h2 see fig 4 it can be seen in the figure that the average horizontal displacement of the caisson reached to a high value at the end of the tsunami the average horizontal displacement of the caisson reached to 21 3 mm 4 8 m in the prototype scale during the tsunami overflow it was observed the caisson slid over the mound under the action of the tsunami waves it was the main reason for excess horizontal displacement of the caisson therefore for the safety of a breakwater it very important to develop countermeasures which can reduce horizontal displacement of the caisson during a tsunami 2 5 2 5 ground deformation to see the behavior of the breakwater foundation during the tsunami overflow the photograph taken after the tsunami overflow test is shown in fig 16 it can be seen that the rubble mound in front of the caisson on the harbor side was scoured by the overflowing tsunami the stones of the rubble mound were flown away by the tsunami waves and spread over the seabed on the harbor side the seabed was disturbed due to the tsunami waves and the seabed sands in front of the mound were scoured and blew out by the overflowing tsunami the sands piled up on the harbor side due to the blocking of the tsunami by the caisson the seawater level increased on the seaside of the caisson it resulted in increase in pore water on the seaside compared to that on the harbor side it caused one directional seepage beneath the caisson through the rubble mound and seabed sands from seaside to harbor side the seepage beneath the caisson started as soon as the seawater level increased in the seaside during the tsunami the rubble mound was made of crushed stones and had high voids which provide easy path for the seawater to pass through them it was the reason that the seepage was mostly concentrated through the mound but significant amount of seepage was observed through the upper loose soil layer the seepage decreased in downward direction due to high seepage forces piping of the seabed sands was also observed beneath the mound during the tsunami overflow test the seepage force supported scouring of the mound which was mainly caused by the overflowing tsunami the whole phenomenon was continue till the end of the tsunami overflow test these factors decreased the bearing capacity of the foundation ground and caused horizontal displacement and settlement of the caisson due to high lateral thrust imposed on the caisson by the tsunami waves the caisson slid over the mound and displaced towards harbor side which can be seen clearly in the figure 3 numerical simulation finite difference program flac was used for numerical simulation of the centrifuge model tests purpose of the numerical simulation is to make clear the mechanism and behavior of the breakwater and its foundation under the earthquake loadings tsunami induced seepage beneath the breakwater is also discussed by the numerical simulation 3 1 model and boundary conditions a grid of size 385 mm x and 385 mm was generated to develop numerical model of the breakwater under plane strain condition the whole grid was discretized into 3025 number of small zones both the soil layers of the seabed were made of toyoura sands and modelled as cohesionless and homogeneous material with elasto plastic response similar to the centrifuge model test the lower soil layer was made of toyoura sand of dr 85 and the upper soil layer was made of toyoura sand of dr 55 the thickness of the lower and upper layer were 30 mm and 50 mm respectively table 3 shows material properties of the foundation ground soil profile for both the layers were assumed homogeneous throughout the seabed profile the rubble mound was made of crushed stones and was modelled as elastic material because it has been the most commonly used to simulate ground behavior of a rubble foundation ye and wang 2015 takahashi et al 2014 the caisson was made of aluminum and modelled as elastic material during the modelling the seabed was created first and then the mound was created after the mound formation the gabion and the caisson were modelled after construction of the whole model the seawater level was raised up to height 40 mm above the seabed saturation level of the foundation soils and mound was made 1 0 fully saturated fig 17 shows numerical model of the breakwater for effective stress analysis the formula proposed by byrne 1991 was considered it is an incremental shear volume coupling equation and incorporates in a cyclic simple shear pore pressure element model it includes an elastic rebound modulus equation that allows the excess pore pressures to be computed for any prescribed cyclic shear strain history ye and wang 2015 and chaudhary et al 2016a c 2017a b also used the byrne model to simulate seismic behavior of seabed foundation of a breakwater all movements were restrained at the bottom plane of the model in order to determine the behavior of the breakwater at the end of construction the model was solved for static equilibrium before applying the seismic loadings the seismic loadings were applied in the form of sinusoidal velocity waves at the base of the model corresponding to 83 hz frequency and 1 4 s time the amplitudes of the seismic waves were equivalent to acceleration amplitudes 2 5 g 5 g and 10 g similar to the earthquake loadings of the centrifuge model tests to avoid wave reflections from the boundaries free field boundaries conditions were applied during the seismic excitations a damping ratio of 5 was assigned to the model during earthquake loadings in the case of the tsunami the tsunami wave forces which were obtained during the centrifuge model test were applied on the caisson to observed seepage flow beneath the caisson 3 2 validation of the model for conducting numerical analyses it is very important to validate numerical model with experimental data in order to validate the numerical model the responses obtained by the numerical simulations are compared with those of the centrifuge model tests validation of the numerical model is made in terms of i settlements of the caisson and ii excess pore water pressure in the foundation ground during the main shock the comparison for settlements of the caisson measured at v1 and v2 is shown in fig 18 for the main shock it can be seen that there are good agreements between the settlement of the caisson obtained from the numerical simulation and those of the centrifuge model test the time histories of excess pore water pressure measured at p8 is compared in fig 19 for the main shock it can be observed that there are close agreement between them thus the results show ability of the numerical model to capture the behavior of the physical model and hence it confirms validation of the numerical model 3 3 numerical analyses the physical model of the breakwater deformed during the centrifuge model tests to see the deformation of the model breakwater and its foundation at the end of the main shock displacement vectors are drawn by the numerical simulation and are shown in fig 20 it can be seen in the figure that flow of the seabed soils and rubbles of the rubble mound took place in large scale beneath the caisson the seabed soils settled in the downward direction and deformed in outward lateral direction furthermore the flow of the seabed soils is concentrate mostly within the upper layer loose soil layer of the seabed in addition deformation of the rubble mound can be seen clearly in the figure the rubble mound settled in the seabed soils and spread outward it resulted in collapse of almost whole rubble mound during the earthquake loading these are the reasons of settlement horizontal displacement and tilt of the caisson at the end of the main shock liquefaction may occur during an earthquake which causes damage of a foundation to observed liquefaction in the foundation ground pore water pressure pwp ratio was determined for different earthquake loadings by the numerical analyses fish programming language was used to define pwp ratio and it was coded in flac fish enables the user to define a new function which was either difficult or impossible with the existing program structures of flac pwp ratio was determined at a depth of 14 mm 3 2 m in the prototype scale beneath base of the mound and 63 mm 14 2 m in the prototype scale distance toward harbor side from harbor side edge of the caisson the pwp ratio is shown in fig 21 for different acceleration amplitudes it can be observed that the pwp ratio increases with the increase in acceleration amplitude deformation of the foundation ground increased with the increase in acceleration amplitude it resulted in increase in the shear strain with the increase in acceleration amplitude of the earthquake loadings the increase in shear strain caused increase in pore water pressure and hence pwp ratio increased with the increase in acceleration amplitude it can be seen in the figure that the pwp ratio is 0 15 for the 1st foreshock a 2 5 g and it increases to 0 32 during the 2nd foreshock a 5 0 g the pwp ratio reaches to 0 86 during the main shock a 10 0 g which is close to liquefaction hence liquefaction might occur in the foundation ground during the main shock it is one of the main reasons for high deformation of the mound and seabed soils which resulted in excess settlement and horizontal displacement of the caisson during the main shock of the earthquake loadings during physical model tests it was observed that a change in the seawater level affected the performance of the breakwater during the earthquake loadings to see the effects of change in the seawater level settlement of the caisson is determined for different seawater levels and it is shown in fig 22 the main shock is used as earthquake loading and the settlement of midpoint of the top surface of the caisson is determined for three different seawater levels d i d 20 mm corresponds to 4 5 m in the prototype scale above the seabed ii d 40 mm corresponds to 9 0 m in the prototype scale above the seabed and iii d 60 mm corresponds to 13 5 m in the prototype scale above the seabed it can be seen in the figure that the settlement of the caisson decreases with the increase in the seawater level buoyancy force acts on a breakwater due to its submergence in the seawater the buoyancy force increases with the increase in seawater level the increase in buoyancy force decreases effective weight of the breakwater and hence seismic inertia force on the caisson also decreases with the increase in seawater level it is the reason that the settlement of the caisson decreases with the increase in seawater level it can be seen in the figure that the settlement is 28 8 mm for d 20 mm and it decreases to 19 7 mm for d 40 mm the settlement further decreases to 10 2 mm for d 60 mm therefore seawater level needs attention for evaluating the stability of a breakwater during an earthquake loading deformation of the upper loose soil layer was one of the main reasons of the settlement of the caisson during the earthquake loadings thickness of the upper loose soil layer may affects settlement of the breakwater in order to observed the effects of thickness of the layer numerical simulation was carried out for different thickness of the layer and it is shown in fig 23 the settlement of midpoint of the top surface of the caisson was determine for three different thickness of the upper loose soil layer i thickness 30 mm corresponds to 6 8 m in the prototype scale ii thickness 50 mm corresponds to 11 3 m in the prototype scale and iii thickness 70 mm corresponds to 15 8 m in the prototype scale the main shock was used as earthquake loading it can be seen that the settlement increases with the increase in thickness of the upper loose soil layer of the seabed the deformation of the upper loose soil was one of the major reasons of settlement of the breakwater see fig 20 during the earthquake deformation of soils is more in a thick loose soil layer compared to a thin loose soil layer and hence a thick soil layer causes more settlement of the caisson compared to a thin layer therefore the settlement of the caisson increases with the increase in thickness of the upper loose soil layer it can be seen in the figure that the settlement is 22 2 mm for the thick soil layer d 70 mm and it decreases to 19 7 mm and 16 4 mm for the soil layer of thickness 50 mm and 30 mm respectively in order to observe seepage through the foundation ground beneath the breakwater flow vectors are shown in fig 24 the flow vectors around the caisson and inside the foundation ground mound and seabed soils can be seen in the figure the flow vectors for the mound indicate high seepage of water through the mound the mound had high permeability and provided easy path for water to flow through it hence the mound shows high seepage flow the seepage through the mound leads to generate seepage forces on the rubbles of the rubble mound and it supports tsunami waves in scouring of the harbor side mound during the tsunami overflow the foundation soils also show flow vectors seepage force may cause boiling or pipping of seabed sands for the foundation ground these factors decrease the confining pressure and shear strength of the foundation and finally reduce the bearing capacity of the foundation the seepage force is high at the bottom corned of the caisson harbor side which might initiate scouring from that point the seepage decreases in the downward direction the upper loose layer shows higher seepage as compared to the lower dense layer the seepage force in the upper layer may lead to scour of the soil of the upper layer beneath the mound during the tsunami it is to be noticed that in addition to the mound the seabed upper soil layer also shows significant seepage therefore consideration of seabed soils beneath a mound is important for the stability evaluation of a breakwater during a tsunami 4 conclusions the stability of a breakwater has been described under an earthquake and tsunami induced forces using centrifuge model tests two foreshocks and one main shock were used for the earthquake loadings in addition to the mound the seabed soils were also used as the foundation ground numerical analyses were performed to make clear the mechanism the following conclusions could be derived based on this research 1 in addition to the tsunami the earthquake imposed a great threat for the stability of the breakwater the main reasons for the settlement of the breakwater were subsidence and lateral flows of the seabed soils and the rubbles beneath the breakwater during the earthquake loadings these factors reduced the shear strength and finally caused decrease in the bearing capacity of the foundation these resulted in the settlement of the caisson during the earthquake loadings moreover almost whole rubble mound collapsed during the main shock the settlement horizontal displacement and tilt of the caisson increased with the increase in acceleration amplitude during the earthquake loadings 2 liquefaction of the foundation soil occurred beneath the mound during the main shock of the earthquake loadings it resulted in flow of the seabed soils and rubble mound in large scale beneath the caisson it was one of the main reasons of excess settlement horizontal displacement and tilt of the breakwater during the main shock of the earthquake loadings 3 during the tsunami overflow test the breakwater slid over the mound under the impact of the tsunami wave forces scouring of the mound on harbor side was observed during the tsunami overflow tests the seabed soils were also scoured and the soils were piled up on harbor side by the tsunami waves seepage of the seawater took place beneath the caisson and it was concentrated mostly through the mound but significant amount of seepage was also observed through the upper soil layer these factors reduced the confining pressure and shear strength and finally resulted in reduction of bearing capacity of the foundation ground during the tsunami these are the reasons for excess horizontal displacement and settlement of the breakwater during the tsunami overflow 4 settlement of the breakwater decreased with the increase in the seawater level during the earthquake loadings buoyancy force increases with the increase in seawater which decreases effective weight and seismic inertia force of a caisson and hence settlement of the caisson decreased with the increase in the seawater level settlement of the caisson increased with the increase in thickness of the upper loose soils layer of the seabed during the earthquake loadings

23688,the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundation is an innovative alternative for offshore wind turbines the concept has wider adaptability and can be used as reinforcement method for existing monopiles a series of centrifuge tests was performed to investigate the lateral bearing capacities of the hybrid foundation under monotonic loads five foundation models and two soil types were considered according to the recorded responses the hybrid foundation demonstrated better lateral behaviors that both lateral bearing capacity and stiffness are enhanced two analytical methods were proposed and compared with the centrifuge test results the bearing capacity of the hybrid foundation is smaller than the sum of individual pile and friction wheel and a reduction factor is suggested for both friction wheels the friction wheel restrains rotations of monopile and provides extra restoring moments their effects are idealized as equivalent moments acting on the pile head the analytical results provide possible solutions in estimating the lateral bearing capacity of the innovative hybrid foundation system for offshore wind turbines by using traditional theories keywords

europe by the end of 2014 which consumed 79 of all installed offshore wind turbines brown et al 2015 ho et al 2015 the foundations are steel piles with large diameters total lengths of 20 m 50 m and driven 40 50 of the total lengths into the seabed to provide resistances arany et al 2015c standard 2007 the offshore wind turbines are mainly subjected to large lateral loads and overturning moments caused by wind wave and ice but relatively smaller vertical loads for a typical monopile foundation the vertical capacity is satisfactory if the requirements of lateral and overturning stabilities are guaranteed arany et al 2017 meanwhile the offshore wind turbines are dynamically sensitive structure and their natural frequencies are close to the excitation frequencies the loads induced by the vibrations at the hub level as well as those caused by blade shadowing effects are considered in the design phase the effects of these external loadings could be transformed into bending moment spectrum at the mudline arany et al 2015b the dynamic response of the offshore wind turbines is a concern wang et al 2017d a proper system frequency is selected to avoid resonance and hence the soft stiff design is the most commonly used method in the offshore wind industry arany et al 2015a the natural frequency of the offshore wind turbine may change with the dynamic loadings which will enhance the dynamic amplification and increase the fatigue damage on the structure by moving the offshore wind farm into deeper seas environmental conditions are more severe and the capacities of wind turbines are higher which results in more challenges for geotechnical design of the foundations the original monopile foundation is likely to be not sufficient to support the new generation of offshore wind structures and therefore improved foundation concepts are necessary the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundation is proposed to enhance the lateral bearing capacity of the original offshore monopile the improved design is a combination of monopile foundation and gravity foundation as shown schematically in fig 2 a circular friction wheel is added at the mudline to stiffen the pile responses laterally the circular friction wheel can be a solid circular footing or a circular frame filled with gravels the introduction of the friction wheel can provide additional shear stress to resist the lateral load and impart larger restoring moment to lower pile rotations clough and duncan 1973 mokwa and duncan 2003 moreover the friction wheel brings larger vertical stresses to the foundation soil and therefore increase the lateral resistance in front of the pile additionally if the friction wheel embeds into the foundation soil to some depth during the operation the passive pressure in front of the wheel can further reduce its lateral deflections mokwa and duncan 2003 the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundation can be an innovative alternative for offshore wind turbines located at areas with requirements of stronger substructures this concept can also be a reinforcement method for existing monopile foundations the fatigue of materials as well as the changing of seabed soil conditions may influence behaviors of the pile foundation in service but it is unrealistic to rebuild the foundation especially at offshore areas therefore a friction wheel can be applied to provide additional bearing capacities as an effective modification to investigate the lateral bearing behaviors of the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundation system both the response of a laterally loaded single pile and the bearing capacity of the friction wheel should be analyzed as a single unit several researcher have proposed different methods to investigate the lateral response of pile foundation broms 1964a b hansen et al 1961 matlock and reese 1960 mcclelland and focht 1958 mokwa and duncan 2001 randolph 1981 reese et al 1974 these analytical models are based on methods of winkler approach p y theory elasticity theory or finite element methods broms broms 1964a b assumed a short rigid pile rotated about a center without substantial pile deformations and the lateral bearing capacity was estimated by the sum of earth pressures reese et al reese 1977 reese et al 1974 studied the behaviors of laterally loaded pile in saturated sand by considering the nonlinear responses of the ground soil which was commonly known as the p y method to date several p y models for the analysis of laterally loaded piles have been proposed georgiadis et al 1992 murchison and o neill 1984 wesselink et al 1988 api and dnv presented design codes for offshore monopile foundations based on p y method for a service life of 25 years which is widely used currently hao and liu 2017 ma et al 2017 rp2a wsda 2000 veritas 2004 the idea of friction wheel part is come from concepts of offshore gravity foundations and pile caps el marassi 2011 kim et al 1979 mokwa and duncan 2001 2003 mokwa and duncan 2001 conducted a series of full scale lateral load tests on single pile or group pile with pile caps and it was demonstrated that the pile cap contributed significant amounts of lateral resistances mokwa and duncan 2001 meanwhile the lateral responses of offshore gravity foundation were investigated by large scale tests and theoretical analysis andersen et al 1989 dyvik et al 1989 and the design codes for gravity foundation for offshore wind turbines were recommended by dnv veritas 2004 the base friction at the mudline is mainly depend on the vertical loads friction coefficient of the connecting surface contacting areas and properties of surrounding soil for the purpose of withstanding severe loading conditions the monopile is strengthened by a friction wheel at the mudline to create an innovative hybrid foundation system some similar concepts have been studied previously stone and arshi arshi and stone 2011 arshi et al 2013 stone et al 2007 conducted a series of 1 g tests of monopiled circular footing it was demonstrated the hybrid footing foundation did show advantages in lateral and vertical bearing behaviors the soil in front of the footing was found to be displaced and provided some passive earth pressure during the tests moreover it was suggested if the vertical movements were allowed between the footing and the pile the hybrid footing foundation was more effective since the two parts were acting independently moreover a series of centrifuge tests were performed to investigate this topic more specifically and the 3d finite element model fem was created to compare with the test results arshi et al 2013 lu et al 2017 the hybrid foundation presented a lateral bearing capacity of three times comparing to the original monopile foundation afterwards several centrifuge tests were conducted on monopile footing foundation with more typical dimensions and loading conditions for offshore wind turbines in both clay and sandy soil the fem models were constructed to reinforce the test results simultaneously lehane et al 2010 2014 the addition of footing reduced the moment being transferred to the pile and larger lateral bearing capacities were obtained the numerical investigation and centrifuge modelling of hybrid monopile footing foundation under combined loadings were summarized thoroughly el marassi 2011 the failure envelop for drained and undrained loadings were depicted and it was found the bearing capacities depended on the geometry of the hybrid system especially the ratio of pile length to the footing diameter moreover responses of the hybrid monopile foundation under cyclic loadings were investigated in our laboratory and a analytical method was proposed to estimate the accumulative lateral displacement in service conditions wang et al 2018 in summary of the previous researches the concept of hybrid monopile footing foundation was examined and some recommendations were put forward however just a few open literature are available currently meanwhile the shapes and materials of footings described previously are limited the study of this hybrid foundation system is far from comprehensive in the present study besides the solid friction wheel a gravel wheel is proposed and demonstrated fig 4 this design has great potential of efficiency and economy by making full use of boulders at offshore area and the installation is accelerated in this paper a series of centrifuge tests were performed to investigate lateral behaviors of the innovative hybrid monopile friction wheel foundations under monotonic lateral loads in sandy soil analytical methods to predict the bearing capacities are proposed and compared with the test results the mechanism of the hybrid foundation are summarized 2 centrifuge tests centrifuge modelling is an effective method in geotechnical investigations it provides reliable experimental results for concept proofs the behavior of soil is stress dependent thereby the 1 g laboratory tests may not able to replicate the geotechnical phenomenon well moreover the availability of field tests are limited especially for offshore wind turbines however the numerical and theoretical analysis are hard to reach solid conclusions without calibrations with reliable physical tests therefore the centrifuge modelling was used in research the technique help realize test small scale models under high gravitational levels and therefore tests can be conducted under satisfactory stress states chakraborty and salgado 2010 chandrasekaran 2003 the results are interpreted by the centrifuge scaling law wang et al 2015 this method was used in the investigations of the behaviors of offshore wind turbine previously lehane et al 2010 2014 the centrifuge tests described in this paper were performed at case western reserve university cwru figueroa et al 1998 the test package is presented in fig 3 and details of tests are listed in table 1 ten centrifuge tests were conducted to investigate the lateral behaviors of the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundation under monotonic lateral load the maximum operational acceleration for the centrifuge was 50 g for all tests and data described here are all in prototype scale the wind turbine model was consist of three parts the tower head wind tower and foundation the tower head was simplified by a lumped mass with a dimension of 1 75 1 75 1 25 m length width height the wind tower was constructed by a steel rod with a diameter of 0 5 m and a length of 13 m the total weight of these two upper structures was 38 25ton the purpose of the upper structure was to apply vertical loads to the foundation as well as provide loading point for applying lateral loads the existing of the upper structure did not bring large influences to the results since the tests conducted are static five types of foundations were tested which included monopile monopile with steel wheel monopile with gravel wheel steel wheel only and gravel wheel only fig 3 the model pile was 7 m long 1 1 m diameter solid steel rod and 8ton weight the steel friction wheel was 7 m diameter 1 5 m thickness disc and the weight was 260ton the gravel wheel was made of a frame with a diameter of 7 m and a thickness of 1 5 m the frame was divided into 7 parts and filled with gravels whose total weight was 87 5ton the hybrid foundations were combinations of pile and friction wheels the pile was push fitted into the center hole of the steel wheel with secured connection and the steel wheel was fully contact with the soil surface after the installation for the gravel wheel the pile and frame were installed firstly after which the gravel was filled the sand used was standard toyoura sand with a mean particle size of 0 17 mm specific gravity of 2 65 and void ratio ranges of 0 6 and 0 98 wang et al 2017a two soil conditions were prepared as loose saturated sand and dense saturated sand with relative densities of 30 and 70 respectively the samples were prepared by air pluviation method dry sand were poured into the test container with constant heights and additional compaction was required to prepare for the desired relative density de aired water flowed in from the bottom slowly and vacuum was on for at least 24 h for saturation chakraborty and salgado 2010 the effective unit weight was 8 6 kn m3 for loose sand and 9 6 kn m3 for dense sand the internal friction angle was determined by direct shear test yang et al 2017 the critical friction angle was found to be 31 for both soil conditions and it was not influenced greatly by initial relative densities chakraborty and salgado 2010 peak friction angles were associated with dilation angles and they were estimated to be 32 5 for loose sand and 36 for dense sand bolton 1986 the monopile foundation and hybrid foundation were installed by pushing in under 1 g gravitational condition two friction wheel only foundations sit on the soil surface by self weights after installation the pile foundation touched container bottom with the embedment depth of 5 5 m and the connection was regarded as a roller support the monotonic lateral load was applied by an actuator at 3 m above the pile head a linear variable differential transducer lvdt was used to record the lateral displacement at the same level with the actuator the transducers are depicted in fig 5 in detail 3 centrifuge test results a series of centrifuge tests was performed to investigate the lateral behaviors of hybrid monopile friction wheel foundation for offshore wind turbines five foundation models each were tested in loose saturated sand and dense saturated sand as summarized in table 1 and fig 3 all results presented in this paper is in prototype scale the relationships between lateral loads and displacements are depicted in fig 6 the tendencies are similar for all the tests the test models show linear responses at the beginning and transit to nonlinear responses as the external lateral loads increase for the monopile foundation and the gravel wheel foundation the curves tend to reach plateau at last around which values the ultimate bearing capacities are reached for the hybrid foundations with friction wheels and the steel wheel foundation the lateral loads tend to obtain slight increase continuously without obvious plateaus the steel wheel and the hybrid foundations bring additional rotational resistances at the mudline which leads to improvements of lateral bearing capacities of the foundations meanwhile the lateral displacements corresponding to the ultimate lateral loads are around 0 3 m for monopile and gravel wheel as shown in fig 6 which are about 2 times larger than the other foundations therefore larger lateral loads are required to reach similar lateral displacements for the hybrid foundations which concludes that the additions of friction wheels are meaningful in improving the lateral bearing capacities besides the advantages in enhancing the ultimate lateral capacities the hybrid foundations also show good abilities in increasing the lateral stiffness the relationships between lateral stiffness and lateral displacement are presented in fig 7 the lateral stiffness are higher for the hybrid foundations the final stiffness of the monopile gravel wheel foundation weaker friction wheel is about 2 times of the gravel wheel only foundation and 5 times of the original monopile foundation by further comparing the two types of hybrid foundations their initial stiffnesses are similar and the monopile steel wheel foundation demonstrates a larger stiffness finally which is 2 times of the monopile gravel wheel foundation moreover when considering the behaviors of the steel wheel only foundation and the hybrid monopile foundation with gravel wheel the initial stiffness of this hybrid foundation is obviously larger although its final bearing capacity is smaller consequently the addition of friction wheel considerably increase the overall lateral stiffness of the foundation systems no matter the type of friction wheel added several methods were put forward to determine the ultimate bearing capacity of the foundation as shown in fig 6 yields are gradual process that start from small elastic deformation to large plastic deformation finally the ultimate bearing capacity can be determined as the maximum curvature on the load displacement curve mcdowell 2002 or it can be determined as the intersection of the two lines fitted from the beginning and end of the load displacement curve graham et al 1982 moreover the ultimate bearing capacity can be easily determined by the significant changing point of the load displacement curve byrne et al 2003 and this method is used here to extract the bearing capacity by plotting the displacement rate lateral load curve the displacement rate is defined as the increment of lateral displacement to the corresponding lateral load and it is plotted against lateral load as shown in fig 8 the data can be fitted with linear curves with interactions to describe the tendency and the interactions at the beginning of the sudden increase can be regarded as the ultimate bearing capacity wang et al 2017c the results are marked on the curves below and summarized in table 2 finally the ultimate bearing capacity can be extracted from the final loading stage or the maximum lateral load sustained in the tests villalobos jara 2006 which are also summarized in table 2 to show the advantages of the hybrid friction wheel foundation more clearly the recorded lateral loads of each foundation are normalized against the ultimate bearing capacity of the monopile foundation and are plotted in fig 9 the scale factors between of the hybrid foundations which are defined as the bearing capacities of the hybrid foundations divided by the other foundations are summarized in table 3 the following observations may be made 1 the capacities of the hybrid foundations increase significantly comparing to the single pile foundation as shown in column 2 especially in loose sand the friction wheels provide additional moment resistances at the ground level and the soil densification is more obvious in loose sand 2 the addition of steel wheel demonstrates better effects than the gravel wheel the phenomenon can be explained in two aspects firstly the steel wheel has a larger weight secondly the steel wheel is an integrated piece so that its moment resistance is more apparent and the passive pressure acting on the embedded wheel depth cannot be neglected in practice 3 the hybrid foundations also result in larger bearing capacities than the two friction wheel only tests as shown in column 3 4 but the increase is not so significant as the monopile foundation the scale factors of two types of hybrid foundations are similar when comparing to their corresponding wheel only foundations and the wheels can be regraded as being reinforced by the same monopile in this situation 4 finally as shown in column 4 5 the capacities of hybrid foundations are smaller than sums of individual monopile and wheel foundations the reduction is more obvious for the gravel wheel 4 analysis of hybrid foundations the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundations show larger lateral bearing capacities in the tests which exceed the resistances provided by the monopile foundation as well as the friction wheel foundation separately the pile is subjected to lateral loads at 4 5 m above the soil surface and the addition of friction wheels restrain rotations of the pile at the mudline which significantly improve its lateral response for extreme conditions if the pile head is rigidly fixed the lateral deflection is expected to decrease 75 comparing to the free head pile mokwa and duncan 2003 the hybrid foundation depends less on the vertical loads therefore the original pile size may be reduced and the initial cost of construction and installation is expected to be lower meanwhile the friction wheel is subjected to moments from the pile and tends to rotate and the tension capacity of pile enable a larger effective area of the friction wheel moreover the friction between the foundation and soil is significant in resisting lateral sliding the degree of resistance depends on the type of the friction wheel the contacting area with foundation soil and the characteristics of the soil beneath the friction wheel fig 10 depicts the failure modes of two hybrid foundations after the centrifuge tests both the front view and side view are presented the models were loaded laterally which resulted deflections towards the front for steel wheel the soil in front of the wheel was heaved which demonstrates the sliding and the rotation occurred simultaneously the front part of the steel wheel embeds into soil to some depth after the tests and the rear part disengaged with soil by rotation the phenomenon illustrates that the passive pressure was generated during the tests and extra resistances were provided for gravel wheel the support frame rotates obviously however the gravels do not rotate together with the frame as an integrated piece the function of the frame is to regulate the gravels and the gravels are dispersed particles therefore the gravel may not bale to rotate together drove by the frame in time besides the moment resistances provided by the bearing stress under the gravel wheel the frictions between gravels and soil bring evident additional sliding resistances due to the larger friction coefficient between soil and gravels consequently the overturning failure for the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundations are predominant and the sliding failure should be considered in the analysis the addition of the friction wheel improves the sliding resistance and the rotation resistance of the monopile the hybrid pile friction wheel foundation is an innovative concept without thorough investigations currently therefore few open literature describe the analytical solution of the bearing capacities of this type of foundation the hybrid foundation is a combination of traditional gravity foundation and monopile the methods presented in the following sections utilize the traditional pile and gravity base analysis methodologies which have been widely applied in practical firstly the complex soil structure interactions of the hybrid foundation systems are simplified as the add on effects of individual foundation the results are calibrated by centrifuge tests based on which reduction factors are suggested the second approach idealizes the hybrid foundation as a monopile with an overturning moment applied at pile head so that the bearing capacity can be estimated using lateral pile analysis method 4 1 lateral behaviors of monopile foundation to investigate the lateral behaviors of hybrid foundation the lateral response of the original monopile foundation is necessary the p y method is used in dnv design standards to analyze the monopile foundation veritas 2004 they have been widely applied in the analysis of offshore wind monopile foundations carswell et al 2015 lau et al 2014 the method apply the winkler approach and soil structure interactions are modeled by a number of consecutive beam column elements supported by a series of non linear springs applied at each nodal points along the pile depth the relation between lateral resistances from the surrounding soil and pile deflections in sandy soil for any external loads can be obtained which can be generated as 1 p a p u tanh k x a p u y where a is the loading condition factor pu is the ultimate lateral resistance k is the initial modulus of subgrade reaction which depends on the friction angle x is the depth below mudline the lateral load displacement curves for monopile foundation developed from dnv p y method are compared with centrifuge tests result in fig 11 according to dnv standard the initial modulus of subgrade reaction k is 18 mpa m and 31 mpa m for loose sand and saturated sand respectively veritas 2004 the tendencies are similar for two methods that the curves reach plateaus after initial stiffer responses the test curves have larger initial stiffness than the dnv curves and obtained larger lateral bearing capacities finally in both loose sand 184 kn and dense sand 272 kn as listed in previous section the maximum displacements mobilized from the peak lateral loads are close the differences are mainly from the methodology of dnv curves the dnv method is derived from long flexible piles and shear forces at the pile tips may not be fully captured however in the tests the shear forces at tip toes should not be neglected and they are expected to increase with tip deflections which is also suggested by previous researches lau et al 2014 the piles are stronger by considering tip shear forces therefore the dnv method provides conservative results which is beneficial for practical designs the dnv p y method is used in the estimation of hybrid monopile friction wheel foundations 4 2 lateral behaviors of friction wheel foundations the responses of friction wheels are similar to offshore gravity foundation so that the design standard suggested by dnv for the bearing capacity of gravity base is used veritas 2004 all forces acting on the foundation as well as the forces from upper wind tower and wind head are transferred to the interface between soil and structures with resultant lateral and vertical forces the moment is represented by the eccentricities the bearing capacity is defined by hanson method and the safety factors are suggested to be 1 2 for inertial friction angle and 2 for static bearing capacity hansen 1970 the sliding resistances of the foundation should also be considered which are associate with soil characteristics and roughness coefficient for soil structure interface the interface coefficients are suggested to be 0 25 for steel sand and 0 4 for gravel sand navy 1986 uesugi and kishida 1986 the results are listed in table 4 and compared with test result the results from dnv standard are more conservative than test results which is beneficial for practical designs 4 3 lateral behaviors of hybrid foundations 4 3 1 add up method the lateral bearing capacities of the hybrid foundations are firstly estimated by the add up effect of individual foundations the results are presented in table 5 the second column describe the bearing capacities of the hybrid foundations by adding the analytical results of monopiles and friction wheels directly and the test results of the hybrid foundations are listed in column 3 for comparison furthermore reduction factors which are defined as ratios of the bearing capacities from add ups of individual foundations from analytical results and tests to the bearing capacities of the hybrid foundations obtained from the tests are listed column 3 is the scale factor from analytical results and column 4 is from test results from table 3 the reduction factors from analytical method are more conservative since the dnv design standard provides a more conservative results for each individual foundation therefore the bearing capacity of the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundation can be initially estimated by adding up the analytical results of individual foundations together and multiplying by reduction factors which are suggested to be 0 8 for hybrid monopile steel wheel foundation and 0 7 for hybrid monopile gravel wheel foundation the interactions between monopile and steel wheel are more effective with the larger reduction factor the phenomenon corresponds with the failure mechanism of the hybrid foundation that the addition of steel wheel provides a larger moment resistances and tends to bring more apparent influences to the hybrid system 4 3 2 equivalent moment method the addition of friction wheels mainly provides extra moment resistances to the original monopile foundation for the purpose of estimating the ultimate bearing capacities of the hybrid foundations the hybrid system is idealized as a resisting moment acting on the monopile which was also applied by other researcher previously arshi et al 2013 therefore the analysis of hybrid system is equivalent to the traditional pile problem and the dnv p y method described previously can be applied for the analysis the equivalent resorting moments applied at the pile head are in the opposite direction to the external loads and are estimated analytically according to the ultimate condition from the conventional bearing theory two assumptions are involved in the analysis 1 the bearing stresses are distributed uniformly under the friction wheels 2 the equivalent moment is obtained from the concentration of these bearing stresses moreover from the failure mechanism described above the rear part of the wheel tends to disengage with the soil after the tests especially for steel wheel therefore the wheel is subjected to compressive stresses for the front part and tensile stresses for the rear part however the soil cannot provide tensions so that the bearing stresses provided by rear part are zero and the restoring moments are estimated by the front half of the wheels 49 fig 12 depicts load displacement relationships of the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundations obtained from the equivalent moment method and test results the fixed head and free head situations of the monopile are plotted and the resistance moments provided by the friction wheel fall between these two boundary conditions the shape of the calculated load displacement curves are similar with the monopile foundation free head since the bearing capacities of the hybrid foundations are also calculated according to dnv p y method however the analytical method demonstrates a larger stiffness comparing to the test results initially but the stiffness decreases fast after the yielding and turns smaller finally in the tests the friction wheels provide additional restoring moment at the mudline and the lateral bearing capacities of the hybrid foundation are mainly provided by the friction wheels at the beginning as the external loads increase continuously to the degree that the restoring moment is no longer able to provide enough resistances the monopile is involved to provide additional bearing capacities this explains that the lateral stiffness of the hybrid foundation drop firstly after the critical point and increase again afterwards furthermore the analytical method results to more conservative ultimate bearing capacities comparing to test results which is benefit for design purpose the shape of load displacement curves from the equivalent moment method and the tests show some differences especially after the critical point in practical the responses of the hybrid foundations are synergistic effects of the friction wheel and the monopile the analytical method is an idealization approach by simplifying the friction wheel effects as a restoring moment and regarding the hybrid system as a pile the method provide a possible solution in estimating the lateral ultimate bearing capacities of the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundation but it cannot replicate their interaction process the analytical results overestimate the initial stiffness and reach lower bearing capacities 5 conclusions a series of centrifuge tests was performed to investigate the lateral bearing capacities of hybrid monopile friction wheel foundations for offshore wind turbines the ground soil conditions were loose saturated sand and dense saturated sand and five types of foundations were tested according to the measured behaviors lateral loads and stiffness were plotted based on which the ultimate bearing capacities were extracted the failure mechanism of the hybrid foundation was demonstrated finally two analytical methods for estimating the lateral bearing capacities were proposed and compared with the results of centrifuge tests based on the centrifuge tests and the analysis the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundations show larger lateral bearing capacities and initial stiffness comparing to monopile foundation or friction wheel only foundations the reinforcement is more effective by adding the steel wheel 2 after the centrifuge tests obvious rotations of the models can be monitored the overturning failure is predominant for the hybrid foundations and the sliding failure also should also be considered 3 the hybrid foundation system is a combination of monopile and gravity base its bearing capacity is smaller than the sum of individual monopile and friction wheel foundation the ultimate bearing capacities of the hybrid foundations can be estimated by add on effects of each foundation and multiplying by a reduction factor which is suggested to be 0 8 for steel friction wheel and 0 7 for gravel friction wheel 4 the addition of friction wheel foundation provide extra resisting moment to the monopile the effect of the friction wheels is idealized as an equivalent restoring moment acting at the pile head and the hybrid foundation system can be simplified as a monopile problem the method provide a possible solution to predict the bearing capacities but the interactions between pile and wheel cannot be ignored acknowledgments the information data or work presented herein was funded in part by the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy

23688,the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundation is an innovative alternative for offshore wind turbines the concept has wider adaptability and can be used as reinforcement method for existing

increasing new installed wind capacity the offshore wind farm tend to build in further and deeper sea which aims to harvesting better wind resources there are several types of substructures for offshore wind turbines and they are selected according to water depths geotechnical conditions and wind turbine capacity arany et al 2017 sun et al 2012 the technique for offshore wind foundation experiences rapid developments besides the fixed foundation types the floating foundation for offshore wind turbines has been proposed to adapt to more severe environmental or seabed conditions castro santos and diaz casas 2015 li et al 2014 the most widely applied foundation concept for offshore wind industry is the monopile foundation there are 2301 monopile supported offshore wind turbines in europe by the end of 2014 which consumed 79 of all installed offshore wind turbines brown et al 2015 ho et al 2015 the foundations are steel piles with large diameters total lengths of 20 m 50 m and

stiff design is the most commonly used method in the offshore wind industry arany et al 2015a the natural frequency of the offshore wind turbine may change with the dynamic loadings which will enhance the dynamic amplification and increase the fatigue damage on the structure by moving the offshore wind farm into deeper seas environmental conditions are more severe and the capacities of wind turbines are higher which results in more challenges for geotechnical design of the foundations the original monopile foundation is likely to be not sufficient to support the new generation of offshore wind structures and therefore improved foundation concepts are necessary the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundation is proposed to enhance the lateral bearing capacity of the original offshore monopile the improved design is a combination of monopile foundation and gravity foundation as shown schematically in fig 2 a circular friction wheel is added at the mudline to stiffen the pile responses laterally the circular friction wheel can be a solid circular footing or a circular frame filled with gravels the introduction of the friction wheel can provide additional shear stress to resist the lateral load and impart larger restoring moment to lower pile rotations clough and duncan 1973 mokwa and duncan 2003 moreover the friction wheel brings larger vertical stresses to the foundation soil and therefore increase the lateral resistance in front of the pile additionally if the friction wheel embeds into the foundation soil to some depth during the operation the passive pressure in front of the wheel can further reduce its lateral deflections mokwa and duncan 2003 the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundation can be an innovative alternative for offshore wind turbines located at areas with requirements of stronger substructures this concept can also be a reinforcement method for existing monopile foundations the fatigue of materials as well as the changing of seabed soil conditions may influence behaviors of the pile foundation in service but it is unrealistic to rebuild the foundation especially at offshore areas therefore a friction wheel can be applied to provide additional bearing capacities as an effective modification to investigate the lateral bearing behaviors of the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundation system both the response of a laterally loaded single pile and the bearing capacity of the friction wheel should be analyzed as a single unit several researcher have proposed different methods to investigate the lateral response

mokwa and duncan 2001 conducted a series of full scale lateral load tests on single pile or group pile with pile caps and it was demonstrated that the pile cap contributed significant amounts of lateral resistances mokwa and duncan 2001 meanwhile the lateral responses of offshore gravity foundation were investigated by large scale tests and theoretical analysis andersen et al 1989 dyvik et al 1989 and the design codes for gravity foundation for offshore wind turbines were recommended by dnv veritas 2004 the base friction at the mudline is mainly depend on the vertical loads friction coefficient of the connecting surface contacting areas and properties of surrounding soil for the purpose of withstanding severe loading conditions the monopile is strengthened by a friction wheel at the mudline to create an innovative hybrid foundation system some similar concepts have been studied previously stone and arshi arshi and stone 2011 arshi et al 2013 stone et al 2007 conducted a series of 1 g tests of monopiled circular footing it was demonstrated the hybrid footing foundation did show advantages in lateral and vertical bearing behaviors the soil in front of the footing was found to be displaced and provided some passive earth pressure during the tests moreover it was suggested if the vertical movements were allowed between the footing and the pile the hybrid footing foundation was more effective since the two parts were acting independently moreover a series of centrifuge tests were performed to investigate this topic more specifically and the 3d finite element model fem was created to compare with the test results arshi et al 2013 lu et al 2017 the hybrid foundation presented a lateral bearing capacity of three times comparing to the original monopile foundation afterwards several centrifuge tests were conducted on monopile footing foundation with more typical dimensions and loading conditions for offshore wind turbines in both clay and sandy soil the fem models were constructed to reinforce the test results simultaneously lehane et al 2010 2014 the addition of footing reduced the moment being transferred to the pile and larger lateral bearing capacities were obtained the numerical investigation and centrifuge modelling of hybrid monopile footing foundation under combined loadings were summarized thoroughly el marassi 2011 the failure envelop for drained and undrained loadings were depicted and it was found the bearing capacities depended on the geometry of the hybrid system especially the ratio of pile length to the footing diameter moreover responses of the hybrid monopile foundation under cyclic loadings were investigated in our laboratory and a analytical method was proposed to estimate the accumulative lateral displacement in service conditions wang et al 2018 in summary of the previous researches the concept of hybrid monopile footing foundation was examined and some recommendations were put forward however just a few open literature are available currently meanwhile the shapes and materials of footings described previously are limited the study of this hybrid foundation system is far from comprehensive in the present study besides the solid friction wheel a gravel wheel is proposed and demonstrated fig 4 this design has great potential of efficiency and economy by making full use of boulders at offshore area and the installation is accelerated in this paper a series of centrifuge tests were performed to investigate lateral behaviors of the innovative hybrid monopile friction wheel foundations under monotonic lateral loads in sandy soil analytical methods to predict the bearing capacities are proposed and compared with the test results the mechanism of the hybrid foundation are summarized 2 centrifuge tests centrifuge modelling is an effective method in geotechnical investigations it provides reliable experimental results for concept proofs the behavior of soil is stress dependent thereby the 1 g laboratory tests may not able to replicate the geotechnical phenomenon well moreover the availability of field tests are limited especially for offshore wind turbines however the numerical and theoretical analysis are hard to reach solid conclusions without calibrations with reliable physical tests therefore the centrifuge modelling was used in research the technique help realize test small scale models under high gravitational levels and therefore tests can be conducted under satisfactory stress states chakraborty and salgado 2010 chandrasekaran 2003 the results are interpreted by the centrifuge scaling law wang et al 2015 this method was used in the investigations of the behaviors of offshore wind turbine previously lehane et al 2010 2014 the centrifuge tests described in this paper were performed at case western reserve university cwru figueroa et al 1998 the test package is presented in fig 3 and details of tests are listed in table 1 ten centrifuge tests were conducted to investigate the lateral behaviors of the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundation under monotonic lateral load the maximum operational acceleration for the centrifuge was 50 g for all tests and data described here are all in prototype scale the wind turbine model was consist of three parts the tower head wind tower and foundation the tower head was simplified by a lumped mass with a dimension of 1 75 1 75 1 25 m length width height the wind tower was constructed by a steel rod with a diameter of 0 5 m and a length of 13 m the total weight of these two upper structures was 38 25ton the purpose of the upper structure was to apply vertical loads to the foundation as well as provide loading point for applying lateral loads the existing of the upper structure did not bring large influences to the results since the tests conducted are static five types of foundations were tested which included monopile monopile with steel wheel monopile with gravel wheel steel wheel only and gravel wheel only fig 3 the model pile was 7 m long 1 1 m diameter solid steel rod and 8ton weight the steel friction wheel was 7 m diameter 1 5 m thickness disc and the weight was 260ton the gravel wheel was made of a frame with a diameter of 7 m and a thickness of 1 5 m the frame was divided into 7 parts and filled with gravels whose total weight was 87 5ton the hybrid foundations were combinations of pile and friction wheels the pile was push fitted into the center hole of the steel wheel with secured connection and the steel wheel was fully contact with the soil surface after the installation for the gravel wheel the pile and frame were installed firstly after which the gravel was filled the sand used was standard toyoura sand with a mean particle size of 0 17 mm specific gravity of 2 65 and void ratio ranges of 0 6 and 0 98 wang et al 2017a two soil conditions were prepared as loose saturated sand and dense saturated sand with relative densities of 30 and 70 respectively the samples were prepared by air pluviation method dry sand were poured into the test container with constant heights and additional compaction was required to prepare for the desired relative density de aired water flowed in from the bottom slowly and vacuum was on for at least 24 h for saturation chakraborty and salgado 2010 the effective unit weight was 8 6 kn m3 for loose sand and 9 6 kn m3 for dense sand the internal friction angle was determined by direct shear test yang et al 2017 the critical friction angle was found to be 31 for both soil conditions and it was not influenced greatly by initial relative densities chakraborty and salgado 2010 peak friction angles were associated with dilation angles and they were estimated to be 32 5 for loose sand and 36 for dense sand bolton 1986 the monopile foundation and hybrid foundation were installed by pushing in under 1 g gravitational condition two friction wheel only foundations sit on the soil surface by self weights after installation the pile foundation touched container bottom with the embedment depth of 5 5 m and the connection was regarded as a roller support the monotonic lateral load was applied by an actuator at 3 m above the pile head a linear variable differential transducer lvdt was used to record the lateral displacement at the same level with the actuator the transducers are depicted in fig 5 in detail 3 centrifuge test results a series of centrifuge tests was performed to investigate the lateral behaviors of hybrid monopile friction wheel foundation for offshore wind turbines five foundation models each were tested in loose saturated sand and dense saturated sand as summarized in table 1 and fig 3 all results presented in this paper is in prototype scale the relationships between lateral loads and displacements are depicted in fig 6 the tendencies are similar for all the tests the test models show linear responses at the beginning and transit to nonlinear responses as the external lateral loads increase for the monopile foundation and the gravel wheel foundation the curves tend to reach plateau at last around which values the ultimate bearing capacities are reached for the hybrid foundations with friction wheels and the steel wheel foundation the lateral loads tend to obtain slight increase continuously without obvious plateaus the steel wheel and the hybrid foundations bring additional rotational resistances at the mudline which leads to improvements of lateral bearing capacities of the foundations meanwhile the lateral displacements corresponding to the ultimate lateral loads are around 0 3 m for monopile and gravel wheel as shown in fig 6 which are about 2 times larger than the other foundations therefore larger lateral loads are required to reach similar lateral displacements for the hybrid foundations which concludes that the additions of friction wheels are meaningful in improving the lateral bearing capacities besides the advantages in enhancing the ultimate lateral capacities the hybrid foundations also show good abilities in increasing the lateral stiffness the relationships between lateral stiffness and lateral displacement are presented in fig 7 the lateral stiffness are higher for the hybrid foundations the final stiffness of the monopile gravel wheel foundation weaker friction wheel is about 2 times of the gravel wheel only foundation and 5 times of the original monopile foundation by further comparing the two types of hybrid foundations their initial stiffnesses are similar and the monopile steel wheel foundation demonstrates a larger stiffness finally which is 2 times of the monopile gravel wheel foundation moreover when considering the behaviors of the steel wheel only foundation and the hybrid monopile foundation with gravel wheel the initial stiffness of this hybrid foundation is obviously larger although its final bearing capacity is smaller consequently the addition of friction wheel considerably increase the overall lateral stiffness of the foundation systems no matter the type of friction wheel added several methods were put forward to determine the ultimate bearing capacity of the foundation as shown in fig 6 yields are gradual process that start from small elastic deformation to large plastic deformation finally the ultimate bearing capacity can be determined as the maximum curvature on the load displacement curve mcdowell 2002 or it can be determined as the intersection of the two lines fitted from the beginning and end of the load displacement curve graham et al 1982 moreover the ultimate bearing capacity can be easily determined by the significant changing point of the load displacement curve byrne et al 2003 and this method is used here to extract the bearing capacity by plotting the displacement rate lateral load curve the displacement rate is defined as the increment of lateral displacement to the corresponding lateral load and it is plotted against lateral load as shown in fig 8 the data can be fitted with linear curves with interactions to describe the tendency and the interactions at the beginning of the sudden increase can be regarded as the ultimate bearing capacity wang et al 2017c the results are marked on the curves below and summarized in table 2 finally the ultimate bearing capacity can be extracted from the final loading stage or the maximum lateral load sustained in the tests villalobos jara 2006 which are also summarized in table 2 to show the advantages of the hybrid friction wheel foundation more clearly the recorded lateral loads of each foundation are normalized against the ultimate bearing capacity of the monopile foundation and are plotted in fig 9 the scale factors between of the hybrid foundations which are defined as the bearing capacities of the hybrid foundations divided by the other foundations are summarized in table 3 the following observations may be made 1 the capacities of the hybrid foundations increase significantly comparing to the single pile foundation as shown in column 2 especially in loose sand the friction wheels provide additional moment resistances at the ground level and the soil densification is more obvious in loose sand 2 the addition of steel wheel demonstrates better effects than the gravel wheel the phenomenon can be explained in two aspects firstly the steel wheel has a larger weight secondly the steel wheel is an integrated piece so that its moment resistance is more apparent and the passive pressure acting on the embedded wheel depth cannot be neglected in practice 3 the hybrid foundations also result in larger bearing capacities than the two friction wheel only tests as shown in column 3 4 but the increase is not so significant as the monopile foundation the scale factors of two types of hybrid foundations are similar when comparing to their corresponding wheel only foundations and the wheels can be regraded as being reinforced by the same monopile in this situation 4 finally as shown in column 4 5 the capacities of hybrid foundations are smaller than sums of individual monopile and wheel foundations the reduction is more obvious for the gravel wheel 4 analysis of hybrid foundations the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundations show larger lateral bearing capacities in the tests which exceed the resistances provided by the monopile foundation as well as the friction wheel foundation separately the pile is subjected to lateral loads at 4 5 m above the soil surface and the addition of friction wheels restrain rotations of the pile at the mudline which significantly improve its lateral response for extreme conditions if the pile head is rigidly fixed the lateral deflection is expected to decrease 75 comparing to the free head pile mokwa and duncan 2003 the hybrid foundation depends less on the vertical loads therefore the original pile size may be reduced and the initial cost of construction and installation is expected to be lower meanwhile the friction wheel is subjected to moments from the pile and tends to rotate and the tension capacity of pile enable a larger effective area of the friction wheel moreover the friction between the foundation and soil is significant in resisting lateral sliding the degree of resistance depends on the type of the friction wheel the contacting area with foundation soil and the characteristics of the soil beneath the friction wheel fig 10 depicts the failure modes of two hybrid foundations after the centrifuge tests both the front view and side view are presented the models were loaded laterally which resulted deflections towards the front for steel wheel the soil in front of the wheel was heaved which demonstrates the sliding and the rotation occurred simultaneously the front part of the steel wheel embeds into soil to some depth after the tests and the rear part disengaged with soil by rotation the phenomenon illustrates that the passive pressure was generated during the tests and extra resistances were provided for gravel wheel the support frame rotates obviously however the gravels do not rotate together with the frame as an integrated piece the function of the frame is to regulate the gravels and the gravels are dispersed particles therefore the gravel may not bale to rotate together drove by the frame in time besides the moment resistances provided by the bearing stress under the gravel wheel the frictions between gravels and soil bring evident additional sliding resistances due to the larger friction coefficient between soil and gravels consequently the overturning failure for the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundations are predominant and the sliding failure should be considered in the analysis the addition of the friction wheel improves the sliding resistance and the rotation resistance of the monopile the hybrid pile friction wheel foundation is an innovative concept without thorough investigations currently therefore few open literature describe the analytical solution of the bearing capacities of this type of foundation the hybrid foundation is a combination of traditional gravity foundation and monopile the methods presented in the following sections utilize the traditional pile and gravity base analysis methodologies which have been widely applied in practical firstly the complex soil structure interactions of the hybrid foundation systems are simplified as the add on effects of individual foundation the results are calibrated by centrifuge tests based on which reduction factors are suggested the second approach idealizes the hybrid foundation as a monopile with an overturning moment applied at pile head so that the bearing capacity can be estimated using lateral pile analysis method 4 1 lateral behaviors of monopile foundation to investigate the lateral behaviors of hybrid foundation the lateral response of the original monopile foundation is necessary the p y method is used in dnv design standards to analyze the monopile foundation veritas 2004 they have been widely applied in the analysis of offshore wind monopile foundations carswell et al 2015 lau et al 2014 the method apply the winkler approach and soil structure interactions are modeled by a number of consecutive beam column elements supported by a series of non linear springs applied at each nodal points along the pile depth the relation between lateral resistances from the surrounding soil and pile deflections in sandy soil for any external loads can be obtained which can be generated as 1 p a p u tanh k x a p u y where a is the loading condition factor pu is the ultimate lateral resistance k is the initial modulus of subgrade reaction which depends on the friction angle x is the depth below mudline the lateral load displacement curves for monopile foundation developed from dnv p y method are compared with centrifuge tests result in fig 11 according to dnv standard the initial modulus of subgrade reaction k is 18 mpa m and 31 mpa m for loose sand and saturated sand respectively veritas 2004 the tendencies are similar for two methods that the curves reach plateaus after initial stiffer responses the test curves have larger initial stiffness than the dnv curves and obtained larger lateral bearing capacities finally in both loose sand 184 kn and dense sand 272 kn as listed in previous section the maximum displacements mobilized from the peak lateral loads are close the differences are mainly from the methodology of dnv curves the dnv method is derived from long flexible piles and shear forces at the pile tips may not be fully captured however in the tests the shear forces at tip toes should not be neglected and they are expected to increase with tip deflections which is also suggested by previous researches lau et al 2014 the piles are stronger by considering tip shear forces therefore the dnv method provides conservative results which is beneficial for practical designs the dnv p y method is used in the estimation of hybrid monopile friction wheel foundations 4 2 lateral behaviors of friction wheel foundations the responses of friction wheels are similar to offshore gravity foundation so that the design standard suggested by dnv for the bearing capacity of gravity base is used veritas 2004 all forces acting on the foundation as well as the forces from upper wind tower and wind head are transferred to the interface between soil and structures with resultant lateral and vertical forces the moment is represented by the eccentricities the bearing capacity is defined by hanson method and the safety factors are suggested to be 1 2 for inertial friction angle and 2 for static bearing capacity hansen 1970 the sliding resistances of the foundation should also be considered which are associate with soil characteristics and roughness coefficient for soil structure interface the interface coefficients are suggested to be 0 25 for steel sand and 0 4 for gravel sand navy 1986 uesugi and kishida 1986 the results are listed in table 4 and compared with test result the results from dnv standard are more conservative than test results which is beneficial for practical designs 4 3 lateral behaviors of hybrid foundations 4 3 1 add up method the lateral bearing capacities of the hybrid foundations are firstly estimated by the add up effect of individual foundations the results are presented in table 5 the second column describe the bearing capacities of the hybrid foundations by adding the analytical results of monopiles and friction wheels directly and the test results of the hybrid foundations are listed in column 3 for comparison furthermore reduction factors which are defined as ratios of the bearing capacities from add ups of individual foundations from analytical results and tests to the bearing capacities of the hybrid foundations obtained from the tests are listed column 3 is the scale factor from analytical results and column 4 is from test results from table 3 the reduction factors from analytical method are more conservative since the dnv design standard provides a more conservative results for each individual foundation therefore the bearing capacity of the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundation can be initially estimated by adding up the analytical results of individual foundations together and multiplying by reduction factors which are suggested to be 0 8 for hybrid monopile steel wheel foundation and 0 7 for hybrid monopile gravel wheel foundation the interactions between monopile and steel wheel are more effective with the larger reduction factor the phenomenon corresponds with the failure mechanism of the hybrid foundation that the addition of steel wheel provides a larger moment resistances and tends to bring more apparent influences to the hybrid system 4 3 2 equivalent moment method the addition of friction wheels mainly provides extra moment resistances to the original monopile foundation for the purpose of estimating the ultimate bearing capacities of the hybrid foundations the hybrid system is idealized as a resisting moment acting on the monopile which was also applied by other researcher previously arshi et al 2013 therefore the analysis of hybrid system is equivalent to the traditional pile problem and the dnv p y method described previously can be applied for the analysis the equivalent resorting moments applied at the pile head are in the opposite direction to the external loads and are estimated analytically according to the ultimate condition from the conventional bearing theory two assumptions are involved in the analysis 1 the bearing stresses are distributed uniformly under the friction wheels 2 the equivalent moment is obtained from the concentration of these bearing stresses moreover from the failure mechanism described above the rear part of the wheel tends to disengage with the soil after the tests especially for steel wheel therefore the wheel is subjected to compressive stresses for the front part and tensile stresses for the rear part however the soil cannot provide tensions so that the bearing stresses provided by rear part are zero and the restoring moments are estimated by the front half of the wheels 49 fig 12 depicts load displacement relationships of the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundations obtained from the equivalent moment method and test results the fixed head and free head situations of the monopile are plotted and the resistance moments provided by the friction wheel fall between these two boundary conditions the shape of the calculated load displacement curves are similar with the monopile foundation free head since the bearing capacities of the hybrid foundations are also calculated according to dnv p y method however the analytical method demonstrates a larger stiffness comparing to the test results initially but the stiffness decreases fast after the yielding and turns smaller finally in the tests the friction wheels provide additional restoring moment at the mudline and the lateral bearing capacities of the hybrid foundation are mainly provided by the friction wheels at the beginning as the external loads increase continuously to the degree that the restoring moment is no longer able to provide enough resistances the monopile is involved to provide additional bearing capacities this explains that the lateral stiffness of the hybrid foundation drop firstly after the critical point and increase again afterwards furthermore the analytical method results to more conservative ultimate bearing capacities comparing to test results which is benefit for design purpose the shape of load displacement curves from the equivalent moment method and the tests show some differences especially after the critical point in practical the responses of the hybrid foundations are synergistic effects of the friction wheel and the monopile the analytical method is an idealization approach by simplifying the friction wheel effects as a restoring moment and regarding the hybrid system as a pile the method provide a possible solution in estimating the lateral ultimate bearing capacities of the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundation but it cannot replicate their interaction process the analytical results overestimate the initial stiffness and reach lower bearing capacities 5 conclusions a series of centrifuge tests was performed to investigate the lateral bearing capacities of hybrid monopile friction wheel foundations for offshore wind turbines the ground soil conditions were loose saturated sand and dense saturated sand and five types of foundations were tested according to the measured behaviors lateral loads and stiffness were plotted based on which the ultimate bearing capacities were extracted the failure mechanism of the hybrid foundation was demonstrated finally two analytical methods for estimating the lateral bearing capacities were proposed and compared with the results of centrifuge tests based on the centrifuge tests and the analysis the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundations show larger lateral bearing capacities and initial stiffness comparing to monopile foundation or friction wheel only foundations the reinforcement is more effective by adding the steel wheel 2 after the centrifuge tests obvious rotations of the models can be monitored the overturning failure is predominant for the hybrid foundations and the sliding failure also should also be considered 3 the hybrid foundation system is a combination of monopile and gravity base its bearing capacity is smaller than the sum of individual monopile and friction wheel foundation the ultimate bearing capacities of the hybrid foundations can be estimated by add on effects of each foundation and multiplying by a reduction factor which is suggested to be 0 8 for steel friction wheel and 0 7 for gravel friction wheel 4 the addition of friction wheel foundation provide extra resisting moment to the monopile the effect of the friction wheels is idealized as an equivalent restoring moment acting at the pile head and the hybrid foundation system can be simplified as a monopile problem the method provide a possible solution to predict the bearing capacities but the interactions between pile and wheel cannot be ignored acknowledgments the information data or work presented herein was funded in part by the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy

device 1 introduction as a renewable green energy resource wave energy is inexhaustible and has a high density in view of the importance of wave energy development and utilization wave energy is bound to be an important part of the future energy supply you et al 2003 clement et al 2002 in order to realize the use of wave energy scholars have done a great deal of work on the hydrodynamic research for devices with simple geometry analytic solutions have been developed matsui et al 1991 and emmerhoff and sclavounos 2006 derived analytic solutions for uniform cylinders in finite and infinite water depth bao and kinoshita 1993 expended the theory to truncated cylinders zheng et al 2005 researched the interaction of a submerged rectangular buoy with incident linear waves in a finite water depth however in engineering practice the shape of the device is complex and numerical methods have to be applied the numerical method has been developed by newman 1992 and brebbia 1978 and nossen et al 2006 among others boundary element method is more effective than other methods such as finite element method and finite difference method when the fluid domain is infinite the hydrodynamic calculation in this paper was carried out by using the boundary element method based on the simple green s function to fit the complex shape of the device using 1 r as the simple green function a large part of the calculation of the integral equation coefficients is independent of frequency which improves the computational efficiency especially in the case that many frequencies need to be calculated the difficulties of hydrodynamic research of the articulated wave energy device are that under the action of waves two hinged floating bodies interact with each other the hinged constraint cannot be destroyed in the process of calculation and movement should meet the constraint conditions at any time for solving such problems in the device s surface condition the device movement and the radiation velocity potential are decomposed according to the constraint condition in the meantime in order to make the computing domain become limited and reduce the amount of calculation the infinity surface boundary is replaced by the characteristic function expansion of the velocity potential as radiating surface condition this calculation method has the characteristics of a small computation and wide application range and it can be applied to many articulated wave energy devices such as the pelamis wave device henderson 2006 oyster wave device whittaker et al 2007 duck wave device salter 1974 and eagle wave device sheng and zhang 2015 the hydrodynamic performance of the eagle wave energy device as an example was studied in this paper the eagle device is a type of two body articulated

device in a wave period can be described as follows the device floats in the sea at the quiescent state when the waves change from troughs to crests the waves drive the eagle beak to rotate upwards and the hydraulic cylinder synchronously moves upward then the hydraulic fluid of the hydraulic cylinder is squeezed into the accumulator to generate electricity or do other forms of work when the waves change from crests to troughs the eagle beak rotates down under gravity the piston rod of the hydraulic cylinder is reset and hydraulic oil is added to the rod cavity to prepare for the next

26 η p w p 0 b 100 here b is the width of the eagle beak 3 calculated results and experiment verification 3 1 calculated results in conditions of linear incident waves the hydrodynamic calculation was carried out by selecting a water depth of 10 m and wave height of 0 4 m and an incident wave angular frequency of 0 2 2 4 rad s the distance from the coordinate centre to radiation surface sl is taken as 30 m in equations 13 and 14 the coefficient m takes 20 and the coefficient n takes 15 the amplitude and phase of the dimensionless wave excitation force is shown in fig 2 the amplitudes of the wave excitation force at different angular frequencies are shown in fig 2a with the increase of the angular frequency the surge wave excitation force f 01 of the device and the pitching excitation force f 04 of the underwater base show a trend that first rises and then decreasingly oscillates the heave wave excitation force f 02 of the device and the pitching excitation force f 03 of the eagle beak are always decreasing as the frequency increases and the incident energy decreases the four kinds of wave excitation force tend to finally zero the phases of the wave excitation force under different angular frequencies are shown in fig 2b the device relies on the rotational movement of the eagle beak and the underwater base to absorb energy for this reason we pay more attention to the third and fourth motion modes fig 2b shows that the phase of the wave excitation force between the eagle beak and underwater base is only slightly different in the low frequency domain there are mutual influences between different motion modes and these influences are reflected in two aspects the additional mass and radiation damping the mutual effect of the four motion modes on the additional mass is shown in fig 3 in fig 3a curve a 11 represents the effect of the surge motion on its own additional mass while curve a 12 curve a 13 and curve a 14 respectively represent the effect of heave motion the pitching motion of the eagle beak and the pitching motion of the underwater base on the additional mass of the surge motion with an increase in angular frequency the curves of a 11 a 12 and a 13 decreasingly oscillate and curve a 14 has a slight fluctuation as shown in fig 3a fig 3a also illustrates that the greatest effect on the surge motion mode of the device is its own surge motion it is noteworthy that a 14 has a negative value at some frequencies indicating that the pitching motion of the underwater base has the effect of reducing the additional mass on the surge motion of the device at these frequencies it is concluded that the surge motion has a greater influence on itself than the other three motions furthermore the same conclusion can be obtained from the heave motion and the pitching motion of the eagle beak as shown in fig 3b and c however the opposite conclusion is obtained from fig 3d that is for the pitching motion of the underwater base the heave motion has a greater impact than its own pitching motion fig 4 shows the radiation damping variation of each motion mode at different angular frequencies which are affected by every other motion mode the influence of the four motion modes on the radiation damping of the surge motion is shown in fig 4a curve b 11 is the effect of the surge motion on the radiation damping of its own motion and curves b 12 b 13 and b 14 are respectively the effect of the heave motion the pitching motion of the eagle beak and the pitching motion of the underwater base on the radiation damping of the surge motion as seen from fig 4a with the increase of angular frequency curve b 11 first rises and then oscillates down with multiple extremes due to the coupled motion of the two bodies in addition b 11 has larger values than do the other coefficients which indicates that the surge motion has a greater influence than other motion modes on its own motion fig 4b illustrates the radiation damping variation of the heave motion mode affected by four motion modes at different angular frequencies the four curves are the effects of surge motion heave motion the pitching motion of the eagle beak and the pitching motion of the underwater base on the radiation damping of the heave motion at lower frequencies the greatest impact on heave motion is its own motion mode however with the increase of frequency the influence of the surge motion and the pitching motion of the eagle beak on heave motion gradually increases the coefficient b 24 is negative indicating that the pitching motion of the underwater base movement has the effect of reducing damping and promoting the heave movement fig 4c and d respectively show that the radiation damping variation of the pitching motion of the eagle beak and the pitching motion of the underwater base were affected by four motion modes the no load movement of the device is the hydrodynamic response of the device without an external damping force the external damping force comes from the hydraulic system once the hydraulic system is closed in some cases the device loses this external damping force the no load movement has important impacts on the safety of the device fig 5 illustrates the amplitude and phase of the displacement of the device under no load movement it can be seen in fig 5a that the surge displacement amplitude x 1 gradually decreases with the increase of the angular frequency indicating that the larger the wave period is the greater the surge displacement of the device is additionally anchor force is needed to limit the horizontal displacement of the device while the heave displacement amplitude x 2 is small and changes little with the increase of the angular frequency the vertical movement of the device is steady and stable the pitching displacement amplitude x 3 of the eagle beak has a maximum value at 1 7 rad s and varies greatly which means that the eagle beak can be used as the capture part of the device to absorb the wave energy in addition the pitching displacement amplitude x 4 of the underwater base is relatively small and remains unchanged as the incident wave frequency changes that is the underwater base can be used as the base of the device to ensure the stability of the entire device fig 5b shows the phase variation of the displacement with the angular frequency if the amplitude ratio and phase difference between the bodies of the device are too large the parts of the device will collide with each other which may cause damage to the device chen et al 2016 as seen in fig 5b the phases between the surge displacement x 1 and the other three displacements have greater differences in the low frequency range than in the high frequency range the same for the amplitude shown in fig 5a therefore under a long wave period a device without an external damping force should be cautiously operated to avoid damage additionally the wave angular frequency of 1 7 rad s should be considered because although the phase of all motion is almost the same there is a large amplitude difference equation 24 shows that the absorbed wave energy by the device depends primarily on the relative rotation displacement amplitude and external damping it can be seen from fig 6 that the external damping coefficient and the relative displacement amplitude between the eagle beak and underwater base are inversely related that is the larger the external damping coefficient c f is the smaller the relative rotation displacement amplitude is additionally the amplitude of the relative rotation displacement has a maximum value at 0 7 0 8 rad s under different external damping coefficients as shown in fig 6 it is evident from fig 7 that the greater the external damping coefficient c f in the low frequency range is the larger the capture width ratio is in contrast in the high frequency range the smaller the external damping c f is the larger the capture width ratio η is the reason is that in low frequency range the eagle beak is subjected to a greater wave excitation force and it can overcome the larger external damping force to work so the greater the external damping is the larger the capture width ratio is in the high frequency range the wave excitation force of the eagle beak weakens in addition the relative displacement between bodies decreases along with the increase of the external damping resulting in the capture capacity of the device being reduced fig 7 also shows that there is an optimal damping that maximizes the capture width ratio of the device at different frequencies 3 2 experiment verification to verify the accuracy of the numerical model a model experiment was carried out see fig 8 in the experiment the first hydraulic cylinder and the second hydraulic cylinder are connected by a hose and heavy blocks as loads are placed on the second hydraulic cylinder the first hydraulic cylinder converts mechanical energy into hydraulic energy and the second hydraulic cylinder converts the hydraulic energy into the gravity potential energy of the load the absorbed wave energy is converted into the gravitational potential energy of the load the capture width ratio in the experiment can be calculated as follows 27 η m g h t p 0 b 100 here m is the quality of heavy blocks that are driven by the second hydraulic cylinders in the experiment g is the acceleration of gravity h is the height of the heavy block to be lifted t is the work time of the energy testing system p 0 is the input power of the wave within the unit width and b is the width of the eagle beak the geometric proportion of the model to the device is 1 10 according to the similarity of gravity the relationships between the parameters are 28 l m l d k 1 10 29 t m t d 1 k 0 316 here k is the geometric proportion l m and t m are respectively the geometric dimensions and wave period associated with the model l d and t d are respectively the geometric dimensions and wave period associated with the device the experimental pool is 50 m long and 1 2 m wide the model s eagle beak is 0 6 m in width the wave period range of the experiment is 0 8 s 2 9 s and the corresponding wave period range of the real sea condition is 2 5 s 9 s in the calculation the water depth is 10 m and the wave height is 0 4 m in the experiment the water depth is 1 m and the wave height is 0 04 m by changing the weight of the heavy block the height of the heavy block to be lifted is measured and the maximum capture width ratio under this condition can be calculated the results of the experiment and numerical calculation are shown in fig 9 the numerical simulation results are consistent with the experimental results 4 conclusion by calculating the wave excitation force and the hydrodynamic coefficients of the articulated wave energy device the displacement and the capture width ratio of the device are obtained at different external damping coefficients and frequencies these parameters can be used for not only evaluating the hydrodynamic performance of the device but also optimizing the device some situations affecting the safety of the device are also analysed through the results from the numerical calculation method given in this paper some conclusions can be drawn 1 the calculation results show that the shape structure design of the eagle device is reasonable achieving the desired results the eagle beak can effectively capture the wave energy and the underwater base can keep the device stable 2 although the vertical wave excitation force of the device is large the vertical displacement of the device is small due to the presence of a hydrostatic restoring force so the device requires more horizontal anchor force to limit the horizontal displacement of the device compared to the vertical anchoring force this can provide a reference for the mooring design 3 when the hydraulic system is closed and the wave angular frequency is at 1 7 rad s and the 0 2 0 5 rad s range it should be cautiously operated to prevent excessive movement which may cause device damage when the hydraulic system works properly we should pay attention to 0 7 0 8 rad s because in this range the relative motion between the eagle beak and the underwater base is large 4 proper selections of the external damping coefficient of the hydraulic cylinder at different frequencies can improve the efficiency of the device to capture wave energy as a result the external damping coefficient can be used as a basis for hydraulic system design the calculation method of this paper can be applied to the wave energy device with a complex shape and multi body coupling motion which enlarges the range of the hydrodynamic calculation the calculation process gives important response parameters of the device which are the basis for design and optimization the method has the following advantages 1 using 1 r as the green function a large part of the calculation of the integral equation coefficients is independent of frequency which improves the computational efficiency especially in the case that many frequencies need to be calculated 2 the distribution of the velocity potential on all the boundaries of the inner domain is used to describe the flow field and there is no limit to the shape of the seabed boundary condition this method can be applied to the more complicated boundary conditions 3 the infinity surface boundary is replaced by the characteristic function expansion of the velocity potential as radiating surface conditions to make the computational domain become limited thus reducing the amount of calculation 4 in the device surface condition the motion is decomposed according to the constraint condition ensuring that the constraint cannot be destroyed and movement should meet the constraint conditions at any time acknowledgement the authors acknowledge the financial support from the ocean energy laboratory in the guangzhou institute of energy

to be an important part of the future energy supply you et al 2003 clement et al 2002 in order to realize the use of wave energy scholars have done a great deal of work on the hydrodynamic research for devices with simple geometry analytic solutions have been developed matsui et al 1991 and emmerhoff and sclavounos 2006 derived analytic solutions for uniform cylinders in finite and infinite water depth bao and kinoshita 1993 expended the theory to truncated cylinders zheng et al 2005 researched the interaction of a submerged rectangular buoy with incident linear waves in a finite water depth however in engineering practice the shape of the device is complex and numerical methods have to be applied the numerical method has been developed by newman 1992 and brebbia 1978 and nossen et al 2006 among others boundary element method is more effective than other methods such as finite element method and finite difference method when the fluid domain is infinite the hydrodynamic calculation in this paper was carried out by using the boundary element method based on the simple green s function to fit the complex shape of the device using 1 r as the simple green function a large part of the calculation of the integral equation coefficients is independent of frequency which improves the computational efficiency especially in the case that many frequencies need to be calculated the difficulties of hydrodynamic research of the articulated wave energy device are that under the action of waves two hinged floating bodies interact with each other the hinged constraint cannot be destroyed in the process of calculation and movement should meet the constraint conditions at any time for solving such problems in the device s surface condition the device movement and the radiation velocity potential are decomposed according to the constraint condition in the meantime in order to make the computing domain become limited and reduce the amount of calculation the infinity surface boundary is replaced by the characteristic function expansion of the velocity potential as radiating surface condition this calculation method has the characteristics of a small computation and wide application range and it can be applied to many articulated wave energy devices such as the pelamis wave device henderson 2006 oyster wave device whittaker et al 2007 duck wave device salter

carried out by selecting a water depth of 10 m and wave height of 0 4 m and an incident wave angular frequency of 0 2 2 4 rad s the distance from the coordinate centre to radiation surface sl is taken as 30 m in equations 13 and 14 the coefficient m takes 20 and the coefficient n takes 15 the amplitude and phase of the dimensionless wave excitation force is shown in fig 2 the amplitudes of the wave excitation force at different angular frequencies are shown in fig 2a with the increase of the angular frequency the surge wave excitation force f 01 of the device and the pitching excitation force f 04 of the underwater base show a trend that first rises and then decreasingly oscillates the heave wave excitation force f 02 of the device and the pitching excitation force f 03 of the eagle beak are always decreasing as the frequency increases and the incident energy decreases the four kinds of wave excitation force tend to finally zero the phases of the wave excitation force under different angular frequencies are shown in fig 2b the device relies on the rotational movement of the eagle beak and the underwater base to absorb energy for this reason we pay more attention to the third and fourth motion modes fig 2b shows that the phase of the wave excitation force between the eagle beak and underwater base is only slightly different in the low frequency domain there are mutual influences between different motion modes and these influences are reflected in two aspects the additional mass and radiation damping the mutual effect of the four motion modes on the additional mass is shown in fig 3 in fig 3a curve a 11 represents the effect of the surge motion on its own additional mass while curve a 12 curve a 13 and curve a 14 respectively represent the effect of heave motion the pitching motion of the eagle beak and the pitching motion of the underwater base on the additional mass of the surge motion with an increase in angular frequency the curves of a 11 a 12 and a 13 decreasingly oscillate and curve a 14 has a slight fluctuation as shown in fig 3a fig 3a also illustrates that the greatest effect on the surge motion mode of the device is its own surge motion it is noteworthy that a 14 has a negative value at some frequencies indicating that the pitching motion of the underwater base has the effect of reducing the additional mass on the surge motion of the device at these frequencies it is concluded that the surge motion has a greater influence on itself than the other three motions furthermore the same conclusion can be obtained from the heave motion and the pitching motion of the eagle beak as shown in fig 3b and c however the opposite conclusion is obtained from fig 3d that is for the pitching motion of the underwater base the heave motion has a greater impact than its own pitching motion fig 4 shows the radiation damping variation of each motion mode at different angular frequencies which are affected by every other motion mode the influence of the four motion modes on the radiation damping of the surge motion is shown in fig 4a curve b 11 is the effect of the surge motion on the radiation damping of its own motion and curves b 12 b 13 and b 14 are respectively the effect of the heave motion the pitching motion of the eagle beak and the pitching motion of the underwater base on the radiation damping of the surge motion as seen from fig 4a with the increase of angular frequency curve b 11 first rises and then oscillates down with multiple extremes due to the coupled motion of the two bodies in addition b 11 has larger values than do the other coefficients which indicates that the surge motion has a greater influence than other motion modes on its own motion fig 4b illustrates the radiation damping variation of the heave motion mode affected by four motion modes at different angular frequencies the four curves are the effects of surge motion heave motion the pitching motion of the eagle beak and the pitching motion of the underwater base on the radiation damping of the heave motion at lower frequencies the greatest impact on heave motion is its own motion mode however with the increase of frequency the influence of the surge motion and the pitching motion of the eagle beak on heave motion gradually increases the coefficient b 24 is negative indicating that the pitching motion of the underwater base movement has the effect of reducing damping and promoting the heave movement fig 4c and d respectively show that the radiation damping variation of the pitching motion of the eagle beak and the pitching motion of the underwater base were affected by four motion modes the no load movement of the device is the hydrodynamic response of the device without an external damping force the external damping force comes from the hydraulic system once the hydraulic system is closed in some cases the device loses this external damping force the no load movement has important impacts on the safety of the device fig 5 illustrates the amplitude and phase of the displacement of the device under no load movement it can be seen in fig 5a that the surge displacement amplitude x 1 gradually decreases with the increase of the angular frequency indicating that the larger the wave period is the greater the surge displacement of the device is additionally anchor force is needed to limit the horizontal displacement of the device while the heave displacement amplitude x 2 is small and changes little with the increase of the angular frequency the vertical movement of the device is steady and stable the pitching displacement amplitude x 3 of the eagle beak has a maximum value at 1 7 rad s and varies greatly which means that the eagle beak can be used as the capture part of the device to absorb the wave energy in addition the pitching displacement amplitude x 4 of the underwater base is relatively small and remains unchanged as the incident wave frequency changes that is the underwater base can be used as the base of the device to ensure the stability of the entire device fig 5b shows the phase variation of the displacement with the angular frequency if the amplitude ratio and phase difference between the bodies of the device are too large the parts of the device will collide with each other which may cause damage to the device chen et al 2016 as seen in fig 5b the phases between the surge displacement x 1 and the other three displacements have greater differences in the low frequency range than in the high frequency range the same for the amplitude shown in fig 5a therefore under a long wave period a device without an external damping force should be cautiously operated to avoid damage additionally the wave angular frequency of 1 7 rad s should be considered because although the phase of all motion is almost the same there is a large amplitude difference equation 24 shows that the absorbed wave energy by the device depends primarily on the relative rotation displacement amplitude and external damping it can be seen from fig 6 that the external damping coefficient and the relative displacement amplitude between the eagle beak and underwater base are inversely related that is the larger the external damping coefficient c f is the smaller the relative rotation displacement amplitude is additionally the amplitude of the relative rotation displacement has a maximum value at 0 7 0 8 rad s under different external damping coefficients as shown in fig 6 it is evident from fig 7 that the greater the external damping coefficient c f in the low frequency range is the larger the capture width ratio is in contrast in the high frequency range the smaller the external damping c f is the larger the capture width ratio η is the reason is that in low frequency range the eagle beak is subjected to a greater wave excitation force and it can overcome the larger external damping force to work so the greater the external damping is the larger the capture width ratio is in the high frequency range the wave excitation force of the eagle beak weakens in addition the relative displacement between bodies decreases along with the increase of the external damping resulting in the capture capacity of the device being reduced fig 7 also shows that there is an optimal damping that maximizes the capture width ratio of the device at different frequencies 3 2 experiment verification to verify the accuracy of the numerical model a model experiment was carried out see fig 8 in the experiment the first hydraulic cylinder and the second hydraulic cylinder are connected by a hose and heavy blocks as loads are placed on the second hydraulic cylinder the first hydraulic cylinder converts mechanical energy into hydraulic energy and the second hydraulic cylinder converts the hydraulic energy into the gravity potential energy of the load the absorbed wave energy is converted into the gravitational potential energy of the load the capture width ratio in the experiment can be calculated as follows 27 η m g h t p 0 b 100 here m is the quality of heavy blocks that are driven by the second hydraulic cylinders in the experiment g is the acceleration of gravity h is the height of the heavy block to be lifted t is the work time of the energy testing system p 0 is the input power of the wave within the unit width and b is the width of the eagle beak the geometric proportion of the model to the device is 1 10 according to the similarity of gravity the relationships between the parameters are 28 l m l d k 1 10 29 t m t d 1 k 0 316 here k is the geometric proportion l m and t m are respectively the geometric dimensions and wave period associated with the model l d and t d are respectively the geometric dimensions and wave period associated with the device the experimental pool is 50 m long and 1 2 m wide the model s eagle beak is 0 6 m in width the wave period range of the experiment is 0 8 s 2 9 s and the corresponding wave period range of the real sea condition is 2 5 s 9 s in the calculation the water depth is 10 m and the wave height is 0 4 m in the experiment the water depth is 1 m and the wave height is 0 04 m by changing the weight of the heavy block the height of the heavy block to be lifted is measured and the maximum capture width ratio under this condition can be calculated the results of the experiment and numerical calculation are shown in fig 9 the numerical simulation results are consistent with the experimental results 4 conclusion by calculating the wave excitation force and the hydrodynamic coefficients of the articulated wave energy device the displacement and the capture width ratio of the device are obtained at different external damping coefficients and frequencies these parameters can be used for not only evaluating the hydrodynamic performance of the device but also optimizing the device some situations affecting the safety of the device are also analysed through the results from the numerical calculation method given in this paper some conclusions can be drawn 1 the calculation results show that the shape structure design of the eagle device is reasonable achieving the desired results the eagle beak can effectively capture the wave energy and the underwater base can keep the device stable 2 although the vertical wave excitation force of the device is large the vertical displacement of the device is small due to the presence of a hydrostatic restoring force so the device requires more horizontal anchor force to limit the horizontal displacement of the device compared to the vertical anchoring force this can provide a reference for the mooring design 3 when the hydraulic system is closed and the wave angular frequency is at 1 7 rad s and the 0 2 0 5 rad s range it should be cautiously operated to prevent excessive movement which may cause device damage when the hydraulic system works properly we should pay attention to 0 7 0 8 rad s because in this range the relative motion between the eagle beak and the underwater base is large 4 proper selections of the external damping coefficient of the hydraulic cylinder at different frequencies can improve the efficiency of the device to capture wave energy as a result the external damping coefficient can be used as a basis for hydraulic system design the calculation method of this paper can be applied to the wave energy device with a complex shape and multi body coupling motion which enlarges the range of the hydrodynamic calculation the calculation process gives important response parameters of the device which are the basis for design and optimization the method has the following advantages 1 using 1 r as the green function a large part of the calculation of the integral equation coefficients is independent of frequency which improves the computational efficiency especially in the case that many frequencies need to be calculated 2 the distribution of the velocity potential on all the boundaries of the inner domain is used to describe the flow field and there is no limit to the shape of the seabed boundary condition this method can be applied to the more complicated boundary conditions 3 the infinity surface boundary is replaced by the characteristic function expansion of the velocity potential as radiating surface conditions to make the computational domain become limited thus reducing the amount of calculation 4 in the device surface condition the motion is decomposed according to the constraint condition ensuring that the constraint cannot be destroyed and movement should meet the constraint conditions at any time acknowledgement the authors acknowledge the financial support from the ocean energy laboratory in the guangzhou institute of energy
