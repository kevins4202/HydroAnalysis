2260,liquid splitting behavior at fracture intersections is an important process affecting unsaturated flow in fractured rocks the role of inertia in liquid splitting at a fracture intersection however remains poorly understood in this study a theoretical model considering inertia is proposed to explore the inertial effect on liquid splitting at idealized facture intersections consisting of a main fracture and a branch fracture the liquid droplet splitting behaviors predicted by the proposed model are in good agreement with the carefully controlled visualization experiments by comparing the model predictions with and without inertia and comparing with experimental data we show that neglecting the inertial effect leads to underestimation of liquid partitioning into the branch fracture with a smaller aperture than the main fracture furthermore a threshold droplet length is defined to quantify the droplet length at which the inertial effect starts to exert an impact on the splitting dynamics the influence of key parameters such as the inclination angle the fracture apertures and the dynamic contact angles on the droplet splitting behaviors is investigated through a systematic parameter sensitivity analysis we show that the inclination angle affects the threshold droplet length mainly by controlling the initial droplet velocity it is also demonstrated that the fracture apertures and the advancing and receding contact angles have significant impact on the volume percentage partitioned into the branch fracture the improved understanding in this work may provide new insights into unsaturated flow and contaminant transport behaviors in fractured networks with implications for hydrological and environmental applications keywords unsaturated flow fracture

zhou et al 2006 and laboratory experiments e g glass et al 2002a glass et al 2003 laviolette et al 2003 wood et al 2004 zhou et al 2022b have highlighted the complexity of spatiotemporal characteristics of unsaturated flow in fractured rocks which leads to a formidable challenge in accurately predicting the unsaturated flow behaviors anatoly et al 2022 viswanathan et al 2022 theoretical studies on relatively simple fracture intersections which are an important geometrical component of a fracture network provide a basis for enabling predictions of unsaturated flow e g kordilla et al 2021 noffz et al 2019 xue et al 2020 however inertial effects on fluid motion during unsaturated flow in fractured media is often neglected in previous studies therefore it is necessary to investigate the influence of inertial effects on unsaturated flow in fractured media under saturated flow conditions inertial force leads to formation and growth of eddies and recirculation zones which is responsible for the transition from darcian flow to non darcian flow e g cardenas et al 2009 lee et al 2014 qian et al 2016 xing et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 however unsaturated flow behaviors in fractures are significantly different from saturated flow and often exhibit more complex features resulting from gravity destabilization and motion of liquid air contact lines sheng et al 2019 thiéry et al 2018 influenced by surface properties and contact line velocities capillary hysteresis and dynamic contact angles occur in unsaturated flow e g hoffman 1975 lei et al 2018 li et al 2022 mumley et al 1986a b for a discrete droplet in an ideal parallel plate fracture the droplet travel velocity can be well predicted by coupling the hydrodynamic theories describing the relationship between dynamic contact angle and contact line velocity in flow models e g bico quéré 2001 dragila weisbrod 2003 or ghezzehei 2006 however when the droplet with higher velocity encounters geometric changes such as fracture intersection and rough fracture surface the inertial effect becomes non negligible and intractable luo et al 2022 ye et al 2017 fracture intersections can act as capillary barriers the strength of which hinges on the combined effect of several factors including intersection geometry fracture apertures and wetting properties ji et al 2006 therefore intersection will behave as integrators pooling infiltrated liquid for unsaturated flow e g stoner et al 2003 tartakovsky meakin 2005 wood et al 2002 based on force balance analysis theoretical equations for estimating the cumulative liquid pool height above an intersection have been proposed e g dragila weisbrod 2004 ji et al 2006 wood et al 2005 for a droplet with a certain velocity entering a stagnant pool wood et al 2005 evaluated the magnitude of the inertial effect and the relative importance of viscous capillary and inertial forces as a function of fracture aperture after the liquid pool height overcomes the capillary barrier at a fracture intersection droplets with larger volume and higher releasing velocity will result in stronger inertial effects and influence the liquid splitting behavior at the intersection although many studies in recent years have qualitatively and quantitatively improved our understanding on liquid splitting behaviors at fracture intersections e g kordilla et al 2017 yang et al 2019 xue et al 2020 it is unclear how inertia influences the liquid splitting behavior in this study we propose a theoretical model of liquid splitting considering the inertial effect and compare model prediction with results from carefully controlled visualized experiments of liquid droplet splitting at a fracture intersection we consider droplets of different initial lengths which determine their terminal velocity in a fracture and thus represent the strength of inertial effect the theoretical analysis and experimental observations are combined to reveal the influence of inertial effect on liquid splitting at fracture intersections the influence of key parameters including the inclination angle of the intersection the fracture apertures and the dynamic contact angles on droplet splitting behaviors is systematically investigated 2 methods 2 1 laboratory experiments we perform liquid splitting experiments at t shaped fracture intersections with a visualization experiment apparatus as shown in fig 1 a the t shaped fracture intersection consists of three pieces of smooth quartz glass with a thickness of 3 mm which are glued to a piece of acrylic plate through four spacers 5 mm thick with uv light curing glue fig 1b so the flow pathways are only in contact with the quartz glass but not the acrylic plate the flow cell is fixed to a support frame which can be rotated allowing the fracture intersections to alter its inclination angle α fig 1c three pieces of glass are separated with gaps forming a main fracture f1 0 78 mm wide 300 mm long and a branch or side fracture f2 0 28 mm wide 150 mm long fracture f1 and fracture f2 intersect at a point which divides fracture f1 into two parts with a length of 200 mm upper fracture and a length of 100 mm lower fracture when the length of the liquid in the fracture is greater than a certain value which depends on the aperture and surface wetting characteristic of the fracture the liquid will leave the injection port to form a droplet flow under continuous injection conditions jones et al 2018 therefore it is practically difficult to generate long droplets e g 3 cm to obtain long droplets in the upper part of the fracture shorter droplets are sequentially injected and allowed to coalesce within the fracture before arriving at the intersection we control the total injection volume by high precision micro injector to acquire droplets of various initial lengths the droplet velocities before splitting are measured the droplet lengths are accurately controlled as 1 15 1 65 2 1 2 6 3 1 3 5 4 0 cm with corresponding volumes of 27 39 50 62 74 84 96 μl of dyed water 0 075 g capsicum red per liter of pure water respectively the inclination angles α are set as 90 70 and 50 each experiment of the same initial droplet length and inclination angle α is repeated three times a high speed camera fixed in front of the fracture intersection records the liquid splitting process at a frequency of 50 frame s after each experiment the flow cell is carefully cleaned through plasma cleaning and subsequent repeated cycles of vacuum drying and ultrapure water immersion yang et al 2019 xue et al 2020 the measured static contact angle θ s of the fracture surface is 56 2 2 theory and model the movement of fluid in a fracture and through a fracture intersection is controlled by the combined action of gravitational capillary viscous and inertial forces these forces are influenced by factors including droplet length interfacial velocity and contact angles which affect liquid splitting process at a fracture intersection xue et al 2020 fig 2 a shows a liquid droplet in an idealized fracture when the droplet length is less than the threshold length for triggering droplet sliding the droplet will remain stationary under the action of gravity and capillary force difference between advancing and receding menisci in this case the balance between gravity and capillary force gives lsinα φ a φ r where l is the droplet length α is the inclination angle of the fracture relative to the horizontal plane φ a and φ r are the capillary pressures in unit of hydraulic head of the advancing and receding menisci respectively since the radius of the minor principal curvature is much larger than the aperture induced radius of curvature in our experiments the minor principal curvature can be neglected therefore one can calculate φ a and φ r according to the young laplace equation 1a φ a 2 σ cos θ a ρ g w 1b φ r 2 σ cos θ r ρ g w where σ is the interfacial tension ρ is the fluid density g is the gravity acceleration w is the fracture aperture and θ a and θ r are the advancing and receding contact angles respectively when the droplet length is greater than the threshold length for triggering droplet movement the droplet will migrate with a steady velocity v the velocity v can be obtained by the balance of capillary gravity and viscous forces e g or ghezzehei 2007 su et al 2004 xue et al 2020 2 v ρ g w 2 12 μ 2 σ cos θ r cos θ a l ρ g w sin α where μ is the dynamic viscosity the advancing and receding contact angles θ a and θ r of a moving droplet vary with the interfacial velocity which in turn depends on the droplet length l after the droplet reaches the intersection fig 2b liquid splitting ensues as shown in fig 2c the liquid length within the upper part of inflow fracture f1 is denoted by l r the length within the lower part of f1 is denoted by l a1 and the length within the side fracture is denoted by l a2 at any moment during the droplet splitting process we divide the droplet into three segments in the upper part of fracture f1 the lower part of fracture f1 and fracture f2 respectively the force equilibrium equations for the three droplet segments in a very short period of time are established as follows 3 ρ g w 1 l r sin α 1 2 σ cos θ r 12 μ l r w 1 d l r dt p w w 1 ρ w 1 l r d 2 l r d t 2 4 ρ g w 1 l a 1 sin α 1 2 σ cos θ a 1 12 μ l a 1 w 1 d l a

respectively α 1 and α 2 are the inclination angle of f1 and f2 relative to the horizontal plane respectively θ a θ a1 and θ a2 and θ r are the advancing and receding contact angles respectively p w is the fluid pressure at the intersection equations 3 5 correspond to the droplet segment within fractures of the upper f1 the lower f1 and f2 fig 2c respectively the terms on the left hand side of each equation are gravity capillary force viscous force and fluid pressure at the intersection the right hand side of each equation is inertial force when the inertial term is ignored i e right hand side is zero this theoretical model reduces to the xue et al 2020 model according to fluid mass conservation the following equation can be obtained 6 d l r dt w 1 d l a 1 dt w 1 d l a 2 dt w 2 0 the hydrodynamic model of velocity dependent contact angles for a liquid air system proposed by berg 1993 which can be applied to capillary numbers ca defined as μv σ i e μ σ dl dt here l l a1 l a2 or l r

can be obtained by fitting equation 7 to measured data of contact angles and interfacial velocities there are seven unknowns l r l a1 l a2 θ r θ a1 θ a2 p w in the above seven equations equations 3 6 7a c we solve these equations by using the ode45 solver in matlab to predict the liquid splitting behavior at the fracture intersection this theoretical model is compared with the xue et al 2020 model without inertia to investigate the influence of inertia on liquid droplet splitting at a fracture intersection 3 results in this section the velocity equation equation 2 and dynamic contact angle model equation 7 are first validated with experimental results then the predictions from the theoretical model of droplet splitting are compared with the physical experiments the theoretical predictions with and without inertial effects are also compared the impacts of inclination angle α apertures w 1 and w 2 and dynamic contact angles θ r and θ a on the splitting dynamics are investigated systematically 3 1 liquid droplet motion before splitting droplet velocity is important parameter quantifying the magnitude of inertial effect we measure the droplet velocities and corresponding receding and advancing contact angles during droplet slide in fracture f1 before arriving at the t shaped fracture intersection and compare the experimental results with the models equations 2 and 7 by fitting the relationship between the receding and advancing contact angles and the capillary number parameters a 1 2 92 b 1 0 073 a 2 0 21 b 2 0 096 are obtained as shown in fig 3 a the dynamic contact angle model shows that as the droplet velocity increases the advancing and receding contact angles gradually approach an asymptotic value with parameters a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 the relationship between droplet sliding velocity and droplet length can be obtained by iteratively solving the dynamic contact angle model equation 7 and velocity equation eq 2 as shown in fig 3b the parameters used in this comparison are ρ 1 g cm3 μ 0 001 pa s σ 0 0728 n m g 9 81 m s2 w 0 78 mm α 50 70 90 it can be seen that the theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data it is also interesting to note the nonlinear dependence of velocity on droplet length the droplet velocity spans two orders of magnitude for l between 1 15 cm and 4 0 cm for l 2 0 cm low droplet velocities are observed whereas when l 2 0 cm the velocity exhibit strong increases with increasing l for the longest droplet length 4 0 cm considered in the experiments a very high velocity over 20 cm s can be observed 3 2 droplet splitting process the flow of water droplets through fracture intersection gives rise to a splitting process during which the droplet is divided into two daughter droplets in the lower part of fracture f1 and branch fracture f2 as shown in figs 4 and 5 as the initial droplet length l increases from 1 65 cm fig 4a and fig 5a to 3 1 cm fig 4b and fig 5b the water entering f2 is reduced substantially further increase of l does not lead to significant decrease in the amount of liquid partitioned into f2 fig 4b c and fig 5b c the detailed experimental results of the daughter droplet length in fracture f2 and lower fracture f1 for different initial droplet lengths are presented in fig 6a it can be seen that the droplet length in lower f1 l a1 increases with l and the droplet length in f2 l a2 generally decreases with l however it should be noted that when l 2 5 cm l a2 becomes essentially insensitive to further increase of l at all three different inclination angles there are two reasons to explain why the amount of liquid partitioned into fracture f2 tends to approach an asymptotic value with l first there exist two competing effects of the droplet length a larger l means an increased effect of gravity which inhibits flow into fracture f2 and at the same time the inertial effect due to increased velocity caused by a larger l promotes liquid entering f2 this effect will be further explained in section 3 3 second the larger the initial droplet length the greater the velocity of the liquid entering f2 but the shorter the time for the liquid to pass the intersection fig 6 b which results in almost the same amount of liquid eventually partitioned into f2 for different initial droplet lengths the results indicate that the partitioning capacity of the branch fractures with the same aperture and inclination angle in a fracture network is almost constant for a certain range of droplet velocities or initial droplet lengths the range is l 2 5 cm in this study to further study the influence of inertia on the droplets after splitting the velocities of the daughter droplets in the lower part of fracture f1 are measured as shown in fig 7 since the daughter droplets in f2 tend to stay immobile after splitting their velocities are not shown here the comparison between the measured results and the theoretical model equations 2 and 7 shows that the velocity equation can again predict the experimental results of the velocities of the daughter droplet in the lower part of fracture f1 very well even at longer initial droplet lengths with stronger inertial effect from comparison with the velocities before splitting fig 3b it can be seen that the velocities are reduced as expected the reduction is more significant for shorter initial droplet lengths since the amount of water partitioning into the branch fracture is much larger in the following subsection we analyze the impact of inertia on liquid splitting ratio at a fracture intersection 3 3 splitting ratio since the apertures of f1 and f2 are chosen in the flow condition to ensure the occurrence of liquid splitting part of liquid will invade f2 and the rest continue flow in the lower half of fracture f1 we define a splitting ratio η as the volumetric ratio of the daughter droplet within f2 after liquid splitting to the total volume of initial droplet before liquid splitting in general the splitting ratio η decreases with increasing initial droplet length l as shown in fig 8 a b the basic parameters used in the theoretical models are ρ 1 g cm3 μ 0 001 pa s σ 0 0728 n m g 9 81 m s2 w 1 0 78 mm w 2 0 28 mm a 1 2 92 b 1 0 073 a 2 0 21 b 2 0 096 α 50 70 90 θ s 56 as can be seen the predictions of splitting ratio for models both with and without inertia well match the experimental observations when the initial droplet length is small fig 8a b however when the initial droplet length is greater than a certain value the difference between the model predictions without inertia and the experimental result gradually increases the relative errors between the theoretical predictions of model without inertia and the experimental results increase from below 10 to over 60 as the initial droplet lengths increase from 1 15 to 4 0 cm for α 90 α 70 and α 50 fig 8c this is because a short initial droplet length means a lower droplet velocity fig 3b as the initial droplet length increases the inertial effects become more pronounced which leads to a larger relative error between experimental results and the theoretical predictions ignoring inertial effect the theoretical predictions of the model with inertia are in good agreement with experimental results about 10 error for all initial droplet lengths fig 8a and c which suggests that the proposed model with inertial effects consider is reliable for prediction of liquid splitting of longer droplets at an intersection to further quantify the inertial effect the difference between the model predictions with inertia and without inertia η i η ii η i is calculated fig 8d not surprisingly the difference increases with the initial droplet length because longer droplets are accompanied by stronger inertial effect here we define a threshold droplet length l th at which η i η ii η i equals 20 beyond this threshold the inertial effect is considered to play a non negligible role in the liquid splitting at the fracture intersection the threshold droplet length l th is 1 71 1 96 2 50 cm for α 90 α 70 and α 50 respectively as indicated by the purple asterisk in fig 8d as shown in fig 8b the measured splitting ratio is greater than the predicted values of the model without inertia when initial droplet length is long l 3 0 cm this may imply that the inertial effect plays a certain role in promoting liquid droplet partition into the branch fracture f2 to reveal the hidden reason behind this seemingly counterintuitive phenomenon taking the inclination angle α 90 as an example we show the evolution of velocities of the receding interface within the upper part of fracture f1 v r the advancing interface within the lower part of fracture f1 v a1 and the advancing interface within fracture f2 v a2 during the splitting process in fig 9 it can be seen that when the initial droplet is short e g l 1 65 cm the difference between v a1 and v a2 is relatively small at the beginning of the liquid splitting fig 9a and both velocities are smaller than v r for larger initial droplet lengths l 2 1 cm the advancing velocity v a1 in f1 is only slightly lower than receding velocity v r but v a2 exhibits a remarkable peak velocity at the beginning of the splitting this peak velocity of v a2 is much higher than v r and v a1 fig 9b d and also higher than the peak velocity in the predictions of the model without inertial effects which results in more liquid entering fracture f2 due to bernoulli effects the partitioned water into f2 within this strongly transient stage is roughly equal to the difference between the model without inertia and experimental results for example when the initial droplet length l 4 0 cm the difference in l a2 between the model without inertia and experimental result is 0 22 cm and according to the model calculation with the inertial effects included the increase of l a2 during the short transient stage is about 0 24 cm the average speed is 40 08 cm s and the corresponding elapsed time is 0 006 s therefore the inertial effect promotes water partitioning into fracture f2 due to transient peak meniscus velocity v a2 immediately after the start of splitting another observation can be made about the decline of peak velocity of v a2 the peak velocity is higher for larger l for l 2 1 cm v a2 quickly drops to zero fig 9b d and the time for the decline of v a2 to zero is shorter for larger l this explains why the splitting ratio stabilizes after l is 2 1 cm 3 4 effect of inclination angle the inclination angle α controlling the magnitude of gravity plays an important role in liquid motion in the fracture here an inclination angle of 90 means a vertical fracture f1 as expected the gravitational effect gradually decreases in f1 and increases in f2 as the inclination angle decreases from 90 to 50 resulting in more water invading f2 and thus a higher splitting ratio fig 8a b in addition for the same initial droplet length the relative error between the model without inertia and the experimental results generally increases with the inclination angle fig 8c which means that the inertial effect on liquid splitting is stronger for larger inclination angles this is due to the fact that the initial droplet velocity is higher when α is larger for a given initial droplet length as a result the threshold droplet length l th increases from 1 71 to 2 50 cm when α decreases from 90 to 50 in order to further clarify the influence of inclination angle on liquid splitting at the intersection the relative error between the model without inertia and the experimental results at roughly the same velocity of initial droplet is presented in fig 10 it can be seen that the relative error increases with the initial velocity before splitting which indicates the inertial effects are responsible for the error however for a given velocity the difference in relative error between different inclination angles is rather small this result indicates that the inclination angle can contribute to the inertial effect on liquid splitting by affecting the droplet velocity 3 5 effect of fracture aperture the fracture aperture having two competing effects also plays an important role in the splitting process xue et al 2020 on the one hand the capillary force that favors liquid entry into fracture f2 increases with decreasing aperture of f2 on the other hand the permeability of f2 decreases with decreasing f2 aperture hindering liquid entry into f2 similarly increase of fracture aperture of f1 leads to an increase in gravity that restrain fluid partitioning into the branch fracture while the enhanced inertial force promotes flow partitioning here we use the models both with and without inertia to investigate the influence of apertures w 1 and w 2 on the threshold droplet length l th by varying w 1 keeping w 2 0 28 mm and w 2 keeping w 1 0 78 mm respectively the inclination angle α is set to 90 as shown in fig 11 a when l is small 2 2 cm increasing w 2 w 1 first leads to an increased splitting ratio η when w 2 w 1 0 4 but then a decreased η when w 2 w 1 0 5 which indicates a non monotonic dependence of η on w 2 w 1 when w 1 is fixed at 0 78 mm which results from the complex interaction between gravity and velocity dependent capillarity during the liquid splitting this result is consistent with xue et al 2020 however when l is large 2 2 cm which was not considered in xue et al 2020 η increases with w 2 w 1 when w 1 w 2 varies with w 2 fixed at 0 28 mm the splitting ratio η generally increases with decreasing w 1 w 2 for l 2 6 cm fig 11b for larger values of l the splitting ratio η again exhibits non monotonic dependence on w 1 w 2 this is due to two opposing mechanisms on the one hand the increase of w 1 enhances the inertial effect and thus promotes partitioning into f2 on the other hand increasing w 1 leads to increased gravity which promotes liquid flow into the lower part of f1 the effect of w 1 and w 2 on the threshold droplet length l th can be analyzed from the results in fig 11c d when w 1 is kept at 0 78 mm and w 2 w 1 changes from 0 1 to 0 5 l th only increases slightly from 2 48 cm to 2 71 cm fig 11c generally an increasing w 2 can weaken the influence of inertia on liquid splitting to a certain extent however when w 2 is kept at 0 28 mm and w 1 w 2 changes from 2 5 to 4 0 l th decreases significantly from 2 87 to 1 89 cm fig 11d this means that increasing aperture w 1 amplifies the influence of inertia on the splitting ratio the reason is that both the initial droplet velocity and mass will increase as the w 1 increases resulting in a stronger inertial effect 3 6 effect of dynamic contact angles the influence of dynamic contact angles on the threshold droplet length l th is studied by varying the shape parameters a 1 and a 2 see equation 7 the shape parameters a 1 and a 2 cannot be controlled independently in our experiments thus a model sensitivity analysis is performed here the inclination α is set to 90 and the fracture widths w 1 and w 2 are set to 0 78 and 0 28 mm respectively to explore the impact of advancing contact angle we set the parameters in contact angle model equation 7 as b 1 0 073 a 2 0 21 b 2 0 096 a 1 varies from 2 35 to 3 25 the corresponding advancing contact angle and the resulting relationship between the droplet velocity and droplet length for different values of a 1 are shown in fig 12 a and 12c the results show that the advancing contact angle increases as a 1 increases but droplet velocity shows an opposite trend for example as a 1 increases from 2 35 to 3 25 the advancing contact angle rises from 86 8 to 119 9 when ca is equal to 0 002 and the droplet velocity drops from 27 6 to 16 0 cm s when the droplet length l is equal to 4 0 cm similarly the effect of receding contact angle is investigated by using different values of a 2 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 it can be seen that the receding contact angle and droplet velocity both increase as a 2 increases fig 12b and 12d when the l 4 0 cm the velocity rises from 19 1 to 23 3 cm s as the a 1 increases from 0 1 to 0 4 from fig 12c d it can be seen that there is a larger velocity change caused by the change of a 1 advancing contact angle than of a 2 receding contact angle as shown in fig 13 a b the splitting ratio η decreases monotonically as a 1 or a 2 increases since a decrease in advancing contact angle decreasing a 1 or an increase in receding contact angle increasing a 2 result in higher droplet velocities and a stronger inertial effect for a given l the parameters a 1 or a 2 will also affect the threshold droplet length l th fig 13c d for example l th 1 98 2 24 2 46 and 2 52 cm for a 1 2 35 2 65 2 95 and 3 25 respectively l th 1 88 1 76 1 64 and 1 44 cm when a 2 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 respectively these results show the influence of shape parameter a 1 on l th is opposite to that of a 2 4 discussion during unsaturated flow in natural fractured rocks sudden discharges of large volume of water with high velocity often occur glass et al 2002a glass et al 2003 jones et al 2018 therefore the inertial force which is often ignored can play a role in liquid motion and splitting at the intersections within a fracture network combining visualization experiments and theoretical modeling we show that when the droplet length is large neglecting the inertial effect can result in underestimation of liquid partitioning into the branch fracture f2 at the intersection this is because the inertia induces a very high meniscus velocity at the advancing front in f2 it should be pointed out that since the droplet velocity in a fracture is higher for larger droplet lengths increasing the inertia means increased gravity effect as a result the competing effects of gravity and inertia give rise to the water partitioning efficiency that maintains a value largely insensitive to droplet length increase when the droplet length is 2 5 cm our mechanistic model with inertial effects improves the prediction of water partitioning at fracture intersections and can be used to assess the effect of flow diversion and preferential path selection on liquid distributions and dynamics in fracture networks this can find applications in subsurface engineering scenarios such as underground waste disposal where seepage through fractures into excavated compartments needs to be predicted besides by embedding the liquid splitting model at each intersection in a fracture network an unsaturated flow model for fractured network model can be developed to investigate macroscopic flow features such as emergence of preferential pathways liquid breakthrough time and spatial distribution of liquid and eventually to obtained upscaled hydraulic properties relevant to field scale applications further work to extend the model of liquid splitting at fracture intersections to fracture network models is needed in future studies it should be noted that our experimental system in this work has several limitations while some necessary simplifications are needed to obtain a fundamental understanding of the influence of inertial effect on liquid splitting behavior at a fracture intersection the experimental setup and the proposed theoretical models are two dimensional however water infiltration in fracture rock masses can exhibit three dimensional flow characteristics even so the two dimensional simplification is considered reasonable since localized and channeling behaviors are believed to occur frequently in unsaturated flows jones et al 2018 illman and hughson 2005 su et al 2004 another simplified condition is that all the liquid splitting behaviors are performed at initially dry scenarios while intersections in natural rocks tend to have residual water which leads to more complex flow behaviors furthermore only the droplet flow regime is investigated here however there are alternative splitting behaviors caused by other flow patterns such as rivulet and film flow at natural fracture intersections e g kordilla et al 2017 yang et al 2019 zhao et al 2022 future studies are thus needed to explore the impact of additional complexities from model dimensionality initial wetting condition flow regimes and fracture properties e g geometry and surface roughness 5 conclusions in this work the influence of inertia on water droplet splitting at a fracture intersection is investigated a novel experimental approach and setup is developed which facilitate visualization of long droplets with high velocity in fractures we first show by experimental observations and calculations that the droplet velocity increases with droplet length and that the droplet velocity model coupled with dynamic contact angle equations is still applicable to high velocity droplets in a fracture we then propose a liquid droplet splitting model considering inertial effect to predict the splitting dynamics of droplets the proposed model is validated against experimental results by comparing the model predictions both with and without inertia in this study and comparing with experimental data we find that the inertial effect tends to promote water partitioning into the branch fracture in addition a threshold droplet length is defined to quantify the droplet length at which the inertial effect starts to exert an impact on the splitting dynamics the influence of key parameters such as the inclination angle of the intersection the fracture apertures and the dynamic contact angles on the droplet splitting behaviors is investigated through a systematic parameter sensitivity study it is shown that the inclination angle affects the threshold droplet length mainly by controlling the droplet velocity furthermore we show that the splitting ratio can have a non monotonic dependence on the aperture ratios between the two fractures for a certain range of droplet lengths the advancing contact angle and receding contact angle have opposite effects on the threshold droplet length i e the threshold droplet length increases with increasing advancing contact angle while it decreases with increasing receding contact angle the proposed theoretical model with inertia included lays a foundation for further research on the effect of inertia on unsaturated flow in fractured media the improved understanding of the inertial effect on liquid splitting at a fracture intersection may provide new mesoscopic insights into unsaturated flow and contaminant transport behavior in subsurface fractured networks ireson et al 2006 mahmoodi et al 2020 yang et al 2013 therefore this work has significance in hydrological and environmental applications the findings of this work are also relevant to subsurface engineering applications involving high rate injection of immiscible fluids with large density contrast into fractured rocks e g in hydrogen storage future studies should consider factors such as three dimensional effects residual water and surface roughness as well as inertia regimes of unsaturated flow in fracture networks

2260,liquid splitting behavior at fracture intersections is an important process affecting unsaturated flow in fractured rocks the role of inertia in liquid splitting at a fracture intersection however remains poorly understood in this study a theoretical model considering inertia is proposed to explore the inertial effect on liquid splitting at idealized facture intersections consisting of a main fracture and a branch fracture the liquid droplet splitting behaviors predicted by the proposed model are in good agreement with the carefully controlled visualization experiments by comparing the model predictions with and without inertia and comparing with experimental data we show that neglecting the inertial effect leads to underestimation of liquid partitioning into the branch fracture with a smaller aperture than the main fracture furthermore a threshold droplet length is defined to quantify the droplet length at which the inertial effect starts to exert an impact on the splitting dynamics the influence of key parameters such as the inclination angle the fracture apertures and the dynamic contact angles on the droplet splitting behaviors is investigated through a systematic parameter sensitivity analysis we show that the inclination angle affects the threshold droplet length mainly by controlling the initial droplet velocity it is also demonstrated that the fracture apertures and the advancing and receding contact angles have significant impact on the volume percentage partitioned into the branch fracture the improved understanding in this work may provide new insights into unsaturated flow and contaminant transport behaviors in fractured networks with implications for hydrological and environmental applications keywords unsaturated flow fracture

characteristics of unsaturated flow in fractured rocks which leads to a formidable challenge in accurately predicting the unsaturated flow behaviors anatoly et al 2022 viswanathan et al 2022 theoretical studies on relatively simple fracture intersections which are an important geometrical component of a fracture network provide a basis for enabling predictions of unsaturated flow e g kordilla et al 2021 noffz et al 2019 xue et al 2020 however inertial effects on fluid motion during unsaturated flow in fractured media is often neglected in previous studies therefore it is necessary to investigate the influence of inertial effects on unsaturated flow in fractured media under saturated flow conditions inertial force leads to formation and growth of eddies and recirculation zones which is responsible for the transition from darcian flow to non darcian flow e g cardenas et al 2009 lee et al 2014 qian et al 2016 xing et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 however unsaturated flow behaviors in fractures are significantly different from saturated flow and often exhibit more complex features resulting from gravity destabilization and motion of liquid air contact lines sheng et al 2019 thiéry et al 2018 influenced by surface properties and contact line velocities capillary hysteresis and dynamic contact angles occur in unsaturated flow e g hoffman 1975 lei et al 2018 li et al 2022

between dynamic contact angle and contact line velocity in flow models e g bico quéré 2001 dragila weisbrod 2003 or ghezzehei 2006 however when the droplet with higher velocity encounters geometric changes such as fracture intersection and rough fracture surface the inertial effect becomes non negligible and intractable luo et al 2022 ye et al 2017 fracture intersections can act as capillary barriers the strength of which hinges on the combined effect of several factors including intersection geometry fracture apertures and wetting properties ji et al 2006 therefore intersection will

et al 2005 evaluated the magnitude of the inertial effect and the relative importance of viscous capillary and inertial forces as a function of fracture aperture after the liquid pool height overcomes the capillary barrier at a fracture intersection droplets with larger volume and higher releasing velocity will result in stronger inertial effects and influence the liquid splitting behavior at the intersection although many studies in recent years have qualitatively and quantitatively improved our understanding on liquid splitting behaviors at fracture intersections e g kordilla et al 2017 yang et al 2019 xue et al 2020 it is unclear how inertia influences the liquid splitting behavior in this study we propose a theoretical model of liquid splitting considering the inertial effect and compare model prediction with results from carefully controlled visualized experiments of liquid droplet splitting at a fracture intersection we consider droplets of different initial lengths which determine their terminal velocity in a fracture and thus represent the strength of inertial effect the theoretical analysis and experimental observations are combined to reveal the influence of inertial effect on liquid splitting at fracture intersections the influence of key parameters including the inclination angle of the intersection the fracture apertures and the dynamic contact angles on droplet splitting behaviors is systematically investigated 2 methods 2 1 laboratory experiments we perform liquid splitting experiments at t shaped fracture intersections with a visualization experiment apparatus as shown in fig 1 a the t shaped fracture intersection consists of three pieces of smooth quartz glass with a thickness of 3 mm which are glued to a piece of acrylic plate through four spacers 5 mm thick with uv light curing glue fig 1b so the flow pathways are only in contact with the quartz glass but not the acrylic plate the flow cell is fixed to a support frame which can be rotated allowing the fracture intersections to alter its inclination angle α fig 1c three pieces of glass are separated with gaps forming a main fracture f1 0 78 mm wide 300 mm long and a branch or side fracture f2 0 28 mm wide 150 mm long fracture f1 and fracture f2 intersect at a point which divides fracture f1 into two parts with a length of 200 mm upper fracture and a length of 100 mm lower fracture when the length of the liquid in the fracture is greater than a certain value which depends on the aperture and surface wetting characteristic of the fracture the liquid will leave the injection port to form a droplet flow under continuous injection conditions jones et al 2018 therefore it is practically difficult to generate long droplets e g 3 cm to obtain long droplets in the upper part of the fracture shorter droplets are sequentially injected and allowed to coalesce within the fracture before arriving at the intersection we control the total injection volume by high precision micro injector to acquire droplets of various initial lengths the droplet velocities before splitting are measured the droplet lengths are accurately controlled as 1 15 1 65 2 1 2 6 3 1 3 5 4 0 cm with corresponding volumes of 27 39 50 62 74 84 96 μl of dyed water 0 075 g capsicum red per liter of pure water respectively the inclination angles α are set as 90 70 and 50 each experiment of the same initial droplet length and inclination angle α is repeated three times a high speed camera fixed in front of the fracture intersection records the liquid splitting process at a frequency of 50 frame s after each experiment the flow cell is carefully cleaned through plasma cleaning and subsequent repeated cycles of vacuum drying and ultrapure water immersion yang et al 2019 xue et al 2020 the measured static contact angle θ s of the fracture surface is 56 2 2 theory and model the movement of fluid in a fracture and through a fracture intersection is controlled by the combined action of gravitational capillary viscous and inertial forces these forces are influenced by factors including droplet length interfacial velocity and contact angles which affect liquid splitting process at a fracture intersection xue et al 2020 fig 2 a shows a liquid droplet in an idealized fracture when the droplet length is less than the threshold length for triggering droplet sliding the droplet will remain stationary under the action of gravity and capillary force difference between advancing and receding menisci in this case the balance between gravity and capillary force gives lsinα φ a φ r where l is the droplet length α is the inclination angle of the fracture relative to the horizontal plane φ a and φ r are the capillary pressures in unit of hydraulic head of the advancing and receding menisci respectively since the radius of the minor principal curvature is much larger than the aperture induced radius of curvature in our experiments the minor principal curvature can be neglected therefore one can calculate φ a and φ r according to the young laplace equation 1a φ a 2 σ cos θ a ρ g w 1b φ r 2 σ cos θ r ρ g w where σ is the interfacial tension ρ is the fluid density g is the gravity acceleration w is the fracture aperture and θ a and θ r are the advancing and receding contact angles respectively when the droplet length is greater than the threshold length for triggering droplet movement the droplet will migrate with a steady velocity v the velocity v can be obtained by the balance of capillary gravity and viscous forces e g or ghezzehei 2007 su et al 2004 xue et al 2020 2 v ρ g w 2 12 μ 2 σ cos θ r cos θ a l ρ g w sin α where μ is the dynamic viscosity the advancing and receding contact angles θ a and θ r of a moving droplet vary with the interfacial velocity which in turn depends on the droplet length l after the droplet reaches the intersection fig 2b liquid splitting ensues as shown in fig 2c the liquid length within the upper part of inflow fracture f1 is denoted by l r the length within the lower part of f1 is denoted by l a1 and the length within the side fracture is denoted by l a2 at any moment during the droplet splitting process we divide the droplet into three segments in the upper part of fracture f1 the lower part of fracture f1 and fracture f2 respectively the force equilibrium equations for the three droplet segments in a very short period of time are established as follows 3 ρ g w 1 l r sin α 1 2 σ cos θ r 12 μ l r w 1 d l r dt p w w 1 ρ w 1 l r d 2 l r d t 2 4 ρ g w 1 l a 1 sin α 1 2 σ cos θ a 1 12 μ l a 1 w 1 d l a

respectively α 1 and α 2 are the inclination angle of f1 and f2 relative to the horizontal plane respectively θ a θ a1 and θ a2 and θ r are the advancing and receding contact angles respectively p w is the fluid pressure at the intersection equations 3 5 correspond to the droplet segment within fractures of the upper f1 the lower f1 and f2 fig 2c respectively the terms on the left hand side of each equation are gravity capillary force viscous force and fluid pressure at the intersection the right hand side of each equation is inertial force when the inertial term is ignored i e right hand side is zero this theoretical model reduces to the xue et al 2020 model according to fluid mass conservation the following equation can be obtained 6 d l r dt w 1 d l a 1 dt w 1 d l a 2 dt w 2 0 the hydrodynamic model of velocity dependent contact angles for a liquid air system proposed by berg 1993 which can be applied to capillary numbers ca defined as μv σ i e μ σ dl dt here l l a1 l a2 or l r

can be obtained by fitting equation 7 to measured data of contact angles and interfacial velocities there are seven unknowns l r l a1 l a2 θ r θ a1 θ a2 p w in the above seven equations equations 3 6 7a c we solve these equations by using the ode45 solver in matlab to predict the liquid splitting behavior at the fracture intersection this theoretical model is compared with the xue et al 2020 model without inertia to investigate the influence of inertia on liquid droplet splitting at a fracture intersection 3 results in this section the velocity equation equation 2 and dynamic contact angle model equation 7 are first validated with experimental results then the predictions from the theoretical model of droplet splitting are compared with the physical experiments the theoretical predictions with and without inertial effects are also compared the impacts of inclination angle α apertures w 1 and w 2 and dynamic contact angles θ r and θ a on the splitting dynamics are investigated systematically 3 1 liquid droplet motion before splitting droplet velocity is important parameter quantifying the magnitude of inertial effect we measure the droplet velocities and corresponding receding and advancing contact angles during droplet slide in fracture f1 before arriving at the t shaped fracture intersection and compare the experimental results with the models equations 2 and 7 by fitting the relationship between the receding and advancing contact angles and the capillary number parameters a 1 2 92 b 1 0 073 a 2 0 21 b 2 0 096 are obtained as shown in fig 3 a the dynamic contact angle model shows that as the droplet velocity increases the advancing and receding contact angles gradually approach an asymptotic value with parameters a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 the relationship between droplet sliding velocity and droplet length can be obtained by iteratively solving the dynamic contact angle model equation 7 and velocity equation eq 2 as shown in fig 3b the parameters used in this comparison are ρ 1 g cm3 μ 0 001 pa s σ 0 0728 n m g 9 81 m s2 w 0 78 mm α 50 70 90 it can be seen that the theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data it is also interesting to note the nonlinear dependence of velocity on droplet length the droplet velocity spans two orders of magnitude for l between 1 15 cm and 4 0 cm for l 2 0 cm low droplet velocities are observed whereas when l 2 0 cm the velocity exhibit strong increases with increasing l for the longest droplet length 4 0 cm considered in the experiments a very high velocity over 20 cm s can be observed 3 2 droplet splitting process the flow of water droplets through fracture intersection gives rise to a splitting process during which the droplet is divided into two daughter droplets in the lower part of fracture f1 and branch fracture f2 as shown in figs 4 and 5 as the initial droplet length l increases from 1 65 cm fig 4a and fig 5a to 3 1 cm fig 4b and fig 5b the water entering f2 is reduced substantially further increase of l does not lead to significant decrease in the amount of liquid partitioned into f2 fig 4b c and fig 5b c the detailed experimental results of the daughter droplet length in fracture f2 and lower fracture f1 for different initial droplet lengths are presented in fig 6a it can be seen that the droplet length in lower f1 l a1 increases with l and the droplet length in f2 l a2 generally decreases with l however it should be noted that when l 2 5 cm l a2 becomes essentially insensitive to further increase of l at all three different inclination angles there are two reasons to explain why the amount of liquid partitioned into fracture f2 tends to approach an asymptotic value with l first there exist two competing effects of the droplet length a larger l means an increased effect of gravity which inhibits flow into fracture f2 and at the same time the inertial effect due to increased velocity caused by a larger l promotes liquid entering f2 this effect will be further explained in section 3 3 second the larger the initial droplet length the greater the velocity of the liquid entering f2 but the shorter the time for the liquid to pass the intersection fig 6 b which results in almost the same amount of liquid eventually partitioned into f2 for different initial droplet lengths the results indicate that the partitioning capacity of the branch fractures with the same aperture and inclination angle in a fracture network is almost constant for a certain range of droplet velocities or initial droplet lengths the range is l 2 5 cm in this study to further study the influence of inertia on the droplets after splitting the velocities of the daughter droplets in the lower part of fracture f1 are measured as shown in fig 7 since the daughter droplets in f2 tend to stay immobile after splitting their velocities are not shown here the comparison between the measured results and the theoretical model equations 2 and 7 shows that the velocity equation can again predict the experimental results of the velocities of the daughter droplet in the lower part of fracture f1 very well even at longer initial droplet lengths with stronger inertial effect from comparison with the velocities before splitting fig 3b it can be seen that the velocities are reduced as expected the reduction is more significant for shorter initial droplet lengths since the amount of water partitioning into the branch fracture is much larger in the following subsection we analyze the impact of inertia on liquid splitting ratio at a fracture intersection 3 3 splitting ratio since the apertures of f1 and f2 are chosen in the flow condition to ensure the occurrence of liquid splitting part of liquid will invade f2 and the rest continue flow in the lower half of fracture f1 we define a splitting ratio η as the volumetric ratio of the daughter droplet within f2 after liquid splitting to the total volume of initial droplet before liquid splitting in general the splitting ratio η decreases with increasing initial droplet length l as shown in fig 8 a b the basic parameters used in the theoretical models are ρ 1 g cm3 μ 0 001 pa s σ 0 0728 n m g 9 81 m s2 w 1 0 78 mm w 2 0 28 mm a 1 2 92 b 1 0 073 a 2 0 21 b 2 0 096 α 50 70 90 θ s 56 as can be seen the predictions of splitting ratio for models both with and without inertia well match the experimental observations when the initial droplet length is small fig 8a b however when the initial droplet length is greater than a certain value the difference between the model predictions without inertia and the experimental result gradually increases the relative errors between the theoretical predictions of model without inertia and the experimental results increase from below 10 to over 60 as the initial droplet lengths increase from 1 15 to 4 0 cm for α 90 α 70 and α 50 fig 8c this is because a short initial droplet length means a lower droplet velocity fig 3b as the initial droplet length increases the inertial effects become more pronounced which leads to a larger relative error between experimental results and the theoretical predictions ignoring inertial effect the theoretical predictions of the model with inertia are in good agreement with experimental results about 10 error for all initial droplet lengths fig 8a and c which suggests that the proposed model with inertial effects consider is reliable for prediction of liquid splitting of longer droplets at an intersection to further quantify the inertial effect the difference between the model predictions with inertia and without inertia η i η ii η i is calculated fig 8d not surprisingly the difference increases with the initial droplet length because longer droplets are accompanied by stronger inertial effect here we define a threshold droplet length l th at which η i η ii η i equals 20 beyond this threshold the inertial effect is considered to play a non negligible role in the liquid splitting at the fracture intersection the threshold droplet length l th is 1 71 1 96 2 50 cm for α 90 α 70 and α 50 respectively as indicated by the purple asterisk in fig 8d as shown in fig 8b the measured splitting ratio is greater than the predicted values of the model without inertia when initial droplet length is long l 3 0 cm this may imply that the inertial effect plays a certain role in promoting liquid droplet partition into the branch fracture f2 to reveal the hidden reason behind this seemingly counterintuitive phenomenon taking the inclination angle α 90 as an example we show the evolution of velocities of the receding interface within the upper part of fracture f1 v r the advancing interface within the lower part of fracture f1 v a1 and the advancing interface within fracture f2 v a2 during the splitting process in fig 9 it can be seen that when the initial droplet is short e g l 1 65 cm the difference between v a1 and v a2 is relatively small at the beginning of the liquid splitting fig 9a and both velocities are smaller than v r for larger initial droplet lengths l 2 1 cm the advancing velocity v a1 in f1 is only slightly lower than receding velocity v r but v a2 exhibits a remarkable peak velocity at the beginning of the splitting this peak velocity of v a2 is much higher than v r and v a1 fig 9b d and also higher than the peak velocity in the predictions of the model without inertial effects which results in more liquid entering fracture f2 due to bernoulli effects the partitioned water into f2 within this strongly transient stage is roughly equal to the difference between the model without inertia and experimental results for example when the initial droplet length l 4 0 cm the difference in l a2 between the model without inertia and experimental result is 0 22 cm and according to the model calculation with the inertial effects included the increase of l a2 during the short transient stage is about 0 24 cm the average speed is 40 08 cm s and the corresponding elapsed time is 0 006 s therefore the inertial effect promotes water partitioning into fracture f2 due to transient peak meniscus velocity v a2 immediately after the start of splitting another observation can be made about the decline of peak velocity of v a2 the peak velocity is higher for larger l for l 2 1 cm v a2 quickly drops to zero fig 9b d and the time for the decline of v a2 to zero is shorter for larger l this explains why the splitting ratio stabilizes after l is 2 1 cm 3 4 effect of inclination angle the inclination angle α controlling the magnitude of gravity plays an important role in liquid motion in the fracture here an inclination angle of 90 means a vertical fracture f1 as expected the gravitational effect gradually decreases in f1 and increases in f2 as the inclination angle decreases from 90 to 50 resulting in more water invading f2 and thus a higher splitting ratio fig 8a b in addition for the same initial droplet length the relative error between the model without inertia and the experimental results generally increases with the inclination angle fig 8c which means that the inertial effect on liquid splitting is stronger for larger inclination angles this is due to the fact that the initial droplet velocity is higher when α is larger for a given initial droplet length as a result the threshold droplet length l th increases from 1 71 to 2 50 cm when α decreases from 90 to 50 in order to further clarify the influence of inclination angle on liquid splitting at the intersection the relative error between the model without inertia and the experimental results at roughly the same velocity of initial droplet is presented in fig 10 it can be seen that the relative error increases with the initial velocity before splitting which indicates the inertial effects are responsible for the error however for a given velocity the difference in relative error between different inclination angles is rather small this result indicates that the inclination angle can contribute to the inertial effect on liquid splitting by affecting the droplet velocity 3 5 effect of fracture aperture the fracture aperture having two competing effects also plays an important role in the splitting process xue et al 2020 on the one hand the capillary force that favors liquid entry into fracture f2 increases with decreasing aperture of f2 on the other hand the permeability of f2 decreases with decreasing f2 aperture hindering liquid entry into f2 similarly increase of fracture aperture of f1 leads to an increase in gravity that restrain fluid partitioning into the branch fracture while the enhanced inertial force promotes flow partitioning here we use the models both with and without inertia to investigate the influence of apertures w 1 and w 2 on the threshold droplet length l th by varying w 1 keeping w 2 0 28 mm and w 2 keeping w 1 0 78 mm respectively the inclination angle α is set to 90 as shown in fig 11 a when l is small 2 2 cm increasing w 2 w 1 first leads to an increased splitting ratio η when w 2 w 1 0 4 but then a decreased η when w 2 w 1 0 5 which indicates a non monotonic dependence of η on w 2 w 1 when w 1 is fixed at 0 78 mm which results from the complex interaction between gravity and velocity dependent capillarity during the liquid splitting this result is consistent with xue et al 2020 however when l is large 2 2 cm which was not considered in xue et al 2020 η increases with w 2 w 1 when w 1 w 2 varies with w 2 fixed at 0 28 mm the splitting ratio η generally increases with decreasing w 1 w 2 for l 2 6 cm fig 11b for larger values of l the splitting ratio η again exhibits non monotonic dependence on w 1 w 2 this is due to two opposing mechanisms on the one hand the increase of w 1 enhances the inertial effect and thus promotes partitioning into f2 on the other hand increasing w 1 leads to increased gravity which promotes liquid flow into the lower part of f1 the effect of w 1 and w 2 on the threshold droplet length l th can be analyzed from the results in fig 11c d when w 1 is kept at 0 78 mm and w 2 w 1 changes from 0 1 to 0 5 l th only increases slightly from 2 48 cm to 2 71 cm fig 11c generally an increasing w 2 can weaken the influence of inertia on liquid splitting to a certain extent however when w 2 is kept at 0 28 mm and w 1 w 2 changes from 2 5 to 4 0 l th decreases significantly from 2 87 to 1 89 cm fig 11d this means that increasing aperture w 1 amplifies the influence of inertia on the splitting ratio the reason is that both the initial droplet velocity and mass will increase as the w 1 increases resulting in a stronger inertial effect 3 6 effect of dynamic contact angles the influence of dynamic contact angles on the threshold droplet length l th is studied by varying the shape parameters a 1 and a 2 see equation 7 the shape parameters a 1 and a 2 cannot be controlled independently in our experiments thus a model sensitivity analysis is performed here the inclination α is set to 90 and the fracture widths w 1 and w 2 are set to 0 78 and 0 28 mm respectively to explore the impact of advancing contact angle we set the parameters in contact angle model equation 7 as b 1 0 073 a 2 0 21 b 2 0 096 a 1 varies from 2 35 to 3 25 the corresponding advancing contact angle and the resulting relationship between the droplet velocity and droplet length for different values of a 1 are shown in fig 12 a and 12c the results show that the advancing contact angle increases as a 1 increases but droplet velocity shows an opposite trend for example as a 1 increases from 2 35 to 3 25 the advancing contact angle rises from 86 8 to 119 9 when ca is equal to 0 002 and the droplet velocity drops from 27 6 to 16 0 cm s when the droplet length l is equal to 4 0 cm similarly the effect of receding contact angle is investigated by using different values of a 2 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 it can be seen that the receding contact angle and droplet velocity both increase as a 2 increases fig 12b and 12d when the l 4 0 cm the velocity rises from 19 1 to 23 3 cm s as the a 1 increases from 0 1 to 0 4 from fig 12c d it can be seen that there is a larger velocity change caused by the change of a 1 advancing contact angle than of a 2 receding contact angle as shown in fig 13 a b the splitting ratio η decreases monotonically as a 1 or a 2 increases since a decrease in advancing contact angle decreasing a 1 or an increase in receding contact angle increasing a 2 result in higher droplet velocities and a stronger inertial effect for a given l the parameters a 1 or a 2 will also affect the threshold droplet length l th fig 13c d for example l th 1 98 2 24 2 46 and 2 52 cm for a 1 2 35 2 65 2 95 and 3 25 respectively l th 1 88 1 76 1 64 and 1 44 cm when a 2 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 respectively these results show the influence of shape parameter a 1 on l th is opposite to that of a 2 4 discussion during unsaturated flow in natural fractured rocks sudden discharges of large volume of water with high velocity often occur glass et al 2002a glass et al 2003 jones et al 2018 therefore the inertial force which is often ignored can play a role in liquid motion and splitting at the intersections within a fracture network combining visualization experiments and theoretical modeling we show that when the droplet length is large neglecting the inertial effect can result in underestimation of liquid partitioning into the branch fracture f2 at the intersection this is because the inertia induces a very high meniscus velocity at the advancing front in f2 it should be pointed out that since the droplet velocity in a fracture is higher for larger droplet lengths increasing the inertia means increased gravity effect as a result the competing effects of gravity and inertia give rise to the water partitioning efficiency that maintains a value largely insensitive to droplet length increase when the droplet length is 2 5 cm our mechanistic model with inertial effects improves the prediction of water partitioning at fracture intersections and can be used to assess the effect of flow diversion and preferential path selection on liquid distributions and dynamics in fracture networks this can find applications in subsurface engineering scenarios such as underground waste disposal where seepage through fractures into excavated compartments needs to be predicted besides by embedding the liquid splitting model at each intersection in a fracture network an unsaturated flow model for fractured network model can be developed to investigate macroscopic flow features such as emergence of preferential pathways liquid breakthrough time and spatial distribution of liquid and eventually to obtained upscaled hydraulic properties relevant to field scale applications further work to extend the model of liquid splitting at fracture intersections to fracture network models is needed in future studies it should be noted that our experimental system in this work has several limitations while some necessary simplifications are needed to obtain a fundamental understanding of the influence of inertial effect on liquid splitting behavior at a fracture intersection the experimental setup and the proposed theoretical models are two dimensional however water infiltration in fracture rock masses can exhibit three dimensional flow characteristics even so the two dimensional simplification is considered reasonable since localized and channeling behaviors are believed to occur frequently in unsaturated flows jones et al 2018 illman and hughson 2005 su et al 2004 another simplified condition is that all the liquid splitting behaviors are performed at initially dry scenarios while intersections in natural rocks tend to have residual water which leads to more complex flow behaviors furthermore only the droplet flow regime is investigated here however there are alternative splitting behaviors caused by other flow patterns such as rivulet and film flow at natural fracture intersections e g kordilla et al 2017 yang et al 2019 zhao et al 2022 future studies are thus needed to explore the impact of additional complexities from model dimensionality initial wetting condition flow regimes and fracture properties e g geometry and surface roughness 5 conclusions in this work the influence of inertia on water droplet splitting at a fracture intersection is investigated a novel experimental approach and setup is developed which facilitate visualization of long droplets with high velocity in fractures we first show by experimental observations and calculations that the droplet velocity increases with droplet length and that the droplet velocity model coupled with dynamic contact angle equations is still applicable to high velocity droplets in a fracture we then propose a liquid droplet splitting model considering inertial effect to predict the splitting dynamics of droplets the proposed model is validated against experimental results by comparing the model predictions both with and without inertia in this study and comparing with experimental data we find that the inertial effect tends to promote water partitioning into the branch fracture in addition a threshold droplet length is defined to quantify the droplet length at which the inertial effect starts to exert an impact on the splitting dynamics the influence of key parameters such as the inclination angle of the intersection the fracture apertures and the dynamic contact angles on the droplet splitting behaviors is investigated through a systematic parameter sensitivity study it is shown that the inclination angle affects the threshold droplet length mainly by controlling the droplet velocity furthermore we show that the splitting ratio can have a non monotonic dependence on the aperture ratios between the two fractures for a certain range of droplet lengths the advancing contact angle and receding contact angle have opposite effects on the threshold droplet length i e the threshold droplet length increases with increasing advancing contact angle while it decreases with increasing receding contact angle the proposed theoretical model with inertia included lays a foundation for further research on the effect of inertia on unsaturated flow in fractured media the improved understanding of the inertial effect on liquid splitting at a fracture intersection may provide new mesoscopic insights into unsaturated flow and contaminant transport behavior in subsurface fractured networks ireson et al 2006 mahmoodi et al 2020 yang et al 2013 therefore this work has significance in hydrological and environmental applications the findings of this work are also relevant to subsurface engineering applications involving high rate injection of immiscible fluids with large density contrast into fractured rocks e g in hydrogen storage future studies should consider factors such as three dimensional effects residual water and surface roughness as well as inertia regimes of unsaturated flow in fracture networks

2261,the critical zone cz includes natural and anthropogenic environments where life energy and matter cycles combine in complex interactions in time and space critical zone observatories czos have been established around the world yet their limitations in space and duration of observations as well as the oft existing dominant disciplinary research field s of each czo may limit the transferability of the local knowledge to other settings or hinder integrative cz understanding in this regard this review advocates for cross site cross network collaborations in cz sciences we posit that this type of collaboration is becoming indispensable for understanding past trends and future trajectories of the cz in the context of fast developing and widespread environmental changes aided by a series of cyberseminars and a community survey we highlight some of the existing cross site initiatives tools and techniques and the cross cutting science questions that could benefit from such cross network syntheses in various types of cz settings montane alpine arctic managed and agricultural environments lakes wetlands streams landscapes disturbed by drought and or wildfire etc this review also identifies and discusses the major and legitimate concerns and obstacles for a collaborative cz approach including data harmonization and integration of social sciences and proposes tentative ways forward keywords critical zone watershed cross site synthesis data harmonization interdisciplinary available datasets data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 critical zone science what why where 1 1 what is the critical zone and what are critical zone observatories in 2001 a panel of the us national research council nrc 2001 put forward the critical zone concept and defined it as a heterogeneous near surface environment in which complex interactions involving rock soil water air and living organisms regulate the natural habitat and determine availability of life sustaining resources simply put the critical zone cz is where most life forms have strived on earth and the natural habitat where our basic human needs such as water food and energy are sustained in the critical zone life energy and matter cycles organize at a variety of scales chorover et al 2007 perdrial et al 2015 among which the watershed or fluvial catchment may constitute a fundamental control volume rinaldo and rodriguez iturbe 2022 to apprehend the daunting complexity of these natural cycles and crucially how ongoing anthropogenic changes have been impacting critical zone and watershed functioning e g goddéris and brantley 2013 numerous long term critical zone observatories czos and watershed sites have been established throughout the world brantley et al 2017 richter and mobley 2009 in the united states the national science foundation nsf recognized the significant role that the critical zone plays in the existence of life on earth and created the critical zone observatory czo program giardino and houser 2015 white et al 2015 this was followed by the establishment of soil transformations in european catchments soiltrec banwart et al 2011 by the consortium of european union members today there are numerous czos spread across the world however not all of these belong to a formally funded network see section 1 3 the term czo as defined here is therefore used to describe any instrumented field site used for monitoring energy water and material fluxes and biogeochemical cycles from unaltered bedrock to the atmospheric boundary layer across terrestrial and aquatic interfaces and across climatic and hydrobiogeochemical gradients guo and lin 2016 lin et al 2011 1 2 why are critical zone observatories needed cz science integrates our understanding of how water moves from the top of the canopy e g trees grass crops to the depths of circulating groundwater anderson et al 2008 brantley et al 2007 cz science also helps us quantify how long water is retained in aquifers how much water goes to vegetation to support carbon fixation versus shunted to our streams lakes and reservoirs and what controls the quality of our freshwater resources ultimately it is this holistic discipline that helps us understand the mechanisms and rates at which multiple earth surface processes and biogeochemical cycles occur and how these may change in response to climate change land use practices and changing disturbance regimes to this end cz science has enabled advances in sensing and tracing technologies that have improved resolution and frequency in monitoring the hidden subsurface barclay et al 2022 mangel et al 2022 cz science has also fostered the growth of high fidelity reactive transport models that test our understanding of processes stolze et al 2022 and can reach beyond spatial and temporal scales of measurements li et al 2017 steefel et al 2015 taken together the substantial body of cz research provides a strong foundation for quantifying nutrient dynamics greenhouse gas emissions as well as water and energy exchange in the critical zone arora et al 2022a cheng et al 2018 chorover et al 2011 it is important to acknowledge that a robust predictive understanding of how cz and watersheds function and respond to disturbances is necessary to tackle some of the biggest challenges for the 21st century such as water security food and energy production and sustainable ecosystem services despite significant advancements in hydrology e g hrachowitz et al 2013 mcdonnell et al 2007 soil science e g tokunaga et al 2019 vereecken et al 2016 ecology dawson et al 2020 geomicrobiology rillig et al 2019 biogeochemistry e g benk et al 2019 waterhouse et al 2021 geology e g rempe and dietrich 2014 white and brantley 2003 climatology rasmussen et al 2011 and other fields that work in the cz accurately predicting cz functioning requires study of the interactions among dominant processes across landscapes given this complexity recent studies have highlighted the need for more holistic integrative and multiscale approaches that work at the intersections of traditionally separate disciplines to advance our understanding of cz functioning for example saup et al 2019 demonstrated the tight linkage between microbial community assembly and seasonal hydrology in the upper colorado river basin they make the point that understanding hydrological drivers of microbial activity is important for systems whose flow regime may be impacted under future climate scenarios similarly li et al 2021 advocate for developing integrated theories at the intersection of hydrology e g transit time theory and biogeochemistry e g reaction kinetic theories which they argue are at the core of cz functioning and necessary to improve our understanding of and ability to predict earth surface system responses to climate and human forcing these calls for more integrated cz research will require interdisciplinary knowledge exchange and adaptation of concepts beyond discipline specific boundaries adler et al 2021 arora et al 2022b brantley et al 2017 perdrial et al 2015 advancing our understanding of cz functioning at relevant local and global scales also requires addressing the tremendous spatial variability in dominant processes across natural and human impacted landscapes elhacham et al 2020 ellis et al 2021 grant et al 2017 the importance of addressing scaling effects in cz science is easily illustrated when considering the cascading impacts of changes in climate and land cover use on water quality in large watersheds for example the mississippi river starts as a humble 6 m wide knee deep creek in north central minnesota as it flows southward it picks up excessive nutrients from the agricultural and urban landscapes in the center of the continental united states before discharging into the gulf of mexico and creating an expansive dead zone of 16 405 km2 noaa 2021 another example is the yellow river a major drinking water source in china and the second longest in asia that has been suffering from extensive contamination and is now on the verge of becoming unfit for even industrial or agricultural use dwivedi et al 2022a existing czos do not operate at these scales so it is important to consider the representativeness of individual cz sites for larger systems and consider opportunities for cross site synthesis to grasp the impact of spatial variability on downstream conditions further while the scale and complexity of these water quality impacts is daunting large investments have already been made in developing these czo sites which constitute collecting phenomenally diverse and distributed watershed datasets including many associated with autonomous sensing systems it is worthwhile to acknowledge that comparable measurements exist at czos at national and international scales together these datasets share many common attributes but differ by important aspects such as geophysical attributes climatic conditions plant functional types biodiversity inherent complexity e g natural built environment disturbance types e g fire heat wave flooding mining and time since disturbance e g logging insect infestation an international network of watersheds and czos can serve as a vehicle for knowledge exchange integration and scientific discovery strengths of such a network include its ability to detect emergent scale properties of watershed and cz function at local to regional and global scales and provide an in depth understanding of the spatially heterogeneous impact of disturbances on watershed function 1 3 where are critical zone observatories located as suggested above these czos are located worldwide fig 1 however these individual sites have traditionally operated in silos with frequent emphasis on their specific design regional setting and priority science questions that have resulted in customized data collection theories and modeling approaches arora et al 2021 brantley et al 2021 lesmes et al 2020 while there is a wide diversity of sites fig 1 a common challenge across these sites is to understand and predict how sustainable or vulnerable these habitats and associated services are in the face of compounding and co occurring climatic disturbances and rapidly growing population industrialization and urbanization many of these czos belong to a larger network e g doe watersheds czcn ozcar tereno that were designed with specific strategic goals however there are many sites including those not listed on this map that are well established e g long term interdisciplinary indigenous community led but not formally part of a funded network and therefore lacking in aspects that promote data sharing cross site comparisons there is room to advocate for both individual and larger scale czo network development and network of networks for example there is significant underrepresentation of the intertropical belt among the established czos fig 1 although this latitudinal range harbors over half of the world population two thirds of the terrestrial plant biomass chapin et al 2002 and may face some of the most dramatic impacts of ongoing global changes mamalakis et al 2021 connecting individual sites in a network of networks fashion in the inter tropical belt is likely to be impactful in transforming our understanding of cz functioning in these regions based on this assessment we first present an overview of where the lack of a network of networks organization comes at a substantial cost to the cz community through missed opportunities to address scientific challenges section 2 we then describe existing cross site cross network initiatives and where these initiatives are urgently needed section 3 in the same spirit we list available and emerging synthesis tools and techniques that provide a springboard for new modes of collaboration section 4 we then summarize the challenges within the context of implementing a network of networks model section 5 in the same section we also highlight community debates regarding the need to integrate human and social perspectives in cz science section 5 2 we identify three areas of greatest need in order to achieve higher rates of data sharing and reuse under a network of networks framework open and standardized metadata guidelines data harmonization and a new class of cz information scientists section 6 1 we suggest specific guidance for addressing these needs and describe the principles for enhancing cross site and cross network collaborations in the cz section 6 2 the proposed network of networks model is expected to promote synthesis integration activities across cz networks develop transferable tools data and workflows train next generation of cz scientists open new sources of funding build personal connections and human to human interaction as well as engage cz site managers and relevant stakeholders the network of networks setup is presented as a framework for improving how human management decisions and adaptation strategies impact cz functioning at a global scale informing policy development and enabling socio ecological innovations section 6 2 the paper concludes with a recommendation to develop an open inclusive international network of networks framework that promotes the use of the best available science to address the most pressing challenges of the cz section 7 2 the need for a radical collaboration across czos the czo concept has been successful in integrating across diverse and distributed measurements for the purposes of understanding the complex and tightly coupled interactions of hydrological biogeochemical geological microbiological and ecological processes at an intensively monitored site anderson et al 2008 kulmala 2018 however czos require massive investment and coordination between dozens of scientists to gain this in depth understanding guo and lin 2016 moreover the technologies needed to observe key ecosystem fluxes directly including evapotranspiration and greenhouse gas fluxes e g fluxnet pastorello et al 2020 and indirectly such as biogeochemical transformations and nutrient uptake e g nutnet adler et al 2011 often need to be observed at very fine spatial scales e g 0 01 km2 baldocchi et al 2001 or in situ morin et al 2017 petrescu et al 2015 as such the knowledge obtained from czos is challenging to apply directly to the large areas we seek to manage and or protect for example the mississippi basin or the yellow river beyond the spatial context that is critical for underpinning resource management decisions co occurring and compounding disturbances are testing the resilience of cz and watersheds in new and poorly understood ways natural and anthropogenic forms of disturbance are pushing these systems to tipping points beyond which many previously stationary environmental rates including rates of erosion and sediment control groundwater recharge contaminant mitigation and associated microbial and ecological processing among others are rapidly changing e g mcdowell et al 2008 newcomer et al 2021 wohl 2013 this has had devastating effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services in the cz díaz et al 2019 co occurring disturbances such as water and resource extraction combined with widespread drought are leaving little for ecological communities while compound disturbances are exacerbating soil fertility and water quality issues recent reports from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2021 stress a clear urgency to understand how natural systems including cz and watersheds will respond to disturbance models predict that the global water cycle will intensify under a warming climate where for each 1 c rise in temperature global precipitation is projected to increase approximately 1 3 ipcc 2013 roque malo and kumar 2017 however this increase is not expected to be uniform across latitudes or seasons xie et al 2015 by integrating information from several czos we can answer questions about how multiple processes are coupled how they vary across broad gradients and how they respond to disturbance e g gaillardet et al 2018 for instance a large river basin like the mississippi basin is typically studied through czos that occupy a tiny proportion of its area through traditional modes of inquiry this implies that the community has assembled a substantial body of observations and process specific interpretations that are relevant to the intensely monitored czo site s however we are still lacking a unified conceptual framework that can translate this knowledge into transferable and generalizable concepts but working across czo networks for example in france and germany in addition to the mississippi basin czos could yield a detailed understanding of how diverse environments function and respond to future disturbances at the very least such an approach would enable unifying data theories and models across czos and disturbance events with the capacity to test hypotheses across a larger parameter space than would be possible within any single czo it is precisely this rationale that underpins the development of czo networks and its logical extension is that coordination across networks is needed as greater scales are to be assessed considering the presence of pre existing networks of czos usually maintained by a particular national government and focused largely within its territory it follows that a continental to global focus of inquiry requires some degree of working across these already established networks the global ecosystem research infrastructure geri loescher et al 2022 which collaborates with five major ecosystem research infrastructures around the globe neon north america elter europe icos europe tern australia cern asia and saeon africa is a good example of an established network of networks further there have been calls for an integrated earth observatory e g kulmala 2018 as the best means to address global problems such as climate change however it is important to recognize that such an effort requires detailed ground data including but not limited to soil properties nutrient stocks and transformations carbon pools and transformations and microbial functioning to constrain processes such as greenhouse gas fluxes nutrient transformations and hydrological processes arora et al 2016 vicca et al 2018 jansson and hofmockel 2020 as well as assessing the response to disturbance graham et al 2021 grant et al 2019 providing such data will require a global coordinated effort and is likely to require working across networks of czos integrating and collaborating across these observatories and networks also becomes increasingly indispensable for understanding how cz might behave under conditions substantially different from the present ones for example in a microbial context an outstanding science question is to understand to what degree the response of a microbial community to a disturbance is ecosystem limited and can the response be generalized as a functional trait that could then be used to make predictions and management decisions regarding future events if microbial datasets are collected in standardized ways across the global cz these data types can be used to reveal generalizable patterns rules concepts and theories tied to a broad range of microbial properties related to ecology e g large scale diversity gradients evolution e g processes governing strain variation and function e g microbial food webs structured by metabolite exchange taking a coordinated approach spanning czos will dramatically accelerate the pursuit of generalizable or transferable knowledge which is essential to develop predictive models e g earth system models that are ultimately tied to developing solutions to sustainably manage ecosystems following disturbance more generally working across networks of czos can help test the generality of concepts and hypotheses e g jansson and hofmockel 2020 and generate new hypotheses for further evaluation via modeling and targeted data generation 3 opportunities to conduct cross site cross network science 3 1 examples of existing cross site initiatives although limited in number recent studies that are targeting data from multiple international sites are far reaching and already creating paradigm shifts in our understanding of watershed and cz functioning e g tiegs et al 2019 migliavacca et al 2021 as an example a global analysis of intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams spanning more than 200 dry riverbeds across major environmental gradients and climate zones is providing important insights on terrestrial plant litter dynamics datry et al 2018 another example is a global low cost analysis using household tea bags known as the teacomposition initiative to elucidate microbial carbon cycling across ecosystems and climatic regions djukic et al 2021 there are also significant emerging efforts focused on collecting extensive observations of hydroclimatic microbial and hydrologic variables across diverse environments e g chosen whondrs zhang et al 2021 stegen and goldman 2018 a recent study by ward et al 2022 further demonstrates the power of prodding such extensive datasets using machine learning approaches focused on river corridor science their study uncovered relationships that would not have been possible through traditional deductive approaches to science however we must recognize that cross site initiatives and data gathering efforts that cover a large spatial domain but do not provide a holistic interdisciplinary view of cz processes may not be enough to advance cz science for instance the nsf has taken a step to address this challenge by reorganizing their czo program to develop 10 new critical zone collaborative networks czcns that all but one focus on science hypothesis driven research across multiple national cz sites the last czcn funding supports the development of a network coordinating hub although limited to the national scale these multi site investigations and hub are expected to not only improve our understanding of cz dynamics but also provide a platform to facilitate exchange of data information and learning opportunities for cz scientists and students alike with this in mind outcomes from globally distributed efforts like intermittent rivers chosen whondrs and the teacomposition initiative as well as nsf led national efforts can be powerful catalysts for further cross network integration and coordination 3 2 opportunities for new cross network synthesis identified through cz community discussions below we highlight some increasingly urgent science questions that could benefit from cross site and cross network collaborations these are assembled from a recent cyberseminar series cuahsi 2021a showcasing czos across bioclimatic settings key science questions being addressed at each czo and perceptual models developed at each site that could be tested across a diversity of czo sites to improve process understanding table 1 these encompass montane alpine and arctic managed and agricultural drought and wildfire impacted as well as lake wetland and stream environments as would be obvious there are opportunities for improved understanding of cz processes in landscapes not described here or discussed during the cyberseminar series to expand on this further the next section section 3 3 describes these outstanding opportunities with an acute focus on urban landscapes 3 3 other examples of outstanding cz related challenges although not explicitly discussed during the 2021 cuahsi cyberseminar series or described in table 1 there are opportunities for improved understanding of cz processes in other landscapes undergoing rapid and drastic change for example tropical forested landscapes urban areas especially those along coastlines intermittent river and variably inundated settings below we take the example of urban landscapes to illustrate how we could benefit from a concerted effort to generate and test hypotheses through synthesizing and analyzing information across a variety of sites and networks as shown in fig 1 urban landscapes can be classified as developed high land cover according to national land cover database dewitz and u s geological survey 2021 which includes 4 sites eel river czo central arizona phoenix lter baltimore ecosystem study and plum island ecosystem lter and as developed low that includes 17 additional sites more recently the nsf czcn funding was awarded to develop an urban cz cluster spanning four cities in the u s east coast philadelphia baltimore washington d c and raleigh weniger et al 2021 the north south gradient these sites fall along captures climatic trends and urban development trends i e older and denser development in philadelphia and baltimore to newer and sparser development in raleigh this urban cz cluster is focused on addressing the drivers of solute export dynamics in urban areas including the potential importance of climate urban density underlying geology and the unique hydrological functioning of urban landscapes the ozcar network in france also has several urban impacted sites including fontaine de vaucluse near nîmes the othu yzeron site near lyon and the osuna irstv onevu site near nantes urban research catchment sites that are not part of an existing cz network also exist for example the black creek research catchment in toronto canada and a number of urban impacted catchments across berlin germany kuhlemann et al 2020 kuhlemann et al 2022 which have both been used to deepen our understanding of water ages and their relationship to solute transport in urban streams across these sites many unanswered research questions related to the impacts of urban development on cz processes have emerged for example the role of pervious areas e g lawns parks brownfields riparian areas in the transport of water and solutes to receiving waters ariano and oswald 2022 as well as spatial and temporal variability in greenhouse gas fluxes is starting to receive more attention notable in urban pervious areas is the heterogeneity of urban soils due to human disturbance e g construction activities compaction the influence of these patterns on pollutant sources and transport and the success of urban vegetation deserves additional attention there is also an emerging interest in quantifying the ecohydrological partitioning of precipitation into blue fluxes and green fluxes in urban greenspaces gillefalk et al 2022 marx et al 2022 and the role of different vegetation species which are usually heavily managed on these fluxes investigations into the dominant biogeochemical processes facilitating the mobilization of contaminants of emerging concern e g plastics plastic associated contaminants pharmaceuticals which are often concentrated in areas with high population density are also increasing kaushal et al 2020 fork et al 2021 werbowski et al 2021 the role of wastewater as a pathway for contaminants of emerging concern to enter surface waters and the impacts of wastewater contributions on stream biogeochemical processing in general are of interest while many of these lines of inquiry could be investigated within a single czo or research catchment there are clear benefits to addressing these questions across networks and urban cz sites there are fundamental differences in the materials and plans of cities including the types of infrastructure in place and management practices which may have an outsized impact on the importance of these processes for example older cities may have more degraded sewer infrastructure which could lead to more wastewater inputs to surface water systems although we could examine how urban cz processes are impacted across climatic gradients in a manner similar to any cross site cross network study here we have the opportunity to prioritize examining gradients of urbanization e g there may be different processes occurring in areas with low levels of urban land cover versus heavily urbanized areas since urban cz science has not been a traditional priority i e it is atypical to have as many urban sites in one country as the u s or france leveraging measurements across multiple sites is advantageous for inferring process from pattern other outstanding overarching cz research questions include how do different cz watershed sites respond to similar compound and co occurring disturbances what determines differences in site responses to similar disturbances how does environmental history modulate these responses to what extent are model machine learning parameters transferable to untested sites and unforeseen conditions what tools exist to make the data more accessible and open for cross site cross network comparisons 4 available and emerging synthesis tools and techniques in this section we focus on highlighting available and emerging tools and techniques for cross site cross network science that were identified by seminar participants in a second cuahsi cyberseminar series cuahsi 2021b 4 1 existing and emerging frameworks and platforms for successful data synthesis as suggested above there now exist a few albeit limited studies targeting global standardized experiments and developing flexible tools with data from multiple international sites crucial enablers of such synthesis activities are existing and emerging interoperable portals for browsing sharing publishing and analyzing cz data these include the cuahsi hydroclient https data cuahsi org and hydroshare https hydroshare org portals the global scale ozcar theia data portal braud et al 2020 https in situ theia land fr the tereno data discovery portal https ddp tereno net ddp the department of energy s ess dive portal on watershed and instrumented sites https ess dive lbl gov or the macrosheds portal for us stream and watershed data https cuahsi shinyapps io macrosheds the latter also includes tools for training models with hosted datasets another example is the datastream portal hosted by the gordon foundation https gordonfoundation ca initiatives datastream which makes it easy to share and access water quality data a more extensive listing of existing regional and international data portals is provided in table 2 we recognize that the highly distributed nature of cz data repositories as is evident from table 2 can require substantial efforts in ensuring data access and discovery in section 6 1 1 we make recommendations on how to make these data easily and automatically accessible and discoverable through a global catalog of cz data stores across networks however efforts to institute a data collection or storage standard will likely have the effect of stifling innovation in cz science while also becoming unwieldy rather than standardize data collection or storage we argue for the development of shared metadata template s these must be developed as a community effort and would enable more efficient but flexible data storage collection and discovery see section 6 1 1 for further details online infrastructures integrating models and data analyses are emerging as well from large platforms such as the ideas watersheds software ecosystem https ideas productivity org ideas watersheds which comprises workflow tools interface libraries and a variety of codes for reactive transport hydrological or land surface modeling all the way to specific toolboxes such as bridget https github com kit hyd bridget for comparing and scaling evapotranspiration estimates beyond existing portals synthesis activities have been focused on curating specific cz data from a variety of sites successful examples of such activities include the soil water infiltration global swig database which includes more than 5000 infiltration curves covering all continents with an acute focus on developing evaluating and validating infiltration processes across a range of models rahmati et al 2018 in the united states the chosen comprehensive hydrologic observatory sensor network is a database of streamflow soil moisture and other hydroclimatic and hydrologic variables a comparative analysis of which highlighted complex patterns in hydrological extremes across different us regions thereby advocating for long term observatories zhang et al 2021 other efforts focused on global datasets of high dimensional high resolution microbial properties and processes across diverse cz environments are also emerging in this regard the worldwide hydrobiogeochemistry observation network for dynamic river systems whondrs has been carrying out crowdsourced sampling campaigns that span numerous networks and countries though significant global gaps remain stegen and goldman 2018 in this campaign the microbial data once fully available can provide a foundation to elucidate organizing principles governing spatial and temporal patterns in microbial composition e g which microbes are where and function e g what genes are expressed before after disturbance these microbe oriented questions are particularly important in the cz and earth system functioning at large as microbes are primary catalysts for organic matter transformations tied to greenhouse gas production and global biogeochemical cycles such data collection and integration efforts are important for bridging scales as they can provide standardized and transferable insights across the globe 4 2 state of the art tools and techniques for reducing complexity beyond data integration portals and frameworks conducting synthesis crucially relies on translating complex cz information into a compelling scientific narrative one approach to reducing complexity in studied systems even more so across a large array of observation sites is to use dimensionless numbers this is because dimensionless numbers have the potential to collapse the scatter in data highlight scale invariance express the competition between processes and allow for comparing datasets model outputs and or locations with different characteristic ranges classical examples include the reynolds number in fluid dynamics abraham 1970 the combination of the dryness and evaporative indices both dimensionless in the budyko curve in hydroclimatology e g berghuijs et al 2014 the damkhöler number in reactive transport or the hillslope number in hydrology e g brutsaert 1994 berne et al 2005 a related approach to reducing complexity in studied systems relies on a mix of hydrological or biogeochemical ecological climatic signatures for instance braud et al 2021 used a number of hydrological signatures such as baseflow index flow duration curve slope and event recession curve indices together with a cluster analysis to classify ozcar sites across four continents their approach was quite scalable and would be straightforward to apply to even larger networks of data and has the potential to allow fairly broad classifications of catchments based on function in a separate cross site study ross et al 2021 used the idea of hydrological thresholds of intensity and storage to analyze 21 catchments across the us canada australia and new zealand in particular they identified thresholds in runoff response at all but one catchment and concluded that threshold behavior can be one basis of studying a large number of catchments another approach builds on the idea of using stream properties e g solutes concentrations as a proxy for upstream cz structure and processes with the most widely used approach being the concentration discharge c q relationship where river discharge rate q reflects different cz compartments mobilized e g gaillardet et al 1999 stewart et al 2022 rather than absolute solute concentration or river discharge one can use the relationship between the two or with dimensionless numbers such as concentration ratios or even their derivatives differential c q analysis arora et al 2020 to collapse data scattering and reflect cz functioning but more importantly to facilitate synthesis and hypothesis testing across diverse observatories some of these non exclusive approaches can further track the transient nature of underlying cz processes both in time hot moments and space hot spots within the studied landscape and time periods using dedicated methods such as wavelets and wavelet entropy analysis e g arora et al 2019 grande et al 2022 cross cz synthesis efforts may also benefit from overcoming small scale paradigms as only very few out of various candidate cz processes may actually play a role at larger scales or explain inter site variability e g adler et al 2021 data analysis methods aimed at dimensionality reduction e g principal component analysis isometric feature mapping can be a path forward to identifying these key drivers or processes e g schilli et al 2010 on soil solution characterization or wlostowski et al 2021 on hydrological signatures these data analysis techniques have been increasingly combined with or paralleled by machine learning ml techniques e g zhi et al 2021 which allow for cz drivers and patterns to be identified with minimal a priori knowledge if sufficient data points are available ml is often considered to be more flexible than other approaches as it does not need all data to be rigidly collected with the same frame dwivedi et al 2022b varadharajan et al 2022 its application in cz science is still in its infancy notably due to significant challenges such as the interpretability and physical consistency of ml models the need to include complexity and uncertainty of training data in ml models and the enormous computational resources needed in many ml applications reichstein et al 2019 sahu et al 2020 burdett and wellen 2022 for example burdett and wellen 2022 found that while ml approaches outperformed more conventional statistical techniques in the prediction of crop yield from soil properties an attempt to quantify the most important factors for prediction revealed substantial uncertainty while the two predictors with the highest level of variable importance in a random forest model alone were able to achieve very strong fits to the crop yield data a model nearly as strong was assembled from the three variables of lowest importance however ml is a fast growing field of research and some of these challenges are already being addressed for instance hybrid methods are increasingly being applied such as differential parameter learning where the training focuses on calibrating the parameters of a process based model efficiently yielding spatially and physically coherent parameter configurations for distributed simulations tsai et al 2021 the need for synthesis studies and cross site cz analyses have also promoted the search for reliable proxies where data gaps exist for instance electrical conductivity ec is often used as a proxy for chloride concentrations in urban systems allowing a continuous record to be reliably derived from a relatively small number of grab samples moore et al 2019 the mechanisms for why ec influences chloride so consistently are well established at very high cl concentrations the cl contributed from road deicers is the main source of ionic strength cooper et al 2014 other proxies for chemical constituents have a much less consistently reliable relation with important variables for instance fdom fluorescent dissolved organic matter sensors allow dissolved organic carbon doc to be monitored but often corrections are required to account for turbidity temperature and other important variables downing et al 2012 turbidity sensors often have strong relationships with total suspended solids and total phosphorus and often reasonable relationships with dissolved phosphorus but the strength of these relationships varies substantially even in areas with similar climate and geology e g biagi et al 2022 robertson et al 2018 ross et al 2022 presumably the details of the erosional processes and also the biogeochemistry dictate this relationship a widespread network effort could provide a mechanistic understanding of why certain sensors are reliable proxies for water quality parameters in some catchments but not others and could help manage expectations of sensors e g rode et al 2016 a host of other sensors are used to monitor various cz processes e g soil moisture snowfall precipitation vegetation cover phenocam sonnentag et al 2012 water quality and others previous intercomparison studies have reported significant variability across sensors when different sensors are sensing the same variable in the same place e g soil moisture jackisch et al 2020 snowfall kochendorfer et al 2022 as such a large distributed sensor intercomparison study would be necessary when integrating data across many sites and instrument to instrument conversion factors may be estimated such a study would also be quite informative for research that relied on a specific sensor as they would have a sense of how specific their results are to the sensor they used furthermore working across czos allows us to evaluate the applicability of sensing technologies for earth science monitoring e g drones in situ gravimetry air borne cosmic ray neutron sensing weighable high precision lysimeter eddy covariance in situ isotopic tracing fiber optic installations environmental dna and omics to other contexts e g mining urban planning wildlife monitoring medical sciences 4 3 examples of bringing cz science into the anthropocene there has been a broad recognition that we have entered into the anthropocene the era of human domination of earth s ecosystems lewis and maslin 2015 vitousek et al 1997 accordingly there is a need to better understand how environmental science generally and cz science specifically can better ask and answer questions related to human environment interaction our final cyberseminar cuahsi 2021b addressed exactly this question abbott et al 2019a talked about the centrality of human interaction in the water cycle and contrasted this centrality with the typically pristine representation of the global water cycle in literature including scientific literature for instance human water appropriation equals about half of global river discharge yet only 15 of water cycle diagrams depict this interaction abbott et al 2019b in fact the icon for the cznet program in the us shows no human influences despite a number of cz sites being located in areas of intense human activity agricultural or urban areas given that such diagrams are a point of entry to cz for many people both inside and outside of academia recognizing and correcting this misrepresentation is an important step towards awareness and equitable development in the anthropocene while efforts in this direction have included updated diagrams on the websites of the australian czo network https www tern org au critical zone and the ozcar theia data portal https www theia land fr theiaozcar un portail unique dedie aux donnees dobservation in situ only recently did the u s geological survey provide a radical update for its classic diagram of the water cycle this time with humans as showrunners duncombe 2022 taking this viewpoint further other cyberseminar participants talked about the importance of societal engagement and design approaches in cz science in particular arènes et al 2018 highlighted that the cz depiction to the general public is in the form of planetary view of the earth made familiar since the time of the scientific revolution and reinforced by the iconic image of the blue planet grevsmühl 2014 their work therefore tried to develop a different visual representation that captured the complex heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the cz to faithfully target practitioners and stakeholders that cz scientists try to address through their science they approached this through a unique collaboration between an architect a sociologist engaged in the cz field and a geochemist who heads the czo network in france this work has since been further extended into a book involving two architects and a science historian aït touati et al 2019 and a museum installation that mimics a cz observatory in strengbach in france at a scale of 1 80 to adequately describe the design of the czos https critical zones zkm de other examples of alternative representations of natural environments and processes following the same philosophical viewpoint are recent works from the monsoon research group mapping rain http monass org bremner 2021 the forensic architecture tracing chemicals in the atmosphere https forensic architecture org and the italian limes following the moving border across italy s glaciers http www italianlimes net other ways of societal engagement include design thinking which includes a work process that puts users first and works through an iterative process designed to understand users and their problems prototype solutions test them and iterate to arrive at better solutions liedtka 2015 goi and tan 2021 suggested that design thinking must entail a deep understanding of the perspective of those it is aimed at and thereby could lead to more inclusive social innovations that involve stakeholders from various backgrounds their work also highlights the key role played by empathy with the example of constructing a map with audio guide to promote ena city and its noren split curtains as japanese culture finally marie toussaint highlighted the importance of ecocide and the importance of ensuring that human interaction with ecosystems is done in a way that allows ecosystems to renew themselves cuahsi 2021b toussaint also highlighted that people who work directly with nature e g farmers hunters indigenous peoples know a lot about nature involving such people in czo site selection priority setting and experimental design could be quite valuable 5 challenges to a network of networks model 5 1 insights from community feedback to gather community inputs on the challenges and opportunities to conduct cz synthesis and integration activities we designed an online survey questionnaire the explicit goal of the survey was to identify define and provide a stimulus for initiating integration and exchange of data tools models and frameworks that enable cross site cross network analyses the survey was conducted on a voluntary basis with participants from different czo networks and single czos fig 1 a survey questions included available tools simulation codes and openly available data as well as perceived challenges associated with synthesizing across diverse cz sites we received a total of 130 responses from across czo sites and networks fig 2 a with respondents working across different agencies institutions and disciplines based on this feedback we identified several pressing needs and challenges that the cz community are tackling related to integration and open sharing along with those pressing needs and challenges the survey also highlighted what appeared to be major obstacles to the construction of cross site cross network collaboration fig 2 b cz respondents felt that key barriers to collaboration included missing data harmonization data access availability and lack of funding additional obstacles were identified as the lack of human connection and the environmental cost the time needed to build a trusting collaboration parachute science and environmental justice issues were identified as other obstacles below we describe in detail on how these obstacles constitute legitimate concerns for network of networks synthesis activities and solutions or partial solutions to navigating these concerns survey participants identified ease of access to data from across cz networks and harmonizing those data as key requirements for successful intercomparison of results across networks sites time periods and techniques however the accuracy and implementation of data collection techniques and tools vary depending on numerous aspects such as czo type the goal of the intercomparison study and practical field constraints while there are existing examples of data harmonization e g wieder et al 2021 and existing portals of data targeting cz research see section 4 1 an increasing emphasis on standardized data collection protocols commonly agreed upon data harmonization strategy and developments in cyberinfrastructure tools could significantly enhance opportunities for data discovery and cross site cross network collaborations another obstacle to cross site cross network collaboration was highlighted as the lack of availability accessibility or existence of funding to support international collaborations while not abundant some funding resources do exist classic examples that support such activities include the powell center and lter synthesis proposals other examples include the berkeley france fund https fbf berkeley edu or the german academic exchange service through daad https www daad de en but these resources are limited to network exchange only some funding resources while available are restricted to specific disciplines such as idiv for biology science https www idiv de en or techniques such as eddy covariance through the fluxnet network https fluxnet org in countries where a formal czo funding source is itself lacking e g canada it can be even more difficult to look for funding for international collaborations given this background it is evident that the cz community needs to advocate for an international cross site cross network collaboration funded at a global scale as is the case for the iodp international ocean discovery program https www iodp org and the icdp international continental drilling program https www icdp online org home examples of other funding setups include i the european funded cost actions an example is the water isotopes in the critical zone watson https watson cost eu which focuses on building a european community around isotope enabled tracking of water pathways in the cz it fosters knowledge exchange and new insights through a funding short stays for visiting scholars and recurring workshops b encouraging building collaborative data portals and c linking functional and spatial scales ii for arctic ecosystems and more widely alpine subarctic ecosystems the interact network can be used to fund field trip to stations over the northern hemisphere but they also offer remote and virtual access to over 89 terrestrial field bases https eu interact org iii the erc synergy grants https erc europa eu funding synergy grants can go up to 10 m over 6 years and involve one non eu co pi while elements of collaboration and coordination can be achieved through these funding setups we believe that the reach of the current cz networks and the extent of scientific exchange could be vastly improved through a global network of network setup such programs could fulfill the urgent need for international funding to support cz synthesis integration activities at a worldwide scale beyond the monetary and science based obstacles the survey also raised the fact that building a collaboration demands human to human interaction such interaction would promote interest in developing cross cutting science questions that go beyond a single site and prompt discussions on transferability and interoperability of tools data collection techniques and modeling frameworks it is important to recognize that while social interactions can be easy in this day and age developing personal connections can prove to be time consuming and environmentally costly for a socially inclusive global network of networks setup that promotes in person interactions navigating the environmental cost of travel can be a significant concern and this leads back to the need to advocate for an international collaboration funded at a global scale that supports this kind of expenditure but also promotes medium to long term engagement from relevant stakeholders communities and nonscientific experts to come together to understand and address cz challenges this solution could also partially address the still existing problem of parachute science occurring mostly in lower income countries stefanoudis et al 2021 and could entail a mandatory linking of external collaborators of the sites to the native collaborators for any experiments building skills and valorization of works conference article etc 5 2 integrating social science with cz research although not explicitly addressed through the survey we believe that a close integration of social science with cz science is critical to answering the most pressing challenges in cz research because czos involve human habitats and human impacted areas the need and establishment of a cross site cross network collaboration should be used as an opportunity to intentionally and tightly integrate social sciences with cz sciences barriers to such an integration have been highlighted as a combination of a lack of formal criteria emphasizing disciplinary research cultural and career barriers lack of linkage to industry a conservative educational system and lack of strategic focus by universities holm et al 2013 in fact holm et al 2013 argue for a revolution in education and capacity building that is deemed necessary in response to urgent environmental and social challenges indeed there is increasing scientific evidence that human migration black et al 2011 or social collapse can be due in whole zheng et al 2014 or in part shaw 2003 to environmental changes in the cz scheffer 2009 in tandem an increasing number of ipcc reports are highlighting the impacts of climate change on human society ipcc 2001 2007 2014 2022 etc moreover recent decades have highlighted that scientific understandings have often been poorly reflected in public policy and sometimes disregarded entirely when solely using a supply side model of science oreskes 2022 together these lines of evidence suggest an urgent need for integrating cz research with human and social sciences the human and social sciences encompass many disciplines but in the case of integration with the cz a first level of integration should at a minimum include sociology such as linkages with demographics and anthropological studies political science to integrate with public management aspects economics and geographical science e g studies of climate change impacts on the economics of societies and human migration as well as human science such as history and archeology to further this integration such cross disciplinary studies should be embedded in education programs an example of such integration is the earth politics center created in paris in the fall of 2019 that aims to address the complex issues of the anthropocene by the convergence of natural and experimental sciences with the human and social sciences https u paris fr centre politiques terre en the earth politics center likewise there is emerging interest in community perceptions and attitudes to environmental change to promote communication of critical resources within the cz and improve adaptive capacity for example grunblatt and alessa 2017 compared science based assessment of environmental changes to society s perceived notion of it and showed diverse individual notions regarding the impact of humans on climate change but more importantly grunblatt and alessa 2017 argued that these perceived notions can be changed through inclusive dialogue and engagement an example where such dialogue is being facilitated is in a project called sentinelles des alpes set up by the zone atelier alpes observation and research facility in france that specifically partners social researchers with local actors such as mountain guides alpine hut keepers and or regional parks workers the project allows the sharing of experiences around important issues and the identification of potential avenues for synergies both in terms of research questions and more methodological aspects across 5 mountain socio ecosystems each led by a researcher and a local actor this project resulted in a communication video to raise awareness on these alpine systems which is also accessible to the general public http www za alpes org le programme sentinelles des alpes an example of where such human dialogue and connection will be important is urban cz science including human dialogue in cz science will allow us to question how humans and nature interact whether new metrics ought to be sought and what kinds of corresponding data should be collected about human activities in specific cz areas such as urban sites it therefore clearly appears that in the current context of a society totally dependent on inevitable climate and environmental changes the inclusion of human sciences as part of the cz science is essential 6 the path forward 6 1 principles for enhancing cross site cross network collaboration in the cz in this section we highlight the most important needs for enhancing integration synthesis activities in the cz as identified through the cyberseminar series and community feedback 1 the need for open standardized global metadata 2 the need for more efforts on data harmonization and 3 the need for a new class of cz data scientists going beyond technical innovations and towards collaborations in the cz community our main recommendation is to develop an open inclusive international network of networks framework that promotes the use of the best available science to address the most pressing challenges of the cz 6 1 1 the need for global metadata for cz science ensuring cross site cross network cz collaboration will require a number of technical innovations that have already begun but require significant additional developments to help bring about open and networked science specifically workflows are needed that enable data to be discovered accessed and harmonized data discovery refers to the ability to locate and understand data sets that exist while access refers to the ability to obtain these datasets in section 4 1 we enumerated many cz networks that made data available and each one enables discovery across its own network more and more of these networks structure their workflow and data life cycle requirements to make used data fair findable accessible interoperable reusable the existing data portals work quite well when seeking to access data within one network however when integrating data across multiple networks the existing approach is quite cumbersome as one must learn the terminology interface and other aspects of every individual network moreover data integration is particularly challenging in the highly multidisciplinary field of cz science due to the inherent diversity of the data that may be combined in a single portal in both type climate ecology geochemistry genomics etc and associated spatio temporal scales see for example table 2 given this background it is obvious that some kind of global catalog of networks is needed and for this to be developed some agreement on a harmonized metadata template is needed this calls for having extensive metadata associated with the databases ideally built in from the start in a robust data management plan to avoid unforeseen discrepancies as the database grows in practice this implies making metadata generation and upload easy and user friendly for data uploaders and fair and open for the targeted users though not explicitly included in fair principles the use of digital object identifiers dois for datasets and published algorithms has been an oft mentioned need as well cuahsi 2021a 2021b dois allow resources such as data or code to be unambiguously identified and cited enabling much more transparency in research within and across networks 6 1 2 the need for semantics to power data harmonization data discovery is simply a first step of working across networks a much more difficult issue and one that arguably has not been addressed as well as discovery is that of harmonization harmonization refers to taking data sets from a number of different sources and having them conform to a particular schema for a particular purpose barriers to cz data harmonization were discussed in detail in the second cuahsi cyberseminar series cuahsi 2021b todd brown et al 2022 reported on an interview study with eight research group leaders who had constructed harmonized soil carbon datasets from pre existing data they found that while discovery tools were quite useful and available there were virtually none dedicated to data harmonization harmonization was usually accomplished in a manual ad hoc manner which proved to be quite labor intensive error prone and constituted no data provenance detailed explanation of how the harmonized data was sourced from primary measurements the data model that each group settled on for harmonized data tended to be dependent on the question they asked this suggests that it is unrealistic to have a single data template or schema even for soil carbon work let alone for cz research these results suggest the need for more research into data harmonization in cz science a generalized approach to data harmonization proved to be quite useful as shown in the sodah project wieder et al 2021 where raw soil carbon data were annotated with a generalized metadata template such a generalized template allowed data to be mapped from whatever format they were collected into to a format useful for a specific aggregated analysis avoiding the need for a universal data storage schema however the specific templates employed in sodah were focused on soil carbon different questions and different source data may require a revisit to the templates used should an approach similar to sodah be implemented more broadly these lessons learned in the soils field are likely to apply to the wider field of cz science if international cz networks become linked together we will need to develop ways to harmonize data across multiple schemas for instance the theia ozcar network has opted to use a specific database schema for data across its network braud et al 2020 it is quite possible that should a researcher wish to integrate ozcar data with any other network s data they would encounter harmonization difficulties similar to those encountered by todd brown s 2022 interviewees as a solution to this tower of babel problem when working across disciplines researchers have advocated for the use of formal ontologies e g sieber et al 2011 formal ontologies encode the domain knowledge of a community into a set of logical statements using classes properties and instances uschold and gruninger 1996 importantly formal ontologies are machine processable and can be used for discovery and harmonization sieber et al 2011 show how formal ontologies can be used for data discovery and harmonization to some extent across multiple databases of chinese history wellen and sieber 2013 question the use of formal ontologies of earth features due to significant natural language differences of those features however in a more restrictive context of sharing and harmonizing data across cz networks formal ontologies may be a useful tool nascent examples of such an ontology exist for instance the open biological and biomedical ontology obo foundry has an environment ontology envo buttigieg et al 2016 but it was not created to help scientists collaborate and is likely too broad for the purposes of cz synthesis integration activities nasa s jet propulsion laboratory has created an ontology of earth science concepts called sweet semantic web for earth and environment technology digiuseppe et al 2014 that might be a promising start to a community ontology to enable data sharing and harmonization across cz networks future research is needed to examine whether formal ontologies are appropriate underpinnings for data harmonization tools or whether a schema driven approach such as the sodah project might be more appropriate or whether other avenues may be needed 6 1 3 towards a new class of cz information scientists given that data harmonization and integration were identified as a bottleneck for any cz synthesis effort and the highly multidisciplinary field of cz science the cyberseminar series cuahsi 2021b clearly highlighted the need for a new class of cz information scientists this meant involving scientist users in a hands on way in the design process of the data portals working hand in hand with the database professionals to make sure that technical proficiency meets the users needs community feedback from the survey further implied looking beyond researchers and actively engaging database users and creators such as data scientists managers and state agencies such synergies are expected to better connect long term data portals with short term and or project based data collection and may even incentivize data rescue i e merging and harmonizing existing sparse records into a long term dataset meeting the aforementioned standards in the long term cz science as a community of practice should integrate more advanced data literacy training for students and early career researchers a move in this direction will help to develop a new generation of cz scientists with a more holistic skillset 6 1 4 an open international network of networks framework as a way forward to sustain cz science into the future we need an open inclusive international network of networks framework that helps overcome some of the issues that limit our progress such a framework is expected to not only promote synthesis integration activities across cz networks but also open new sources of funding build personal connections and human to human interaction as well as engage cz site managers and stakeholders at a level not previously accomplished the inclusive and open nature of such a network is expected to better address inequalities in the sciences such as gender e g ranganathan et al 2021 and ethnic and racial diversity e g bernard and cooperdock 2018 and improve the representation of women of color and white women in these fields as well as promote ethnic and racial diversity networking with diverse stakeholders e g women in science underrepresented communities is not only intended to create awareness regarding diverse needs but to build partnerships that potentially contribute to more innovative ways of coordinating and sharing research but perhaps more importantly such a network is expected to leave behind a multigenerational legacy by training educating and mentoring future cz scientists and act as a host for transferable tools data and workflows fig 3 training for students and early career researchers as well as sharing of educational resources within this networking framework will be instrumental in propagating the novel tools data and workflows developed herein we expect such cross network activities to at a minimum enable sharing of education materials enhance engagement in cross country citizen science projects and increase participation in international summer schools consequently a network based approach is expected to enhance interpersonal interactions and establish career spanning collegial relationships and friendships the power of such a network lies in its ability to mobilize people and further empower cz students early careers and scientists to pursue the pathbreaking questions that address the most complex as well as socially relevant problems of our time one approach to facilitating a global network of networks framework is through the use of icon science principles these principles focus on the intentional design of research efforts to be integrated across disciplines and scales coordinated through the use of consistent methods open throughout the research lifecycle including publication of fair metadata and data and networked with a broad range of stakeholders to understand and respond to collective needs priorities perspectives and risks goldman et al 2022 for example the coordinated component of icon is focused on intentional a priori planning and implementation of strategies to generate fair metadata and data that are generated in a standardized format as well as consistently structured upon publication further these consistent protocols are expected to be openly shared and framed based on multidisciplinary i e integrated feedback consensus i e networked using the icon principles together is therefore meant to enable development of knowledge data and models that are generalizable or transferable across diverse settings additionally icon is meant to enable research outcomes that are mutually beneficial across stakeholders ranging from core research teams to land owners managers to the general public producing research outcomes that are transferable and mutually beneficial does not happen by chance it requires a priori planning and design which can again be facilitated by using icon principles to help build an international networks of networks for the cz using a networked approach is vital to this process whereby open discussions and anonymous reporting across stakeholders can be used to understand needs and collectively work towards solutions although icon can be applied to any scientific domain it can be a particularly powerful tool for cz science due to the diversity of systems people priorities and limitations that need to be considered collectively to meet both fundamental and applied science challenges associated with the cz in this regard the icon science cooperative https www pnnl gov projects icon science is developing open resources to facilitate the use of icon principles by researchers at any career or project stage e g developing proposals modifying existing projects the cz community can use and contribute to these resources to facilitate the intentional development of networks of networks and enhance the benefit of these efforts across a broad range of stakeholders 6 2 from observatory to living lab using czos to address global societal challenges many czos have been intentionally designed to monitor how human actions affect the coupled processes in the cz e g agricultural areas and managed watersheds and herein we propose that these individual sites and cz networks together can help illuminate how humans affect the cz across much broader gradients of climate land use management and soil type than can be investigated at a single site in this regard a network of czos can provide important opportunities to identify the most urgent gaps or an indivisible problem that cannot be tackled by a single person network agency as well as address pressing science questions and societal challenges for many different environments fig 3 for instance the united nations has set 17 sustainable development goals un sdgs to address the challenges posed by human impact on many of the earth s cycles including the water cycle abbott et al 2019b and cz science is directly or indirectly relevant to many of these with a network of czo sites in many different countries it could be possible to treat a network of czo sites as a living lab where design thinking see section 4 3 and other approaches could be employed to inform policy development management approaches management tools and other socio ecological innovations in support of climate change issues environmental sustainability and other relevant societal challenges indeed czos may be ideal locations for inventing and prototyping new ideas regarding socio ecosystem management and cross site cross network collaborations could test more broadly ideas that are promising at a small number of sites for instance incentive programs to help farmers adopt conservation nutrient management have the potential to mitigate some issues associated with eutrophication of water bodies wilson et al 2019 or promote sustainable water use that helps improve long term water resources as well as reduce farmers socioeconomic vulnerability fischer et al 2022 one question that arises is how best to encourage farmers to do so this requires both consideration of incentives which differ drastically in different jurisdictions and contexts the biophysical environment which also differs and through strong partnerships between the researchers and the community a recent study on agroecological transitions in vineyards showed that the farmer s perception of risk could be mitigated by promoting environmental values as well as solutions to policy problems by including a team of ecologists and social scientists teschner and orenstein 2022 in another context precision agriculture is becoming more ubiquitous in a wide diversity of sites and has been the subject of comparison studies e g antle et al 2017 yet there has been little work to evaluate how a move to precision agriculture may affect the overall functioning of the cz a network of networks framework can provide an important opportunity to close this gap by examining how human management decisions and adaptation strategies impact cz functioning at a global scale last but not the least a global network of czo sites provides the necessary infrastructure to better understand the functioning of the cz and share resources both of which are essential to tackle high priority science questions and societal challenges e g lü et al 2017 however this must be followed by closer links between science management and policy to improve decision making banwart et al 2011 hence the understanding gained about cz processes and functions at a minimum needs to be incorporated into quantitative decision making tools designed to help environmental managers stakeholders and policy makers make decisions about adaptation and mitigation strategies e g banwart et al 2013 making this science society integration will also crucially rely on the partnership with social sciences as discussed in section 5 3 7 summary given the inherent diversity of czos and variability in governing cz processes a systematic approach to tackle these challenges is needed with future efforts decreasing the fragmentation of individual czos and watershed sites as well as openly sharing data models and tools now more than ever there is increasing recognition that close coordination and integration across the global distribution of watershed sites and cz networks can significantly advance science provide opportunities to create a shared vision learn from each other s mistakes open doors for broad perspectives and ultimately address regional and national priorities in this regard a national academies of sciences engineering and medicine report nasem 2020 made the case for an all hands on deck moment defined as bringing together a demographically and scientifically diverse group of critical zone and watershed scientists working both individually and in collaborative networks to create and deploy cutting edge analytical computational and field based research methods in an open environment where success builds expeditiously on success the path forward should include more holistic cross site cross network studies that aim to advance our understanding of cz and watersheds in response to environmental technological and societal changes and build the next generation of tools that are broadly applicable and transferable there is an urgent need to build such a network of networks for several reasons firstly increasing intensity and frequency of disturbances are pushing these systems to tipping points such that the future functioning of these systems is uncertain with consequences for energy and water cycles global distribution of nutrients and human health armstrong mckay et al 2022 a formal systematic i e coordinated approach is therefore needed to work across these cz sites and networks to develop a robust predictive understanding of how cz and watersheds function and respond to compounding and co occurring disturbances secondly new techniques and technologies are providing observations that were previously not possible such as eddy covariance based measurements of n2o and other trace gasses and fiber optic based measurements of soil temperature chemical and biological properties that can be useful indicators of global climate change baldocchi 2014 hubbard et al 2020 additionally if these unique and novel watershed observations across networks sites are to be analyzed through ai ml based approaches such approaches hold the potential to transform our understanding prediction and management of cz watershed behavior through the rapid identification of system tipping point precursors the assimilation of diverse multi scale data into models for near real time prediction and water management and the ability for models to inform real time optimization of autonomous sensing systems from local to regional to global scales lastly building on the success of these approaches and a formal global network of networks collaboration would significantly advance the understanding of environments that are extremely vulnerable and changing at a rapid pace such as those associated with coastal regions mountain watersheds arid lands agriculture urban ecosystems among others declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments we thank all presenters and

2261,the critical zone cz includes natural and anthropogenic environments where life energy and matter cycles combine in complex interactions in time and space critical zone observatories czos have been established around the world yet their limitations in space and duration of observations as well as the oft existing dominant disciplinary research field s of each czo may limit the transferability of the local knowledge to other settings or hinder integrative cz understanding in this regard this review advocates for cross site cross network collaborations in cz sciences we posit that this type of collaboration is becoming indispensable for understanding past trends and future trajectories of the cz in the context of fast developing and widespread environmental changes aided by a series of cyberseminars and a community survey we highlight some of the existing cross site initiatives tools and techniques and the cross cutting science questions that could benefit from such cross network syntheses in various types of cz settings montane alpine arctic managed and agricultural environments lakes wetlands streams landscapes disturbed by drought and or wildfire etc this review also identifies and discusses the major and legitimate concerns and obstacles for a collaborative cz approach including data harmonization and integration of social sciences and proposes tentative ways forward keywords critical zone watershed cross site synthesis data harmonization interdisciplinary available datasets data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 critical zone science what why where 1 1 what is the critical zone and what are critical zone observatories in 2001 a panel of the us national research council nrc 2001 put forward the critical zone concept and defined it as a heterogeneous near surface environment in which complex interactions involving rock soil water air and living organisms regulate the natural habitat and determine availability of life sustaining resources simply put the critical zone cz is where most life forms have strived on earth and the natural habitat where our basic human needs such as water food and energy are sustained in the critical zone life energy and matter cycles organize at a variety of scales chorover et al 2007 perdrial et al 2015 among which the watershed or fluvial catchment may constitute a fundamental control volume rinaldo and rodriguez iturbe 2022 to apprehend the daunting complexity of these natural cycles and crucially how ongoing anthropogenic changes have been impacting critical zone and watershed functioning e g goddéris and brantley 2013 numerous long term critical zone observatories czos and watershed sites have been established throughout the world brantley et al 2017 richter and mobley 2009 in the united states the national science foundation nsf recognized the significant role that the critical zone plays in the existence of life on earth and created the critical zone observatory czo program giardino and houser 2015 white et al 2015 this was followed by the establishment of soil transformations in european catchments soiltrec banwart et al 2011 by the consortium of european union members today there are numerous czos spread across the world however not all of these belong to a formally funded network see section 1 3 the term czo as defined here is therefore used to describe any instrumented field site used for monitoring energy water and material fluxes and biogeochemical cycles from unaltered bedrock to the atmospheric boundary layer across terrestrial and aquatic interfaces and across climatic and hydrobiogeochemical gradients guo and lin 2016 lin et al 2011 1 2 why are critical zone observatories needed cz science integrates our understanding of how water moves from the top of the canopy e g trees grass crops to the depths of circulating groundwater anderson et al 2008 brantley et al 2007 cz science also helps us quantify how long water is retained in aquifers how much water goes to vegetation to support carbon fixation versus shunted to our streams lakes and reservoirs and what controls the quality of our freshwater resources ultimately it is this holistic discipline that helps us understand the mechanisms and rates at which multiple earth surface processes and biogeochemical cycles occur and how these may change in response to climate change land use practices and changing disturbance regimes to this end cz science has enabled advances in sensing and tracing technologies that have improved resolution and frequency in monitoring the hidden subsurface barclay et al 2022 mangel et al 2022 cz science has also fostered the growth of high fidelity reactive transport models that test our understanding of processes stolze et al 2022 and can reach beyond spatial and temporal scales of measurements li et al 2017 steefel et al 2015 taken together the substantial body of cz research provides a strong foundation for quantifying nutrient dynamics greenhouse gas emissions as well as water and energy exchange in the critical zone arora et al 2022a cheng et al 2018 chorover et al 2011 it is important to acknowledge that a robust predictive understanding of how cz and watersheds function and respond to disturbances is necessary to tackle some of the biggest challenges for the 21st century such as water security food and energy production and sustainable ecosystem services despite significant advancements in hydrology e g hrachowitz et al 2013 mcdonnell et al 2007 soil science e

white and brantley 2003 climatology rasmussen et al 2011 and other fields that work in the cz accurately predicting cz functioning requires study of the interactions among dominant processes across landscapes given this complexity recent studies have highlighted the need for more holistic integrative and multiscale approaches that work at the intersections of traditionally separate disciplines to advance our understanding of cz functioning for example saup et al 2019 demonstrated the tight linkage between microbial community assembly and seasonal hydrology in the upper colorado river basin they make the point that understanding hydrological drivers of microbial activity is important for systems whose flow regime may be impacted under future climate scenarios similarly li et al 2021 advocate for developing integrated theories at the intersection of hydrology e g transit time theory and biogeochemistry e g reaction kinetic theories which they argue are at the core of cz functioning and necessary to improve our understanding of and ability to predict earth surface system responses to climate and human forcing these calls for more integrated cz research will require interdisciplinary knowledge exchange and adaptation of concepts beyond discipline specific boundaries adler et al 2021 arora et al 2022b brantley et al 2017 perdrial et al 2015 advancing our understanding of cz functioning at relevant local and global scales also requires addressing the tremendous spatial variability in dominant processes across natural and human impacted landscapes elhacham et al 2020 ellis et al 2021 grant et al 2017 the importance of addressing scaling effects in cz science is easily illustrated when considering the cascading impacts of changes in climate and land cover use on water quality in large watersheds for example the mississippi river starts as a humble 6 m wide knee deep creek in north central minnesota as it flows southward it picks up excessive nutrients from the agricultural and urban landscapes in the center of the continental united states before discharging into the gulf of mexico and creating an expansive dead zone of 16 405 km2 noaa 2021 another example is the yellow river a major drinking water source in china and the second longest in asia that has been suffering from extensive contamination and is now on the verge of becoming unfit for even industrial or agricultural use dwivedi et al 2022a existing czos do not operate at these scales so it is important to consider the representativeness of individual cz sites for larger systems and consider opportunities for cross site synthesis to grasp the impact of spatial variability on downstream conditions further while the scale and complexity of these water quality impacts is daunting large investments have already been made in developing these czo sites which constitute collecting phenomenally diverse and distributed watershed datasets including many associated with autonomous sensing systems it is worthwhile to acknowledge that comparable measurements exist at czos at national and international scales together these datasets share many common attributes but differ by important aspects such as geophysical attributes climatic conditions plant functional types biodiversity inherent complexity e g natural built environment disturbance types e g fire heat wave flooding mining and time since disturbance e g logging insect infestation an international network of watersheds and czos can serve as a vehicle for knowledge exchange integration and scientific discovery strengths of such a network include its ability to detect emergent scale properties of watershed and cz function at local to regional and global scales and provide an in depth understanding of the spatially heterogeneous impact of disturbances on watershed function 1 3 where are critical zone observatories located as suggested above these czos are located worldwide fig 1 however these individual sites have traditionally operated in silos with frequent emphasis on their specific design regional setting and priority science questions that have resulted in customized data collection theories and modeling approaches arora et al 2021 brantley et al 2021 lesmes et al 2020 while there is a wide diversity of sites fig 1 a common challenge across these sites is to understand and predict how sustainable or vulnerable these habitats and associated services are in the face of compounding and co occurring climatic disturbances and rapidly growing population industrialization and urbanization many of these czos belong to a larger network e g doe watersheds czcn ozcar tereno that were designed with specific strategic goals however there are many sites including those not listed on this map that are well established e g long term interdisciplinary indigenous community led but not formally part of a funded network and therefore lacking in aspects that promote data sharing cross site comparisons there is room to advocate for both individual and larger scale czo network development and network of networks for example there is significant underrepresentation of the intertropical belt among the established czos fig 1 although this latitudinal range harbors over half of the world population two thirds of the terrestrial plant biomass chapin et al 2002 and may face some of the most dramatic impacts of ongoing global changes mamalakis et al 2021 connecting individual sites in a network of networks fashion in the inter tropical belt is likely to be impactful in transforming our understanding of cz functioning in these regions based on this assessment we first present an overview of where the lack of a network of networks organization comes at a substantial cost to the cz community through missed opportunities to address scientific challenges section 2 we then describe existing cross site cross network initiatives and where these initiatives are urgently needed section 3 in the same spirit we list available and emerging synthesis tools and techniques that provide a springboard for new modes of collaboration section 4 we then summarize the challenges within the context of implementing a network of networks model section 5 in the same section we also highlight community debates regarding the need to integrate human and social perspectives in cz science section 5 2 we identify three areas of greatest need in order to achieve higher rates of data sharing and reuse under a network of networks framework open and standardized metadata guidelines data harmonization and a new class of cz information scientists section 6 1 we suggest specific guidance for addressing these needs and describe the principles for enhancing cross site and cross network collaborations in the cz section 6 2 the proposed network of networks model is expected to promote synthesis integration activities across cz networks develop transferable tools data and workflows train next generation of cz scientists open new sources of funding build personal connections and human to human interaction as well as engage cz site managers and relevant stakeholders the network of networks setup is presented as a framework for improving how human management decisions and adaptation strategies impact cz functioning at a global scale informing policy development and enabling socio ecological innovations section 6 2 the paper concludes with a recommendation to develop an open inclusive international network of networks framework that promotes the use of the best available science to address the most pressing challenges of the cz section 7 2 the need for a radical collaboration across czos the czo concept has been successful in integrating across diverse and distributed measurements for the purposes of understanding the complex and tightly coupled interactions of hydrological biogeochemical geological microbiological and ecological processes at an intensively monitored site anderson et al 2008 kulmala 2018 however czos require massive investment and coordination between dozens of scientists to gain this in depth understanding guo and lin 2016 moreover the technologies needed to observe key ecosystem fluxes directly including evapotranspiration and greenhouse gas fluxes e g fluxnet pastorello et al 2020 and indirectly such as biogeochemical transformations and nutrient uptake e g nutnet adler et al 2011 often need to be observed at very fine spatial scales e g 0 01 km2 baldocchi et al 2001 or in situ morin et al 2017 petrescu et al 2015 as such the knowledge obtained from czos is challenging to apply directly to the large areas we seek to manage and or protect for example the mississippi basin or the yellow river beyond the spatial context that is critical for underpinning resource management decisions co occurring and compounding disturbances are testing the resilience of cz and watersheds in new and poorly understood ways natural and anthropogenic forms of disturbance are pushing these systems to tipping points beyond which many previously stationary environmental rates including rates of erosion and sediment control groundwater recharge contaminant mitigation and associated microbial and ecological processing among others are rapidly changing e g mcdowell et al 2008 newcomer et al 2021 wohl 2013 this has had devastating effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services in the cz díaz et al 2019 co occurring disturbances such as water and resource extraction combined with widespread drought are leaving little for ecological communities while compound disturbances are exacerbating soil fertility and water quality issues recent reports from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2021 stress a clear urgency to understand how natural systems including cz and watersheds will respond to disturbance models predict that the global water cycle will intensify under a warming climate where for each 1 c rise in temperature global precipitation is projected to increase approximately 1 3 ipcc 2013 roque malo and kumar 2017 however this increase is not expected to be uniform across latitudes or seasons xie et al 2015 by integrating information from several czos we can answer questions about how multiple processes are coupled how they vary across broad gradients and how they respond to disturbance e g gaillardet et al 2018 for instance a large river basin like the mississippi basin is typically studied through czos that occupy a tiny proportion of its area through traditional modes of inquiry this implies that the community has assembled a substantial body of observations and process specific interpretations that are relevant to the intensely monitored czo site s however we are still lacking a unified conceptual framework that can translate this knowledge into transferable and generalizable concepts but working across czo networks for example in france and germany in addition to the mississippi basin czos could yield a detailed understanding of how diverse environments function and respond to future disturbances at the very least such an approach would enable unifying data theories and models across czos and disturbance events with the capacity to test hypotheses across a larger parameter space than would be possible within any single czo it is precisely this rationale that underpins the development of czo networks and its logical extension is that coordination across networks is needed as greater scales are to be assessed considering the presence of pre existing networks of czos usually maintained by a particular national government and focused largely within its territory it follows that a continental to global focus of inquiry requires some degree of working across these already established networks the global ecosystem research infrastructure geri loescher et al 2022 which collaborates with five major ecosystem research infrastructures around the globe neon north america elter europe icos europe tern australia cern asia and saeon africa is a good example of an established network of networks further there have been calls for an integrated earth observatory e g kulmala 2018 as the best means to address global problems such as climate change however it is important to recognize that such an effort requires detailed ground data including but not limited to soil properties nutrient stocks and transformations carbon pools and transformations and microbial functioning to constrain processes such as greenhouse gas fluxes nutrient transformations and hydrological processes arora et al 2016 vicca et al 2018 jansson and hofmockel 2020 as well as assessing the response to disturbance graham et al 2021 grant et al 2019 providing such data will require a global coordinated effort and is likely to require working across networks of czos integrating and collaborating across these observatories and networks also becomes increasingly indispensable for understanding how cz might behave under conditions substantially different from the present ones for example in a microbial context an outstanding science question is to understand to what degree the response of a microbial community to a disturbance is ecosystem limited and can the response be generalized as a functional trait that could then be used to make predictions and management decisions regarding future events if microbial datasets are collected in standardized ways across the global cz these data types can be used to reveal generalizable patterns rules concepts and theories tied to a broad range of microbial properties related to ecology e g large scale diversity gradients evolution e g processes governing strain variation and function e g microbial food webs structured by metabolite exchange taking a coordinated approach spanning czos will dramatically accelerate the pursuit of generalizable or transferable knowledge which is essential to develop predictive models e g earth system models that are ultimately tied to developing solutions to sustainably manage ecosystems following disturbance more generally working across networks of czos can help test the generality of concepts and hypotheses e g jansson and hofmockel 2020 and generate new hypotheses for further evaluation via modeling and targeted data generation 3 opportunities to conduct cross site cross network science 3 1 examples of existing cross site initiatives although limited in number recent studies that are targeting data from multiple international sites are far reaching and already creating paradigm shifts in our understanding of watershed and cz functioning e g tiegs et al 2019 migliavacca et al 2021 as an example a global analysis of intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams spanning more than 200 dry riverbeds across major environmental gradients and climate zones is providing important insights on terrestrial plant litter dynamics datry et al 2018 another example is a global low cost analysis using household tea bags known as the teacomposition initiative to elucidate microbial carbon cycling across ecosystems and climatic regions djukic et al 2021 there are also significant emerging efforts focused on collecting extensive observations of hydroclimatic microbial and hydrologic variables across diverse environments e g chosen whondrs zhang et al 2021 stegen and goldman 2018 a recent study by ward et al 2022 further demonstrates the power of prodding such extensive datasets using machine learning approaches focused on river corridor science their study uncovered relationships that would not have been possible through traditional deductive approaches to science however we must recognize that cross site initiatives and data gathering efforts that cover a large spatial domain but do not provide a holistic interdisciplinary view of cz processes may not be enough to advance cz science for instance the nsf has taken a step to address this challenge by reorganizing their czo program to develop 10 new critical zone collaborative networks czcns that all but one focus on science hypothesis driven research across multiple national cz sites the last czcn funding supports the development of a network coordinating hub although limited to the national scale these multi site investigations and hub are expected to not only improve our understanding of cz dynamics but also provide a platform to facilitate exchange of data information and learning opportunities for cz scientists and students alike with this in mind outcomes from globally distributed efforts like intermittent rivers chosen whondrs and the teacomposition initiative as well as nsf led national efforts can be powerful catalysts for further cross network integration and coordination 3 2 opportunities for new cross network synthesis identified through cz community discussions below we highlight some increasingly urgent science questions that could benefit from cross site and cross network collaborations these are assembled from a recent cyberseminar series cuahsi 2021a showcasing czos across bioclimatic settings key science questions being addressed at each czo and perceptual models developed at each site that could be tested across a diversity of czo sites to improve process understanding table 1 these encompass montane alpine and arctic managed and agricultural drought and wildfire impacted as well as lake wetland and stream environments as would be obvious there are opportunities for improved understanding of cz processes in landscapes not described here or discussed during the cyberseminar series to expand on this further the next section section 3 3 describes these outstanding opportunities with an acute focus on urban landscapes 3 3 other examples of outstanding cz related challenges although not explicitly discussed during the 2021 cuahsi cyberseminar series or described in table 1 there are opportunities for improved understanding of cz processes in other landscapes undergoing rapid and drastic change for example tropical forested landscapes urban areas especially those along coastlines intermittent river and variably inundated settings below we take the example of urban landscapes to illustrate how we could benefit from a concerted effort to generate and test hypotheses through synthesizing and analyzing information across a variety of sites and networks as shown in fig 1 urban landscapes can be classified as developed high land cover according to national land cover database dewitz and u s geological survey 2021 which includes 4 sites eel river czo central arizona phoenix lter baltimore ecosystem study and plum island ecosystem lter and as developed low that includes 17 additional sites more recently the nsf czcn funding was awarded to develop an urban cz cluster spanning four cities in the u s east coast philadelphia baltimore washington d c and raleigh weniger et al 2021 the north south gradient these sites fall along captures climatic trends and urban development trends i e older and denser development in philadelphia and baltimore to newer and sparser development in raleigh this urban cz cluster is focused on addressing the drivers of solute export dynamics in urban areas including the potential importance of climate urban density underlying geology and the unique hydrological functioning of urban landscapes the ozcar network in france also has several urban impacted sites including fontaine de vaucluse near nîmes the othu yzeron site near lyon and the osuna irstv onevu site near nantes urban research catchment sites that are not part of an existing cz network also exist for example the black creek research catchment in toronto canada and a number of urban impacted catchments across berlin germany kuhlemann et al 2020 kuhlemann et al 2022 which have both been used to deepen our understanding of water ages and their relationship to solute transport in urban streams across these sites many unanswered research questions related to the impacts of urban development on cz processes have emerged for example the role of pervious areas e g lawns parks brownfields riparian areas in the transport of water and solutes to receiving waters ariano and oswald 2022 as well as spatial and temporal variability in greenhouse gas fluxes is starting to receive more attention notable in urban pervious areas is the heterogeneity of urban soils due to human disturbance e g construction activities compaction the influence of these patterns on pollutant sources and transport and the success of urban vegetation deserves additional attention there is also an emerging interest in quantifying the ecohydrological partitioning of precipitation into blue fluxes and green fluxes in urban greenspaces gillefalk et al 2022 marx et al 2022 and the role of different vegetation species which are usually heavily managed on these fluxes investigations into the dominant biogeochemical processes facilitating the mobilization of contaminants of emerging concern e g plastics plastic associated contaminants pharmaceuticals which are often concentrated in areas with high population density are also increasing kaushal et al 2020 fork et al 2021 werbowski et al 2021 the role of wastewater as a pathway for contaminants of emerging concern to enter surface waters and the impacts of wastewater contributions on stream biogeochemical processing in general are of interest while many of these lines of inquiry could be investigated within a single czo or research catchment there are clear benefits to addressing these questions across networks and urban cz sites there are fundamental differences in the materials and plans of cities including the types of infrastructure in place and management practices which may have an outsized impact on the importance of these processes for example older cities may have more degraded sewer infrastructure which could lead to more wastewater inputs to surface water systems although we could examine how urban cz processes are impacted across climatic gradients in a manner similar to any cross site cross network study here we have the opportunity to prioritize examining gradients of urbanization e g there may be different processes occurring in areas with low levels of urban land cover versus heavily urbanized areas since urban cz science has not been a traditional priority i e it is atypical to have as many urban sites in one country as the u s or france leveraging measurements across multiple sites is advantageous for inferring process from pattern other outstanding overarching cz research questions include how do different cz watershed sites respond to similar compound and co occurring disturbances what determines differences in site responses to similar disturbances how does environmental history modulate these responses to what extent are model machine learning parameters transferable to untested sites and unforeseen conditions what tools exist to make the data more accessible and open for cross site cross network comparisons 4 available and emerging synthesis tools and techniques in this section we focus on highlighting available and emerging tools and techniques for cross site cross network science that were identified by seminar participants in a second cuahsi cyberseminar series cuahsi 2021b 4 1 existing and emerging frameworks and platforms for successful data synthesis as suggested above there now exist a few albeit limited studies targeting global standardized experiments and developing flexible tools with data from multiple international sites crucial enablers of such synthesis activities are existing and emerging interoperable portals for browsing sharing publishing and analyzing cz data these include the cuahsi hydroclient https data cuahsi org and hydroshare https hydroshare org portals the global scale ozcar theia data portal braud et al 2020 https in situ theia land fr the tereno data discovery portal https ddp tereno net ddp the department of energy s ess dive portal on watershed and instrumented sites https ess dive lbl gov or the macrosheds portal for us stream and watershed data https cuahsi shinyapps io macrosheds the latter also includes tools for training models with hosted datasets another example is the datastream portal hosted by the gordon foundation https gordonfoundation ca initiatives datastream which makes it easy to share and access water quality data a more extensive listing of existing regional and international data portals is provided in table 2 we recognize that the highly distributed nature of cz data repositories as is evident from table 2 can require substantial efforts in ensuring data access and discovery in section 6 1 1 we make recommendations on how to make these data easily and automatically accessible and discoverable through a global catalog of cz data stores across networks however efforts to institute a data collection or storage standard will likely have the effect of stifling innovation in cz science while also becoming unwieldy rather than standardize data collection or storage we argue for the development of shared metadata template s these must be developed as a community effort and would enable more efficient but flexible data storage collection and discovery see section 6 1 1 for further details online infrastructures integrating models and data analyses are emerging as well from large platforms such as the ideas watersheds software ecosystem https ideas productivity org ideas watersheds which comprises workflow tools interface libraries and a variety of codes for reactive transport hydrological or land surface modeling all the way to specific toolboxes such as bridget https github com kit hyd bridget for comparing and scaling evapotranspiration estimates beyond existing portals synthesis activities have been focused on curating specific cz data from a variety of sites successful examples of such activities include the soil water infiltration global swig database which includes more than 5000 infiltration curves covering all continents with an acute focus on developing evaluating and validating infiltration processes across a range of models rahmati et al 2018 in the united states the chosen comprehensive hydrologic observatory sensor network is a database of streamflow soil moisture and other hydroclimatic and hydrologic variables a comparative analysis of which highlighted complex patterns in hydrological extremes across different us regions thereby advocating for long term observatories zhang et al 2021 other efforts focused on global datasets of high dimensional high resolution microbial properties and processes across diverse cz environments are also emerging in this regard the worldwide hydrobiogeochemistry observation network for dynamic river systems whondrs has been carrying out crowdsourced sampling campaigns that span numerous networks and countries though significant global gaps remain stegen and goldman 2018 in this campaign the microbial data once fully available can provide a foundation to elucidate organizing principles governing spatial and temporal patterns in microbial composition e g which microbes are where and function e g what genes are expressed before after disturbance these microbe oriented questions are particularly important in the cz and earth system functioning at large as microbes are primary catalysts for organic matter transformations tied to greenhouse gas production and global biogeochemical cycles such data collection and integration efforts are important for bridging scales as they can provide standardized and transferable insights across the globe 4 2 state of the art tools and techniques for reducing complexity beyond data integration portals and frameworks conducting synthesis crucially relies on translating complex cz information into a compelling scientific narrative one approach to reducing complexity in studied systems even more so across a large array of observation sites is to use dimensionless numbers this is because dimensionless numbers have the potential to collapse the scatter in data highlight scale invariance express the competition between processes and allow for comparing datasets model outputs and or locations with different characteristic ranges classical examples include the reynolds number in fluid dynamics abraham 1970 the combination of the dryness and evaporative indices both dimensionless in the budyko curve in hydroclimatology e g berghuijs et al 2014 the damkhöler number in reactive transport or the hillslope number in hydrology e g brutsaert 1994 berne et al 2005 a related approach to reducing complexity in studied systems relies on a mix of hydrological or biogeochemical ecological climatic signatures for instance braud et al 2021 used a number of hydrological signatures such as baseflow index flow duration curve slope and event recession curve indices together with a cluster analysis to classify ozcar sites across four continents their approach was quite scalable and would be straightforward to apply to even larger networks of data and has the potential to allow fairly broad classifications of catchments based on function in a separate cross site study ross et al 2021 used the idea of hydrological thresholds of intensity and storage to analyze 21 catchments across the us canada australia and new zealand in particular they identified thresholds in runoff response at all but one catchment and concluded that threshold behavior can be one basis of studying a large number of catchments another approach builds on the idea of using stream properties e g solutes concentrations as a proxy for upstream cz structure and processes with the most widely used approach being the concentration discharge c q relationship where river discharge rate q reflects different cz compartments mobilized e g gaillardet et al 1999 stewart et al 2022 rather than absolute solute concentration or river discharge one can use the relationship between the two or with dimensionless numbers such as concentration ratios or even their derivatives differential c q analysis arora et al 2020 to collapse data scattering and reflect cz functioning but more importantly to facilitate synthesis and hypothesis testing across diverse observatories some of these non exclusive approaches can further track the transient nature of underlying cz processes both in time hot moments and space hot spots within the studied landscape and time periods using dedicated methods such as wavelets and wavelet entropy analysis e g arora et al 2019 grande et al 2022 cross cz synthesis efforts may also benefit from overcoming small scale paradigms as only very few out of various candidate cz processes may actually play a role at larger scales or explain inter site variability e g adler et al 2021 data analysis methods aimed at dimensionality reduction e g principal component analysis isometric feature mapping can be a path forward to identifying these key drivers or processes e g schilli et al 2010 on soil solution characterization or wlostowski et al 2021 on hydrological signatures these data analysis techniques have been increasingly combined with or paralleled by machine learning ml techniques e g zhi et al 2021 which allow for cz drivers and patterns to be identified with minimal a priori knowledge if sufficient data points are available ml is often considered to be more flexible than other approaches as it does not need all data to be rigidly collected with the same frame dwivedi et al 2022b varadharajan et al 2022 its application in cz science is still in its infancy notably due to significant challenges such as the interpretability and physical consistency of ml models the need to include complexity and uncertainty of training data in ml models and the enormous computational resources needed in many ml applications reichstein et al 2019 sahu et al 2020 burdett and wellen 2022 for example burdett and wellen 2022 found that while ml approaches outperformed more conventional statistical techniques in the prediction of crop yield from soil properties an attempt to quantify the most important factors for prediction revealed substantial uncertainty while the two predictors with the highest level of variable importance in a random forest model alone were able to achieve very strong fits to the crop yield data a model nearly as strong was assembled from the three variables of lowest importance however ml is a fast growing field of research and some of these challenges are already being addressed for instance hybrid methods are increasingly being applied such as differential parameter learning where the training focuses on calibrating the parameters of a process based model efficiently yielding spatially and physically coherent parameter configurations for distributed simulations tsai et al 2021 the need for synthesis studies and cross site cz analyses have also promoted the search for reliable proxies where data gaps exist for instance electrical conductivity ec is often used as a proxy for chloride concentrations in urban systems allowing a continuous record to be reliably derived from a relatively small number of grab samples moore et al 2019 the mechanisms for why ec influences chloride so consistently are well established at very high cl concentrations the cl contributed from road deicers is the main source of ionic strength cooper et al 2014 other proxies for chemical constituents have a much less consistently reliable relation with important variables for instance fdom fluorescent dissolved organic matter sensors allow dissolved organic carbon doc to be monitored but often corrections are required to account for turbidity temperature and other important variables downing et al 2012 turbidity sensors often have strong relationships with total suspended solids and total phosphorus and often reasonable relationships with dissolved phosphorus but the strength of these relationships varies substantially even in areas with similar climate and geology e g biagi et al 2022 robertson et al 2018 ross et al 2022 presumably the details of the erosional processes and also the biogeochemistry dictate this relationship a widespread network effort could provide a mechanistic understanding of why certain sensors are reliable proxies for water quality parameters in some catchments but not others and could help manage expectations of sensors e g rode et al 2016 a host of other sensors are used to monitor various cz processes e g soil moisture snowfall precipitation vegetation cover phenocam sonnentag et al 2012 water quality and others previous intercomparison studies have reported significant variability across sensors when different sensors are sensing the same variable in the same place e g soil moisture jackisch et al 2020 snowfall kochendorfer et al 2022 as such a large distributed sensor intercomparison study would be necessary when integrating data across many sites and instrument to instrument conversion factors may be estimated such a study would also be quite informative for research that relied on a specific sensor as they would have a sense of how specific their results are to the sensor they used furthermore working across czos allows us to evaluate the applicability of sensing technologies for earth science monitoring e g drones in situ gravimetry air borne cosmic ray neutron sensing weighable high precision lysimeter eddy covariance in situ isotopic tracing fiber optic installations environmental dna and omics to other contexts e g mining urban planning wildlife monitoring medical sciences 4 3 examples of bringing cz science into the anthropocene there has been a broad recognition that we have entered into the anthropocene the era of human domination of earth s ecosystems lewis and maslin 2015 vitousek et al 1997 accordingly there is a need to better understand how environmental science generally and cz science specifically can better ask and answer questions related to human environment interaction our final cyberseminar cuahsi 2021b addressed exactly this question abbott et al 2019a talked about the centrality of human interaction in the water cycle and contrasted this centrality with the typically pristine representation of the global water cycle in literature including scientific literature for instance human water appropriation equals about half of global river discharge yet only 15 of water cycle diagrams depict this interaction abbott et al 2019b in fact the icon for the cznet program in the us shows no human influences despite a number of cz sites being located in areas of intense human activity agricultural or urban areas given that such diagrams are a point of entry to cz for many people both inside and outside of academia recognizing and correcting this misrepresentation is an important step towards awareness and equitable development in the anthropocene while efforts in this direction have included updated diagrams on the websites of the australian czo network https www tern org au critical zone and the ozcar theia data portal https www theia land fr theiaozcar un portail unique dedie aux donnees dobservation in situ only recently did the u s geological survey provide a radical update for its classic diagram of the water cycle this time with humans as showrunners duncombe 2022 taking this viewpoint further other cyberseminar participants talked about the importance of societal engagement and design approaches in cz science in particular arènes et al 2018 highlighted that the cz depiction to the general public is in the form of planetary view of the earth made familiar since the time of the scientific revolution and reinforced by the iconic image of the blue planet grevsmühl 2014 their work therefore tried to develop a different visual representation that captured the complex heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the cz to faithfully target practitioners and stakeholders that cz scientists try to address through their science they approached this through a unique collaboration between an architect a sociologist engaged in the cz field and a geochemist who heads the czo network in france this work has since been further extended into a book involving two architects and a science historian aït touati et al 2019 and a museum installation that mimics a cz observatory in strengbach in france at a scale of 1 80 to adequately describe the design of the czos https critical zones zkm de other examples of alternative representations of natural environments and processes following the same philosophical viewpoint are recent works from the monsoon research group mapping rain http monass org bremner 2021 the forensic architecture tracing chemicals in the atmosphere https forensic architecture org and the italian limes following the moving border across italy s glaciers http www italianlimes net other ways of societal engagement include design thinking which includes a work process that puts users first and works through an iterative process designed to understand users and their problems prototype solutions test them and iterate to arrive at better solutions liedtka 2015 goi and tan 2021 suggested that design thinking must entail a deep understanding of the perspective of those it is aimed at and thereby could lead to more inclusive social innovations that involve stakeholders from various backgrounds their work also highlights the key role played by empathy with the example of constructing a map with audio guide to promote ena city and its noren split curtains as japanese culture finally marie toussaint highlighted the importance of ecocide and the importance of ensuring that human interaction with ecosystems is done in a way that allows ecosystems to renew themselves cuahsi 2021b toussaint also highlighted that people who work directly with nature e g farmers hunters indigenous peoples know a lot about nature involving such people in czo site selection priority setting and experimental design could be quite valuable 5 challenges to a network of networks model 5 1 insights from community feedback to gather community inputs on the challenges and opportunities to conduct cz synthesis and integration activities we designed an online survey questionnaire the explicit goal of the survey was to identify define and provide a stimulus for initiating integration and exchange of data tools models and frameworks that enable cross site cross network analyses the survey was conducted on a voluntary basis with participants from different czo networks and single czos fig 1 a survey questions included available tools simulation codes and openly available data as well as perceived challenges associated with synthesizing across diverse cz sites we received a total of 130 responses from across czo sites and networks fig 2 a with respondents working across different agencies institutions and disciplines based on this feedback we identified several pressing needs and challenges that the cz community are tackling related to integration and open sharing along with those pressing needs and challenges the survey also highlighted what appeared to be major obstacles to the construction of cross site cross network collaboration fig 2 b cz respondents felt that key barriers to collaboration included missing data harmonization data access availability and lack of funding additional obstacles were identified as the lack of human connection and the environmental cost the time needed to build a trusting collaboration parachute science and environmental justice issues were identified as other obstacles below we describe in detail on how these obstacles constitute legitimate concerns for network of networks synthesis activities and solutions or partial solutions to navigating these concerns survey participants identified ease of access to data from across cz networks and harmonizing those data as key requirements for successful intercomparison of results across networks sites time periods and techniques however the accuracy and implementation of data collection techniques and tools vary depending on numerous aspects such as czo type the goal of the intercomparison study and practical field constraints while there are existing examples of data harmonization e g wieder et al 2021 and existing portals of data targeting cz research see section 4 1 an increasing emphasis on standardized data collection protocols commonly agreed upon data harmonization strategy and developments in cyberinfrastructure tools could significantly enhance opportunities for data discovery and cross site cross network collaborations another obstacle to cross site cross network collaboration was highlighted as the lack of availability accessibility or existence of funding to support international collaborations while not abundant some funding resources do exist classic examples that support such activities include the powell center and lter synthesis proposals other examples include the berkeley france fund https fbf berkeley edu or the german academic exchange service through daad https www daad de en but these resources are limited to network exchange only some funding resources while available are restricted to specific disciplines such as idiv for biology science https www idiv de en or techniques such as eddy covariance through the fluxnet network https fluxnet org in countries where a formal czo funding source is itself lacking e g canada it can be even more difficult to look for funding for international collaborations given this background it is evident that the cz community needs to advocate for an international cross site cross network collaboration funded at a global scale as is the case for the iodp international ocean discovery program https www iodp org and the icdp international continental drilling program https www icdp online org home examples of other funding setups include i the european funded cost actions an example is the water isotopes in the critical zone watson https watson cost eu which focuses on building a european community around isotope enabled tracking of water pathways in the cz it fosters knowledge exchange and new insights through a funding short stays for visiting scholars and recurring workshops b encouraging building collaborative data portals and c linking functional and spatial scales ii for arctic ecosystems and more widely alpine subarctic ecosystems the interact network can be used to fund field trip to stations over the northern hemisphere but they also offer remote and virtual access to over 89 terrestrial field bases https eu interact org iii the erc synergy grants https erc europa eu funding synergy grants can go up to 10 m over 6 years and involve one non eu co pi while elements of collaboration and coordination can be achieved through these funding setups we believe that the reach of the current cz networks and the extent of scientific exchange could be vastly improved through a global network of network setup such programs could fulfill the urgent need for international funding to support cz synthesis integration activities at a worldwide scale beyond the monetary and science based obstacles the survey also raised the fact that building a collaboration demands human to human interaction such interaction would promote interest in developing cross cutting science questions that go beyond a single site and prompt discussions on transferability and interoperability of tools data collection techniques and modeling frameworks it is important to recognize that while social interactions can be easy in this day and age developing personal connections can prove to be time consuming and environmentally costly for a socially inclusive global network of networks setup that promotes in person interactions navigating the environmental cost of travel can be a significant concern and this leads back to the need to advocate for an international collaboration funded at a global scale that supports this kind of expenditure but also promotes medium to long term engagement from relevant stakeholders communities and nonscientific experts to come together to understand and address cz challenges this solution could also partially address the still existing problem of parachute science occurring mostly in lower income countries stefanoudis et al 2021 and could entail a mandatory linking of external collaborators of the sites to the native collaborators for any experiments building skills and valorization of works conference article etc 5 2 integrating social science with cz research although not explicitly addressed through the survey we believe that a close integration of social science with cz science is critical to answering the most pressing challenges in cz research because czos involve human habitats and human impacted areas the need and establishment of a cross site cross network collaboration should be used as an opportunity to intentionally and tightly integrate social sciences with cz sciences barriers to such an integration have been highlighted as a combination of a lack of formal criteria emphasizing disciplinary research cultural and career barriers lack of linkage to industry a conservative educational system and lack of strategic focus by universities holm et al 2013 in fact holm et al 2013 argue for a revolution in education and capacity building that is deemed necessary in response to urgent environmental and social challenges indeed there is increasing scientific evidence that human migration black et al 2011 or social collapse can be due in whole zheng et al 2014 or in part shaw 2003 to environmental changes in the cz scheffer 2009 in tandem an increasing number of ipcc reports are highlighting the impacts of climate change on human society ipcc 2001 2007 2014 2022 etc moreover recent decades have highlighted that scientific understandings have often been poorly reflected in public policy and sometimes disregarded entirely when solely using a supply side model of science oreskes 2022 together these lines of evidence suggest an urgent need for integrating cz research with human and social sciences the human and social sciences encompass many disciplines but in the case of integration with the cz a first level of integration should at a minimum include sociology such as linkages with demographics and anthropological studies political science to integrate with public management aspects economics and geographical science e g studies of climate change impacts on the economics of societies and human migration as well as human science such as history and archeology to further this integration such cross disciplinary studies should be embedded in education programs an example of such integration is the earth politics center created in paris in the fall of 2019 that aims to address the complex issues of the anthropocene by the convergence of natural and experimental sciences with the human and social sciences https u paris fr centre politiques terre en the earth politics center likewise there is emerging interest in community perceptions and attitudes to environmental change to promote communication of critical resources within the cz and improve adaptive capacity for example grunblatt and alessa 2017 compared science based assessment of environmental changes to society s perceived notion of it and showed diverse individual notions regarding the impact of humans on climate change but more importantly grunblatt and alessa 2017 argued that these perceived notions can be changed through inclusive dialogue and engagement an example where such dialogue is being facilitated is in a project called sentinelles des alpes set up by the zone atelier alpes observation and research facility in france that specifically partners social researchers with local actors such as mountain guides alpine hut keepers and or regional parks workers the project allows the sharing of experiences around important issues and the identification of potential avenues for synergies both in terms of research questions and more methodological aspects across 5 mountain socio ecosystems each led by a researcher and a local actor this project resulted in a communication video to raise awareness on these alpine systems which is also accessible to the general public http www za alpes org le programme sentinelles des alpes an example of where such human dialogue and connection will be important is urban cz science including human dialogue in cz science will allow us to question how humans and nature interact whether new metrics ought to be sought and what kinds of corresponding data should be collected about human activities in specific cz areas such as urban sites it therefore clearly appears that in the current context of a society totally dependent on inevitable climate and environmental changes the inclusion of human sciences as part of the cz science is essential 6 the path forward 6 1 principles for enhancing cross site cross network collaboration in the cz in this section we highlight the most important needs for enhancing integration synthesis activities in the cz as identified through the cyberseminar series and community feedback 1 the need for open standardized global metadata 2 the need for more efforts on data harmonization and 3 the need for a new class of cz data scientists going beyond technical innovations and towards collaborations in the cz community our main recommendation is to develop an open inclusive international network of networks framework that promotes the use of the best available science to address the most pressing challenges of the cz 6 1 1 the need for global metadata for cz science ensuring cross site cross network cz collaboration will require a number of technical innovations that have already begun but require significant additional developments to help bring about open and networked science specifically workflows are needed that enable data to be discovered accessed and harmonized data discovery refers to the ability to locate and understand data sets that exist while access refers to the ability to obtain these datasets in section 4 1 we enumerated many cz networks that made data available and each one enables discovery across its own network more and more of these networks structure their workflow and data life cycle requirements to make used data fair findable accessible interoperable reusable the existing data portals work quite well when seeking to access data within one network however when integrating data across multiple networks the existing approach is quite cumbersome as one must learn the terminology interface and other aspects of every individual network moreover data integration is particularly challenging in the highly multidisciplinary field of cz science due to the inherent diversity of the data that may be combined in a single portal in both type climate ecology geochemistry genomics etc and associated spatio temporal scales see for example table 2 given this background it is obvious that some kind of global catalog of networks is needed and for this to be developed some agreement on a harmonized metadata template is needed this calls for having extensive metadata associated with the databases ideally built in from the start in a robust data management plan to avoid unforeseen discrepancies as the database grows in practice this implies making metadata generation and upload easy and user friendly for data uploaders and fair and open for the targeted users though not explicitly included in fair principles the use of digital object identifiers dois for datasets and published algorithms has been an oft mentioned need as well cuahsi 2021a 2021b dois allow resources such as data or code to be unambiguously identified and cited enabling much more transparency in research within and across networks 6 1 2 the need for semantics to power data harmonization data discovery is simply a first step of working across networks a much more difficult issue and one that arguably has not been addressed as well as discovery is that of harmonization harmonization refers to taking data sets from a number of different sources and having them conform to a particular schema for a particular purpose barriers to cz data harmonization were discussed in detail in the second cuahsi cyberseminar series cuahsi 2021b todd brown et al 2022 reported on an interview study with eight research group leaders who had constructed harmonized soil carbon datasets from pre existing data they found that while discovery tools were quite useful and available there were virtually none dedicated to data harmonization harmonization was usually accomplished in a manual ad hoc manner which proved to be quite labor intensive error prone and constituted no data provenance detailed explanation of how the harmonized data was sourced from primary measurements the data model that each group settled on for harmonized data tended to be dependent on the question they asked this suggests that it is unrealistic to have a single data template or schema even for soil carbon work let alone for cz research these results suggest the need for more research into data harmonization in cz science a generalized approach to data harmonization proved to be quite useful as shown in the sodah project wieder et al 2021 where raw soil carbon data were annotated with a generalized metadata template such a generalized template allowed data to be mapped from whatever format they were collected into to a format useful for a specific aggregated analysis avoiding the need for a universal data storage schema however the specific templates employed in sodah were focused on soil carbon different questions and different source data may require a revisit to the templates used should an approach similar to sodah be implemented more broadly these lessons learned in the soils field are likely to apply to the wider field of cz science if international cz networks become linked together we will need to develop ways to harmonize data across multiple schemas for instance the theia ozcar network has opted to use a specific database schema for data across its network braud et al 2020 it is quite possible that should a researcher wish to integrate ozcar data with any other network s data they would encounter harmonization difficulties similar to those encountered by todd brown s 2022 interviewees as a solution to this tower of babel problem when working across disciplines researchers have advocated for the use of formal ontologies e g sieber et al 2011 formal ontologies encode the domain knowledge of a community into a set of logical statements using classes properties and instances uschold and gruninger 1996 importantly formal ontologies are machine processable and can be used for discovery and harmonization sieber et al 2011 show how formal ontologies can be used for data discovery and harmonization to some extent across multiple databases of chinese history wellen and sieber 2013 question the use of formal ontologies of earth features due to significant natural language differences of those features however in a more restrictive context of sharing and harmonizing data across cz networks formal ontologies may be a useful tool nascent examples of such an ontology exist for instance the open biological and biomedical ontology obo foundry has an environment ontology envo buttigieg et al 2016 but it was not created to help scientists collaborate and is likely too broad for the purposes of cz synthesis integration activities nasa s jet propulsion laboratory has created an ontology of earth science concepts called sweet semantic web for earth and environment technology digiuseppe et al 2014 that might be a promising start to a community ontology to enable data sharing and harmonization across cz networks future research is needed to examine whether formal ontologies are appropriate underpinnings for data harmonization tools or whether a schema driven approach such as the sodah project might be more appropriate or whether other avenues may be needed 6 1 3 towards a new class of cz information scientists given that data harmonization and integration were identified as a bottleneck for any cz synthesis effort and the highly multidisciplinary field of cz science the cyberseminar series cuahsi 2021b clearly highlighted the need for a new class of cz information scientists this meant involving scientist users in a hands on way in the design process of the data portals working hand in hand with the database professionals to make sure that technical proficiency meets the users needs community feedback from the survey further implied looking beyond researchers and actively engaging database users and creators such as data scientists managers and state agencies such synergies are expected to better connect long term data portals with short term and or project based data collection and may even incentivize data rescue i e merging and harmonizing existing sparse records into a long term dataset meeting the aforementioned standards in the long term cz science as a community of practice should integrate more advanced data literacy training for students and early career researchers a move in this direction will help to develop a new generation of cz scientists with a more holistic skillset 6 1 4 an open international network of networks framework as a way forward to sustain cz science into the future we need an open inclusive international network of networks framework that helps overcome some of the issues that limit our progress such a framework is expected to not only promote synthesis integration activities across cz networks but also open new sources of funding build personal connections and human to human interaction as well as engage cz site managers and stakeholders at a level not previously accomplished the inclusive and open nature of such a network is expected to better address inequalities in the sciences such as gender e g ranganathan et al 2021 and ethnic and racial diversity e g bernard and cooperdock 2018 and improve the representation of women of color and white women in these fields as well as promote ethnic and racial diversity networking with diverse stakeholders e g women in science underrepresented communities is not only intended to create awareness regarding diverse needs but to build partnerships that potentially contribute to more innovative ways of coordinating and sharing research but perhaps more importantly such a network is expected to leave behind a multigenerational legacy by training educating and mentoring future cz scientists and act as a host for transferable tools data and workflows fig 3 training for students and early career researchers as well as sharing of educational resources within this networking framework will be instrumental in propagating the novel tools data and workflows developed herein we expect such cross network activities to at a minimum enable sharing of education materials enhance engagement in cross country citizen science projects and increase participation in international summer schools consequently a network based approach is expected to enhance interpersonal interactions and establish career spanning collegial relationships and friendships the power of such a network lies in its ability to mobilize people and further empower cz students early careers and scientists to pursue the pathbreaking questions that address the most complex as well as socially relevant problems of our time one approach to facilitating a global network of networks framework is through the use of icon science principles these principles focus on the intentional design of research efforts to be integrated across disciplines and scales coordinated through the use of consistent methods open throughout the research lifecycle including publication of fair metadata and data and networked with a broad range of stakeholders to understand and respond to collective needs priorities perspectives and risks goldman et al 2022 for example the coordinated component of icon is focused on intentional a priori planning and implementation of strategies to generate fair metadata and data that are generated in a standardized format as well as consistently structured upon publication further these consistent protocols are expected to be openly shared and framed based on multidisciplinary i e integrated feedback consensus i e networked using the icon principles together is therefore meant to enable development of knowledge data and models that are generalizable or transferable across diverse settings additionally icon is meant to enable research outcomes that are mutually beneficial across stakeholders ranging from core research teams to land owners managers to the general public producing research outcomes that are transferable and mutually beneficial does not happen by chance it requires a priori planning and design which can again be facilitated by using icon principles to help build an international networks of networks for the cz using a networked approach is vital to this process whereby open discussions and anonymous reporting across stakeholders can be used to understand needs and collectively work towards solutions although icon can be applied to any scientific domain it can be a particularly powerful tool for cz science due to the diversity of systems people priorities and limitations that need to be considered collectively to meet both fundamental and applied science challenges associated with the cz in this regard the icon science cooperative https www pnnl gov projects icon science is developing open resources to facilitate the use of icon principles by researchers at any career or project stage e g developing proposals modifying existing projects the cz community can use and contribute to these resources to facilitate the intentional development of networks of networks and enhance the benefit of these efforts across a broad range of stakeholders 6 2 from observatory to living lab using czos to address global societal challenges many czos have been intentionally designed to monitor how human actions affect the coupled processes in the cz e g agricultural areas and managed watersheds and herein we propose that these individual sites and cz networks together can help illuminate how humans affect the cz across much broader gradients of climate land use management and soil type than can be investigated at a single site in this regard a network of czos can provide important opportunities to identify the most urgent gaps or an indivisible problem that cannot be tackled by a single person network agency as well as address pressing science questions and societal challenges for many different environments fig 3 for instance the united nations has set 17 sustainable development goals un sdgs to address the challenges posed by human impact on many of the earth s cycles including the water cycle abbott et al 2019b and cz science is directly or indirectly relevant to many of these with a network of czo sites in many different countries it could be possible to treat a network of czo sites as a living lab where design thinking see section 4 3 and other approaches could be employed to inform policy development management approaches management tools and other socio ecological innovations in support of climate change issues environmental sustainability and other relevant societal challenges indeed czos may be ideal locations for inventing and prototyping new ideas regarding socio ecosystem management and cross site cross network collaborations could test more broadly ideas that are promising at a small number of sites for instance incentive programs to help farmers adopt conservation nutrient management have the potential to mitigate some issues associated with eutrophication of water bodies wilson et al 2019 or promote sustainable water use that helps improve long term water resources as well as reduce farmers socioeconomic vulnerability fischer et al 2022 one question that arises is how best to encourage farmers to do so this requires both consideration of incentives which differ drastically in different jurisdictions and contexts the biophysical environment which also differs and through strong partnerships between the researchers and the community a recent study on agroecological transitions in vineyards showed that the farmer s perception of risk could be mitigated by promoting environmental values as well as solutions to policy problems by including a team of ecologists and social scientists teschner and orenstein 2022 in another context precision agriculture is becoming more ubiquitous in a wide diversity of sites and has been the subject of comparison studies e g antle et al 2017 yet there has been little work to evaluate how a move to precision agriculture may affect the overall functioning of the cz a network of networks framework can provide an important opportunity to close this gap by examining how human management decisions and adaptation strategies impact cz functioning at a global scale last but not the least a global network of czo sites provides the necessary infrastructure to better understand the functioning of the cz and share resources both of which are essential to tackle high priority science questions and societal challenges e g lü et al 2017 however this must be followed by closer links between science management and policy to improve decision making banwart et al 2011 hence the understanding gained about cz processes and functions at a minimum needs to be incorporated into quantitative decision making tools designed to help environmental managers stakeholders and policy makers make decisions about adaptation and mitigation strategies e g banwart et al 2013 making this science society integration will also crucially rely on the partnership with social sciences as discussed in section 5 3 7 summary given the inherent diversity of czos and variability in governing cz processes a systematic approach to tackle these challenges is needed with future efforts decreasing the fragmentation of individual czos and watershed sites as well as openly sharing data models and tools now more than ever there is increasing recognition that close coordination and integration across the global distribution of watershed sites and cz networks can significantly advance science provide opportunities to create a shared vision learn from each other s mistakes open doors for broad perspectives and ultimately address regional and national priorities in this regard a national academies of sciences engineering and medicine report nasem 2020 made the case for an all hands on deck moment defined as bringing together a demographically and scientifically diverse group of critical zone and watershed scientists working both individually and in collaborative networks to create and deploy cutting edge analytical computational and field based research methods in an open environment where success builds expeditiously on success the path forward should include more holistic cross site cross network studies that aim to advance our understanding of cz and watersheds in response to environmental technological and societal changes and build the next generation of tools that are broadly applicable and transferable there is an urgent need to build such a network of networks for several reasons firstly increasing intensity and frequency of disturbances are pushing these systems to tipping points such that the future functioning of these systems is uncertain with consequences for energy and water cycles global distribution of nutrients and human health armstrong mckay et al 2022 a formal systematic i e coordinated approach is therefore needed to work across these cz sites and networks to develop a robust predictive understanding of how cz and watersheds function and respond to compounding and co occurring disturbances secondly new techniques and technologies are providing observations that were previously not possible such as eddy covariance based measurements of n2o and other trace gasses and fiber optic based measurements of soil temperature chemical and biological properties that can be useful indicators of global climate change baldocchi 2014 hubbard et al 2020 additionally if these unique and novel watershed observations across networks sites are to be analyzed through ai ml based approaches such approaches hold the potential to transform our understanding prediction and management of cz watershed behavior through the rapid identification of system tipping point precursors the assimilation of diverse multi scale data into models for near real time prediction and water management and the ability for models to inform real time optimization of autonomous sensing systems from local to regional to global scales lastly building on the success of these approaches and a formal global network of networks collaboration would significantly advance the understanding of environments that are extremely vulnerable and changing at a rapid pace such as those associated with coastal regions mountain watersheds arid lands agriculture urban ecosystems among others declaration of competing interest the authors declare

2262,the interactions between saline seawater and fresh groundwater occurs in subterranean estuaries stes triggering complex hydrological and geochemical processes these processes are influenced by multiple hydrological factors including tidal amplitude a freshwater head h seawater diffusion coefficient d and slope ratio besides accurate predictions of the geochemical processes in stes require validating the hydrological estimations by the geochemical models against that by conventionally used hydrological models toughreact is employed to numerically study the effects of these hydrological factors on groundwater flow and salt transport in stes at the quasi static state the spatiotemporal distributions of the upper saline plume usp and the saltwater wedge sw and the water fluxes at the surface water groundwater interface agree with previous results confirming the applicability of toughreact for submarine groundwater discharge sgd simulations increasing tidal amplitude inland freshwater head seawater diffusion coefficient and beach slope ratio enhances the exchange of groundwater and surface water strengthens the density driven circulation ddc of seawater and alleviates the saltwater intrusion si by shrinking the sw the rise of tidal amplitude and seawater diffusion coefficient and the reduction of freshwater head and beach slope ratio intensify the seawater exchange across the beach mainly by increasing the flux of tide driven circulation tdc of seawater but reducing the freshwater flux these findings are beneficial for better understanding the hydrological processes of sgd and serve as a benchmark for predicting the water and salt flow across stes using toughreact this validation expands the numerical toolsets used for quantifying the hydrological processes and enables future analysis of the geochemical processes occurred in stes keywords submarine groundwater discharge seawater intrusion groundwater surface water interaction toughreact hydrodynamic processes geochemistry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction more than 60 of the global population lives in coastal areas especially within 100 km from the coastlines relying mostly on shallow groundwater resources martínez et al 2007 seawater intrusion si and submarine groundwater discharge sgd occur in the coastal aquifer systems xin et al 2022 threatening these critical freshwater resources robinson et al 2018 werner et al 2013 salinity seawater and fresh groundwater complexly interact with each other via sgd and si alorda kleinglass et al 2021 shen et al 2022 the sgd drives the discharge of not only a large volume of freshwater but also terrestrial geochemical substances into the ocean luijendijk et al 2020 santos et al 2021 through a mixing zone between discharging freshwater and recirculating seawater termed as subterranean estuary moore 1999 the flux of sgd may be even greater than that of surface water through rivers and estuaries termed as surface estuary moore 1996 moore et al 2008 yuan et al 2022 for example the sgd was estimated to be 40 and 80 160 of the river water discharging flux into the south atlantic bight moore 1996 and atlantic ocean moore et al 2008 respectively and as a major source of dissolved organic matter and nutrients to arctic coastal waters connolly et al 2020 and the mediterranean sea rodellas et al 2015 typically the interaction between terrestrial freshwater and seawater in coastal areas involves variably saturated variable density flow through porous media with the mixing between the two waters resulting in complexly hydrodynamic processes robinson et al 2018 werner et al 2013 xin et al 2022 generally the driving forces own terrestrial and marine components the terrestrial forces mainly include terrestrial freshwater level changes freshwater density and thermal gradients robinson et al 2018 werner et al 2013 xin et al 2022 while the marine driving forces mainly include short period changes in seawater level such as tides and waves and long period changes such as seasonal and interannual fluctuations in seawater level and sea level rise with global warming robinson et al 2018 werner et al 2013 xin et al 2022 the temperature difference between seawater and terrestrial freshwater nguyen et al 2020 pu et al 2020 and the topographic relief of the seabed robinson et al 2006 also cause local scale hydrodynamic processes in addition the non homogeneity and anisotropy of the aquifer aggravate the complexity of the hydrodynamic processes during sgd robinson et al 2018 werner et al 2013 xin et al 2022 groundwater surface water interactions in stes are impacted by several factors such as tidal amplitude freshwater head seawater diffusion coefficient and slope ratio related methods include field measurements of hydrodynamic parameters geophysical inversion and geochemical tracing but all with large uncertainties werner et al 2013 xin et al 2022 it is difficult and or high cost to obtain spatial and temporal data of high precision across the section via these methods limiting comprehensive research on sgd processes and systematical understanding of the related mechanisms numerical simulation provides an alternative way xin et al 2022 the groundwater flow and salt transport in stes with tidal and wave forces were simulated by seawat and sutra and the driven mechanisms were unraveled robinson et al 2007 2006 xin et al 2010 the mixing between saltwater and freshwater in a sandy beach aquifer over diurnal spring neap and seasonal cycles was numerically studied heiss and michael 2014 nguyen et al 2020 analyzed the effects of temperature and tide on coastal unconfined aquifers using sutra ms with tidal force shen et al 2022 studied the effects of land reclamation with changes in slope ratio and saturated hydraulic conductivity on a subterranean estuary with sutra however the impact factors are partly considered during these studies on sgd in stes a few hydrological models including marun seawat sutra and pht3d are commonly used for sgd studies xin et al 2022 despite their popularities in simulating the hydrologic and salt transport processes in stes these models have their limitations for example seawat and pht3d own a limitation in modeling variably saturated flow sutra does not implement geochemical processes and marun is limited in 2d simulation the recently developed toughreact is robust in simulating coupled hydrodynamic thermodynamic and geochemical processes from tough2 transport of unsaturated groundwater and heat version 2 a multi dimensional numerical model for simulating coupled transport of water vapor non condensable gas and heat in porous and fractured media pruess and moridis 2012 toughreact was developed as a numerical simulation program for chemically reactive non isothermal flows of multiphase fluids in porous and fractured media xu et al 2012 this model has been applied to a variety of reactive fluid and geochemical transport problems under natural conditions including nitrogen cycling in the vadose zone and co2 disposal in a deep saline aquifer singleton et al 2004 sonnenthal et al 2005 xu et al 2009 zheng et al 2009 however toughreact is rarely used for sgd analysis despite it being a well rounded model with wide applications therefore the objectives of this study are 1 to develop a systematic method using toughreact to simulate the hydrological processes in stes and benchmark the estimations and 2 to numerically explore the groundwater flow and salt transport in stes by considering the influencing factors of tidal amplitude freshwater head seawater diffusion coefficient and beach slope ratio 2 methods 2 1 governing equations the flow and transport equations in toughreact are based on the principle of mass or energy for heat flow conservation pruess and moridis 2012 xu et al 2012 the model includes various equation of state eos modules representing different fluid mixtures the eos7 module considering the aqueous phase as a mixture of pure water and brine such as sodium chloride nacl solution pruess and moridis 2012 is employed in this study the brine mass fraction is used to describe the salinity of the aqueous phase and the mixture density and viscosity can be obtained based on the fraction between the pure water and the brine under the isothermal condition the governing equations for water and bulk salt transport are listed as eqs 1 3 1 ϕ s ρ mix t ρ mix v mix q mix 2 ϕ s ρ mix t ρ mix v mix ϕ τ d seawater i

dynamics during sgd in stes by tidal force are simulated by a 2 d numerical model setup in toughreact referring to the work by robinson et al 2007 and xin et al 2010 the 2 d domain has a length of 200 m with a surface water region overlying the groundwater region fig 1 the surface water region has a height of 0 5 m and the groundwater region has a depth of 30 m on the left and 25 m on the right the beach slope ratio is 1 10 the lower left point is selected as the origin of the coordinate so that all coordinate values are non negative the domain is discretized by 100 identical elements in the horizontal direction while the surface water region and groundwater region are discretized by 1 and 60 identical elements in the vertical direction respectively this results in 100 surface water elements with the size dz dx of 0 5 m 2 m and 6000 groundwater elements with the dx of 2 m but varying dz due to different aquifer depth on the left and right sides of the domain the surface water boundary is prescribed with a static atmospheric pressure of 1 013 105 pa no flow is allowed at the bottom boundary the left and right vertical boundaries represent the terrestrial inland supplying freshwater and the ocean supplying seawater exerting hydrostatic heads of 28 5 m and 28 m higher than atmospheric pressure head respectively table 1 note that the hydraulic head report hereafter refers to a value higher than the static atmospheric pressure head the surface water region is initially filled with air the left 170 m in the horizontal direction of the groundwater region is initially filled with freshwater and the right 30 m with seawater preliminarily simulation confirms that the simulation result is independent of the initial condition a semi diurnal tidal boundary at the seaward side is implemented by applying a time varying head eq 8 to the rightmost element of the surface water region fig 1 8 h a s i n w t h where h is the time varying seawater head a is the tidal amplitude w is the tidal angular frequency of 12 567 d corresponding to a period of 0 5 d and h is the mean seawater head of 28 m note that toughreact does not provide time dependent dirichlet conditions and so this time dependent dirichlet condition is implemented by the provided time dependent sinks or sources q t i d e e m e l e n t in the large tide element which is calculated based on

s 106 m d is assigned to all the surface water elements allowing for nearly instantaneous transmission of this time varying heads to the submerged interface between groundwater and surface water robinson et al 2007 xin et al 2010 as the hydrodynamic dispersion process is not explicitly implemented in toughreact the upstream weighting scheme is enabled to make use of the numerical dispersion along the horizontal α x dx 2 and vertical α z dz 2 directions xu et al 2012 this approximation allows the width of the mixing zone to be effectively controlled by the element size despite that the salt dispersion along the saltwater wedge may not be well represented as the local flow direction is diagonal the model determines the time step by the courant friedrichs lewy condition with a ceiling value of 200 s and considers a simulation time span of 365 days at the end of the simulation a quasi static state is reached where the change of seawater mass fraction is minimal this simulation case defined above is considered as the base case with the employed parameters and units shown in table 1 besides the base case a series of simulation cases are carried out for 365 days by adopting the same configuration as the base case except for a change in one parameter table 2 the varying parameters include tidal amplitude freshwater head seawater diffusion coefficient and slope ratio in order to investigate the individual influence of each parameter on the results table 3 the upper saline plume usp and salt wedge sw regions are determined as the regions with seawater mass fraction greater than 0 2 the centroid and spread are traced to quantify the location and extent of the formed usp and sw regions robinson et al 2007 the centroid coordinates in the horizontal and vertical directions c x c z are calculated by normalizing the first moments m 1 x m 1 z by the zeroth moment m 0 as shown in eq 12 c x m 1 x m o ϕ f seawater x z x d x d z ϕ f seawater x z d x d z 12 c z m 1 z m o ϕ f seawater x z z d x d z ϕ f seawater x z d x d z similarly the spread variance in the horizontal and vertical directions σ x σ z is calculated by normalizing the second central moments m 2 x m 2 z by the zeroth moment m 0 as shown in eq 13 σ x m 2 x m o ϕ f seawater x z x x c 2 d x d z ϕ f seawater x z d x d z 13 σ z m 2 z m o ϕ f seawater x z z z c 2 d x d z ϕ f seawater x z d x d z the toe location is determined as the horizontal coordinate of the cell in the bottom layer with a seawater mass fraction of 0 5 and the seawater intrusion length is determined as the horizontal distance between the toe location and the lowest point of the slope the sgd is composed of terrestrially derived freshwater and recirculated seawater and the latter includes density driven circulation ddc and tide driven circulation tdc so there are five types of water fluxes namely total water freshwater seawater and ddc and tdc of seawater and four types of flux ratios specifically the ratios of freshwater seawater and ddc and tdc of seawater to the total water shen et al 2022 3 results 3 1 submarine groundwater discharge with tidal force for the case without tidal force a classical wedge shaped interface between freshwater and seawater saltwater wedge sw is formed at the steady state fig 2 a the seawater flows downward from the seabed then circulates upward following the sw and finally discharges at the beach the freshwater flows horizontally from the inland boundary then moves upward following the sw fig 2c and e before discharge on the beach at locations landward to the seawater discharging areas the liquid saturation and seawater mass fraction at the ground surface above the sw region increase from the freshwater side to the seawater side fig 2c the water discharge from the beach is dominated by freshwater fig 2e for the case with tidal effect at the quasi static state a region with high seawater mass fraction so called the upper saline plume usp is formed above the sw fig 2b the freshwater discharges between the usp and sw below the minimum seawater level which is called freshwater tube ft the formation of usp pushes the ft and the toe location seaward reducing seawater intrusion length sil fig 2b the liquid saturation at the ground surface increases from the freshwater side to the seawater side fig 2d the seawater mass fraction reaches unity at the usp and the seabed and remains low at the inland surface and the freshwater discharging beach fig 2d two seawater circulation cells were identified with tidal forcing enabled fig 2f the tide driven circulation tdc over the usp region with a dominant flux ratio of 52 9 table 3 and the density driven circulation ddc at the seawater aquifer with a flux ratio of 20 7 table 3 this results in the flux ratio of seawater of 73 6 and of freshwater of 26 4 respectively fig 3 shows the time dependent variations of the seawater mass fraction in the aquifer left column the liquid saturation and seawater mass fraction at the ground surface middle column and the instant water flux across the ground surface right column for the base case in a tide cycle after reaching the quasi static state the usp ft sw sil and seawater mass fraction at the ground surface are relatively stable over a tidal cycle figs 3 and 4 with seawater increase from mean to the maximum level the seawater infiltrates into the aquifer from the inundated beach surface filling in the unsaturated zone rows 1 and 2 in fig 3 leading to the gradual rise of the liquid saturation at the ground surface above the usp x between 120 m and 140 m subsequently the seawater recharge flux declines with the seawater level down rows 3 and 4 in fig 3 with the seawater level decrease from mean to minimum value rows 5 and 6 in fig 3 the infiltrated seawater discharges at the lower intertidal zone and freshwater discharges over the ft region respectively as the seawater level decreases the discharge flux rises with less water recharge the discharge also reduces the liquid saturation in the intertidal zone subsequently the discharge flux declines with the rising of seawater level rows 7 and 8 in fig 3 the ddc of seawater mainly occurs at the seawater part near the mean seawater level with a flux lower than that of tdc during a tidal cycle the areas the mean seawater mass fractions and the centroids and spreads of the usp and sw regions vary temporally with the seawater level but with a relatively small difference of 1 between the maximum and minimum value fig 4a l the toe of the wedge remains stagnant over the tidal cycles fig 4r these phenomena indicate the simulation after 365 days has reached a quasi static state the phases of the area fig 4a and g the mean seawater mass fraction fig 4b and h and the centroid movement fig 4d and j and spread fig 4e k f and l of the usp and sw are slightly behind the phase of the seawater level change while the centroid movements in the horizontal direction of the usp and sw regions fig 4c and i are largely behind the phase of the seawater level change the fluxes fig 4m q of the total water freshwater seawater and tdc and ddc of seawater are behind the phase of the seawater level change by nearly a tidal cycle 3 2 influencing factors figs 5 and s1 show the influence of tidal amplitude on the water and salt dynamics in the coastal aquifer as the tidal amplitude increases the usp moves seaward fig 5 c and downward fig 5d with an area enlarged evidently fig 5a b e and f and the sw moves in the same direction as the usp fig 5i and j but with a shrinking area fig 5g h k and l with the rise of tidal amplitude the flux of seawater and tdc and ddc of seawater increases overall fig 5o q while the freshwater flux decreases fig 5n resulting in the increase of total water flux along the surface water groundwater interface fig 5m with tidal amplitude increase the flux ratio of freshwater and ddc of seawater decreases fig 5n and q and that of seawater and tdc of seawater increases fig 5o and p these results are consistent with the findings in robinson et al 2007 the peak flux value of total water and seawater at the tidal amplitude of 1 1 m can be mainly attributed to the peak flux value of tdc of seawater which is caused by a largely overestimated seawater influx at the inundated beach surface fig s1 this also leads to the overestimation of the flux ratio of seawater and tdc of seawater and the underestimation of the flux ratio of freshwater and ddc of seawater at the tidal amplitude of 1 1 m the seawater intrusion length decreases and the toe location increases with the tidal amplitude rising fig 5r the influence of freshwater head on the water and salt dynamics in the coastal aquifer is shown in figs 6 and s2 the freshwater flux and its ratio own a linear variation with the freshwater head fig 6 n as the freshwater head elevates the usp is squeezed by the enlarged ft and hence moves landward fig 6c and upward fig 6d with decreasing area fig 6a b e and f likewise the sw moves seaward fig 6i and upward fig 6j with decreasing area fig 6g h k and l mainly in the horizontal direction the enhanced freshwater flux leads to the retreat of the toe of the sw resulting in a slightly upward movement of the sw fig 6j and l at the ground surface the total water and freshwater flux and the freshwater flux ratio increase fig 6m and n with rising freshwater head and hence the flux of seawater and tdc of seawater and their ratio decrease fig 6o and p the ddc flux of seawater and its ratio fluctuate slightly suggesting the saltwater circulation in the sw is not affected by enhanced freshwater flow fig 6q the seawater intrusion length decreases and the toe location increases linearly with inland fresh groundwater head rise fig 6r the results agree with those in robinson et al 2007 the influence of seawater diffusion coefficient on the water and salt dynamics in the coastal aquifer is shown in figs 7 and s3 overall as the seawater diffusion coefficient increases the mixing zone around the margin of the usp thickens forming an enlarged usp fig 7 c e and f with reduced seawater fraction fig 7b and a centroid shifted downward fig 7c and d likewise the sw moves seaward fig 7i and upward fig 7j with decreasing area fig 7g h k and l mainly in the horizontal direction the total water flux increases with the seawater diffusion coefficient rising as well as the flux and its ratio of seawater including tdc and ddc while the flux and its ratio of freshwater decrease fig 7m q this is because the enlarged mixing zone strengthens the tdc and ddc of seawater the seawater intrusion length decreases with the seawater diffusion coefficient increase and the toe location increases fig 7r the slope ratio is altered by only changing the horizontal length of the slope zone thus altering the horizontal coordinate of points located in the slope and seawater part regions therefore the horizontal centroid of usp and sw regions relative to the horizontal coordinate of seawater reaching the slope at the mean water level is calculated figs 8 and s4 show the influence of slope ratio on the water and salt dynamics in the coastal aquifer as the slope ratio increases the usp moves landward fig 8 c and upward fig 8d and the sw moves landward fig 8i and downward fig 8j both with a decreasing area fig 8a b e f g h k and l the flux of total water freshwater and ddc of seawater increases with slope ratio rise as well as the related ratio while the flux of seawater and tdc of seawater fluctuate both with decreasing flux ratio fig 8m q the seawater intrusion length and the toe location decrease with the slope ratio increase fig 8r 4 discussions and implications hydrodynamic dispersion is not implemented in toughreact the upstream weighting scheme is enabled to make use of the numerical dispersion to mimic the extent of hydrodynamic dispersion and the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities can be determined by the sizes of dx and dz respectively however this method is found effective only when the water flow is in parallel with the axes different from the sgd where water flows along the sw are diagonal to the axis therefore we decide to use small and fixed grid sizes among all cases to minimize and uniform the impact of numerical dispersion while considering the diffusion coefficient in the model as the effective diffusion dispersion coefficient sensitivity analysis on the effective diffusion dispersion coefficient was carried out to identify the influence on the water and salt dynamics in the coastal aquifer figs 7 and s3 results show that the formed usp by tidal effect pushes the ft and toe location toward the seawater side alleviating the seawater intrusion into the aquifer after it reaches the quasi static state the usp ft sw and sil change less the tdc of seawater recharges into the aquifer when the seawater level exceeds the mean seawater level and the freshwater and seawater discharge from the aquifer when the seawater level is lower than the mean value with the water flux fluctuating with the seawater level these findings agree well with previous results heiss and michael 2014 nguyen et al 2020 robinson et al 2007 2006 shen et al 2022 xin et al 2010 indicating the applicability of toughreact for sgd simulation and expanding the application area of toughreact the rising of tidal amplitude freshwater head seawater diffusion coefficient and slope ratio reduces the seawater intrusion length but with different impacts on usp and sw table 4 the rising of the freshwater head and slope ratio pushes the usp toward the freshwater side and upward with a shrinking area the rising of tidal amplitude pushes the usp toward the seawater side and downward with the expanding area the rising of seawater diffusion coefficient pushes the usp downward with the expanding area this indicates that the usp shrinks and expands along with its location up and down respectively the rising of freshwater head and seawater diffusion coefficient pushes the sw toward the seawater side and upward the rising of tidal amplitude pushes the sw toward the seawater side and downward and the rising of slope ratio pushes the sw toward the freshwater side and downward all with the shrinking area this demonstrates that the rise of these variables alleviates the seawater intrusion length mainly by reducing the sw area attention should be paid to the expanding area of usp as the formed usp itself means seawater mixture in the shallow groundwater this has implications for groundwater resources management and protection in coastal areas in terms of water flux the rises of the four variables all raise the total water flux but with different details in the flux and its ratio of the four sub types of water table 4 the rising of tidal amplitude raises the flux and its ratio of seawater including tdc and ddc of seawater except for the ddc flux ratio of seawater but reduces those of freshwater the rising of freshwater head linearly raises the flux and its ratio of freshwater but reduces the others the rising of seawater diffusion coefficient raises the flux and its ratio of all types of seawater but reduces the freshwater flux and its ratio the rising of slope ratio raises the flux and its ratio of freshwater and ddc of seawater but reduces those of seawater and tdc of seawater overall this indicates that the rising of these variables mainly raises the flux of total water and ddc of seawater while the rise of tidal amplitude and seawater diffusion coefficient and the decline of freshwater head and slope ratio raise the seawater flux and its ratio mainly by increasing the flux and its ratio of tdc of seawater but reduce the freshwater flux and its ratio table 4 these findings are beneficial for better understanding and further predicting the hydrodynamic processes of sgd in stes the sgd will drive large amounts of multiple terrestrial geochemical substances and the impacts of these factors mentioned above have significant implications on the discharge flux of these terrestrial geochemical substances to the ocean the sgd in stes involves not only hydrodynamic processes but also the transport and reaction of geochemical species which is a hydro geo chemical coupling process with complex mechanisms recent studies mainly focus on the hydrodynamic and salt transport processes during sgd but the geochemical processes are less involved due to the difficulty of the coupling among them toughreact owns the functions of simulation of geochemical transport and reaction coupling processes which can potentially be employed to study the hydro geo chemical processes during sgd on the foundation of these results in this study in addition the terrestrial freshwater input is commonly irregular due to rainfall recharge evapotranspiration and anthropic groundwater exploitation robinson et al 2018 werner et al 2013 xin et al 2022 while fixed freshwater head at the inland boundary is assumed in this study irregular freshwater input will be involved in further sgd studies so that the simulation results are much closer to the reality 5 conclusions by employing toughreact the effects of the variables of tidal amplitude freshwater head seawater diffusion coefficient and slope ratio on groundwater flow and salt transport in stes with tidal force were numerically studied with the main conclusions in the following at the quasi static state with tide effect the spatiotemporal distributions of the upper saline plume usp and the saltwater wedge sw and the fluxes at the surface water groundwater interface are coincident with previous results indicating the applicability of toughreact for sgd simulation and expanding the application area of toughreact increasing the tidal amplitude inland freshwater head seawater diffusion and the beach slope enhances the exchange of groundwater and surface water strengthens the ddc of seawater and alleviates the si by shrinking the sw increasing the tidal amplitude and seawater diffusion coefficient and reducing the freshwater head and slope ratio will raise the seawater flux and its ratio mainly by increasing the flux and its ratio of tdc of seawater but will reduce the freshwater flux and its ratio the sgd is a typically coupled process between hydrodynamics and geochemistry these findings own great implications for better understanding these processes and the related mechanisms in stes further studies on the hydro geo chemical coupling processes during sgd

2262,the interactions between saline seawater and fresh groundwater occurs in subterranean estuaries stes triggering complex hydrological and geochemical processes these processes are influenced by multiple hydrological factors including tidal amplitude a freshwater head h seawater diffusion coefficient d and slope ratio besides accurate predictions of the geochemical processes in stes require validating the hydrological estimations by the geochemical models against that by conventionally used hydrological models toughreact is employed to numerically study the effects of these hydrological factors on groundwater flow and salt transport in stes at the quasi static state the spatiotemporal distributions of the upper saline plume usp and the saltwater wedge sw and the water fluxes at the surface water groundwater interface agree with previous results confirming the applicability of toughreact for submarine groundwater discharge sgd simulations increasing tidal amplitude inland freshwater head seawater diffusion coefficient and beach slope ratio enhances the exchange of groundwater and surface water strengthens the density driven circulation ddc of seawater and alleviates the saltwater intrusion si by shrinking the sw the rise of tidal amplitude and seawater diffusion coefficient and the reduction of freshwater head and beach slope ratio intensify the seawater exchange across the beach mainly by increasing the flux of tide driven circulation tdc of seawater but reducing the freshwater flux these findings are beneficial for better understanding the hydrological processes of sgd and serve as a benchmark for predicting the water and salt flow across stes using toughreact this validation expands the numerical toolsets used for quantifying the hydrological

the coastlines relying mostly on shallow groundwater resources martínez et al 2007 seawater intrusion si and submarine groundwater discharge sgd occur in the coastal aquifer systems xin et al 2022 threatening these critical freshwater resources robinson et al 2018 werner et al 2013 salinity seawater and fresh groundwater complexly interact with each other via sgd and si alorda kleinglass et al 2021 shen et al 2022 the sgd drives the discharge of not only a large volume of freshwater but also terrestrial geochemical substances into the ocean luijendijk et al 2020 santos et al 2021 through a mixing zone between discharging freshwater and recirculating seawater termed as subterranean estuary moore 1999 the flux of sgd may be even greater than that of surface water through rivers and estuaries termed as surface estuary moore 1996 moore et al 2008 yuan et al 2022 for example the sgd was estimated to be 40 and 80 160 of the river water discharging flux into the south atlantic bight moore 1996 and atlantic ocean moore et al 2008 respectively and as a major source of dissolved organic matter and nutrients to arctic coastal waters connolly et al 2020 and the mediterranean sea rodellas et al 2015 typically the interaction between terrestrial freshwater and seawater in coastal areas involves variably saturated variable density flow through porous media with the mixing between the two waters resulting in complexly hydrodynamic processes robinson et al 2018 werner et al 2013 xin et al 2022 generally the driving forces own terrestrial and marine components the terrestrial forces mainly include terrestrial freshwater level changes freshwater density and thermal gradients robinson et al 2018 werner et al 2013 xin et al 2022 while the marine driving forces mainly include short period changes in seawater level such as tides and waves and long period changes such as seasonal and interannual fluctuations in seawater level and sea level rise with global warming robinson et al 2018 werner et al 2013 xin et al 2022 the temperature difference between seawater and terrestrial freshwater nguyen et al 2020 pu et al 2020 and the topographic relief of the seabed robinson et al 2006 also cause local scale hydrodynamic processes in addition the non homogeneity and anisotropy of the aquifer aggravate the complexity of the hydrodynamic processes during sgd robinson et al 2018 werner et al 2013 xin et al 2022 groundwater surface water interactions in stes are impacted by several factors such as tidal amplitude freshwater head seawater diffusion coefficient and slope ratio related methods include field measurements of hydrodynamic parameters geophysical inversion and geochemical tracing but all with large uncertainties werner et al 2013 xin et al 2022 it is difficult and or high cost to obtain spatial and temporal data of high precision across the section via these methods limiting comprehensive research on sgd processes and systematical understanding of the related mechanisms numerical simulation provides an alternative way xin et al 2022 the groundwater flow and salt transport in stes with tidal and wave forces were simulated by seawat and sutra and the driven mechanisms were unraveled robinson et al 2007 2006 xin et al 2010 the mixing between saltwater and freshwater in a sandy beach aquifer over diurnal spring neap and seasonal cycles was numerically studied heiss and michael 2014 nguyen et al 2020 analyzed the effects of temperature and tide on coastal unconfined aquifers using sutra ms with tidal force shen et al 2022 studied the effects of land reclamation with changes in slope ratio and saturated hydraulic conductivity on a subterranean estuary with sutra however the impact factors are partly considered during these studies on sgd in stes a few hydrological models including marun seawat sutra and pht3d are commonly used for sgd studies xin et al 2022 despite their popularities in simulating the hydrologic and salt transport processes in stes these models have their limitations for example seawat and pht3d own a limitation in modeling variably saturated flow sutra does not implement geochemical processes and marun is limited in 2d simulation the recently developed toughreact is robust in simulating coupled hydrodynamic thermodynamic and geochemical processes from tough2 transport of unsaturated groundwater and heat version 2 a multi dimensional numerical model for simulating coupled transport of water vapor non condensable gas and heat in porous and fractured media pruess and moridis 2012 toughreact was developed as a numerical simulation program for chemically reactive non isothermal flows of multiphase fluids in porous and fractured media xu et al 2012 this model has been applied to a variety of reactive fluid and geochemical transport problems under natural conditions including nitrogen cycling in the vadose zone and co2 disposal in a deep saline aquifer singleton et al 2004 sonnenthal et al 2005 xu et al 2009 zheng et al 2009 however toughreact is rarely used for sgd analysis despite it being a well rounded model with wide applications therefore the objectives of this study are 1 to develop a systematic method using toughreact to simulate the hydrological processes in stes and benchmark the estimations and 2 to numerically explore the groundwater flow and salt transport in stes by considering the influencing factors of tidal amplitude freshwater head seawater diffusion coefficient and beach slope ratio 2 methods 2 1 governing equations the flow and transport equations in toughreact are based on the principle of mass or energy for heat flow conservation pruess and moridis 2012 xu et al 2012 the model includes various equation of state eos modules representing different fluid mixtures the eos7 module considering the aqueous phase as a mixture of pure water and brine such as sodium chloride nacl solution pruess and moridis 2012 is employed in this study the brine mass fraction is used to describe the salinity of the aqueous phase and the mixture density and viscosity can be obtained based on the fraction between the pure water and the brine under the isothermal condition the governing equations for water and bulk salt transport are listed as eqs 1 3 1 ϕ s ρ mix t ρ mix v mix q mix 2 ϕ s ρ mix t ρ mix v mix ϕ τ d seawater i

dynamics during sgd in stes by tidal force are simulated by a 2 d numerical model setup in toughreact referring to the work by robinson et al 2007 and xin et al 2010 the 2 d domain has a length of 200 m with a surface water region overlying the groundwater region fig 1 the surface water region has a height of 0 5 m and the groundwater region has a depth of 30 m on the left and 25 m on the right the beach slope ratio is 1 10 the lower left point is selected as the origin of the coordinate so that all coordinate values are non negative the domain is discretized by 100 identical elements in the horizontal direction while the surface water region and groundwater region are discretized by 1 and 60 identical elements in the vertical direction respectively this results in 100 surface water elements with the size dz dx of 0 5 m 2 m and 6000 groundwater elements with the dx of 2 m but varying dz due to different aquifer depth on the left and right sides of the domain the surface water boundary is prescribed with a static atmospheric pressure of 1 013 105 pa no flow is allowed at the bottom boundary the left and right vertical boundaries represent the terrestrial inland supplying freshwater and the ocean supplying seawater exerting hydrostatic heads of 28 5 m and 28 m higher than atmospheric pressure head respectively table 1 note that the hydraulic head report hereafter refers to a value higher than the static atmospheric pressure head the surface water region is initially filled with air the left 170 m in the horizontal direction of the groundwater region is initially filled with freshwater and the right 30 m with seawater preliminarily simulation confirms that the simulation result is independent of the initial condition a semi diurnal tidal boundary at the seaward side is implemented by applying a time varying head eq 8 to the rightmost element of the surface water region fig 1 8 h a s i n w t h where h is the time varying seawater head a is the tidal amplitude w is the tidal angular frequency of 12 567 d corresponding to a period of 0 5 d and h is the mean seawater head of 28 m note that toughreact does not provide time dependent dirichlet conditions and so this time dependent dirichlet condition is implemented by the provided time dependent sinks or sources q t i d e e m e l e n t in the large tide element which is calculated based on

t β t i d e e l e m e n t is the saturation of 1 volume of 1050 m3 the porosity of 1 and pore compressibility of 1 10 10 pa 1 for the tide element respectively a high hydraulic conductivity of 11 24 m s 106 m d is assigned to all the surface water elements allowing for nearly instantaneous transmission of this time varying heads to the submerged interface between groundwater and surface water robinson et al 2007 xin et al 2010 as the hydrodynamic dispersion process is not explicitly implemented in toughreact the upstream weighting scheme is enabled to make use of the numerical dispersion along the horizontal α x dx 2 and vertical α z dz 2 directions xu et al 2012 this approximation allows the width of the mixing zone to be effectively controlled by the element size despite that the salt dispersion along the saltwater wedge may not be well represented as the local flow direction is diagonal the model determines the time step by the courant friedrichs lewy condition with a ceiling value of 200 s and considers a simulation time span of 365 days at the end of the simulation a quasi static state is reached where the change of seawater mass fraction is minimal this simulation case defined above is considered as the base case with the employed parameters and units shown in table 1 besides the base case a series of simulation cases are carried out for 365 days by adopting the same configuration as the base case except for a change in one parameter table 2 the varying parameters include tidal amplitude freshwater head seawater diffusion coefficient and slope ratio in order to investigate the individual influence of each parameter on the results table 3 the upper saline plume usp and salt wedge sw regions are determined as the regions with seawater mass fraction greater than 0 2 the centroid and spread are traced to quantify the location and extent of the formed usp and sw regions robinson et al 2007 the centroid coordinates in the horizontal and vertical directions

seawater x z z d x d z ϕ f seawater x z d x d z similarly the spread variance in the horizontal and vertical directions σ x σ z is calculated by normalizing the second central moments m 2 x m 2 z by the zeroth moment m 0 as shown in eq 13 σ x m 2 x m o ϕ f seawater x z x x c 2 d x d z ϕ f seawater x z d x d z 13 σ z m 2 z m o ϕ f seawater x z z z c 2 d x d z ϕ f seawater x z d x d z the toe location is determined as the horizontal coordinate of the cell in the bottom layer with a seawater mass fraction of 0 5 and the seawater intrusion length is determined as the horizontal distance between the toe location and the lowest point of the slope the sgd is composed of terrestrially derived freshwater and recirculated seawater and the latter includes density driven circulation ddc and tide driven circulation tdc so there are five types of water fluxes namely total water freshwater seawater and ddc and tdc of seawater and four types of flux ratios specifically the ratios of freshwater seawater and ddc and tdc of seawater to the total water shen et al 2022 3 results 3 1 submarine groundwater discharge with tidal force for the case without tidal force a classical wedge shaped interface between freshwater and seawater saltwater wedge sw is formed at the steady state fig 2 a the seawater flows downward from the seabed then circulates upward following the sw and finally discharges at the beach the freshwater flows horizontally from the inland boundary then moves upward following the sw fig 2c and e before discharge on the beach at locations landward to the seawater discharging areas the liquid saturation and seawater mass fraction at the ground surface above the sw region increase from the freshwater side to the seawater side fig 2c the water discharge from the beach is dominated by freshwater fig 2e for the case with tidal effect at the quasi static state a region with high seawater mass fraction so called the upper saline plume usp is formed above the sw fig 2b the freshwater discharges between the usp and sw below the minimum seawater level which is called freshwater tube ft the formation of usp pushes the ft and the toe location seaward reducing seawater intrusion length sil fig 2b the liquid saturation at the ground surface increases from the freshwater side to the seawater side fig 2d the seawater mass fraction reaches unity at the usp and the seabed and remains low at the inland surface and the freshwater discharging beach fig 2d two seawater circulation cells were identified with tidal forcing enabled fig 2f the tide driven circulation tdc over the usp region with a dominant flux ratio of 52 9 table 3 and the density driven circulation ddc at the seawater aquifer with a flux ratio of 20 7 table 3 this results in the flux ratio of seawater of 73 6 and of freshwater of 26 4 respectively fig 3 shows the time dependent variations of the seawater mass fraction in the aquifer left column the liquid saturation and seawater mass fraction at the ground surface middle column and the instant water flux across the ground surface right column for the base case in a tide cycle after reaching the quasi static state the usp ft sw sil and seawater mass fraction at the ground surface are relatively stable over a tidal cycle figs 3 and 4 with seawater increase from mean to the maximum level the seawater infiltrates into the aquifer from the inundated beach surface filling in the unsaturated zone rows 1 and 2 in fig 3 leading to the gradual rise of the liquid saturation at the ground surface above the usp x between 120 m and 140 m subsequently the seawater recharge flux declines with the seawater level down rows 3 and 4 in fig 3 with the seawater level decrease from mean to minimum value rows 5 and 6 in fig 3 the infiltrated seawater discharges at the lower intertidal zone and freshwater discharges over the ft region respectively as the seawater level decreases the discharge flux rises with less water recharge the discharge also reduces the liquid saturation in the intertidal zone subsequently the discharge flux declines with the rising of seawater level rows 7 and 8 in fig 3 the ddc of seawater mainly occurs at the seawater part near the mean seawater level with a flux lower than that of tdc during a tidal cycle the areas the mean seawater mass fractions and the centroids and spreads of the usp and sw regions vary temporally with the seawater level but with a relatively small difference of 1 between the maximum and minimum value fig 4a l the toe of the wedge remains stagnant over the tidal cycles fig 4r these phenomena indicate the simulation after 365 days has reached a quasi static state the phases of the area fig 4a and g the mean seawater mass fraction fig 4b and h and the centroid movement fig 4d and j and spread fig 4e k f and l of the usp and sw are slightly behind the phase of the seawater level change while the centroid movements in the horizontal direction of the usp and sw regions fig 4c and i are largely behind the phase of the seawater level change the fluxes fig 4m q of the total water freshwater seawater and tdc and ddc of seawater are behind the phase of the seawater level change by nearly a tidal cycle 3 2 influencing factors figs 5 and s1 show the influence of tidal amplitude on the water and salt dynamics in the coastal aquifer as the tidal amplitude increases the usp moves seaward fig 5 c and downward fig 5d with an area enlarged evidently fig 5a b e and f and the sw moves in the same direction as the usp fig 5i and j but with a shrinking area fig 5g h k and l with the rise of tidal amplitude the flux of seawater and tdc and ddc of seawater increases overall fig 5o q while the freshwater flux decreases fig 5n resulting in the increase of total water flux along the surface water groundwater interface fig 5m with tidal amplitude increase the flux ratio of freshwater and ddc of seawater decreases fig 5n and q and that of seawater and tdc of seawater increases fig 5o and p these results are consistent with the findings in robinson et al 2007 the peak flux value of total water and seawater at the tidal amplitude of 1 1 m can be mainly attributed to the peak flux value of tdc of seawater which is caused by a largely overestimated seawater influx at the inundated beach surface fig s1 this also leads to the overestimation of the flux ratio of seawater and tdc of seawater and the underestimation of the flux ratio of freshwater and ddc of seawater at the tidal amplitude of 1 1 m the seawater intrusion length decreases and the toe location increases with the tidal amplitude rising fig 5r the influence of freshwater head on the water and salt dynamics in the coastal aquifer is shown in figs 6 and s2 the freshwater flux and its ratio own a linear variation with the freshwater head fig 6 n as the freshwater head elevates the usp is squeezed by the enlarged ft and hence moves landward fig 6c and upward fig 6d with decreasing area fig 6a b e and f likewise the sw moves seaward fig 6i and upward fig 6j with decreasing area fig 6g h k and l mainly in the horizontal direction the enhanced freshwater flux leads to the retreat of the toe of the sw resulting in a slightly upward movement of the sw fig 6j and l at the ground surface the total water and freshwater flux and the freshwater flux ratio increase fig 6m and n with rising freshwater head and hence the flux of seawater and tdc of seawater and their ratio decrease fig 6o and p the ddc flux of seawater and its ratio fluctuate slightly suggesting the saltwater circulation in the sw is not affected by enhanced freshwater flow fig 6q the seawater intrusion length decreases and the toe location increases linearly with inland fresh groundwater head rise fig 6r the results agree with those in robinson et al 2007 the influence of seawater diffusion coefficient on the water and salt dynamics in the coastal aquifer is shown in figs 7 and s3 overall as the seawater diffusion coefficient increases the mixing zone around the margin of the usp thickens forming an enlarged usp fig 7 c e and f with reduced seawater fraction fig 7b and a centroid shifted downward fig 7c and d likewise the sw moves seaward fig 7i and upward fig 7j with decreasing area fig 7g h k and l mainly in the horizontal direction the total water flux increases with the seawater diffusion coefficient rising as well as the flux and its ratio of seawater including tdc and ddc while the flux and its ratio of freshwater decrease fig 7m q this is because the enlarged mixing zone strengthens the tdc and ddc of seawater the seawater intrusion length decreases with the seawater diffusion coefficient increase and the toe location increases fig 7r the slope ratio is altered by only changing the horizontal length of the slope zone thus altering the horizontal coordinate of points located in the slope and seawater part regions therefore the horizontal centroid of usp and sw regions relative to the horizontal coordinate of seawater reaching the slope at the mean water level is calculated figs 8 and s4 show the influence of slope ratio on the water and salt dynamics in the coastal aquifer as the slope ratio increases the usp moves landward fig 8 c and upward fig 8d and the sw moves landward fig 8i and downward fig 8j both with a decreasing area fig 8a b e f g h k and l the flux of total water freshwater and ddc of seawater increases with slope ratio rise as well as the related ratio while the flux of seawater and tdc of seawater fluctuate both with decreasing flux ratio fig 8m q the seawater intrusion length and the toe location decrease with the slope ratio increase fig 8r 4 discussions and implications hydrodynamic dispersion is not implemented in toughreact the upstream weighting scheme is enabled to make use of the numerical dispersion to mimic the extent of hydrodynamic dispersion and the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities can be determined by the sizes of dx and dz respectively however this method is found effective only when the water flow is in parallel with the axes different from the sgd where water flows along the sw are diagonal to the axis therefore we decide to use small and fixed grid sizes among all cases to minimize and uniform the impact of numerical dispersion while considering the diffusion coefficient in the model as the effective diffusion dispersion coefficient sensitivity analysis on the effective diffusion dispersion coefficient was carried out to identify the influence on the water and salt dynamics in the coastal aquifer figs 7 and s3 results show that the formed usp by tidal effect pushes the ft and toe location toward the seawater side alleviating the seawater intrusion into the aquifer after it reaches the quasi static state the usp ft sw and sil change less the tdc of seawater recharges into the aquifer when the seawater level exceeds the mean seawater level and the freshwater and seawater discharge from the aquifer when the seawater level is lower than the mean value with the water flux fluctuating with the seawater level these findings agree well with previous results heiss and michael 2014 nguyen et al 2020 robinson et al 2007 2006 shen et al 2022 xin et al 2010 indicating the applicability of toughreact for sgd simulation and expanding the application area of toughreact the rising of tidal amplitude freshwater head seawater diffusion coefficient and slope ratio reduces the seawater intrusion length but with different impacts on usp and sw table 4 the rising of the freshwater head and slope ratio pushes the usp toward the freshwater side and upward with a shrinking area the rising of tidal amplitude pushes the usp toward the seawater side and downward with the expanding area the rising of seawater diffusion coefficient pushes the usp downward with the expanding area this indicates that the usp shrinks and expands along with its location up and down respectively the rising of freshwater head and seawater diffusion coefficient pushes the sw toward the seawater side and upward the rising of tidal amplitude pushes the sw toward the seawater side and downward and the rising of slope ratio pushes the sw toward the freshwater side and downward all with the shrinking area this demonstrates that the rise of these variables alleviates the seawater intrusion length mainly by reducing the sw area attention should be paid to the expanding area of usp as the formed usp itself means seawater mixture in the shallow groundwater this has implications for groundwater resources management and protection in coastal areas in terms of water flux the rises of the four variables all raise the total water flux but with different details in the flux and its ratio of the four sub types of water table 4 the rising of tidal amplitude raises the flux and its ratio of seawater including tdc and ddc of seawater except for the ddc flux ratio of seawater but reduces those of freshwater the rising of freshwater head linearly raises the flux and its ratio of freshwater but reduces the others the rising of seawater diffusion coefficient raises the flux and its ratio of all types of seawater but reduces the freshwater flux and its ratio the rising of slope ratio raises the flux and its ratio of freshwater and ddc of seawater but reduces those of seawater and tdc of seawater overall this indicates that the rising of these variables mainly raises the flux of total water and ddc of seawater while the rise of tidal amplitude and seawater diffusion coefficient and the decline of freshwater head and slope ratio raise the seawater flux and its ratio mainly by increasing the flux and its ratio of tdc of seawater but reduce the freshwater flux and its ratio table 4 these findings are beneficial for better understanding and further predicting the hydrodynamic processes of sgd in stes the sgd will drive large amounts of multiple terrestrial geochemical substances and the impacts of these factors mentioned above have significant implications on the discharge flux of these terrestrial geochemical substances to the ocean the sgd in stes involves not only hydrodynamic processes but also the transport and reaction of geochemical species which is a hydro geo chemical coupling process with complex mechanisms recent studies mainly focus on the hydrodynamic and salt transport processes during sgd but the geochemical processes are less involved due to the difficulty of the coupling among them toughreact owns the functions of simulation of geochemical transport and reaction coupling processes which can potentially be employed to study the hydro geo chemical processes during sgd on the foundation of these results in this study in addition the terrestrial freshwater input is commonly irregular due to rainfall recharge evapotranspiration and anthropic groundwater exploitation robinson et al 2018 werner et al 2013 xin et al 2022 while fixed freshwater head at the inland boundary is assumed in this study irregular freshwater input will be involved in further sgd studies so that the simulation results are much closer to the reality 5 conclusions by employing toughreact the effects of the variables of tidal amplitude freshwater head seawater diffusion coefficient and slope ratio on groundwater flow and salt transport in stes with tidal force were numerically studied with the main conclusions in the following at the quasi static state with tide effect the spatiotemporal distributions of the upper saline plume usp and the saltwater wedge sw and the fluxes at the surface water groundwater interface are coincident with previous results indicating the applicability of toughreact for sgd simulation and expanding the application area of toughreact increasing the tidal amplitude inland freshwater head seawater diffusion and the beach slope enhances the exchange of groundwater and surface water strengthens the ddc of seawater and alleviates the si by shrinking the sw increasing the tidal amplitude and seawater diffusion coefficient and reducing the freshwater head and slope ratio will raise the seawater flux and its ratio mainly by increasing the flux and its ratio of tdc of seawater but will reduce the freshwater flux and its ratio the sgd is a typically coupled process between hydrodynamics and geochemistry these findings own great implications for better understanding these processes and the related mechanisms in stes further studies on the hydro geo chemical coupling processes during sgd

2263,rapid urbanisation in developing countries has exerted ever increasing pressure on food and water resource systems existing studies mostly focus on impacts of population urbanisation on agricultural water use disregarding the multidimensional characteristics of urbanisation accounting for four dimensions of urbanisation population economy spatial distribution and society we assessed the impact of multidimensional urbanisation on the water footprint self sufficiency rate wfss of three staple crops that is the ratio of the water footprint wf of crop production to the wf of crop related consumption through the case for china over 2000 2017 the socio economic driving factors and spatial heterogeneity of crop wfss were further tested results show that 30 of high crop wfss provinces supplied more than 70 of low crop wfss provinces social urbanisation and economic urbanisation were the governing positive and negative driving factors of the rice wfss respectively population urbanisation was the dominant factor attenuating wheat wfss during the study period while playing a reverse role in maize wfss impacts of different dimensions of urbanisation on crop wfss were heterogeneous and even contradictory depending on the crop type the different processes of urbanisation and the water endowment and economic level of the provinces the quantile regression results further indicate that population urbanisation spatial urbanisation and social urbanisation had greater impact on the higher wfss i e resulted in virtual water export of rice and wheat the current analysis challenges the conventionally monotonous urbanisation water relationships and suggests that additional dimensions of urbanisation should be considered when assessing the effects of urbanisation on agricultural water use keywords crop production spatiotemporal variations driving force virtual water trade data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rapid urbanisation in developing places promotes global population migration economic development and human well being mcdonald et al 2011 campbell 2016 wang et al 2021 with accelerating natural resource consumption and environmental degradation bai et al 2014 larsen et al 2016 d amour et al 2017 flörke et al 2018 li et al 2020 it has been widely acknowledged that urbanisation is causing radical change in all aspects of human lifestyle and is a full scale concept consisting of various dimensions of population economy spatial distribution and society wang et al 2019 kuang et al 2020 li et al 2020 concretely population urbanisation pu measures the proportion of regional urban population within the total population economic urbanisation eu indicates capital aggregation and industry transformation measured as the proportion of secondary and tertiary industries in the economic structure li et al 2020 spatial urbanisation su is the process of converting rural landscape to urban landscape primarily indicated by the per capita built up area of urban residents li et al 2020 su leads to the expansion of urban geography thereby compressing the original cropland area chen et al 2020 social urbanisation sou is a crucial characteristic of urbanisation mirroring the value orientation behavioural choices and lifestyle transformation of residents as they move from rural to urban areas wang et al 2018 kuang et al 2020 commonly measured by as per capita consumption expenditure of urban residents the global pu rate is expected to increase to 68 in 2050 with nearly 90 of the growth occurring in asian countries such as china and india and africa such as nigeria united nations 2019 rapid urbanisation largely implies imposing substantial pressure on food production and supply enhancing the external dependence of food systems as well as the risk of crop production self sufficiency in major crop producing areas kriewald et al 2019 beltran peña et al 2020 it is estimated that 50 63 of the urban expansion in 2100 will occupy existing croplands chen et al 2020 which undoubtedly increases the threat to food systems d amour et al 2017 additionally the limited freshwater resources for food production are a major challenge for the growing human population godfray et al 2010 dalin et al 2015 as one of the core inputs of food systems water resources are particularly vulnerable to urbanisation mcdonald et al 2014 larsen et al 2016 the global per capita domestic water consumption has risen fourfold over the past half century with a greater increase being recorded in urban areas flörke et al 2018 a large number of studies have focused on investigating the interaction between water resources and urbanisation from a single perspective of water supply or demand e g domene and sauri 2006 mcdonald et al 2011 2014 larsen et al 2016 morote and hernandez 2016 flörke et al 2018 fan et al 2019 soligno et al 2019 li et al 2020 the focal point of most research studies addresses the assessment of the influence of urbanisation on urban domestic or industrial water use however agricultural particularly crop related water consumption is largely disregarded the water footprint wf proposed by hoekstra 2003 refers to both direct and indirect appropriation of water resources in production or final consumption of goods that humans require to measure the degree of water supply required to meet demand the concept of wfss was introduced and is defined as the ratio of the internal wf to the wf of consumption in a country or region hoekstra 2011 the wfss serves two primary functions it is a comprehensive indicator that combines the supply and demand aspects and reflects the self sufficiency of corresponding water resource appropriation in the region and it can partly represent the supply and demand status of food systems related to water consumption the concept of wfss has been extensively utilised as an index to reflect regional water or partially characterise the food security of a region rygaard et al 2011 da silva et al 2016 rygaard et al 2011 investigated strategies for achieving wfss for 15 cities da silva et al 2016 analysed the wfss of agricultural and livestock products in brazil and found water consumption for crop production in brazil to be self sufficient to date research on wfss seldom considers the impact of urbanisation whereas urban expansion may severely impede regional water security hubacek et al 2009 beltran peña et al 2020 kuang et al 2020 the effect of urbanisation on regional water security especially crop wfss remains unclear given that the mechanism is multidimensional dynamic and complex mcdonald et al 2014 dermody et al 2018 li et al 2020 currently there are two apparent gaps in research studies concerning the effect of urbanisation on water resource systems first most existing studies only consider the single dimension of population urbanisation while assessing the influence of urbanisation on crop water consumption hubacek et al 2009 duarte et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 xu et al 2015 jin et al 2016 feng et al 2017 the disregard of additional aspects of urbanisation results in one sided and non robust results second although several studies have investigated the relationship between urbanisation and crop related water consumption by adopting the concept of wf table 1 most of them concentrated on one perspective of production or consumption hubacek et al 2009 xu et al 2015 feng et al 2017 fan et al 2019 sun and fang 2019 niva et al 2020 and thus failed to measure regional water resource security comprehensively and accurately to our knowledge how multidimensional urbanisation drives integral indicators of regional water supply demand i e wfss has not been quantitatively analysed this information is crucial to addressing the increasing contradiction between water supply and demand against the backdrop of rapid urbanisation to date three prevailing approaches are utilized to examine the drivers of agricultural wf the multiple regression analysis of stochastic impacts by regression on population influence and technology stirpat e g duarte et al 2014 huang et al 2021 wang et al 2016 the structural decomposition analysis sda e g fan et al 2019 feng et al 2017 soligno et al 2019 and the logarithmic mean division index lmdi explosive

of data availability the decomposition of lmdi has no residual while it fails to intuitively reveal the elastic coefficient of independent variable to dependent variable zhao et al 2014 the ipat identity proposed by ehrlich and holdren 1971 decomposes the environmental impact i of anthropogenic activities into three factors population p affluence a and technology t then york et al 2003 established an improved stirpat stochastic impacts by regression on population affluence and technology model by introducing exponential elasticity and random error term it has been popularly used for investigating the driving forces of environmental impact such as carbon emission liddle 2015 energy consumption vázquez et al 2022 and air pollution xu et al 2020 the stirpat model allows to expand or reduce variables flexibly according to the purpose of specific study and is able to accurately evaluate the elasticity of influencing factors york et al 2003 the objective of this study is to systematically investigate the role of multi dimensional urbanisation in regulating the supply and demand of water resources related to crop production specifically the current study aims to assess the social economic driving forces and spatial heterogeneity of crop wfss by using the multiple regression model stirpat and quantile regression analysis and considering three staple crops rice wheat and maize in 31 provinces within mainland china fig 1 during 2000 2017 as a case study to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to analyse the role of urbanisation in crop wfss particularly focusing on the four dimensions of urbanisation as opposed to solely focusing on population urbanisation we chose mainland china for the following reasons china being most populated and a major food producing country produced 30 17 and 23 of the world s rice wheat and maize in 2019 nbsc 2020 the decline in china s staple crop self sufficiency rate would have severe consequences on the global agricultural trade market given the increasing rate of globalisation the increase in food imports would raise food prices globally thus hampering the welfare of low income countries fortunately the central government of china has always adhered to the policy of keeping the self sufficiency rate of staple crops above 95 state council of china 2008 to date the areas producing staple crops are concentrated in the northern and central regions of china and the shortage of water resources in these regions is still the major factor limiting the achievement of regional food self sufficiency policies dalin et al 2015 furthermore rapid urbanisation causes uncharted challenges to the food and water supply systems bai et al 2014 the study results provide insight into the relationship between multidimensional urbanisation and water resource systems related to crop production and consumption these findings will also offer guidelines on addressing the interlaced crises for countries that similar to china are undergoing rapid urbanisation and facing water scarcity thus allowing them to accomplish sustainable urbanisation and water security synergistically 2 methods and data 2 1 estimating crop water footprint self sufficiency rate the crop wfss proposed by hoekstra 2011 is indicated by the ratio of the wf of crop production to the wf of crop consumption in a specific region this study considers blue green wfss and blue wfss wfssb as blue water is the basis for traditional water resource management as well as of direct competition among different water consumption sectors the specific calculation of crop wfss is expressed by eq 1 1 wfss i c wfp i c wfc i c wfp i c wfp i c vwi i c vwe i c where wfss i c refers to the wfss of crop c in province i the value of wfss in specific provinces exceeds 100 implying that the crop related wf is self sufficient whereas a 0 100 value means that it depends on vw import from other regions to meet the consumption demand of the region wfp i c m3 y 1 and wfc i c m3 y 1 are the wfs of production and consumption of crop c in province i respectively vwi i c m3 y 1 and vwe i c m3 y 1 represent the volume of vw import and export of crop c in province i respectively the wf mentioned in this study only considers the consumptive wf i e blue and green wf wfp i c is the wf per unit mass of crop c in province i uwfp i c in m3 t 1 multiplied by production t y 1 data on annual green and blue uwfp i c of each province from 2000 to 2008 were obtained from the study conducted by zhuo et al 2016a which fully considers the spatial heterogeneity of the wf per unit area specifically uwfp i c is simulated by the water driven aquacrop model based on climate conditions rainfall temperature and co2 concentration agronomic measures sowing date and irrigation mode and soil conditions soil moisture and soil texture at a 5 arc grid scale the data during 2009 2017 were calculated using the fast track approach which enables the crop unit wf in a specific year to estimate the wf of multiple years tuninetti et al 2017 the calculation of uwfp i c is expressed by eq 2 considering 2008 as reference 2 uwfp t c uwfp 2008 c y 2008 c y t c where uwfp t c and uwfp 2008 c denote the production wf per unit mass of crop c in year t t 2009 2010 2017 and 2008 respectively y t ha is the crop yield per unit area the underlying principle of the approach of fast track proposed by tuninetti et al 2017 is a monotonic negative linear correlation between uwfp t c and crop yield given the advantages of relatively simple computations and minor errors 10 globally and within 20 within china this approach has been widely employed to estimate crop unit wf abdelkader et al 2018 gao et al 2020 huang et al 2021 in eq 1 the difference between vwi i c m3 y 1 and vwe i c m3 y 1 is the net vw import of crop c in province i nvwi i c m3 y 1 which is determined by multiplying the international and domestic cross province net import volume by the crop unit wf in the production regions 3 nvwi i c vwi i c vwe i c ni int c uwfp int c ni dom c uwfp dom c where nvwi i c m3 y 1 is the net vw import amount of crop c in province i a positive value represents vw imports while a negative value indicates vw export ni int c and ni dom c represent the international and domestic inter provincial net import volumes t y 1 of crop c in specific provinces respectively uwfp int c and uwfp dom c refer to the crop unit wf of production m3 t 1 in exporting regions from international and domestic inter provincial imports respectively this study assumes that crop international imports and exports exist in provinces with food production deficits and surpluses respectively therefore the data of ni int c in the food deficit provinces are based on the total net import volume of china collected from fao 2020 and then allocated to the corresponding provinces where import demand is based on the proportion of import gap dalin et al 2014 zhuo et al 2016a huang et al 2021 after considering international net imports domestic trans provincial net imports are estimated using the regional trade balance method proposed by ma et al 2006 this method assumes that the amount of food reserves remains constant and the per capita crop consumption of each province is the same and has been widely applied in the estimation of the inter provincial trade volume of crops in china dalin et al 2014 zhuo et al 2016a gao et al 2020 huang et al 2021 the domestic trans provincial net import volume of crop c in a specific province is the consumption volume minus the production volume the consumption volume of crop c in province i is obtained by downscaling the national consumption data from fao 2020 to the corresponding provinces based on the population proportion of the province this is obtained by downscaling to the corresponding province the data for uwfp int c and uwfp dom c were derived from the studies conducted by hoekstra et al 2011 and zhuo et al 2016a respectively 2 2 identifying the driving forces using the extended stirpat model in this study the stirpat model reformulated by york et al 2003 was used to identify the driving forces of wfss the stirpat model is a well known method to examine the potentially influential factors of wf and vw flows jin et al 2016 wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 huang et al 2021 the original and logarithmic forms are expressed in eq 4 and eq 5 4 i a p b a c t d e 5 lni a b l n p c l n a d l n t e where i p a and t represent the environmental impact population affluence and technology respectively a is a constant the coefficients of b c and d are all estimated of population affluence and technology respectively and e is the error term each coefficient represents the elasticity of specific independent to dependent variables specifically in eq 5 the coefficient indicates the percentage change of the dependent variable from a 1 change in the independent variable when other independent variables hold constant the ipat model is a special form of stirpat model i e a b c d e 1 the model can be extended based on the research purpose as t addresses wide ranging additional variables of environmental impacts that do not pertain to population or affluence to illustrate how and the extent to which the social economic influencing factors affect crop wfss more precisely this study input several crucial factors into the stirpat model we constructed urbanisation indicators from four dimensions population economy spatial distribution and society additionally to comprehensively evaluate the anthropogenic influence of crop wfss and compare the magnitudes of urbanisation with other socio economic factors that have already been identified we introduced population density per capita gdp technology into the model and added one control variable per capita arable land area according to the result of stepwise regression the abovementioned four factors were acquired via two septs the first step is the determination of initial candidate independent variables we reviewed and referred to 29 initial candidate influencing factors proposed in the existing literature or self constructed according to our understanding on the driving force of crop wf or vwf table 2 seven main aspects were included including water endowment and utilization land endowment and utilization agricultural production social economic technological and cultural aspects the step is the stepwise regression to filter the input and deletion probability of the candidate independent variables at 1 and 5 significance level respectively other than urbanisation variables as a result there were 25 in 29 variables being removed as either no statistically significant on the dependent variables or apparent multicollinearity the rest four factors were kept in the analysis they were population density pd per capita gdp pgdp agricultural water intensity awi and per capita arable land area ala which were also the prevailing influencing factors of crop wf and vwfs the extended stirpat model utilised in this study is expressed by eq 6 6 ln wfss it a it β 1 l n pu it β 2 l n eu it β 3

multicollinearity diagnosis results in table s1 show no clear collinearity among the independent variables in this study the maximum vif is 8 3 2 3 assessing heterogeneous role of drivers using the quantile regression model numerous studies on the influencing factors of crop wf have been conducted using the ordinary least squares ols regression method which can only depict the mean influence of independent variables on the dependent variable and does not present all the conditional distributions koenker and xiao 2002 moreover the ols method necessitates the assumption of preconditions of zero mean homoscedasticity non autocorrelation and normal distribution of the random error term of variables huang et al 2020 however these assumptions cannot be fulfilled in most circumstances resulting in non robust parameter estimates and spurious regression salman et al 2019 huang et al 2020 in this regard the quantile regression proposed by koenker and bassett 1978 has the apparent advantage of detecting the heterogeneous influence of driving factors on multiple quantiles of the dependent variable and provides all information regarding conditional distribution nwaka et al 2020 additionally quantile regression is particularly useful for addressing problems in terms of inaccurate estimation because the variables are inconsistent with the assumptions of ols regression koenker and xiao 2002 given the tremendous heterogeneity within china and the above mentioned advantages of quantile regression this approach is employed in this study to capture the heterogeneous effects of socioeconomic drivers on crop wfss at multiple quantiles the quantile regression is expressed as follows 7 y i x i β θ μ θ i 0 θ 1 8 quant θ y i x i x i β θ where y i is the dependent variable x i and x i refer to the matrix and inverse matrix composed of independent variables respectively μ denotes the random error and the conditional quantile distribution is 0 quant θ y i x i indicates the θ th quantile of y i β θ is the coefficient to be estimated at the θ th quantile in the dependent variable which can be obtained using eq 9 9 min y i x 1 i β θ y i x i β y i x i β 1 θ y i x i β the solution of eq 9 was estimated using linear programming buchinsky 1995 the coefficients of the independent variables vary according to different quantiles to explore the influencing factors and regional heterogeneity of crop wfss more comprehensively and effectively this study selected the typical quantile levels i e 10th 25th 50th 75th and 90th following most previous studies salman et al 2019 nwaka et al 2020 yan et al 2020 to investigate the heterogeneous role of determinants at different quantiles of crop wfss based on the stirpat model eq 6 can be further substituted into eq 10 10

regression coefficients on the τ th quantile of the independent variable and q τ represents the τ th quantile of the dependent variable statistical analysis and graphing were performed using the quantreg package developed by koenker and xiao 2002 using r language software 2 4 pre regression test 2 4 1 panel unit root test the stationarity test of variables is a crucial step in ensuring the reliability and robustness of the regression results particularly for the economic variables of the panel data the unit root test is a common method for detecting whether the variables are stationary nwaka et al 2020 yan et al 2020 if the unit root of a variable exists i e insignificant at the 1 significance level the variable is considered to be nonstationary otherwise it is considered to be stationary currently three approaches of llc levin et al 2002 im pesaran and shin ips im et al 2003 and the fisher augmented dickey fuller adf test choi 2001 are extensively used to test the stationarity of panel data therefore these three approaches were employed to test the stability of all variables in the study the results of the panel unit root test listed in table s2 show that all variables were significant at the 1 significance level in the first order difference series implying that they were stationary and could be used for subsequent analysis 2 4 2 cointegration test the cointegration test was applied to further verify whether there was a long term equilibrium relationship between crop wfss and driving factors based on stationarity results which was the premise for quantile regression the cointegration theory requires that the estimation of regression be meaningful only when a causal relationship exists between the dependent and independent variables engle and granger 1987 in this study the popular and commonly used pedroni and kao tests were applied to detect the cointegration of variables koenker and xiao 2002 pedroni 2004 the statistical results of the cointegration test in table s3 indicate that both tests passed the significance test at the 1 significance level indicating a cointegration correlation between crop wfss and the driving factors 2 4 3 normal distribution test before performing empirical analysis with quantile regression it is essential to check whether the data are normally distributed as the ols method assumes that random error in the model subjects is normally distributed with zero mean and homoscedasticity however it is difficult for most economic variables to satisfy these assumptions yan et al 2020 in this case ols regression fails to obtain accurate estimated parameters while quantile regression is more applicable and robust than ols in addressing the abnormal distribution of variables in this study the most widely used q q chart was implemented to test the normal distribution salman et al 2019 fig s1 shows that the observed values of all variables deviated from the blue line the expected value of the normal distribution meaning that these variables do not follow a normal distribution therefore the quantile regression approach is useful for further investigating the drivers of crop related wfss in china 2 5 data sources the raw data on provincial population industrial gdp added value and per capita gdp were derived from the china statistical yearbook 2000 2018 nbsc 2020 the data on urban built up area per capita consumption expenditure of urban residents and per capita arable land area were collected from the china national knowledge infrastructure project cnki 2020 data on agricultural and domestic water use were extracted from the china water resources bulletin of the ministry of water resources of china mwrc 2020 the international trade data of crops selected for the calculation of wfsss were obtained from faostat fao 2020 the data on per capita gdp were deflated into a constant price with the gdp index based on the year 2000 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal evolution of crop water footprint self sufficiency on a national scale the wfss of rice wheat and maize in china were essentially self sufficient 95 over the study period according to the report of the state council of china 2008 but exhibited a downward trend for all three crops the wfss values of rice wheat and maize in 2017 were 98 5 95 7 and 99 0 respectively the wfss of the three crops in 2017 decreased by 3 0 3 4 and 12 0 respectively in 2000 fig 2 a and b the crop wfss is constrained by both production and consumption wfs despite an increase of 13 in china s production wf from 2000 to 2017 consumption wf increased by 18 particularly a significant rise of over 100 for consumption wf of maize resulting in the decline of crop wfss the overall characteristics and changing trends of wfssb were similar to those of wfss on the provincial scale the spatial distribution of crop wfss showed that 30 9 of 31 provinces 29 0 high crop wfss provinces i e wfss 100 namely net vw exporters fed over 70 low crop wfss provinces i e wfss 100 namely net vw importers fig 3 a c the provinces with the lowest wfss 1 were primarily concentrated in economically developed provinces such as beijing rice guangdong wheat and shanghai maize high wfss provinces were mainly located in the central and northeast regions such as rice 479 4 in heilongjiang fig 3a wheat 387 9 in henan fig 3b and maize 634 2 in jilin fig 3c the wfss of the three crops in more than 70 of the provinces in 2017 decreased to varying degrees compared with that in 2000 owing to the reduction in the production scale of several provinces and the increase in consumption demand in broad terms the spatial distribution of the wfssb of the three crops was similar to that of wfss fig 3d f note that the variation characteristics of wfssb and wfss in individual provinces were different for instance the wfss and wfssb of hainan in 2017 decreased by 42 8 and 115 0 respectively compared with those in 2000 owing to the mitigation of the planting area especially the decrease in irrigation area for rice production in hainan fig s2 further explored the correlation between crop wfss and crop self sufficiency rate measured as the ratio of crop production to crop consumption showing a highly positive correlation between crop wfss and crop self sufficiency rate as the ratio of wfss to crop self sufficiency rate was equal to 1 in the exporting provinces 3 2 driving forces of multidimensional urbanisation on crop water footprint self sufficiency rate this section shows the results of the impact of socio economic variables especially multi dimensional urbanisation on crop wfss using the quantile regression approach simultaneously the results of the ols regression are also presented here for ease of comparison the empirical results of influencing factors on crop wfss showed that the driving strength and direction of the multi dimensional urbanisation and other socioeconomic variables were statistically significant and varied among the three crops according to the average effect i e ols regression figs 4 6 social urbanisation and economic urbanisation were the governing positive and negative driving factors of the rice wfss respectively population urbanisation was the dominant factor attenuating wheat wfss during the study period while playing a reverse role in maize wfss the heterogeneous impacts of population urbanisation on crop wfss could at least partly be attributed to the fact that most rice and wheat are directly consumed in china while maize is mainly utilised for feed consumption the quantile regression approach was applied in this study to further examine the heterogeneous effects of the driving factors of crop wfss at different quantile points the results showed that the influence of population urbanisation spatial urbanisation and social urbanisation on the wfss of rice and wheat increased following an increase in quantile while other dimensions of urbanisation had no significant effect on maize wfss except for the population fig 4 first population urbanisation had a statistically significant influence on the wfss of the three crops and the driving strength increased as the quantile increased fig 4 the elasticity coefficients of population urbanisation of wfss of rice wheat and maize at the 90th quantile was 0 237 p 0 01 1 361 p 0 01 and 0 527 p 0 01 respectively because the provinces in the 90th percentile i e high wfss are predominantly concentrated in the central and northeast regions which subsist on agricultural production for the labour force figs 4 6 therefore the loss of labour force caused by population urbanisation would have relatively more critical impact on urban areas second the influence of economic urbanisation on crop wfss was determined by crop type fig 4 economic urbanisation significantly abated the wfss of rice which first increased and then decreased as the quantile increased however it had significant positive effect on the lower quantile in wheat fig 5 and the role was not significant in maize except for being negative at the 90th quantile fig 6 the heterogeneity of economic urbanisation on wfss among crops due to economic urbanisation could increase consumption demand and reduce the wfss of rice and maize as well as improve wheat wfss by transforming economic structure and indirectly promoting technological innovation third the elasticity coefficient of spatial urbanisation on rice wfss was obviously negative whereas a contrary effect was observed in wheat and the magnitude increased as the quantile increased figs 4 5 the relatively high wfss is concentrated in the northeast e g heilongjiang and central e g jiangxi hunan and hubei regions whereas that of wheat is fundamentally located in the north coast e g hebei and shandong compared with the central provinces the provinces located in the north coast had relatively low spatial urbanisation hence the wfss of wheat in these provinces was particularly sensitive to spatial urbanisation fourth social urbanisation would promote rice wfss with a relatively high estimation coefficient in the higher quantile reaching 0 85 p 0 01 in the 90th quantile fig 4 this was possibly because the provinces with higher quantiles of rice wfss were situated in the northeast and central regions which had greater marginal effect on rice wfss owing to relatively low social urbanisation in wheat however the roles observed in the low and high quantiles were antonymous and had a negative effect on the lower quantiles and a significant positive effect on higher quantiles fig 5 finally regarding the other socio economic factors we found the per capita arable land area had a positive effect on the wfss of the three crops especially larger than other independent variables on the maize wfss fig 6 this was probably because the large scale production caused by expanding per capita arable land area improved the production efficiency thus enhancing the wfss of maize wang et al 2021 3 3 driving forces of multidimensional urbanisation on crop blue water footprint self sufficiency rate blue water is the sole focus of conventional water resource accounting necessitating the investigation of the influence of the drivers on the crop related blue water footprint self sufficiency rate wfssb overall the effects of socioeconomic variables on crop wfssb and wfss showed a similar tendency figs 6 8 as crop wfss and wfssb were the same in the exporting provinces therefore the following analysis mainly focused on the crops or influencing factors that varied widely from the wfss from the ols regression results we found that population urbanisation had a significantly positive effect on rice wfssb which was stronger than that on wfss figs 7 9 for every 1 increase in population urbanisation the wfssb of rice increased by 0 2 while wfss increased by only 0 1 fig 7 similarly this trend was observed in the effects of social urbanisation on rice wfssb as a result of both population urbanisation and social urbanisation we managed to directly provoke technological progress public consciousness improvement and institutional innovation ultimately promoting rice wfssb however the effect of social urbanisation on wheat wfssb was less than that on wfss fig 8 and a similar influence of per capita gdp was also observed on rice wfssb fig 9 indicating that the role of social urbanisation and per capita gdp on crop wfssb was indirect whereas their comprehensive effect on crop wfss was relatively large the quantile regression results showed that population urbanisation had a larger influence on the wfssb of three crops than on wfss at each quantile level especially for wheat fig 8 the model coefficient of wheat wfssb of population urbanisation was 0 1 0 2 which was larger than that of wfss owing to the water intensive nature of wheat compared with the other two crops consequently the technological progress and regulatory measures caused by population urbanisation play a greater role in the wfssb of wheat 3 4 discussion the current study investigated the driving forces and spatial heterogeneity of crop wfss among three staple crops at the provincial scale within china particularly focusing on the four dimensions of urbanisation distinct from the existing urbanisation water homogeneous relationship we found that the driving intention and direction of urbanisation on crop wfss were determined by the various dimensions of urbanisation quantile regression was further applied to explore the heterogeneous consequences of influencing factors on crop wfss compared to the current sole focus on population urbanisation hubacek et al 2009 duarte et al 2014 feng et al 2017 our analysis showed for the first time that distinct even opposite roles of multi dimension of urbanisation on crop related wfss can be determined by various aspects of urbanisation and type of crop the variation of crop wfss depends on two determinants one is the unit wf of production and the other crop production or consumption the four dimensions of urbanisation can drive crop wfsss through these two patterns directly or indirectly population urbanisation is a widely used proxy index in current research on the impact of urbanisation on water resources and conventionally results in a monotonous urbanisation water relationship hubacek et al 2009 zhao et al 2014 xu et al 2015 feng et al 2017 our results show that population urbanisation has the opposite influence on the inhibition of wheat wfss but promotes maize wfss this may be attributable to a significant increase in crop consumption demand as the original rural population moved to urban areas of wheat flörke et al 2018 however owing to the relative scarcity of labour force engaged in maize production in rural areas the innovation of adaptive agricultural technology e g applications of agricultural machinery pesticides fertilisers and modified varieties has been induced and the corresponding alternative and complementary technologies have emerged kuang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 these measures effectively reduced the maize wf and ultimately improved the maize wfss similarly the implications of the other dimensions of urbanisation on crop wfss were also heterogeneous and even contradictory depending on the crop type the different processes of urbanisation and the water endowment and economic level of the provinces on the one hand economic improvement increased consumer demand thus reducing the wfss on the other hand the fundamental feature of economic urbanisation is the transformation of economic structure from agriculture to industry and service industry where the surplus labour force was transferred thus improving the degree of specialisation of agricultural production and finally promoting the crop wfss spatial urbanisation as a critical aspect of the urbanisation process has been proven to cause the loss of existing cultivated land especially high yield farmland d amour et al 2017 chen et al 2020 which further reduces the wfss of crops this study found that social urbanisation had a positive effect on the wfss of all three crops social urbanisation is reflected in the accumulation of professional talent and improvement of social awareness which is conducive to the formation of advanced systems and facilitate the development of additional knowledge and technology wang et al 2019 kuang et al 2020 more interestingly we found that population urbanisation spatial urbanisation and social urbanisation played greater roles in crop wfss as the quantile increased implying that urbanisation had greater impact on the vw export provinces i e with higher crop wfss these provinces are mostly concentrated in the economically backward northeast northwest and central regions which are also in the initial process of urbanisation nbsc 2020 the marginal effect of the early stage of urbanisation on crop wfss is more critical than that of the developed urbanisation provinces as rapid urbanisation promotes urban populations expansion of urban landscapes and transformation of production and lifestyle patterns li et al 2020 simultaneously the vw exporting provinces are undergoing a severe water scare dilemma huang et al 2021 therefore given the importance of a more critical role in provinces in terms of higher crop wfss predominance of vw exports and water scarcity urbanisation should be regarded as a key factor in exploring the correlation between urbanisation and crop related water resources note that the role of the crop price has not been considered in this case study food security is of vital importance for china the cropping patterns of staple crops at the sub national scale are hardly regulated by market prices but more by national policies we recognize that it is necessary to take crop prices and other determinants e g location of cropping regions the cultural and historical context into consideration when investigating national scale crop wfss cash crops or other countries or regions certain limitations of this study cannot be disregarded first the crop unit wf was estimated by the approach of fast track which only considered the temporal variation in the wf tuninetti et al 2017 proved the applicability of fast track by considering the effects of climate and soil conditions and comparing it with the unit wf based on crop evapotranspiration simulated by the crop growth model moreover uncertainty analysis showed that the standard error of the fast track method was 10 globally and gao et al 2020 further verified that the provincial deviation of the approach in china was within 20 given that the purpose of this study is to evaluate the driving forces instead of quantifying crop wf we consider the estimation of crop wf through this method to be acceptable second only three staple crops were considered in this study which cannot comprehensively illustrate the wfss of china s crop related water sector associated crop production apparently more crop even animal products need to be incorporated into the scoping review on crop wfss in future such as the considerable soybean import for china because of its relatively low yield third this study estimated crop wfss from a single aspect of water quantity while neglecting the implication of water quality however a severe shortage of water quality occurs despite the abundance of water quantity van vliet et al 2017 wfss combining water quantity and quality warrants further investigation based on the aforementioned analysis we propose three policy suggestions first action should be taken to achieve water sustainability in regions with higher crop wfss i e vw exports but water scarcity such as adjustment of crop planting structure towards crops consuming lower water reduction of exports and realisation of sustainable and effective utilisation of water resources related to crop production second the role of additional dimensions of urbanisation on crop related water consumption should not be disregarded particularly in water scarce regions as the heterogeneous and antonymous consequences of various dimensions of urbanisation on crop wfss third quantification of the heterogeneous effects of the socio economic driving factors of crop wfss can help policy makers implement differentiated policies for provinces with different crop wfsss table 3 presents the customised provincial strategies in terms of local conditions from the integral perspective of dominant urbanisation type status of blue water scarcity and crop wfss 4 conclusions this study first investigated the spatiotemporal variations of wfss related to three staple crops via a case study of 31 provinces in china during 2000 2017 and then identified their major driving factors paying particular attention to the impact of the four dimensions of urbanisation finally the spatial heterogeneity of these influencing factors was analysed using the quantile regression approach the primary conclusions drawn are as follows 1 china s crop wf could be self sufficient over the study period of 2000 2017 however the wfss of the three staple crops gradually decreased in 2017 the average wfss was 98 indicating that china had to import 8 5 gm3y 1 vw to meet domestic consumption 2 the sub national spatial distribution of crop wfss captured additional crop related water security risks 30 of the provinces with high crop wfss supply more than 70 of low crop wfss provinces 3 the directions and intensities of crop wfss were determined by the dimension of urbanisation population urbanisation and social urbanisation promoted crop wfss as the decline of per unit wf of crop production induced by technological progress whereas economic urbanisation and spatial urbanisation significantly reduced crop wfss by promoting the consumption wf demand while compressing high yield farmland area 4 with higher marginal effects population urbanisation spatial urbanisation and social urbanisation had relatively more influence on crop wfss in vw exporting provinces i e higher crop wfss but water scarcity we suggest that additional dimensions of urbanisation except population and regional heterogeneity should be incorporated in exploring the relationship between urbanisation and crop related water consumption to formulate differentiated policies addressing urban expansion and water supply and demand this study highlights the importance of quantifying the implications of multi dimensional urbanisation on regional crop related water systems particularly in areas with water shortages future research should focus on the consequences of multidimensional urbanisation on wfss among more

2263,rapid urbanisation in developing countries has exerted ever increasing pressure on food and water resource systems existing studies mostly focus on impacts of population urbanisation on agricultural water use disregarding the multidimensional characteristics of urbanisation accounting for four dimensions of urbanisation population economy spatial distribution and society we assessed the impact of multidimensional urbanisation on the water footprint self sufficiency rate wfss of three staple crops that is the ratio of the water footprint wf of crop production to the wf of crop related consumption through the case for china over 2000 2017 the socio economic driving factors and spatial heterogeneity of crop wfss were further tested results show that 30 of high crop wfss provinces supplied more than 70 of low crop wfss provinces social urbanisation and economic urbanisation were the governing positive and negative driving factors of the rice wfss respectively population urbanisation was the dominant factor attenuating wheat wfss during the study period while playing a reverse role in maize wfss impacts of different dimensions of urbanisation on crop wfss were heterogeneous and even contradictory depending on the crop type the different processes of urbanisation and the water endowment and economic level of the provinces the quantile regression results further indicate that population urbanisation spatial urbanisation and social urbanisation had greater impact on the higher wfss i e resulted in virtual water export of rice and wheat the current analysis challenges the conventionally monotonous urbanisation water relationships and suggests that additional dimensions of urbanisation should be considered when assessing the effects of urbanisation on agricultural water use keywords crop production spatiotemporal variations driving force virtual water trade data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rapid urbanisation in developing places promotes global population migration economic development and human well being mcdonald et al 2011 campbell 2016 wang et al 2021 with accelerating natural resource consumption and environmental degradation bai et al 2014 larsen et al 2016 d amour et al 2017 flörke et al 2018 li et al 2020 it has been widely acknowledged that urbanisation is causing radical change in all aspects of human lifestyle and is a full scale concept consisting of various dimensions of population economy spatial distribution and society wang et al 2019 kuang et al 2020 li et al 2020 concretely population urbanisation pu measures the proportion of regional urban population within the total population economic urbanisation eu indicates capital aggregation and industry transformation measured as the proportion of secondary and tertiary industries in the economic structure li et al 2020 spatial urbanisation su is the process of converting rural landscape to urban

2020 social urbanisation sou is a crucial characteristic of urbanisation mirroring the value orientation behavioural choices and lifestyle transformation of residents as they move from rural to urban

growth occurring in asian countries such as china and india and africa such as nigeria united nations 2019 rapid urbanisation largely implies imposing substantial pressure on food production and supply enhancing the external dependence of food systems as well as the risk of crop production self sufficiency in major crop producing areas kriewald et al 2019 beltran peña et al 2020 it is estimated that 50 63 of the urban expansion in 2100 will occupy existing croplands chen et al 2020 which undoubtedly increases the threat to food systems d amour et al 2017 additionally the limited freshwater resources for food production are a major challenge for the growing human population godfray et al 2010 dalin et al 2015 as one of the core inputs of food systems water resources are particularly vulnerable to urbanisation mcdonald et al 2014 larsen et al 2016 the global per capita domestic water consumption has risen fourfold over the past half century with a greater increase being recorded in urban areas flörke et al 2018 a large number of studies have focused on investigating the interaction between water resources and urbanisation from a single perspective of water supply or demand e g domene and sauri 2006 mcdonald et al 2011 2014 larsen et al 2016 morote and hernandez 2016 flörke et al 2018 fan et al 2019 soligno et al 2019 li et al 2020 the focal point of most research studies addresses the assessment of the influence of urbanisation on urban domestic or industrial water use however agricultural particularly crop related water consumption is largely disregarded the water footprint wf proposed by hoekstra 2003 refers to both direct and indirect appropriation of water resources in production or final consumption of goods that humans require to measure the degree of water supply required to meet demand the concept of wfss was introduced and is defined as the ratio of the internal wf to the wf of consumption in a country or region hoekstra 2011 the wfss serves two primary functions it is a comprehensive indicator that combines the supply and demand aspects and reflects the self sufficiency of corresponding water resource appropriation in the region and it can partly represent the supply and demand status of food systems related to water consumption the concept of wfss has been extensively utilised as an index to reflect regional water or partially characterise the food security of a region rygaard et al 2011 da silva et al 2016 rygaard et al 2011 investigated strategies for achieving wfss for 15 cities da silva et al 2016 analysed the wfss of agricultural and livestock products in brazil and found water consumption for crop production in brazil to be self sufficient to date research on wfss seldom considers the impact of urbanisation whereas urban expansion may severely impede regional water security hubacek et al 2009 beltran peña et al 2020 kuang et al 2020 the effect of urbanisation on regional water security especially crop wfss remains unclear given that the mechanism is multidimensional dynamic and complex mcdonald et al 2014 dermody et al 2018 li et al 2020 currently there are two apparent gaps in research studies concerning the effect of urbanisation on water resource systems first most existing studies only consider the single dimension of population urbanisation while assessing the influence of urbanisation on crop water consumption hubacek et al 2009 duarte et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 xu et al 2015 jin et al 2016 feng et al 2017 the disregard of additional aspects of urbanisation results in one sided and non robust results second although several studies have investigated the relationship between urbanisation and crop related water consumption by adopting the concept of wf table 1 most of them concentrated on one perspective of production or consumption hubacek et al 2009 xu et al 2015 feng et al 2017 fan et al 2019 sun and fang 2019 niva et al 2020 and thus failed to measure regional water resource security comprehensively and accurately to our knowledge how multidimensional urbanisation drives integral indicators of regional water supply demand i e wfss has not been quantitatively analysed this information is crucial to addressing the increasing contradiction between water supply and demand against the backdrop of rapid urbanisation to date three prevailing approaches are utilized to examine the drivers of agricultural wf the multiple regression analysis of stochastic impacts by regression on population influence and technology stirpat e g duarte et al 2014 huang et al 2021 wang et al 2016 the structural decomposition analysis sda e g fan et al 2019 feng et al 2017 soligno et al 2019 and the logarithmic mean division index lmdi explosive

of data availability the decomposition of lmdi has no residual while it fails to intuitively reveal the elastic coefficient of independent variable to dependent variable zhao et al 2014 the ipat identity proposed by ehrlich and holdren 1971 decomposes the environmental impact i of anthropogenic activities into three factors population p affluence a and technology t then york et al 2003 established an improved stirpat stochastic impacts by regression on population affluence and technology model by introducing exponential elasticity and random error term it has been popularly used for investigating the driving forces of environmental impact such as carbon emission liddle 2015 energy consumption vázquez et al 2022 and air pollution xu et al 2020 the stirpat model allows to expand or reduce variables flexibly according to the purpose of specific study and is able to accurately evaluate the elasticity of influencing factors york et al 2003 the objective of this study is to systematically investigate the role of multi dimensional urbanisation in regulating the supply and demand of water resources related to crop production specifically the current study aims to assess the social economic driving forces and spatial heterogeneity of crop wfss by using the multiple regression model stirpat and quantile regression analysis and considering three staple crops rice wheat and maize in 31 provinces within mainland china fig 1 during 2000 2017 as a case study to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to analyse the role of urbanisation in crop wfss particularly focusing on the four dimensions of urbanisation as opposed to solely focusing on population urbanisation we chose mainland china for the following reasons china being most populated and a major food producing country produced 30 17 and 23 of the world s rice wheat and maize in 2019 nbsc 2020 the decline in china s staple crop self sufficiency rate would have severe consequences on the global agricultural trade market given the increasing rate of globalisation the increase in food imports would raise food prices globally thus hampering the welfare of low income countries fortunately the central government of china has always adhered to the policy of keeping the self sufficiency rate of staple crops above 95 state council of china 2008 to date the areas producing staple crops are concentrated in the northern and central regions of china and the shortage of water resources in these regions is still the major factor limiting the achievement of regional food self sufficiency policies dalin et al 2015 furthermore rapid urbanisation causes uncharted challenges to the food and water supply systems bai et al 2014 the study results provide insight into the relationship between multidimensional urbanisation and water resource systems related to crop production and consumption these findings will also offer guidelines on addressing the interlaced crises for countries that similar to china are undergoing rapid urbanisation and facing water scarcity thus allowing them to accomplish sustainable urbanisation and water security synergistically 2 methods and data 2 1 estimating crop water footprint self sufficiency rate the crop wfss proposed by hoekstra 2011 is indicated by the ratio of the wf of crop production to the wf of crop consumption in a specific region this study considers blue green wfss and blue wfss wfssb as blue water is the basis for traditional water resource management as well as of direct competition among different water consumption sectors the specific calculation of crop wfss is expressed by eq 1 1 wfss i c wfp i c wfc i c wfp i c wfp i c vwi i c vwe i c where wfss i c refers to the wfss of crop c in province i the value of wfss in specific provinces exceeds 100 implying that the crop related wf is self sufficient whereas a 0 100 value means that it depends on vw import from other regions to meet the consumption demand of the region wfp i c m3 y 1 and wfc i c m3 y 1 are the wfs of production and consumption of crop c in province i respectively vwi i c m3 y 1 and vwe i c m3 y 1 represent the volume of vw import and export of crop c in province i respectively the wf mentioned in this study only considers the consumptive wf i e blue and green wf wfp i c is the wf per unit mass of crop c in province i uwfp i c in m3 t 1 multiplied by production t y 1 data on annual green and blue uwfp i c of each province from 2000 to 2008 were obtained from the study conducted by zhuo et al 2016a which fully considers the spatial heterogeneity of the wf per unit area specifically uwfp i c is simulated by the water driven aquacrop model based on climate conditions rainfall temperature and co2 concentration agronomic measures sowing date and irrigation mode and soil conditions soil moisture and soil texture at a 5 arc grid scale the data during 2009 2017 were calculated using the fast track approach which enables the crop unit wf in a specific year to estimate the wf of multiple years tuninetti et al 2017 the calculation of uwfp i c is expressed by eq 2 considering 2008 as reference 2 uwfp t c uwfp 2008 c y 2008 c y t c where uwfp t c and uwfp 2008 c denote the production wf per unit mass of crop c in year t t 2009 2010 2017 and 2008 respectively y t ha is the crop yield per unit area the underlying principle of the approach of fast track proposed by tuninetti et al 2017 is a monotonic negative linear correlation between uwfp t c and crop yield given the advantages of relatively simple computations and minor errors 10 globally and within 20 within china this approach has been widely employed to estimate crop unit wf abdelkader et al 2018 gao et al 2020 huang et al 2021 in eq 1 the difference between vwi i c m3 y 1 and vwe i c m3 y 1 is the net vw import of crop c in province i nvwi i c m3 y 1 which is determined by multiplying the international and domestic cross province net import volume by the crop unit wf in the production regions 3 nvwi i c vwi i c vwe i c ni int c uwfp int c ni dom c uwfp dom c where nvwi i c m3 y 1 is the net vw import amount of crop c in province i a positive value represents vw imports while a negative value indicates vw export ni int c and ni dom c represent the international and domestic inter provincial net import volumes t y 1 of crop c in specific provinces respectively uwfp int c and uwfp dom c refer to the crop unit wf of production m3 t 1 in exporting regions from international and domestic inter provincial imports respectively this study assumes that crop international imports and exports exist in provinces with food production deficits and surpluses respectively therefore the data of ni int c in the food deficit provinces are based on the total net import volume of china collected from fao 2020 and then allocated to the corresponding provinces where import demand is based on the proportion of import gap dalin et al 2014 zhuo et al 2016a huang et al 2021 after considering international net imports domestic trans provincial net imports are estimated using the regional trade balance method proposed by ma et al 2006 this method assumes that the amount of food reserves remains constant and the per capita crop consumption of each province is the same and has been widely applied in the estimation of the inter provincial trade volume of crops in china dalin et al 2014 zhuo et al 2016a gao et al 2020 huang et al 2021 the domestic trans provincial net import volume of crop c in a specific province is the consumption volume minus the production volume the consumption volume of crop c in province i is obtained by downscaling the national consumption data from fao 2020 to the corresponding provinces based on the population proportion of the province this is obtained by downscaling to the corresponding province the data for uwfp int c and uwfp dom c were derived from the studies conducted by hoekstra et al 2011 and zhuo et al 2016a respectively 2 2 identifying the driving forces using the extended stirpat model in this study the stirpat model reformulated by york et al 2003 was used to identify the driving forces of wfss the stirpat model is a well known method to examine the potentially influential factors of wf and vw flows jin et al 2016 wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 huang et al 2021 the original and logarithmic forms are expressed in eq 4 and eq 5 4 i a p b a c t d e 5 lni a b l n p c l n a d l n t e where i p a and t represent the environmental impact population affluence and technology respectively a is a constant the coefficients of b c and d are all estimated of population affluence and technology respectively and e is the error term each coefficient represents the elasticity of specific independent to dependent variables specifically in eq 5 the coefficient indicates the percentage change of the dependent variable from a 1 change in the independent variable when other independent variables hold constant the ipat model is a special form of stirpat model i e a b c d e 1 the model can be extended based on the research purpose as t addresses wide ranging additional variables of environmental impacts that do not pertain to population or affluence to illustrate how and the extent to which the social economic influencing factors affect crop wfss more precisely this study input several crucial factors into the stirpat model we constructed urbanisation indicators from four dimensions population economy spatial distribution and society additionally to comprehensively evaluate the anthropogenic influence of crop wfss and compare the magnitudes of urbanisation with other socio economic factors that have already been identified we introduced population density per capita gdp technology into the model and added one control variable per capita arable land area according to the result of stepwise regression the abovementioned four factors were acquired via two septs the first step is the determination of initial candidate independent variables we reviewed and referred to 29 initial candidate influencing factors proposed in the existing literature or self constructed according to our understanding on the driving force of crop wf or vwf table 2 seven main aspects were included including water endowment and utilization land endowment and utilization agricultural production social economic technological and cultural aspects the step is the stepwise regression to filter the input and deletion probability of the candidate independent variables at 1 and 5 significance level respectively other than urbanisation variables as a result there were 25 in 29 variables being removed as either no statistically significant on the dependent variables or apparent multicollinearity the rest four factors were kept in the analysis they were population density pd per capita gdp pgdp agricultural water intensity awi and per capita arable land area ala which were also the prevailing influencing factors of crop wf and vwfs the extended stirpat model utilised in this study is expressed by eq 6 6 ln wfss it a it β 1 l n pu it β 2 l n eu it β 3 l n su it β 4 l n sou it β 5 l n pd it β 6 l n p gdp it β 7 l n awi it β 8 l n ala it ε it where wfss is the crop related wf self sufficiency rate pu refers to the population urbanisation rate measured by the proportion of urban population eu represents economic urbanisation measured by the proportion of secondary and tertiary industry added value to gdp wang et al 2019 su denotes spatial urbanisation measured by the per capita urban built up area of urban residents kuang et al 2020 li et al 2020 wang et al 2018 sou stands for social urbanisation measured by per capita consumption expenditure of urban residents li et al 2020 wang et al 2018 pd represents population size which is expressed by population density pgdp is per capita gdp awi denotes the proxy of technical level which is measured by agricultural water consumption per 1000 dollars gdp and ala refers to per capita arable land area the variables used in this study are presented in table 3 table 4 generally the variance inflation factor vif is required to diagnose the multicollinearity for independent variables before regression stine 1995 a vif 10 indicates that there is no significant collinearity the multicollinearity diagnosis results in table s1 show no clear collinearity among the independent variables in this study the maximum vif is 8 3 2 3 assessing heterogeneous role of drivers using the quantile regression model numerous studies on the influencing factors of crop wf have been conducted using the ordinary least squares ols regression method which can only depict the mean influence of independent variables on the dependent variable and does not present all the conditional distributions koenker and xiao 2002 moreover the ols method necessitates the assumption of preconditions of zero mean homoscedasticity non autocorrelation and normal distribution of the random error term of variables huang et al 2020 however these assumptions cannot be fulfilled in most circumstances resulting in non robust parameter estimates and spurious regression salman et al 2019 huang et al 2020 in this regard the quantile regression proposed by koenker and bassett 1978 has the apparent advantage of detecting the heterogeneous influence of driving factors on multiple quantiles of the dependent variable and provides all information regarding conditional distribution nwaka et al 2020 additionally quantile regression is particularly useful for addressing problems in terms of inaccurate estimation because the variables are inconsistent with the assumptions of ols regression koenker and xiao 2002 given the tremendous heterogeneity within china and the above mentioned advantages of quantile regression this approach is employed in this study to capture the heterogeneous effects of socioeconomic drivers on crop wfss at multiple quantiles the quantile regression is expressed as follows 7 y i x i β θ μ θ i 0 θ 1 8 quant θ y i x i x i β θ where y i is the dependent variable x i and x i refer to the matrix and inverse matrix composed of independent variables respectively μ denotes the random error and the conditional quantile distribution is 0 quant θ y i x i indicates the θ th quantile of y i β θ is the coefficient to be estimated at the θ th quantile in the dependent variable which can be obtained using eq 9 9 min y i x 1 i β θ y i x i β y i x i β 1 θ y i x i β the solution of eq 9 was estimated using linear programming buchinsky 1995 the coefficients of the independent variables vary according to different quantiles to explore the influencing factors and regional heterogeneity of crop wfss more comprehensively and effectively this study selected the typical quantile levels i e 10th 25th 50th 75th and 90th following most previous studies salman et al 2019 nwaka et al 2020 yan et al 2020 to investigate the heterogeneous role of determinants at different quantiles of crop wfss based on the stirpat model eq 6 can be further substituted into eq 10 10 q τ l n wfss it a it τ β 1 τ l n pu it β 2 τ l n eu it β 3 τ l n su it β 4 τ l n sou it β 5 τ l n pop it β 6 τ l n p gdp it β 7 τ l n awi it β 8 τ l n ala it ε it where β 1 τ β 2 τ β 8 τ are the regression coefficients on the τ th quantile of the independent variable and q τ represents the τ th quantile of the dependent variable statistical analysis and graphing were performed using the quantreg package developed by koenker and xiao 2002 using r language software 2 4 pre regression test 2 4 1 panel unit root test the stationarity test of variables is a crucial step in ensuring the reliability and robustness of the regression results particularly for the economic variables of the panel data the unit root test is a common method for detecting whether the variables are stationary nwaka et al 2020 yan et al 2020 if the unit root of a variable exists i e insignificant at the 1 significance level the variable is considered to be nonstationary otherwise it is considered to be stationary currently three approaches of llc levin et al 2002 im pesaran and shin ips im et al 2003 and the fisher augmented dickey fuller adf test choi 2001 are extensively used to test the stationarity of panel data therefore these three approaches were employed to test the stability of all variables in the study the results of the panel unit root test listed in table s2 show that all variables were significant at the 1 significance level in the first order difference series implying that they were stationary and could be used for subsequent analysis 2 4 2 cointegration test the cointegration test was applied to further verify whether there was a long term equilibrium relationship between crop wfss and driving factors based on stationarity results which was the premise for quantile regression the cointegration theory requires that the estimation of regression be meaningful only when a causal relationship exists between the dependent and independent variables engle and granger 1987 in this study the popular and commonly used pedroni and kao tests were applied to detect the cointegration of variables koenker and xiao 2002 pedroni 2004 the statistical results of the cointegration test in table s3 indicate that both tests passed the significance test at the 1 significance level indicating a cointegration correlation between crop wfss and the driving factors 2 4 3 normal distribution test before performing empirical analysis with quantile regression it is essential to check whether the data are normally distributed as the ols method assumes that random error in the model subjects is normally distributed with zero mean and homoscedasticity however it is difficult for most economic variables to satisfy these assumptions yan et al 2020 in this case ols regression fails to obtain accurate estimated parameters while quantile regression is more applicable and robust than ols in addressing the abnormal distribution of variables in this study the most widely used q q chart was implemented to test the normal distribution salman et al 2019 fig s1 shows that the observed values of all variables deviated from the blue line the expected value of the normal distribution meaning that these variables do not follow a normal distribution therefore the quantile regression approach is useful for further investigating the drivers of crop related wfss in china 2 5 data sources the raw data on provincial population industrial gdp added value and per capita gdp were derived from the china statistical yearbook 2000 2018 nbsc 2020 the data on urban built up area per capita consumption expenditure of urban residents and per capita arable land area were collected from the china national knowledge infrastructure project cnki 2020 data on agricultural and domestic water use were extracted from the china water resources bulletin of the ministry of water resources of china mwrc 2020 the international trade data of crops selected for the calculation of wfsss were obtained from faostat fao 2020 the data on per capita gdp were deflated into a constant price with the gdp index based on the year 2000 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal evolution of crop water footprint self sufficiency on a national scale the wfss of rice wheat and maize in china were essentially self sufficient 95 over the study period according to the report of the state council of china 2008 but exhibited a downward trend for all three crops the wfss values of rice wheat and maize in 2017 were 98 5 95 7 and 99 0 respectively the wfss of the three crops in 2017 decreased by 3 0 3 4 and 12 0 respectively in 2000 fig 2 a and b the crop wfss is constrained by both production and consumption wfs despite an increase of 13 in china s production wf from 2000 to 2017 consumption wf increased by 18 particularly a significant rise of over 100 for consumption wf of maize resulting in the decline of crop wfss the overall characteristics and changing trends of wfssb were similar to those of wfss on the provincial scale the spatial distribution of crop wfss showed that 30 9 of 31 provinces 29 0 high crop wfss provinces i e wfss 100 namely net vw exporters fed over 70 low crop wfss provinces i e wfss 100 namely net vw importers fig 3 a c the provinces with the lowest wfss 1 were primarily concentrated in economically developed provinces such as beijing rice guangdong wheat and shanghai maize high wfss provinces were mainly located in the central and northeast regions such as rice 479 4 in heilongjiang fig 3a wheat 387 9 in henan fig 3b and maize 634 2 in jilin fig 3c the wfss of the three crops in more than 70 of the provinces in 2017 decreased to varying degrees compared with that in 2000 owing to the reduction in the production scale of several provinces and the increase in consumption demand in broad terms the spatial distribution of the wfssb of the three crops was similar to that of wfss fig 3d f note that the variation characteristics of wfssb and wfss in individual provinces were different for instance the wfss and wfssb of hainan in 2017 decreased by 42 8 and 115 0 respectively compared with those in 2000 owing to the mitigation of the planting area especially the decrease in irrigation area for rice production in hainan fig s2 further explored the correlation between crop wfss and crop self sufficiency rate measured as the ratio of crop production to crop consumption showing a highly positive correlation between crop wfss and crop self sufficiency rate as the ratio of wfss to crop self sufficiency rate was equal to 1 in the exporting provinces 3 2 driving forces of multidimensional urbanisation on crop water footprint self sufficiency rate this section shows the results of the impact of socio economic variables especially multi dimensional urbanisation on crop wfss using the quantile regression approach simultaneously the results of the ols regression are also presented here for ease of comparison the empirical results of influencing factors on crop wfss showed that the driving strength and direction of the multi dimensional urbanisation and other socioeconomic variables were statistically significant and varied among the three crops according to the average effect i e ols regression figs 4 6 social urbanisation and economic urbanisation were the governing positive and negative driving factors of the rice wfss respectively population urbanisation was the dominant factor attenuating wheat wfss during the study period while playing a reverse role in maize wfss the heterogeneous impacts of population urbanisation on crop wfss could at least partly be attributed to the fact that most rice and wheat are directly consumed in china while maize is mainly utilised for feed consumption the quantile regression approach was applied in this study to further examine the heterogeneous effects of the driving factors of crop wfss at different quantile points the results showed that the influence of population urbanisation spatial urbanisation and social urbanisation on the wfss of rice and wheat increased following an increase in quantile while other dimensions of urbanisation had no significant effect on maize wfss except for the population fig 4 first population urbanisation had a statistically significant influence on the wfss of the three crops and the driving strength increased as the quantile increased fig 4 the elasticity coefficients of population urbanisation of wfss of rice wheat and maize at the 90th quantile was 0 237 p 0 01 1 361 p 0 01 and 0 527 p 0 01 respectively because the provinces in the 90th percentile i e high wfss are predominantly concentrated in the central and northeast regions which subsist on agricultural production for the labour force figs 4 6 therefore the loss of labour force caused by population urbanisation would have relatively more critical impact on urban areas second the influence of economic urbanisation on crop wfss was determined by crop type fig 4 economic urbanisation significantly abated the wfss of rice which first increased and then decreased as the quantile increased however it had significant positive effect on the lower quantile in wheat fig 5 and the role was not significant in maize except for being negative at the 90th quantile fig 6 the heterogeneity of economic urbanisation on wfss among crops due to economic urbanisation could increase consumption demand and reduce the wfss of rice and maize as well as improve wheat wfss by transforming economic structure and indirectly promoting technological innovation third the elasticity coefficient of spatial urbanisation on rice wfss was obviously negative whereas a contrary effect was observed in wheat and the magnitude increased as the quantile increased figs 4 5 the relatively high wfss is concentrated in the northeast e g heilongjiang and central e g jiangxi hunan and hubei regions whereas that of wheat is fundamentally located in the north coast e g hebei and shandong compared with the central provinces the provinces located in the north coast had relatively low spatial urbanisation hence the wfss of wheat in these provinces was particularly sensitive to spatial urbanisation fourth social urbanisation would promote rice wfss with a relatively high estimation coefficient in the higher quantile reaching 0 85 p 0 01 in the 90th quantile fig 4 this was possibly because the provinces with higher quantiles of rice wfss were situated in the northeast and central regions which had greater marginal effect on rice wfss owing to relatively low social urbanisation in wheat however the roles observed in the low and high quantiles were antonymous and had a negative effect on the lower quantiles and a significant positive effect on higher quantiles fig 5 finally regarding the other socio economic factors we found the per capita arable land area had a positive effect on the wfss of the three crops especially larger than other independent variables on the maize wfss fig 6 this was probably because the large scale production caused by expanding per capita arable land area improved the production efficiency thus enhancing the wfss of maize wang et al 2021 3 3 driving forces of multidimensional urbanisation on crop blue water footprint self sufficiency rate blue water is the sole focus of conventional water resource accounting necessitating the investigation of the influence of the drivers on the crop related blue water footprint self sufficiency rate wfssb overall the effects of socioeconomic variables on crop wfssb and wfss showed a similar tendency figs 6 8 as crop wfss and wfssb were the same in the exporting provinces therefore the following analysis mainly focused on the crops or influencing factors that varied widely from the wfss from the ols regression results we found that population urbanisation had a significantly positive effect on rice wfssb which was stronger than that on wfss figs 7 9 for every 1 increase in population urbanisation the wfssb of rice increased by 0 2 while wfss increased by only 0 1 fig 7 similarly this trend was observed in the effects of social urbanisation on rice wfssb as a result of both population urbanisation and social urbanisation we managed to directly provoke technological progress public consciousness improvement and institutional innovation ultimately promoting rice wfssb however the effect of social urbanisation on wheat wfssb was less than that on wfss fig 8 and a similar influence of per capita gdp was also observed on rice wfssb fig 9 indicating that the role of social urbanisation and per capita gdp on crop wfssb was indirect whereas their comprehensive effect on crop wfss was relatively large the quantile regression results showed that population urbanisation had a larger influence on the wfssb of three crops than on wfss at each quantile level especially for wheat fig 8 the model coefficient of wheat wfssb of population urbanisation was 0 1 0 2 which was larger than that of wfss owing to the water intensive nature of wheat compared with the other two crops consequently the technological progress and regulatory measures caused by population urbanisation play a greater role in the wfssb of wheat 3 4 discussion the current study investigated the driving forces and spatial heterogeneity of crop wfss among three staple crops at the provincial scale within china particularly focusing on the four dimensions of urbanisation distinct from the existing urbanisation water homogeneous relationship we found that the driving intention and direction of urbanisation on crop wfss were determined by the various dimensions of urbanisation quantile regression was further applied to explore the heterogeneous consequences of influencing factors on crop wfss compared to the current sole focus on population urbanisation hubacek et al 2009 duarte et al 2014 feng et al 2017 our analysis showed for the first time that distinct even opposite roles of multi dimension of urbanisation on crop related wfss can be determined by various aspects of urbanisation and type of crop the variation of crop wfss depends on two determinants one is the unit wf of production and the other crop production or consumption the four dimensions of urbanisation can drive crop wfsss through these two patterns directly or indirectly population urbanisation is a widely used proxy index in current research on the impact of urbanisation on water resources and conventionally results in a monotonous urbanisation water relationship hubacek et al 2009 zhao et al 2014 xu et al 2015 feng et al 2017 our results show that population urbanisation has the opposite influence on the inhibition of wheat wfss but promotes maize wfss this may be attributable to a significant increase in crop consumption demand as the original rural population moved to urban areas of wheat flörke et al 2018 however owing to the relative scarcity of labour force engaged in maize production in rural areas the innovation of adaptive agricultural technology e g applications of agricultural machinery pesticides fertilisers and modified varieties has been induced and the corresponding alternative and complementary technologies have emerged kuang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 these measures effectively reduced the maize wf and ultimately improved the maize wfss similarly the implications of the other dimensions of urbanisation on crop wfss were also heterogeneous and even contradictory depending on the crop type the different processes of urbanisation and the water endowment and economic level of the provinces on the one hand economic improvement increased consumer demand thus reducing the wfss on the other hand the fundamental feature of economic urbanisation is the transformation of economic structure from agriculture to industry and service industry where the surplus labour force was transferred thus improving the degree of specialisation of agricultural production and finally promoting the crop wfss spatial urbanisation as a critical aspect of the urbanisation process has been proven to cause the loss of existing cultivated land especially high yield farmland d amour et al 2017 chen et al 2020 which further reduces the wfss of crops this study found that social urbanisation had a positive effect on the wfss of all three crops social urbanisation is reflected in the accumulation of professional talent and improvement of social awareness which is conducive to the formation of advanced systems and facilitate the development of additional knowledge and technology wang et al 2019 kuang et al 2020 more interestingly we found that population urbanisation spatial urbanisation and social urbanisation played greater roles in crop wfss as the quantile increased implying that urbanisation had greater impact on the vw export provinces i e with higher crop wfss these provinces are mostly concentrated in the economically backward northeast northwest and central regions which are also in the initial process of urbanisation nbsc 2020 the marginal effect of the early stage of urbanisation on crop wfss is more critical than that of the developed urbanisation provinces as rapid urbanisation promotes urban populations expansion of urban landscapes and transformation of production and lifestyle patterns li et al 2020 simultaneously the vw exporting provinces are undergoing a severe water scare dilemma huang et al 2021 therefore given the importance of a more critical role in provinces in terms of higher crop wfss predominance of vw exports and water scarcity urbanisation should be regarded as a key factor in exploring the correlation between urbanisation and crop related water resources note that the role of the crop price has not been considered in this case study food security is of vital importance for china the cropping patterns of staple crops at the sub national scale are hardly regulated by market prices but more by national policies we recognize that it is necessary to take crop prices and other determinants e g location of cropping regions the cultural and historical context into consideration when investigating national scale crop wfss cash crops or other countries or regions certain limitations of this study cannot be disregarded first the crop unit wf was estimated by the approach of fast track which only considered the temporal variation in the wf tuninetti et al 2017 proved the applicability of fast track by considering the effects of climate and soil conditions and comparing it with the unit wf based on crop evapotranspiration simulated by the crop growth model moreover uncertainty analysis showed that the standard error of the fast track method was 10 globally and gao et al 2020 further verified that the provincial deviation of the approach in china was within 20 given that the purpose of this study is to evaluate the driving forces instead of quantifying crop wf we consider the estimation of crop wf through this method to be acceptable second only three staple crops were considered in this study which cannot comprehensively illustrate the wfss of china s crop related water sector associated crop production apparently more crop even animal products need to be incorporated into the scoping review on crop wfss in future such as the considerable soybean import for china because of its relatively low yield third this study estimated crop wfss from a single aspect of water quantity while neglecting the implication of water quality however a severe shortage of water quality occurs despite the abundance of water quantity van vliet et al 2017 wfss combining water quantity and quality warrants further investigation based on the aforementioned analysis we propose three policy suggestions first action should be taken to achieve water sustainability in regions with higher crop wfss i e vw exports but water scarcity such as adjustment of crop planting structure towards crops consuming lower water reduction of exports and realisation of sustainable and effective utilisation of water resources related to crop production second the role of additional dimensions of urbanisation on crop related water consumption should not be disregarded particularly in water scarce regions as the heterogeneous and antonymous consequences of various dimensions of urbanisation on crop wfss third quantification of the heterogeneous effects of the socio economic driving factors of crop wfss can help policy makers implement differentiated policies for provinces with different crop wfsss table 3 presents the customised provincial strategies in terms of local conditions from the integral perspective of dominant urbanisation type status of blue water scarcity and crop wfss 4 conclusions this study first investigated the spatiotemporal variations of wfss related to three staple crops via a case study of 31 provinces in china during 2000 2017 and then identified their major driving factors paying particular attention to the impact of the four dimensions of urbanisation finally the spatial heterogeneity of these influencing factors was analysed using the quantile regression approach the primary conclusions drawn are as follows 1 china s crop wf could be self sufficient over the study period of 2000 2017 however the wfss of the three staple crops gradually decreased in 2017 the average wfss was 98 indicating that china had to import 8 5 gm3y 1 vw to meet domestic consumption 2 the sub national spatial distribution of crop wfss captured additional crop related water security risks 30 of the provinces with high crop wfss supply more than 70 of low crop wfss provinces 3 the directions and intensities of crop wfss were determined by the dimension of urbanisation population urbanisation and social urbanisation promoted crop wfss as the decline of per unit wf of crop production induced by technological progress whereas economic urbanisation and spatial urbanisation significantly reduced crop wfss by promoting the consumption wf demand while compressing high yield farmland area 4 with higher marginal effects population urbanisation spatial urbanisation and social urbanisation had relatively more influence on crop wfss in vw exporting provinces i e higher crop wfss but water scarcity we suggest that additional dimensions of urbanisation except population and regional heterogeneity should be incorporated in exploring the relationship between urbanisation and crop related water consumption to formulate differentiated policies addressing urban expansion and water supply and demand this study highlights the importance of quantifying the implications of multi dimensional urbanisation on regional crop related water systems particularly in areas with water shortages future research should focus on the consequences of multidimensional urbanisation on wfss among more

2264,two dimensional hydrodynamic models are computationally expensive this drawback can limit their application to solving problems requiring real time predictions or several simulation runs although the literature presented improvements in using deep learning as an alternative to hydrodynamic models artificial neural networks applications for flood prediction cannot satisfactorily predict floods for areas outside the training datasets with different boundary conditions in this paper we used a conditional generative adversarial network cgan aiming to generalize flood predictions in catchments not included in the training process the proposed method called cgan flood uses two cgan models to solve a rain on grid problem by first identifying wet cells and then estimating the water depths the cgans were trained using hec ras outputs as ground truth cgan flood distributes a target flood volume v t in a given catchment which can be calculated via water balance from hydrological simulations our approach was trained on ten and tested on five urban catchments with distinct characteristics the cgan flood was compared to hec ras for different rainfall magnitudes and surface roughness we also compared our approach to the weighted cellular automata 2d wca2d a rapid flood model rfm used for rain on grid simulations our method successfully predicted water depths in the testing areas showing that cgan flood could generalize to different locations however cgan flood tended to underestimate depths in channels in some areas for events with a small peak of precipitation intensity cgan flood was 50 and 250 times faster than wca2d and hec ras respectively due to its computational efficiency and accuracy we suggest that cgan flood can be applied when fast simulations are necessary and it can be a viable modeling solution for flood forecasts in large scale watersheds keywords rapid flood modeling deep learning generative adversarial networks rain on grid data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods are the costliest natural disaster for life losses and economic damages bulti and abebe 2020 natarajan and radhakrishnan 2019 climate change is likely to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme storm events which can potentially magnify the impacts of flooding aich et al 2016 clavet gaumont et al 2017 yin et al 2018 do lago et al 2021 flood modeling is a fundamental tool for planning and designing flood mitigation in urban areas two dimensional 2d hydrodynamic approaches are the most effective models used for urban flood predictions cea and costabile 2022 however they are computationally expensive hampering their application in large scale watersheds or when many runs are required e g for monte carlo simulation and optimization problems as an alternative rapid flood models rfms have been developed based on simplified modeling approaches such as cellular automata guidolin et al 2016 more recently artificial neural networks models have also been trained to reduce the computation time of flood predictions kabir et al 2020 rfms are fast flood models that decrease simulation time by implementing simplified hydraulic concepts rather than solving complex physical equations teng et al 2017 these approaches usually aim to distribute a flood volume over a domain e g jamali et al 2018 2019 ghimire et al 2013 guidolin et al 2016 while granting significant computational speedups these simplifications reduce their prediction accuracy in areas characterized by high momentum and velocities moreover rfms may require low time steps in areas with high velocities and dem resolution resulting in longer computational runs guidolin et al 2016 deep learning dl techniques have been used to predict floods with satisfactory results berkhahn et al 2019 dtissibe et al 2020 kabir et al 2020 lowe et al 2021 dl models use a multiple layer structure known as artificial neural networks ann to represent high levels of complexity and learn from high dimensional data sit et al 2020 convolutional neural networks cnn in particular have gained popularity in earth sciences due to their ability to process image data and extract features from multiple adjacent pixels kabir et al 2020 cnns have been applied successfully in flood prediction studies lowe et al 2021 applied a u net based dl to model maximum water depths in an urban catchment using spatial inputs and rainfall characteristics they trained their model on parts of the study area and could predict maximum water depths in unseen patches of the same domain guo et al 2022 developed a similar dl model trained with rfm outputs to predict maximum water depths and flow velocities in different catchments although the authors showed that the model could effectively generalize in unseen catchments their approach does not generalize for different rainfall events generative adversarial networks gan goodfellow et al 2014 can be used to improve cnn predictions gans include two convolutional based dl structures a generator g and a discriminator d that compete during training while d is trained to differentiate g s output from the actual data g is trained to generate outputs to be classified as true data by the discriminator gonog and zhou 2019 wang et al 2017 this approach significantly increases the capacity to create more realistic results wang et al 2017 and has been an effective method for generating high resolution outputs cheng et al 2020 recently hofmann and schüttrumpf 2021 applied a conditional generative adversarial network cgan which is also cnn based for predicting floods floodgan their approach uses spatially distributed rainfall as inputs to generate flood maps up to 106 times faster than physically based hydrodynamic modeling however the transferability of their method to other locations is a major challenge because floodgan is domain specific due to the lack of topographic information used as inputs despite the significant advances in the state of art of dl ensuring a meaningful physical connection between inputs and outputs is still a challenge willard et al 2020 swischuk et al 2019 merging dl with physically based models is a promising solution to improve the accuracy of the predictions and the dl generalization capacity as this combination can capture better the physical processes and the dynamics of an entire system willard et al 2020 palmitessa et al 2022 however building a hybrid physics guided dl method with models requiring fixed input sizes such as cnn is difficult ma et al 2021 park et al 2020 one alternative to the fixed input size issue of cnns is to use multiple patches smaller portions of the domain to construct maps for scale dependent problems martins et al 2020 in the case of flood predictions previous studies applied the boundary conditions e g hydrograph or precipitation for individual cnn patches e g guo et al 2022 lowe et al 2021 in these cases the interaction between patches is lost and a full assessment of the entire domain such as maintaining the conservation of mass becomes very complex therefore the strategy of applying patches for flood predictions hampers the development of physics guided dl models according to the literature there is still a lack of an approach capable of generalizing flood predictions to different catchments and boundary conditions the inability to generalize requires the retraining of the model for new areas or when local characteristics change training a dl model is a time consuming process that demands extensive data training data is often obtained from hydrodynamic outputs and thus limits the advantage of such dl models over the traditional hydrodynamic approaches bentivoglio et al 2022 in this paper we aim to narrow this gap by developing a novel physics guided dl method named cgan flood based on a cgan approach to predict flooding in unseen catchments and for different rainfall events our approach includes two generators that identify wet cells and calculate the water depths the dual generator strategy enabled applying boundary conditions to the entire studied area instead of to individual patches therefore this method allowed us to enforce mass conservation for the whole catchment we tested our approach in unseen catchments under varying rainfall conditions 2 methodology the proposed deep learning modeling approach is based on the idea of distributing a target runoff volume v t over a given catchment area to create a map with maximum flood depths d the v t can be calculated via water balance from hydrological simulations which are traditionally faster than hydraulic models while the flood volume distribution is performed with dl models 2 1 rapid flood modeling with cgan flood and the required input data rapid flood simulations with cgan flood require the v t which is the volume to be distributed over the domain and four spatial inputs elevation imperviousness flow accumulation and slope maps these spatial input data have been chosen as they are often used to build hydrological models and are relevant for flood predictions lowe et al 2021 cgan flood is a dual generator approach that uses spatial characteristics to generate flood maps with a volume that matches v t a schematic representation of this hybrid physics guided dl method is shown in fig 1 first a generator g 1 is trained to rank which cells in the domain are likely to be flooded the outputs of g 1 are patches of the whole domain that are combined so that the full catchment is ranked map r then a map with all wet cells w is created by setting a threshold τ and considering all cells in r ranked above τ as wet in other words τ determines the magnitude of flooding with lower values resulting in a larger number of wet cells finally a second generator g 2 is trained to calculate the depths of wet cells in w to create d by combining multiple output patches of g 2 the pix2pix method isola et al 2017 which uses a conditional gan cgan was used to train the generators in cgans the g and d are conditioned with additional information as inputs instead of random noises alone like traditional gans in this paper we conditioned the cgan with local characteristics that affect flood predictions details in section 2 2 the method requires finding a suitable τ so that the total volume v in the final map d which depends on w matches the volume v t this dual generator approach allows applying the boundary conditions in this case v t to the entire catchment and not only the area the patch where g is restricted to unlike previous studies 2 2 cgan structure and maps construction the pix2pix conditional gan uses a generator g with u net based ann for image to image translation i e the model uses noises and conditional images x as inputs to g for generating an output image isola et al 2017 observed that including noise as an input did not contribute to the generation of the final image as it usually happens with gans therefore we only considered images as inputs to cgan flood the training process uses a discriminator d that grades the output of g as a true or false image g 1 and g 2 are trained separately each one with a distinct discriminator d 1 and d 2 the g and d structures used in this paper are shown in fig 2 each step of the downscale contains one 2d convolutional layer conv2d and a leaky relu activation function while the step of the upscale process has one deconvolutional layer with a relu activation function finally the generator s output layer uses hyperbolic tangent activation functions d consists of two downscale blocks followed by conv2d layers then a binary cross entropy function is applied to the output matrix of d to classify the input image as false or true elevation e imperviousness i flow accumulation f and slope s matrices for the whole catchment with dimensions m n are the required data for g 1 the inputs for g 1 x1 are four stacked submatrices with the size of a patch of e i f and s with dimensions s s in which s m and s n the inputs to g 2 x2 include a submatrix of the wet matrix w during the cgan training g 1 x1 and g 2 x2 are optimized to get as close as possible to ground truth submatrixes r and d respectively in our case the ground truth images are obtained from hydrodynamic models the input of the d s includes the same inputs of g plus the image to be classified which can be either the generator s output g 1 x1 or g 2 x2 or the ground truth image the ideal d returns a 0 probability of being a true image if fed with g x and a 100 if the input includes the ground truth the d of both cgans are trained utilizing a loss function loss d which is the following 1 loss d l c e d x t j l c e d x g x k where j and k are label matrixes of ones and zeros used to relate the true and false images respectively t represents the ground truth image either r or d calculated with a hydrodynamic model l c e stands for a binary cross entropy function gneiting and raftery 2007 the g loss function loss g used to train g 1 and g 2 is shown in eq 2 loss g combines the d grading with the least absolute deviation l 1 isola et al 2017 shown in eq 3 2 loss g l c e d x g x j λ l 1 3 l 1 1 s 2 i 0 s j 0 s t i j g x i j where λ is constant once the generators are trained the construction of r and d is done by assigning g 1 x 1 or g 2 x 2 to the patch around a given coordinate x 0 y 0 these coordinates slide through the domain until the whole catchment has been covered however preliminary analysis showed that the model uncertainties were more prominent at the borders possibly because e contains the normalized elevations relative to the central cell further details in the next section therefore only the central portion of each patch is utilized by excluding the 25 extremes as depicted in fig 3 to discard points outside of the catchment area we considered a mask matrix where a flood map is generated since the maximum water depth significantly varies between different catchments we considered a fixed maximum water depth threshold d m a x to further improve the generalizability across catchments preliminary analyses showed that reducing the generator s predicted depth range improved the generalization potential significantly therefore g 2 computes only depths for shallow water d d m a x while simply identifying those considered deeper d d m a x here we used a d m a x 0 3 m which is twice the depth considered a transition between concentrated shallow flows and open channel flow usda 1986 to estimate deeper water depths 0 3 m we interpolated the water surface elevation wse calculated at the frontier between the shallow and deep waters assuming that the water level is linear within this region we based this assumption on 1d hydrodynamic modeling e g hec ras 1d according to which the water surface is leveled perpendicular to the flow direction with a single wse for a given cross section in addition 1d models assume that the water surface is linear between cross sections brunner 2016 here the final water depths are calculated by subtracting the interpolated wse from the dem the whole process is shown in fig 4 this figure also shows that the wse varies in space the interpolation results of the wse are directly dependent on the outputs of g2 which identifies the locations of deeper waters and dictates the values to be interpolated from the borders it also should be noted that the interpolations tend to be perpendicular to the flow direction and flood propagation in channels as higher water depths are more likely to be found along the thalweg and the frontier between deep and shallow water tends to follow the river banks 2 3 data augmentation and normalization hydrodynamic simulations were performed to generate r and d maps used to train the generators for a given domain under a rainfall with an increasing intensity over time the ranking matrix r can be calculated as 4 r t 1 t w t w t i j 1 i f d t i j 0 0 elsewhere where d t is the water depth map at time t w t is a binary map with unitary values for wet cells at time t and t is the number of maps the higher the r value for a given cell the earliest it started to flood in other words cells with a high r value start to flood with small rainfall intensity while the cells with lower r would only flood with more intense precipitations we collected the samples throughout the catchment by sliding a center point of coordinates x 0 y 0 inside the catchment and selecting the patch of dimension s s g x as illustrated in fig 3 we employed data augmentation strategies to increase the generalizability of the proposed model we augmented the number of training samples per catchment by multiplying the elevation maps e by a factor k t m a value lower than 1 generates flatter terrains and shallower channels which are more likely to be flooded on the other hand a k t m larger than 1 increases the slopes and deepens the channels reducing the flood extension in addition to the terrain modification further data augmentation was performed by rotating and mirroring the patches during the data collection the central point slides s 2 plus a random number ranging from 0 to s 2 until the whole domain has been visited this randomization helped to increase the variability of the training dataset as the same points are not always selected for different d maps or k t m finally we applied min max normalization on the e f s r and d to facilitate the training process and improve its generalizability the normalized values of these matrixes ranged from 1 to 1 the wet cell matrix w and the imperviousness i one and zero representing that a cell is fully impervious and pervious were not normalized the maximum values used to normalize r and d were t see eq 4 and d m a x 0 3 m respectively the e submatrix was normalized between 1 and 1 with the elevation relative to the central coordinate of the patch this way the central element of this input is always zero while 1 and 1 represent the lowest and highest elevation cells fixating an origin helps the training process and facilitates the dl to recognize patterns gondhi and kour 2017 2 4 estimating the flood magnitude with τ one key component of our model is the ability to match the total flood runoff volume v t estimated by a hydrological model for a given catchment thus providing a link with physical based models and enforcing mass conservation for this purpose we iteratively modify the threshold τ used in the determination of the wet cell map w until the relative error between the predicted volume v eq 5 and v t is smaller than a pre defined tolerance ξ t o l the volume v and the relative error ɛ are calculated as 5 v a i j d i j 6 ɛ v v t v t where a is the area of a single cell and d i j is the water depth at row i and column j in d decreasing the value of τ increases the flooded area and consequentially v therefore the error as a function of τ is unimodal this characteristic enables applying the golden search optimizing algorithm kiefer 1953 an efficient method to single variable problems details of the golden search can be seen in supplementary material 1 it is worth noting that our approach aims to distribute a v t that corresponds to maximum flood depths in the entire domain as shown in eq 6 which differs from instantaneous volume the maximum depth is calculated with the depth peak of the whole rainfall event due to the flood wave propagation the arrival time of maximum depth varies across cells at the time of maximum instantaneous volume not all cells in the domain present maximum water depth therefore the maximum volume calculated with instantaneous depths is smaller than the volume calculated with a map of maximum depths in this paper we assume that flood wave attenuation can be irrelevant at short distances therefore the time of maximum flood depth of nearby cells is closely the same in this case the difference between maximum instantaneous volume and volume computed with maximum depths can be neglectable the methods and assumptions for calculating v t via hydrological modeling are depicted in section 3 3 2 5 evaluation metrics the root squared mean error rsme and the coefficient of determination r2 were used to evaluate the model performance we also used the metrics hit rate hr false alarm rate far and critical success index csi to evaluate the spatial performance of the final d map hr far and csi can be calculated with the following equations 7 hr hits misses 8 far hits hits false alarms 9 csi hits hits false alarms misses where hits are the cells flooded in both models false alarms are the cells flooded only with cgan flood and misses are the cells flooded only predicted by the hydrodynamic model we considered a threshold of 0 01 m to distinguish dry and wet cells a value used in other flood studies brown et al 2007 shi et al 2021 preliminary analysis not shown indicated that cells with flood depths between 0 01 m and 0 05 m accounted for an average of 8 of the total runoff volume in training areas this is significant to evaluate cgan flood as this method aims to match the total volume of d with v t in addition accounting for shallow depths is relevant to understand the outputs of g 1 as it computes wet cells for any depths above 0 larger thresholds prevent the evaluation of the g 1 performance in identifying the wet cells to evaluate the performance of cgan flood for cells with deeper flood levels and the performance of g 2 we also included csi0 05 and csi0 3 in our analysis to consider water depths higher than 0 05 m and 0 3 m similarly to lowe et al 2021 2 6 cgan training and validation both training processes of g 1 d 1 and g 2 d 2 were performed with 200 epochs and a batch size of 128 the adam optimizer kingma and ba 2014 was used with a learning rate of 0 005 the λ for g 1 d 1 and g 2 d 2 were 5 and 40 respectively so that to the discriminator and mae in eq 2 had approximately the same contribution to the total loss g at approximately epoch 20 when the losses started to get stable for each epoch the parameters of g 1 and g 2 were saved so they could be used during validation for the model validation we evaluated the capacity of g 1 and g 2 to generate full maps of the entire catchment instead of computing the loss at each epoch during the training phase for each individual patches fig 5 step 1 evaluated the g 2 and wse interpolation shown in fig 4 in reproducing the flood depths calculated with hydrodynamic models during this validation the w map to be used as input to g 2 was determined directly from hydrodynamic outputs to compare depths for the same wet cells then d maps were generated with g 2 parameters saved for each of the 200 epochs used for training these maps were evaluated with csi0 3 csi0 05 and rsme metrics to identify at what epoch the parameters of g 2 presented the most accurate flood depths map d since we used flood maps of the entire domain we also validated the interaction between patches instead of isolated g 2 x 2 the interaction between patches is important because it can affect the wse in deep areas which is estimated via linear interpolation in step 2 g 1 was validated here we generated r maps with g 1 saved for all 200 epochs the golden search single variable optimization method was performed for each of the 200 r maps to identify τ and what g 1 model generates the most accurate d the validated g 2 was selected and was used during the golden search for validating g 1 therefore the validation of g 1 can be interpreted as a validation of the entire cgan flood method since w indicates the cells that are flooded for any depth above zero the metric csi was used to validate g 2 which includes shallower depths 3 studied area and flood simulations the training tr validation va and testing te datasets consisted of ten two and five sub catchments in san antonio texas fig 6a these sub catchments are located in the upper san antonio and leon creek watersheds the training sub catchments are mostly clustered at the eastern portion of leon creek testing areas te1 te2 and te3 are closer to the training areas while va1 va2 te4 and te5 are outside the training areas cluster the areas selected for testing and validation include catchments with different sizes average cell slopes and percentage of imperviousness allowing cgan flood to evaluate different spatial configurations the characteristics of all areas are presented in table 1 hec ras 2d models were created for each training and testing area with 3 m grid resolution as recommended by federal emergency management agency 2020 along with dem and imperviousness maps of the same resolutions both provided by the san antonio river authority sara e cavazos personal communication 2018 a required hec ras 2d model parameter is the manning s roughness coefficient for pervious and impervious cells we selected n of 0 03 m 1 3 s 1 for impervious cells a typical value that represents the roughness of concrete brunner 2016 for pervious areas we selected n 0 1 m 1 3 s 1 which is in the recommended range for different pervious covers e g bare field grass row crops sparsely vegetated surfaces and others engman 1986 the input rainfall in all catchments was assumed to be spatially uniform because the catchments are relatively small 3 1 training and validation we used a synthetic linear rainfall hyetograph in the training areas fig 6b the rainfall intensity increases smoothly over time to minimize differences in water levels due to flood wave propagation this rainfall has a 1 minute time step and a total duration of 100 min with intensity varying from 7 to 700 mm h approximately twice the maximum rainfall intensity of the 100 year storm we used this extreme precipitation intensity so that the flooded areas to be predicted are likely to be smaller than what the dl has seen during the training phase flood maps for every training area were acquired every 1 min to compute r with eq 4 and therefore t 100 during validation of g 2 d maps were collected every 5 min this approach allows g 2 to learn water depths from lighter and heavier rainfall intensity t closer to 0 and t we considered additional simulations obtained by terrain augmentation for the training dataset as described in section 2 2 using k t m values of 0 8 0 9 1 1 and 1 2 for validating both generators we simulated maximum depths in the areas va1 and va2 using the 25 and 100 year storms with a duration of 3 h fig 6c the alternating blocks method was used to obtain the rainfall temporal distribution with a 5 minute resolution we evaluated the d maps with the averages between the csi and rsme metrics computed for both design storms and va locations 3 2 testing we tested cgan flood s capacity to reproduce hec ras depth maps in the te catchments which were not included in the training or validation phases similarly to the validation we calculated v t from hec ras flood maps eq 5 to compare maps with the same flood volume therefore we excluded the uncertainties propagated from the hydrological model to analyze the errors that are solely produced by the cgan flood method four rainfall events were used including the two design storms and two observed events fig 6d and e observed event 1 obs1 and observed event 2 obs2 were measured at the san antonio international airport noaa station id ghcnd usw00012921 lat 29 54429 long 98 48395 and in the te2 catchment respectively with time resolutions of 15 and 5 min both observed events have a total of 130 mm in 3 h obs1 has a distinct rainfall peak while the rainfall volume of obs2 is more evenly distributed over time in addition to the different rainfall events we also tested the model s capability to predict flood depths with different scenarios of manning s n these scenarios were simulated on hec ras with manning s n as twice scenario m1 and a half scenario m2 of the values used for training the cgan 0 015 and 0 06 for the pervious and 0 05 and 0 02 m 1 3 s 1 for the impervious grids respectively we used the 25 and 100 year storms to evaluate the influence of surface roughness for different rainfall magnitudes the surface roughness reflects how quickly the runoff flows out of the catchment and consequently the v t to be distributed for instance a higher manning s n results in a higher time of concentration and higher v t for the same rainfall due to a higher flood accumulation in the cells of the domain the goal of this experiment is to evaluate how the changes in v t due to different surface roughness could affect the performance of the cgan flood model 3 3 hydrological modeling and cellular automata benchmark simulations in this study we used swmm models that were previously developed by zarezadeh 2017 for areas te1 and te2 the te1 and te2 models are subdivided into 34 and 163 sub catchments respectively the computation of v t was performed by summing the maximum instantaneous volume of each of the smaller components of the swmm models separately instead of a water balance applied to the whole catchment this way we reduce the error associated with the approximation that we assumed between the instantaneous maximum volume and the volume corresponding to maximum depth details of how v t was calculated with swmm can be seen in supplementary material 2 the longest segment in our swmm models is approximately 770 m corresponding to an open channel conduit link in area te1 in supplementary material 3 we show that the effects of flood wave propagation could be neglected in that segment for these analyses effective precipitation was inserted on hec ras and wca2d to account for infiltration hec ras 6 0 brunner 2016 and newer versions have the option to compute infiltration for 2d simulations however we used effective precipitation as no infiltration was included in the hec ras models used for training including infiltration would increase the cgan flood complexity as different infiltration capacities would have to be tested to account for different soil types for comparison wca2d does not account for infiltration the wca2d only uses one global manning s n for the whole domain which was set as 0 025 and 0 055 m 1 3 s 1 for areas te1 and te2 respectively these values were obtained after calibration that ensured maximum csi0 03 for the 100 year storm when compared to hec ras we selected csi0 3 because 0 3 m was the minimum depth used to evaluate the wca2d model according to guidolin et al 2016 in addition a 0 01s minimum time step was used which showed no signs of instability the two design storms and two observed events used for testing cgan flood were also modeled with wca2d 3 4 hardware specifications we performed all cgan flood and wca2d simulations on an nvidia geforce rtx 2060 super gpu 1650 mhz and 16 gb of ram hec ras model does not support gpu therefore the hydrodynamic simulations were done using an i7 10700 cpu with 2 9 ghz 4 results and discussion 4 1 cgan flood training and validation the evolution of r and d maps created with g 1 and g 2 during the validation is illustrated in fig 7 the results show that the average csi metric for r and d increased rapidly for the first epochs and then stabilized fig 7a and b we selected the parameters saved at epoch 120 for g 1 as csi starts to get unstable beyond this point due to overfitting fig 7c shows the r maps obtained by hec ras simulations and generated by g 2 at epochs 3 120 and 200 in the va2 area in epoch 3 for example g 1 has already started to understand flooding features in va2 and indicates the areas most susceptible to flooding on the other hand r shows signs of overfitting in epoch 200 in comparison to g 1 g 2 converged faster as fig 7b shows the highest csi0 3 was observed at epoch 30 and beyond this point rsme started to increase slowly fig 7d illustrates g 2 accuracy for water depths in comparison to hec ras in epoch 30 for the 100 year storm 4 2 cgan flood testing in this section we present the results of the model performance in the testing areas here cgan flood distributes a v t calculated from the hec ras simulation therefore the errors presented in this section are solely related to the cgan flood methods and do not include uncertainties in flood volume propagated by the hydrological model the model s performance was satisfactory for all storm events and testing areas as shown in table 2 among the four tested rainfall storms the cgan flood obtained better performance for the 100 year storm as shown by all the goodness of fit metrics with the exception of the rsme this behavior occurred because the rsme is more sensitive to larger storms than the other metrics and the 100 year storm resulted in the highest flooding and water depths r2 values were above 0 7 for all testing cases except in te5 for obs2 hr values range from 83 9 to 95 3 with relatively low variance across different events the far ranged from 8 5 to 24 4 with higher values worst performances found for the obs2 event the higher far shows that g 1 tends to overestimate the number of wet cells for events with smaller rainfall intensity csi metric was above 70 for all catchments with lower values for obs2 event due to higher far the csi0 05 and csi0 3 presented low values because errors from g 1 which identified a larger number of wet cells in comparison to the ground truth were propagated to g 2 predictions our results suggest that cgan flood can generalize across different watersheds and rainfall forcings for instance cgan flood was capable of predicting floods for the obs2 and 100 year storms in areas te2 and te3 fig 8 regardless of the significant differences in the catchment area and rainfall magnitude te3 is approximately 7 times larger than te2 in addition cgan flood distributed a v t more than 20 times larger in area te3 for the 100 year storm when compared to te2 for the obs2 event the errors in depth are mainly within 0 1 and 0 1 m in the area te3 cgan flood underestimated water depths in the main channel with errors ranging from 0 3 to 0 1 m since cgan flood matches volume with hec ras in these analyses there was a more significant frequency of errors up to 0 1 m to compensate for the underestimations in the main channels in area te2 cgan flood overestimated depths in parts of the channel but overall there was a balance between the positive and negative errors the results indicate that cgan flood s performance for deeper water depths was lower than for shallow locations as indicated by csi0 3 values one reason is that the deeper flooding gets restricted to smaller portions of the domain we noted that misses or false alarms significantly affected csi especially for the obs2 event that generated smaller flooded areas due to a smaller rainfall peak this pattern in performance is also observed with u flood lowe et al 2021 fig 9 compares the flooded areas with d 0 3 m in te4 and te5 for the 100 year storm and obs2 events in area te4 both hec ras and cgan flood predicted many flooded streets for both events the reason is that this area has a smaller average slope and tends to concentrate runoff more easily on the other hand flooding in te5 is more restricted and cgan flood tends to underestimate flooded areas despite these errors cgan flood was able to capture the flooded cells in this testing area 4 3 sensitivity of cgan flood to different manning coefficients the model s sensitivity was tested for different manning s roughness values table 3 here two scenarios were evaluated m1 lower manning s n and m2 higher manning s n both far and hr decrease for the m1 scenario when compared to manning s n used for training by increasing the surface roughness m2 scenario surface runoff flows more slowly and accumulates within the sub catchments as a result the flooded area increases which reduces the false alarms and increases the misses with the increase in the number of wet cells in hec ras outputs cgan flood had an accuracy improvement because some false alarms became hits on the other hand some of the dry cells become wet which increases the number of misses in the case of the m1 scenario the number of flooded cells decreases with high runoff velocities therefore both far and hr values tends to decrease despite the decrease in hr for higher manning s n the overall performance of cgan flood improved for larger flooded areas the csi csi0 05 and csi0 3 increased for both 25 and 100 year storms in the m1 scenario compared to the original model on the other hand the performance of the cgan flood decreased in most cases for m2 the worst performance was also observed for area te5 the difference in flooded area predictions for lower and higher n values is illustrated in fig 10 the number of false alarms is significantly lower for the m1 scenario fig 10a b compared to m2 10c and d the large number of false alarm rates in m1 originated from w maps as the cgan flood also overestimates flooded areas for smaller depths therefore the distribution of the flooded cells was miscalculated by g 1 and propagated to g 2 predictions however in general the metrics show a satisfactory performance of the cgan flood for different surface roughness scenarios as shown in table 3 4 4 coupling hydrological modeling with cgan flood and comparison to wca2d in this section we calculated v t with a swmm model to study the performance of cgan flood when combined with a hydrological model table 4 reports the total flood volume v t for the maximum depth map computed with hec ras wca2d and swmm in areas te1 and te2 the results show that v t was generally underestimated with swmm except for event obs2 in te1 the most significant error in volume was registered for obs2 in te2 which was 25 9 lower than hec ras one possible explanation is that the depression storage in the terrain is better captured with a fully distributed model which can be underestimated with the swmm model the evaluation metrics for cgan flood and wca2d are shown in table 5 despite underestimating v t the volumes are similar to those computed with hec ras and did not affect the overall performance of cgan flood when calculating v t from hec ras maps see table 2 the exception was te2 for obs2 where the error in v t was significant see table 4 affecting the prediction of the maximum flood the csi0 3 in this case was as low as 41 1 despite swmm predicting a better v t than wca2d the performance of cgan flood was similar to the wca2d model the rsme values for cgan flood in area te1 were close to wca2d and higher in area te2 overall wca2d overestimated depths for very shallow waters between 0 01 and 0 05 m which compromised the overall performance of models as indicated by the csi metric however csi0 05 was in general higher for wca2d than for cgan flood the results show that cgan flood performed better for very shallow depths 0 05 m while wca2d had better predictions for depths between 0 05 and 0 3 m concerning csi0 3 cgan flood over performed wca2d for all rainfall events in area te1 and under performed in area te2 for both models csi0 05 is higher than csi0 3 which is expected as the considered flooded area is smaller for depths 0 05 m than 0 3 m lowe et al 2021 also reported lower csi0 3 values than csi0 05 fig 11 shows the maximum water depths computed for areas te1 and te2 for the 100 year and obs2 rainfall events both models predicted well the depths and flooded area in te1 however wca2d underestimated depths in the main channel the reason is that wca2d uses a single manning s n for the entire domain a limitation of this approach the cgan flood significantly underestimated the flooded area in te2 for the obs2 event in this case v t calculated with swmm was 25 lower than hec ras which resulted in a significantly lower flood area the cgan flood coupled with the swmm was significantly faster than hec ras and wca2d table 6 while wca2d was on average 5 times faster than hec ras cgan flood and swmm combined were on average 250 times faster than hec ras the difference in simulation time is more significant for larger areas for example in area te3 largest training area hec ras simulations took an average of 2 h and 45 min between all four events while cgan flood excluding swmm required an average of 30 s to complete all the simulations 330 times faster the computational time of the cgan flood method is more variable than hec ras or wca2d because it depends on the number of iterations of the golden search optimization method that estimates the parameter τ for instance cgan flood found d after eight iterations for the 25 year storm and required only two iterations for the 100 year storm in area te1 it is worth noting that v t can be calculated with other hydrological models other than swmm e g hec hms or gssha which can affect the simulation speed and accuracy in computing v t 5 advantages and limitations here we discuss the major advantages and some limitations of cgan flood the major advantage of cgan flood is speed the results show significantly faster simulations than hydrodynamic simulations while maintaining the overall good predictive performance of flood locations and water depths second cgan flood was able to generalize predictions in unseen catchments the generalization can promote the application of dl in flood studies as the necessity of retraining is reduced the proposed cgan flood model achieves results comparable with other rfms but can significantly improve the computational time of large scale flood simulations another advantage of cgan flood compared to other deep learning methods found in the literature is the use of mass conservation which gives the model a physical backbone although it requires the use of a hydrological model to estimate the total runoff volumes regarding limitations or deficiencies the results indicate that cgan flood tended to underestimate flood depths in channels for small rainfall events one limitation of our study is that infiltration and hydraulic structures e g sewers bridges and culverts were excluded from the hec ras simulations used to generate the training dataset although the infiltration losses and drainage system can be simulated with swmm and be reflected on v t the overland distribution of flooded volume might be affected because the location of flow and volumes e g combined sewer overflow is lost the lack of infiltration losses and no options for the sewer system are also missing from other models such as wca2d the catchments tested in this study rely mainly on open channels and overland flow the model likely fails in urban catchments where underground sewer systems are significant one solution might be applying cgan flood in subdivided catchments in multiple simulations in this case v t values could be calculated for each sub catchment and be used with cgan flood to spread the flood volume helping to identify vulnerable locations to flooding more investigation is needed on how to incorporate drainage infrastructure in the model e g sewers culverts bridges furthermore subdividing the domain into smaller sub catchments can also be necessary to reduce the error when calculating maximum depths in a large domain the v t can be underestimated if the instantaneous maximum runoff volume is calculated for large areas as the effect of flood wave propagation can be significant finally our model assumes a linear wse for deeper waters which can be less accurate than the outputs of 2d modeling with wca2d and hec ras brunner 2016 also highlights that linear assumptions of hec ras 1d are a disadvantage compared to the hec ras 2d one potential application of cgan flood would be to improve the resolution of fully distributed hydrological and hydraulic models the idea is to run fully distributed hydrological models e g ghssa in a coarse spatial resolution and use cgan flood to obtain high resolution floodplains one limiting aspect of cgan flood is cell resolution currently the cgan flood model only works for a spatial resolution of 3 m although this is within the fema recommended scale for hydraulic studies of floodplains cgan flood cannot be used to generate flood maps on finer cells or in areas where high resolution data do not exist predictions with different spatial resolutions would require building new hydrodynamic models to generate new data and re train cgan flood 6 conclusions and future model improvements this paper developed the model cgan flood a rapid flood model based on conditional generative adversarial networks to estimate high resolution maximum flood areas this approach generates maximum flood depths by distributing a flood volume cgan flood uses two generators to first identify flooded cells and then to estimate water depths this method was evaluated for catchments unseen to the generators during training or validation phases results showed that cgan flood could generate accurate results for a variety of catchments rainfall magnitudes and surface roughness indicating that the generators could satisfactorily generalize their predictions future model improvements could include infiltration different manning s n and sewer systems adding these aspects could enable dl models to calculate flood depths directly from rainfall inputs potentially eliminating the need to use a hydrological model before computing the flood volume to be distributed these advancements however would require many additional simulations on catchments with different sewer system configurations various infiltration capacities and land cover types we also suggest the development of new dl methods that can accurately generalize predictions of deeper water which can replace the wse interpolation approach adopted for cgan flood and

2264,two dimensional hydrodynamic models are computationally expensive this drawback can limit their application to solving problems requiring real time predictions or several simulation runs although the literature presented improvements in using deep learning as an alternative to hydrodynamic models artificial neural networks applications for flood prediction cannot satisfactorily predict floods for areas outside the training datasets with different boundary conditions in this paper we used a conditional generative adversarial network cgan aiming to generalize flood predictions in catchments not included in the training process the proposed method called cgan flood uses two cgan models to solve a rain on grid problem by first identifying wet cells and then estimating the water depths the cgans were trained using hec ras outputs as ground truth cgan flood distributes a target flood volume v t in a given catchment which can be calculated via water balance from hydrological simulations our approach was trained on ten and tested on five urban catchments with distinct characteristics the cgan flood was compared to hec ras for different rainfall magnitudes and surface roughness we also compared our approach to the weighted cellular automata 2d wca2d a rapid flood model rfm used for rain on grid simulations our method successfully predicted water depths in the testing areas showing that cgan flood could generalize to different locations however cgan flood tended to underestimate depths in channels in some areas for events with a small peak of precipitation intensity cgan flood was 50 and 250 times faster than wca2d and hec ras respectively due to its computational efficiency and accuracy we suggest that cgan flood can be applied when fast simulations are necessary and it can be a viable modeling solution for flood forecasts in large scale watersheds keywords rapid flood modeling deep learning generative adversarial networks rain on grid data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods are the costliest natural disaster for life losses and economic damages bulti and abebe 2020 natarajan and radhakrishnan 2019 climate change is likely to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme storm events which can potentially magnify the impacts of flooding aich et al 2016 clavet gaumont et al 2017 yin et al 2018 do lago et al 2021 flood modeling is a fundamental tool for planning and designing flood mitigation in urban areas two dimensional 2d hydrodynamic approaches are the most effective models used for urban flood predictions cea and costabile 2022 however they are computationally expensive hampering their application in large scale watersheds or when many runs are required e g for monte carlo simulation and optimization problems as an alternative rapid flood models rfms have been developed based on simplified modeling approaches such as cellular automata guidolin et al 2016 more recently artificial neural networks models have also been trained to reduce the computation time of flood predictions kabir et al 2020 rfms are fast flood models that decrease simulation time by implementing simplified hydraulic concepts rather than solving complex physical equations teng et al 2017 these approaches usually aim to distribute a flood volume over a domain e g jamali et al 2018 2019 ghimire et al 2013 guidolin et al 2016 while granting significant computational speedups these simplifications reduce their prediction accuracy in areas characterized by high momentum and velocities moreover rfms may require low time steps in areas with high velocities and dem resolution resulting in longer computational runs guidolin et al 2016 deep learning dl techniques have been used to predict floods with satisfactory results berkhahn et al 2019 dtissibe et al 2020 kabir et al 2020 lowe et al 2021 dl models use a multiple layer structure known as artificial neural networks ann to represent high levels of complexity and learn from high dimensional data sit et al 2020 convolutional neural networks cnn in particular have gained popularity in earth sciences due to their ability to process image data and extract features from multiple adjacent pixels kabir et al 2020 cnns have been applied successfully in flood prediction studies lowe et al 2021 applied a u net based dl to model maximum water depths in an urban catchment using spatial inputs and rainfall characteristics they trained their model on parts of the study area and could predict maximum water depths in unseen patches of the same domain guo et al 2022 developed a similar dl model trained with rfm outputs to predict maximum water depths and flow velocities in different catchments although the authors showed that the model could effectively generalize in unseen catchments their approach does not generalize for different rainfall events generative adversarial networks gan goodfellow et al 2014 can be used to improve cnn predictions gans include two convolutional based dl structures a generator g and a discriminator d that compete during training while d is trained to differentiate g s output from the actual data g is trained to generate outputs to be classified as true data by the discriminator gonog and zhou 2019 wang et al 2017 this approach significantly increases the capacity to create more realistic results wang et al 2017 and has been an effective method for generating high resolution outputs cheng et al 2020 recently hofmann and schüttrumpf 2021 applied a conditional generative adversarial network cgan which is also cnn based for predicting floods floodgan their approach uses spatially distributed rainfall as inputs to generate flood maps up to 106 times faster than physically based hydrodynamic modeling however the transferability of their method to other locations is a major challenge because floodgan is domain specific due to the lack of topographic information used as inputs despite the significant advances in the state of art of dl ensuring a meaningful physical connection between inputs and outputs is still a challenge willard et al 2020 swischuk et al 2019 merging dl with physically based models is a promising solution to improve the accuracy of the predictions and the dl generalization capacity as this combination can capture better the physical processes and the dynamics of an entire system willard et al 2020 palmitessa et al 2022 however building a hybrid physics guided dl method with models requiring fixed input sizes such as cnn is difficult ma et al 2021 park et al 2020 one alternative to the fixed input size issue of cnns is to use multiple patches smaller portions of the domain to construct maps for scale dependent problems martins et al 2020 in the case of flood predictions previous studies applied the boundary conditions e g hydrograph or precipitation for individual cnn patches e g guo et al 2022 lowe et al 2021 in these cases the interaction between patches is lost and a full assessment of the entire domain such as maintaining the conservation of mass becomes very complex therefore the strategy of applying patches for flood predictions hampers the development of physics guided dl models according to the literature there is still a lack of an approach capable of generalizing flood predictions to different catchments and boundary conditions the inability to generalize requires the retraining of the model for new areas or when local characteristics change training a dl model is a time consuming process that demands extensive data training data is often obtained from hydrodynamic outputs and thus limits the advantage of such dl models over the traditional hydrodynamic approaches bentivoglio et al 2022 in this paper we aim to narrow this gap by developing a novel physics guided dl method named cgan flood based on a cgan approach to predict flooding in unseen catchments and for different rainfall events our approach includes two generators that identify wet cells and calculate the water depths the dual generator strategy enabled applying boundary conditions to the entire studied area instead of to individual patches therefore this method allowed us to enforce mass conservation for the whole catchment we tested our approach in unseen catchments under varying rainfall conditions 2 methodology the proposed deep learning modeling approach is based on the idea of distributing a target runoff volume v t over a given catchment area to create a map with maximum flood depths d the v t can be calculated via water balance from hydrological simulations which are traditionally faster than hydraulic models while the flood volume distribution is performed with dl models 2 1 rapid flood modeling with cgan flood and the required input data rapid flood simulations with cgan flood require the v t which is the volume to be distributed over the domain and four spatial inputs elevation imperviousness flow accumulation and slope maps these spatial input data have been chosen as they are often used to build hydrological models and are relevant for flood predictions lowe et al 2021 cgan flood is a dual generator approach that uses spatial characteristics to generate flood maps with a volume that matches v t a schematic representation of this hybrid physics guided dl method is shown in fig 1 first a generator g 1 is trained to rank which cells in the domain are likely to be flooded the outputs of g 1 are patches of the whole domain that are combined so that the full catchment is ranked map r then a map with all wet cells w is created by setting a threshold τ and considering all cells in r ranked above τ as wet in other words τ determines the magnitude of flooding with lower values resulting in a larger number of wet cells finally a second generator g 2 is trained to calculate the depths of wet cells in w to create d by combining multiple output patches of g 2 the pix2pix method isola et al 2017 which uses a conditional gan cgan was used to train the generators in cgans the g and d are conditioned with additional information as inputs instead of random noises alone like traditional gans in this paper we conditioned the cgan with local characteristics that affect flood predictions details in section 2 2 the method requires finding a suitable τ so that the total volume v in the final map d which depends on w matches the volume v t this dual generator approach allows applying the boundary conditions in this case v t to the entire catchment and not only the area the patch where g is restricted to unlike previous studies 2 2 cgan structure and maps construction the pix2pix conditional gan uses a generator g with u net based ann for image to image translation i e the model uses noises and conditional images x as inputs to g for generating an output image isola et al 2017 observed that including noise as an input did not contribute to the generation of the final image as it usually happens with gans therefore we only considered images as inputs to cgan flood the training process uses a discriminator d that grades the output of g as a true or false image g 1 and g 2 are trained separately each one with a distinct discriminator d 1 and d 2 the g and d structures used in this paper are shown in fig 2 each step of the downscale contains one 2d convolutional layer conv2d and a leaky relu activation function while the step of the upscale process has one deconvolutional layer with a relu activation function finally the generator s output layer uses hyperbolic tangent activation functions d consists of two downscale blocks followed by conv2d layers then a binary cross entropy function is applied to the output matrix of d to classify the input image as false or true elevation e imperviousness i flow accumulation f and slope s matrices for the whole catchment with dimensions m n are the required data for g 1 the inputs for g 1 x1 are four stacked submatrices with the size of a patch of e i f and s with dimensions s s in which s m and s n the inputs to g 2 x2 include a submatrix of the wet matrix w during the cgan training g 1 x1 and g 2 x2 are optimized to get as close as possible to ground truth submatrixes r and d respectively in our case the ground truth images are obtained from hydrodynamic models the input of the d s includes the same inputs of g plus the image to be classified which can be either the generator s output g 1 x1 or g 2 x2 or the ground truth image the ideal d returns a 0 probability of being a true image if fed with g x and a 100 if the input includes the ground truth the d of both cgans are trained utilizing a loss function loss d which is the following 1 loss d l c e d x t j l c e d x g x k where j and k are label matrixes of ones and zeros used to relate the true and false images respectively t represents the ground truth image either r or d calculated with a hydrodynamic model l c e stands for a binary cross entropy function gneiting and raftery 2007 the g loss function loss g used to train g 1 and g 2 is shown in eq 2 loss g combines the d grading with the least absolute deviation l 1 isola et al 2017 shown in eq 3 2 loss g l c e d x g x j λ l 1 3 l 1 1 s 2 i 0 s j 0 s t i j g x i j where λ is constant once the generators are trained the construction of r and d is done by assigning g 1 x 1 or g 2 x 2 to the patch around a given coordinate x 0 y 0 these coordinates slide through the domain until the whole catchment has been covered however preliminary analysis showed that the model uncertainties were more prominent at the borders possibly because e contains the normalized elevations relative to the central cell further details in the next section therefore only the central portion of each patch is utilized by excluding the 25 extremes as depicted in fig 3 to discard points outside of the catchment area we considered a mask matrix where a flood map is generated since the maximum water depth significantly varies between different catchments we considered a fixed maximum water depth threshold d m a x to further improve the generalizability across catchments preliminary analyses showed that reducing the generator s predicted depth range improved the generalization potential significantly therefore g 2 computes only depths for shallow water d d m a x while simply identifying those considered deeper d d m a x here we used a d m a x 0 3 m which is twice the depth considered a transition between concentrated shallow flows and open channel flow usda 1986 to estimate deeper water depths 0 3 m we interpolated the water surface elevation wse calculated at the frontier between the shallow and deep waters assuming that the water level is linear within this region we based this assumption on 1d hydrodynamic modeling e g hec ras 1d according to which the water surface is leveled perpendicular to the flow direction with a single wse for a given cross section in addition 1d models assume that the water surface is linear between cross sections brunner 2016 here the final water depths are calculated by subtracting the interpolated wse from the dem the whole process is shown in fig 4 this figure also shows that the wse varies in space the interpolation results of the wse are directly dependent on the outputs of g2 which identifies the locations of deeper waters and dictates the values to be interpolated from the borders it also should be noted that the interpolations tend to be perpendicular to the flow direction and flood propagation in channels as higher water depths are more likely to be found along the thalweg and the frontier between deep and shallow water tends to follow the river banks 2 3 data augmentation and normalization hydrodynamic simulations were performed to generate r and d maps used to train the generators for a given domain under a rainfall with an increasing intensity over time the ranking matrix r can be calculated as 4 r t 1 t w t w t i j 1 i f d t i j 0 0 elsewhere where d t is the water depth map at time t w t is a binary map with unitary values for wet cells at time t and t is the number of maps the higher the r value for a given cell the earliest it started to flood in other words cells with a high r value start to flood with small rainfall intensity while the cells with lower r would only flood with more intense precipitations we collected the samples throughout the catchment by sliding a center point of coordinates x 0 y 0 inside the catchment and selecting the patch of dimension s s g x as illustrated in fig 3 we employed data augmentation strategies to increase the generalizability of the proposed model we augmented the number of training samples per catchment by multiplying the elevation maps e by a factor k t m a value lower than 1 generates flatter terrains and shallower channels which are more likely to be flooded on the other hand a k t m larger than 1 increases the slopes and deepens the channels reducing the flood extension in addition to the terrain modification further data augmentation was performed by rotating and mirroring the patches during the data collection the central point slides s 2 plus a random number ranging from 0 to s 2 until the whole domain has been visited this randomization helped to increase the variability of the training dataset as the same points are not always selected for different d maps or k t m finally we applied min max normalization on the e f s r and d to facilitate the training process and improve its generalizability the normalized values of these matrixes ranged from 1 to 1 the wet cell matrix w and the imperviousness i one and zero representing that a cell is fully impervious and pervious were not normalized the maximum values used to normalize r and d were t see eq 4 and d m a x 0 3 m respectively the e submatrix was normalized between 1 and 1 with the elevation relative to the central coordinate of the patch this way the central element of this input is always zero while 1 and 1 represent the lowest and highest elevation cells fixating an origin helps the training process and facilitates the dl to recognize patterns gondhi and kour 2017 2 4 estimating the flood magnitude with τ one key component of our model is the ability to match the total flood runoff volume v t estimated by a hydrological model for a given catchment thus providing a link with physical based models and enforcing mass conservation for this purpose we iteratively modify the threshold τ used in the determination of the wet cell map w until the relative error between the predicted volume v eq 5 and v t is smaller than a pre defined tolerance ξ t o l the volume v and the relative error ɛ are calculated as 5 v a i j d i j 6 ɛ v v t v t where a is the area of a single cell and d i j is the water depth at row i and column j in d decreasing the value of τ increases the flooded area and consequentially v therefore the error as a function of τ is unimodal this characteristic enables applying the golden search optimizing algorithm kiefer 1953 an efficient method to single variable problems details of the golden search can be seen in supplementary material 1 it is worth noting that our approach aims to distribute a v t that corresponds to maximum flood depths in the entire domain as shown in eq 6 which differs from instantaneous volume the maximum depth is calculated with the depth peak of the whole rainfall event due to the flood wave propagation the arrival time of maximum depth varies across cells at the time of maximum instantaneous volume not all cells in the domain present maximum water depth therefore the maximum volume calculated with instantaneous depths is smaller than the volume calculated with a map of maximum depths in this paper we assume that flood wave attenuation can be irrelevant at short distances therefore the time of maximum flood depth of nearby cells is closely the same in this case the difference between maximum instantaneous volume and volume computed with maximum depths can be neglectable the methods and assumptions for calculating v t via hydrological modeling are depicted in section 3 3 2 5 evaluation metrics the root squared mean error rsme and the coefficient of determination r2 were used to evaluate the model performance we also used the metrics hit rate hr false alarm rate far and critical success index csi to evaluate the spatial performance of the final d map hr far and csi can be calculated with the following equations 7 hr hits misses 8 far hits hits false alarms 9 csi hits hits false alarms misses where hits are the cells flooded in both models false alarms are the cells flooded only with cgan flood and misses are the cells flooded only predicted by the hydrodynamic model we considered a threshold of 0 01 m to distinguish dry and wet cells a value used in other flood studies brown et al 2007 shi et al 2021 preliminary analysis not shown indicated that cells with flood depths between 0 01 m and 0 05 m accounted for an average of 8 of the total runoff volume in training areas this is significant to evaluate cgan flood as this method aims to match the total volume of d with v t in addition accounting for shallow depths is relevant to understand the outputs of g 1 as it computes wet cells for any depths above 0 larger thresholds prevent the evaluation of the g 1 performance in identifying the wet cells to evaluate the performance of cgan flood for cells with deeper flood levels and the performance of g 2 we also included csi0 05 and csi0 3 in our analysis to consider water depths higher than 0 05 m and 0 3 m similarly to lowe et al 2021 2 6 cgan training and validation both training processes of g 1 d 1 and g 2 d 2 were performed with 200 epochs and a batch size of 128 the adam optimizer kingma and ba 2014 was used with a learning rate of 0 005 the λ for g 1 d 1 and g 2 d 2 were 5 and 40 respectively so that to the discriminator and mae in eq 2 had approximately the same contribution to the total loss g at approximately epoch 20 when the losses started to get stable for each epoch the parameters of g 1 and g 2 were saved so they could be used during validation for the model validation we evaluated the capacity of g 1 and g 2 to generate full maps of the entire catchment instead of computing the loss at each epoch during the training phase for each individual patches fig 5 step 1 evaluated the g 2 and wse interpolation shown in fig 4 in reproducing the flood depths calculated with hydrodynamic models during this validation the w map to be used as input to g 2 was determined directly from hydrodynamic outputs to compare depths for the same wet cells then d maps were generated with g 2 parameters saved for each of the 200 epochs used for training these maps were evaluated with csi0 3 csi0 05 and rsme metrics to identify at what epoch the parameters of g 2 presented the most accurate flood depths map d since we used flood maps of the entire domain we also validated the interaction between patches instead of isolated g 2 x 2 the interaction between patches is important because it can affect the wse in deep areas which is estimated via linear interpolation in step 2 g 1 was validated here we generated r maps with g 1 saved for all 200 epochs the golden search single variable optimization method was performed for each of the 200 r maps to identify τ and what g 1 model generates the most accurate d the validated g 2 was selected and was used during the golden search for validating g 1 therefore the validation of g 1 can be interpreted as a validation of the entire cgan flood method since w indicates the cells that are flooded for any depth above zero the metric csi was used to validate g 2 which includes shallower depths 3 studied area and flood simulations the training tr validation va and testing te datasets consisted of ten two and five sub catchments in san antonio texas fig 6a these sub catchments are located in the upper san antonio and leon creek watersheds the training sub catchments are mostly clustered at the eastern portion of leon creek testing areas te1 te2 and te3 are closer to the training areas while va1 va2 te4 and te5 are outside the training areas cluster the areas selected for testing and validation include catchments with different sizes average cell slopes and percentage of imperviousness allowing cgan flood to evaluate different spatial configurations the characteristics of all areas are presented in table 1 hec ras 2d models were created for each training and testing area with 3 m grid resolution as recommended by federal emergency management agency 2020 along with dem and imperviousness maps of the same resolutions both provided by the san antonio river authority sara e cavazos personal communication 2018 a required hec ras 2d model parameter is the manning s roughness coefficient for pervious and impervious cells we selected n of 0 03 m 1 3 s 1 for impervious cells a typical value that represents the roughness of concrete brunner 2016 for pervious areas we selected n 0 1 m 1 3 s 1 which is in the recommended range for different pervious covers e g bare field grass row crops sparsely vegetated surfaces and others engman 1986 the input rainfall in all catchments was assumed to be spatially uniform because the catchments are relatively small 3 1 training and validation we used a synthetic linear rainfall hyetograph in the training areas fig 6b the rainfall intensity increases smoothly over time to minimize differences in water levels due to flood wave propagation this rainfall has a 1 minute time step and a total duration of 100 min with intensity varying from 7 to 700 mm h approximately twice the maximum rainfall intensity of the 100 year storm we used this extreme precipitation intensity so that the flooded areas to be predicted are likely to be smaller than what the dl has seen during the training phase flood maps for every training area were acquired every 1 min to compute r with eq 4 and therefore t 100 during validation of g 2 d maps were collected every 5 min this approach allows g 2 to learn water depths from lighter and heavier rainfall intensity t closer to 0 and t we considered additional simulations obtained by terrain augmentation for the training dataset as described in section 2 2 using k t m values of 0 8 0 9 1 1 and 1 2 for validating both generators we simulated maximum depths in the areas va1 and va2 using the 25 and 100 year storms with a duration of 3 h fig 6c the alternating blocks method was used to obtain the rainfall temporal distribution with a 5 minute resolution we evaluated the d maps with the averages between the csi and rsme metrics computed for both design storms and va locations 3 2 testing we tested cgan flood s capacity to reproduce hec ras depth maps in the te catchments which were not included in the training or validation phases similarly to the validation we calculated v t from hec ras flood maps eq 5 to compare maps with the same flood volume therefore we excluded the uncertainties propagated from the hydrological model to analyze the errors that are solely produced by the cgan flood method four rainfall events were used including the two design storms and two observed events fig 6d and e observed event 1 obs1 and observed event 2 obs2 were measured at the san antonio international airport noaa station id ghcnd usw00012921 lat 29 54429 long 98 48395 and in the te2 catchment respectively with time resolutions of 15 and 5 min both observed events have a total of 130 mm in 3 h obs1 has a distinct rainfall peak while the rainfall volume of obs2 is more evenly distributed over time in addition to the different rainfall events we also tested the model s capability to predict flood depths with different scenarios of manning s n these scenarios were simulated on hec ras with manning s n as twice scenario m1 and a half scenario m2 of the values used for training the cgan 0 015 and 0 06 for the pervious and 0 05 and 0 02 m 1 3 s 1 for the impervious grids respectively we used the 25 and 100 year storms to evaluate the influence of surface roughness for different rainfall magnitudes the surface roughness reflects how quickly the runoff flows out of the catchment and consequently the v t to be distributed for instance a higher manning s n results in a higher time of concentration and higher v t for the same rainfall due to a higher flood accumulation in the cells of the domain the goal of this experiment is to evaluate how the changes in v t due to different surface roughness could affect the performance of the cgan flood model 3 3 hydrological modeling and cellular automata benchmark simulations in this study we used swmm models that were previously developed by zarezadeh 2017 for areas te1 and te2 the te1 and te2 models are subdivided into 34 and 163 sub catchments respectively the computation of v t was performed by summing the maximum instantaneous volume of each of the smaller components of the swmm models separately instead of a water balance applied to the whole catchment this way we reduce the error associated with the approximation that we assumed between the instantaneous maximum volume and the volume corresponding to maximum depth details of how v t was calculated with swmm can be seen in supplementary material 2 the longest segment in our swmm models is approximately 770 m corresponding to an open channel conduit link in area te1 in supplementary material 3 we show that the effects of flood wave propagation could be neglected in that segment for these analyses effective precipitation was inserted on hec ras and wca2d to account for infiltration hec ras 6 0 brunner 2016 and newer versions have the option to compute infiltration for 2d simulations however we used effective precipitation as no infiltration was included in the hec ras models used for training including infiltration would increase the cgan flood complexity as different infiltration capacities would have to be tested to account for different soil types for comparison wca2d does not account for infiltration the wca2d only uses one global manning s n for the whole domain which was set as 0 025 and 0 055 m 1 3 s 1 for areas te1 and te2 respectively these values were obtained after calibration that ensured maximum csi0 03 for the 100 year storm when compared to hec ras we selected csi0 3 because 0 3 m was the minimum depth used to evaluate the wca2d model according to guidolin et al 2016 in addition a 0 01s minimum time step was used which showed no signs of instability the two design storms and two observed events used for testing cgan flood were also modeled with wca2d 3 4 hardware specifications we performed all cgan flood and wca2d simulations on an nvidia geforce rtx 2060 super gpu 1650 mhz and 16 gb of ram hec ras model does not support gpu therefore the hydrodynamic simulations were done using an i7 10700 cpu with 2 9 ghz 4 results and discussion 4 1 cgan flood training and validation the evolution of r and d maps created with g 1 and g 2 during the validation is illustrated in fig 7 the results show that the average csi metric for r and d increased rapidly for the first epochs and then stabilized fig 7a and b we selected the parameters saved at epoch 120 for g 1 as csi starts to get unstable beyond this point due to overfitting fig 7c shows the r maps obtained by hec ras simulations and generated by g 2 at epochs 3 120 and 200 in the va2 area in epoch 3 for example g 1 has already started to understand flooding features in va2 and indicates the areas most susceptible to flooding on the other hand r shows signs of overfitting in epoch 200 in comparison to g 1 g 2 converged faster as fig 7b shows the highest csi0 3 was observed at epoch 30 and beyond this point rsme started to increase slowly fig 7d illustrates g 2 accuracy for water depths in comparison to hec ras in epoch 30 for the 100 year storm 4 2 cgan flood testing in this section we present the results of the model performance in the testing areas here cgan flood distributes a v t calculated from the hec ras simulation therefore the errors presented in this section are solely related to the cgan flood methods and do not include uncertainties in flood volume propagated by the hydrological model the model s performance was satisfactory for all storm events and testing areas as shown in table 2 among the four tested rainfall storms the cgan flood obtained better performance for the 100 year storm as shown by all the goodness of fit metrics with the exception of the rsme this behavior occurred because the rsme is more sensitive to larger storms than the other metrics and the 100 year storm resulted in the highest flooding and water depths r2 values were above 0 7 for all testing cases except in te5 for obs2 hr values range from 83 9 to 95 3 with relatively low variance across different events the far ranged from 8 5 to 24 4 with higher values worst performances found for the obs2 event the higher far shows that g 1 tends to overestimate the number of wet cells for events with smaller rainfall intensity csi metric was above 70 for all catchments with lower values for obs2 event due to higher far the csi0 05 and csi0 3 presented low values because errors from g 1 which identified a larger number of wet cells in comparison to the ground truth were propagated to g 2 predictions our results suggest that cgan flood can generalize across different watersheds and rainfall forcings for instance cgan flood was capable of predicting floods for the obs2 and 100 year storms in areas te2 and te3 fig 8 regardless of the significant differences in the catchment area and rainfall magnitude te3 is approximately 7 times larger than te2 in addition cgan flood distributed a v t more than 20 times larger in area te3 for the 100 year storm when compared to te2 for the obs2 event the errors in depth are mainly within 0 1 and 0 1 m in the area te3 cgan flood underestimated water depths in the main channel with errors ranging from 0 3 to 0 1 m since cgan flood matches volume with hec ras in these analyses there was a more significant frequency of errors up to 0 1 m to compensate for the underestimations in the main channels in area te2 cgan flood overestimated depths in parts of the channel but overall there was a balance between the positive and negative errors the results indicate that cgan flood s performance for deeper water depths was lower than for shallow locations as indicated by csi0 3 values one reason is that the deeper flooding gets restricted to smaller portions of the domain we noted that misses or false alarms significantly affected csi especially for the obs2 event that generated smaller flooded areas due to a smaller rainfall peak this pattern in performance is also observed with u flood lowe et al 2021 fig 9 compares the flooded areas with d 0 3 m in te4 and te5 for the 100 year storm and obs2 events in area te4 both hec ras and cgan flood predicted many flooded streets for both events the reason is that this area has a smaller average slope and tends to concentrate runoff more easily on the other hand flooding in te5 is more restricted and cgan flood tends to underestimate flooded areas despite these errors cgan flood was able to capture the flooded cells in this testing area 4 3 sensitivity of cgan flood to different manning coefficients the model s sensitivity was tested for different manning s roughness values table 3 here two scenarios were evaluated m1 lower manning s n and m2 higher manning s n both far and hr decrease for the m1 scenario when compared to manning s n used for training by increasing the surface roughness m2 scenario surface runoff flows more slowly and accumulates within the sub catchments as a result the flooded area increases which reduces the false alarms and increases the misses with the increase in the number of wet cells in hec ras outputs cgan flood had an accuracy improvement because some false alarms became hits on the other hand some of the dry cells become wet which increases the number of misses in the case of the m1 scenario the number of flooded cells decreases with high runoff velocities therefore both far and hr values tends to decrease despite the decrease in hr for higher manning s n the overall performance of cgan flood improved for larger flooded areas the csi csi0 05 and csi0 3 increased for both 25 and 100 year storms in the m1 scenario compared to the original model on the other hand the performance of the cgan flood decreased in most cases for m2 the worst performance was also observed for area te5 the difference in flooded area predictions for lower and higher n values is illustrated in fig 10 the number of false alarms is significantly lower for the m1 scenario fig 10a b compared to m2 10c and d the large number of false alarm rates in m1 originated from w maps as the cgan flood also overestimates flooded areas for smaller depths therefore the distribution of the flooded cells was miscalculated by g 1 and propagated to g 2 predictions however in general the metrics show a satisfactory performance of the cgan flood for different surface roughness scenarios as shown in table 3 4 4 coupling hydrological modeling with cgan flood and comparison to wca2d in this section we calculated v t with a swmm model to study the performance of cgan flood when combined with a hydrological model table 4 reports the total flood volume v t for the maximum depth map computed with hec ras wca2d and swmm in areas te1 and te2 the results show that v t was generally underestimated with swmm except for event obs2 in te1 the most significant error in volume was registered for obs2 in te2 which was 25 9 lower than hec ras one possible explanation is that the depression storage in the terrain is better captured with a fully distributed model which can be underestimated with the swmm model the evaluation metrics for cgan flood and wca2d are shown in table 5 despite underestimating v t the volumes are similar to those computed with hec ras and did not affect the overall performance of cgan flood when calculating v t from hec ras maps see table 2 the exception was te2 for obs2 where the error in v t was significant see table 4 affecting the prediction of the maximum flood the csi0 3 in this case was as low as 41 1 despite swmm predicting a better v t than wca2d the performance of cgan flood was similar to the wca2d model the rsme values for cgan flood in area te1 were close to wca2d and higher in area te2 overall wca2d overestimated depths for very shallow waters between 0 01 and 0 05 m which compromised the overall performance of models as indicated by the csi metric however csi0 05 was in general higher for wca2d than for cgan flood the results show that cgan flood performed better for very shallow depths 0 05 m while wca2d had better predictions for depths between 0 05 and 0 3 m concerning csi0 3 cgan flood over performed wca2d for all rainfall events in area te1 and under performed in area te2 for both models csi0 05 is higher than csi0 3 which is expected as the considered flooded area is smaller for depths 0 05 m than 0 3 m lowe et al 2021 also reported lower csi0 3 values than csi0 05 fig 11 shows the maximum water depths computed for areas te1 and te2 for the 100 year and obs2 rainfall events both models predicted well the depths and flooded area in te1 however wca2d underestimated depths in the main channel the reason is that wca2d uses a single manning s n for the entire domain a limitation of this approach the cgan flood significantly underestimated the flooded area in te2 for the obs2 event in this case v t calculated with swmm was 25 lower than hec ras which resulted in a significantly lower flood area the cgan flood coupled with the swmm was significantly faster than hec ras and wca2d table 6 while wca2d was on average 5 times faster than hec ras cgan flood and swmm combined were on average 250 times faster than hec ras the difference in simulation time is more significant for larger areas for example in area te3 largest training area hec ras simulations took an average of 2 h and 45 min between all four events while cgan flood excluding swmm required an average of 30 s to complete all the simulations 330 times faster the computational time of the cgan flood method is more variable than hec ras or wca2d because it depends on the number of iterations of the golden search optimization method that estimates the parameter τ for instance cgan flood found d after eight iterations for the 25 year storm and required only two iterations for the 100 year storm in area te1 it is worth noting that v t can be calculated with other hydrological models other than swmm e g hec hms or gssha which can affect the simulation speed and accuracy in computing v t 5 advantages and limitations here we discuss the major advantages and some limitations of cgan flood the major advantage of cgan flood is speed the results show significantly faster simulations than hydrodynamic simulations while maintaining the overall good predictive performance of flood locations and water depths second cgan flood was able to generalize predictions in unseen catchments the generalization can promote the application of dl in flood studies as the necessity of retraining is reduced the proposed cgan flood model achieves results comparable with other rfms but can significantly improve the computational time of large scale flood simulations another advantage of cgan flood compared to other deep learning methods found in the literature is the use of mass conservation which gives the model a physical backbone although it requires the use of a hydrological model to estimate the total runoff volumes regarding limitations or deficiencies the results indicate that cgan flood tended to underestimate flood depths in channels for small rainfall events one limitation of our study is that infiltration and hydraulic structures e g sewers bridges and culverts were excluded from the hec ras simulations used to generate the training dataset although the infiltration losses and drainage system can be simulated with swmm and be reflected on v t the overland distribution of flooded volume might be affected because the location of flow and volumes e g combined sewer overflow is lost the lack of infiltration losses and no options for the sewer system are also missing from other models such as wca2d the catchments tested in this study rely mainly on open channels and overland flow the model likely fails in urban catchments where underground sewer systems are significant one solution might be applying cgan flood in subdivided catchments in multiple simulations in this case v t values could be calculated for each sub catchment and be used with cgan flood to spread the flood volume helping to identify vulnerable locations to flooding more investigation is needed on how to incorporate drainage infrastructure in the model e g sewers culverts bridges furthermore subdividing the domain into smaller sub catchments can also be necessary to reduce the error when calculating maximum depths in a large domain the v t can be underestimated if the instantaneous maximum runoff volume is calculated for large areas as the effect of flood wave propagation can be significant finally our model assumes a linear wse for deeper waters which can be less accurate than the outputs of 2d modeling with wca2d and hec ras brunner 2016 also highlights that linear assumptions of hec ras 1d are a disadvantage compared to the hec ras 2d one potential application of cgan flood would be to improve the resolution of fully distributed hydrological and hydraulic models the idea is to run fully distributed hydrological models e g ghssa in a coarse spatial resolution and use cgan flood to obtain high resolution floodplains one limiting aspect of cgan flood is cell resolution currently the cgan flood model only works for a spatial resolution of 3 m although this is within the fema recommended scale for hydraulic studies of floodplains cgan flood cannot be used to generate flood maps on finer cells or in areas where high resolution data do not exist predictions with different spatial resolutions would require building new hydrodynamic models to generate new data and re train cgan flood 6 conclusions and future model improvements this paper developed the model cgan flood a rapid flood model based on conditional generative adversarial networks to estimate high resolution maximum flood areas this approach generates maximum flood depths by distributing a flood volume cgan flood uses two generators to first identify flooded cells and then to estimate water depths this method was evaluated for catchments unseen to the generators during training or validation phases results showed that cgan flood could generate accurate results for a variety of catchments rainfall magnitudes and surface roughness indicating that the generators could satisfactorily generalize their predictions future model improvements could include infiltration different manning s n and sewer systems adding these aspects could enable dl models to calculate flood depths directly from rainfall inputs potentially eliminating the need to use a hydrological model before computing the flood volume to be distributed these advancements however would require many additional simulations on catchments with different sewer system configurations various infiltration capacities and land cover types we also suggest the development of new dl methods that can accurately generalize predictions of deeper water which can replace the wse interpolation approach adopted for cgan flood and
