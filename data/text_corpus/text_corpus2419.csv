12095,coastal areas are densely populated due to associated socioeconomic benefits and therefore have higher demand for freshwater this ever increasing demand for freshwater can be met by coastal aquifers which act as giant reservoirs of freshwater excessive and unmanaged pumping from coastal aquifer allows saltwater to flow inward encroaching the voids created by pumping of freshwater this phenomenon is called saltwater intrusion to stop saltwater intrusion an optimal pumping strategy needs to be adopted simulation models are generally linked with an optimization algorithm to develop optimal pumping strategy for management of saltwater intrusion sharp interface based simulation models are often used which are computationally inexpensive but lacks in prediction accuracy as it does not incorporate the effects of dispersion and diffusion density dependent simulation models include the effect of dispersion and diffusion but have very high computational budget in evaluating an optimal pumping strategy to overcome above mentioned limitations a new methodology is developed where a density dependent model is used in conjunction with a sharp interface model to derive an optimal density ratio such that interface obtained using this density ratio implicitly accommodates the effect of dispersion and diffusion in a sharp interface model the performance of the developed methodology is evaluated for three hypothetical scenarios of saltwater intrusion and in densely populated coastal city of puri in india the performance evaluation results show the applicability of the developed methodology for management of saltwater intrusion while maximizing freshwater pumping from coastal aquifers graphical abstract image 1 keywords saltwater intrusion pumping management simulation optimization groundwater management computational budget puri city 1 introduction ever increasing demand for freshwater has resulted in the excessive pumping of groundwater aquifers aquifers that are hydraulically connected to the sea referred to as coastal aquifers when subjected to excessive and unmanaged pumping result in saltwater intrusion excessive unmanaged pumping causes a reversal of groundwater head gradient allowing saline water from sea to flow towards land and fill the voids created by pumping of freshwater this phenomenon is called saltwater intrusion dunlop et al 2019 sato and iwasa 2011 therefore the main challenge in the management of coastal aquifers is to maximize pumping of freshwater without causing saltwater intrusion and referred to as pumping optimization problem several pumping based management alternatives needs to evaluated in order to design the right management strategy to meet this challenge the method essentially relies on simulating the effect of a candidate pumping value on the saltwater intrusion in a coastal aquifer sequentially evaluating all possible pumping alternatives to find an optimal pumping strategy is not possible or practical as infinite combinations of pumping strategies can exist datta et al 2013 dhar and datta 2009a sreekanth and datta 2015 therefore simulation models are linked with optimization algorithms to evaluate various pumping based management alternatives to find the optimal pumping strategy that maximizes production of freshwater without causing saltwater intrusion among various simulation models available density dependent numerical simulation models incorporate effects of dispersion and diffusion which makes the model more realistic abarca et al 2007 dausman et al 2010 dokou and karatzas 2012 to incorporate effects of dispersion and diffusion flow and transport equations are solved sequentially which increases the computational budget dey and prakash 2019b werner et al 2013 as pumping optimization problems in coastal aquifers are non convex in nature heuristic optimization techniques are found to be suitable singh 2014 sreekanth and datta 2010 for finding optimal pumping heuristic optimization has been successfully applied to solving various groundwater management problems prakash and datta 2013 2014 2015 however use of heuristic optimization algorithm with density dependent simulation model increases the computational budget significantly dhar and datta 2009b surrogate models have been used with heuristic optimization algorithms to reduce computational effort generally faced by numerical simulation models like density dependent model surrogate models are pattern recognition algorithms like artificial neural network ann which maps the relationship between production well pumping and location of the saltwater freshwater front datta et al 2014 sreekanth and datta 2011a ann was earlier applied as surrogate model banerjee et al 2011 bhattacharjya and datta 2009 kourakos and mantoglou 2009 rao et al 2003 2004 but in recent times modular neural network ataie ashtiani et al 2013 kourakos and mantoglou 2009 genetic algorithm sreekanth and datta 2011a 2011b 2014 fuzzy inference system roy and datta 2017a and multivariate adaptive regression spline roy and datta 2017b are also used as surrogates surrogate models need large comprehensive data sets to train the model besides changes in hydrogeological conditions also affect the performance of surrogate models werner et al 2013 thus limiting their practical applicability another simulation model is the sharp interface model which is a trade off between accuracy of prediction and computational efficiency in the case of sharp interface model saltwater and freshwater are considered as two immiscible fluids therefore a sharp interface is present between saltwater and freshwater in reality there is a mixing zone present between freshwater and saltwater due to dispersion and diffusion in the sharp interface effects of dispersion and diffusion are not considered which leads to inaccuracy in prediction christelis and mantoglou 2013 dausman et al 2010 llopis albert and pulido velazquez 2014 pool and carrera 2011 sharp interface model based on strack 1976 potential is widely used in pumping optimization study ataie ashtiani et al 2013 eissa et al 2018 kourakos and mantoglou 2015 it is evident from the above discussion that realistic representation of coastal aquifers is performed by density dependent model but requires large computational budget sharp interface model requires less computational budget but lack in prediction accuracy therefore it is necessary to develop a methodology that reduces computational effort and still predicts the saltwater freshwater front accurately pool and carrera 2011 and christelis and mantoglou 2016 showed that the outcome of the sharp interface model could be more realistic if the effects of dispersion and diffusion can be incorporated in the model based on the above hypothesis a new methodology is presented in this paper where optimal pumping values derived using a sharp interface model is further adjusted with the help of density dependent model to achieve greater accuracy in prediction of saltwater freshwater front in pumping optimization problem first a sharp interface model is called within an optimization algorithm and optimal pumping value is estimated this optimal pumping value is used in a density dependent numerical simulation model within an optimization algorithm to update the density ratio the adjusted density ratio is again passed on to the sharp interface model to improve the optimal pumping value with the new density ratio this iterative procedure is repeated until there is no improvement in the density ratio value obtained from the density dependent model particle swarm optimization pso algorithm is used for solving the pumping maximization 2 methodology 2 1 formulation of pumping optimization problem the main objective is to maximize pumping from the coastal aquifer without causing saltwater intrusion at the pumping wells all the pumping wells in the study area are considered together to maximize the pumping yield from the aquifer given by equation 1 all the pumping wells in the study area are considered together to maximize the pumping yield from the aquifer given by equation 1 to achieve this objective optimization algorithm is linked with a simulation model to analyze the impact of each candidate pumping scenario 1 maximize q t m 1 m q m 2 subjected to x mk x τk 3 q m max q m q m min where q m is pumping from mth pumping well m is total number of pumping wells x mk is distance of mth well from shoreline x τk is saltwater freshwater interface toe location from shoreline corresponding to mth well is minimum allowable pumping from mth well q m max is maximum allowable pumping from mth well freshwater pumping from production wells are maximized subject to constraint set given by equations 2 and 3 equation 2 essentially constrains the location of saltwater freshwater front in such a way that it never reaches the pumping well location this ensures that saltwater never reaches the production well thus preventing saltwater intrusion 2 2 simulation models for saltwater intrusion the main objective is to maximize freshwater pumping in a coastal aquifer such that it meets the freshwater demand without causing saltwater intrusion this objective is achieved by linking simulation models within a pso optimization framework to evaluate various pumping based management alternatives in this section used simulation models are discussed 2 2 1 sharp interface model the developed sharp interface model is based on the principles of ghyben herzberg relationship and dupuit s approximation todd 1959 saltwater and freshwater are considered as two immiscible fluids assuming a sharp interface separates the two fluids though the zones are segregated by densities sharp interface does not consider the mixing of the fluids therefore only advection is considered in this simulation model a typical cross section of sharp interface model for an unconfined coastal aquifer is shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 there are two distinct zones present in the aquifer zone 1 where only freshwater is present and zone 2 where both freshwater and saltwater are present but separated by a sharp interface the head of the water from datum is h depth of freshwater below the water table is b and d is the height of mean sea level msl from the datum in addition let ρ f be the density of the fresh water and ρ s be the density of saltwater density ratio be ε defined as 4 ε ρ s ρ f ρ f from ghyben herzberg observation the relation between the height of freshwater above msl h f and depth of freshwater below msl h s for zone 2 is given by equations 5 and 6 respectively 5 h f ε h s 6 h d ε h s strack 1976 and mantoglou et al 2004 developed a differential equation based on a single potential ϕ which applies to both the zones in an unconfined aquifer given by equation 7 7 x k ϕ x y k ϕ y q t 0 where k is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and q t is total pumping form the aquifer the potential for zone 1 ϕ 1 and zone 2 ϕ 2 is given by equations 8 and 9 respectively 8 ϕ 1 h 2 1 ε d 2 9 ϕ 2 1 ε ε h d 2 the potential at toe location of interface ϕ τ is defined by equation 10 cheng et al 2000 mantoglou et al 2004 10 ϕ τ ε ε 1 2 d 2 modflow 2000 harbaugh et al 2000 is used to solve equation 7 and a lagrangian interpolation equation 11 method is used to calculate toe location of interface ϕ τ equation 10 11 x τk j 1 n ϕ τ ϕ j k i 1 n x ik ϕ τ ϕ ik j 1 j i n ϕ ik ϕ jk here at kth row and ith column the potential is ϕ ik and the distance of interface from the sea is x ik n is the total number of columns for jth column potential is ϕ jk the flow potential at toe of interface is ϕ τ and the corresponding location is x τk 2 2 2 density dependent model in an undisturbed coastal aquifer a mixing zone is present between freshwater and saltwater in this zone density of water gradually decreases from density of saltwater to density of freshwater this zone is created due to hydrodynamic dispersion this coupled flow advection hydrodynamic dispersion is expressed mathematically in form of a partial differential equation given in equation 12 guo and langevin 2002 12 ρ q ρ q s ρ s p p t θ ρ c c t where ρ is fluid density q is specific discharge vector ρ is fluid density entering or leaving the medium q s is volumetric flow rate at source or sink θ is porosity t is time p is fluid pore pressure c is concentration of solute equation 9 is a combination of flow and transport equation linked by density term there are various finite difference and finite element based methods to solve this equation in this study finite difference based model seawat guo and langevin 2002 is used to solve equation 12 seawat uses flow model modflow harbaugh et al 2000 and transport model mt3d zheng and wang 1999 together to solve the above equation to find the salt concentration on different locations which is used to calculate an isosalinity contour which is compared with the sharp interface the isosalinity contour is calculated from the lagrangian interpolation equation 13 13 x c k j 1 n c τ c j k i 0 n x i k c τ c i k j 1 i j n c i k c j k here at kth row and ith column the concentration is c i k and the distance from the sea is x i k n is the total number of columns for jth column concentration is c j k the concentration at which isosalinity contour is calculated is c τ and the corresponding location is x c k 2 3 linking of sharp interface model with density dependent model as discussed earlier simulation based pumping optimization techniques has some distinct advantage over surrogate based pumping optimization in terms of data requirement at the same time drawbacks of simulation optimization framework in saltwater intrusion problem are accuracy of prediction and computational time above mentioned drawbacks are addressed by developing a new methodology which reduces computational time without compromising on the accuracy of prediction for saltwater freshwater front in a limited data availability scenario the goal is met by modifying the density ratio in the sharp interface model such that freshwater saltwater interface predicted by this modified density ratio represents the actual freshwater saltwater interface as would have been predicted by a density dependent model which incorporates the effect of dispersion and diffusion it is well documented that sharp interface model over estimates the toe location of the interface because it does not consider dispersion and diffusion to overcome this problem an iterative process is designed where first pumping is optimized using only sharp interface simulation model for a given density ratio ε 0 035 ε 0 this optimized pumping value is then used in a density dependent model to find the corresponding isosalinity contour toe location density dependent model has been used to calculate isosalinity contour corresponding to a concentration of 5 kg m3 the residual error between the toe location obtained using sharp interface simulation model for optimal pumping and the corresponding isosalinity contour toe location obtained using density dependent model for the same pumping is minimized the density is varied based on the idea that at optimal density ratio toe location obtained from sharp interface and toe location obtained from isosalinity contour using density dependent simulation model should match fig 2 for a given pumping scenario the optimization model chooses any candidate density value between 35 kg m3 and 0 kg m3 and calculates the toe location for the corresponding value of density the optimization model in subsequent iterations suitably modifies the density value based on optimization parameters until a density value is found that gives the minimum residual error between the estimated toe location and the actual toe location since the density ratio is dependent on the value of density the density ratio also gets modified this formulation to optimize density ratio is given by equation 14 subject to constraint in equation 15 14 minimize τ m m 1 m x τmk x cmk 15 subjected to 0 035 ε 0 where x τmk is distance of toe location obtained using sharp interface simulation model from sea boundary at mth well location x cmk is distance of toe location of isosalinity contour obtained using density dependent simulation model from sea boundary at mth well location the advantage of this methodology is that it eliminates the need to run the density dependent model in every iteration of pumping optimization and therefore reduces computational budget this method is similar to as discussed by christelis and mantoglou 2016 according to christelis and mantoglou 2019 this method can quickly attain solution in a simulation optimization based framework optimization model finds the possible solution as is with any heuristic optimization there is a possibility that the solution may converge to local optima to overcome this difficulty stopping criterion is introduced in the developed methodology the stopping of the algorithm is performed when last five iterations shows a good match between them the iterative process has two parts as shown in fig 3 first part is optimization of pumping with help of sharp interface model linked with pso sharp interface is function of water table head and density ratio therefore pumping optimization is initialized with an estimated density ratio ε between 0 035 as the upper limit and 0 as the lower limit as proposed by pool and carrera 2011 and christelis and mantoglou 2016 in the second step density ratio is optimized the optimized pumping value from pumping optimization by sharp interface model is used to run the density dependent model seawat then the outcome of seawat is used to locate toe of isosalinity contour with help of lagrangian interpolation equation 13 the optimization algorithm in second case minimizes the difference between toe location of isosalinity contour and toe location obtained from sharp interface fig 3 density ratio corresponding to optimal value of this minimization problem is used to update the density ratio in the sharp interface model in the next iteration this process is continued until there is no significant change in density ratio value for five consecutive iterations 2 4 particle swarm optimization in this study heuristic optimization pso is chosen for solving the optimization problem working principle of pso is derived from movement of a flock of birds or a school of fish with the help of collective intelligence exhibited by a flock of birds or a school of fish the group is able to locate food which otherwise would have been impossible if attempted by an individual thus the strength in search for food essentially comes from sharing information gathered by each individual within the group this concept is used in pso to find an optimal pumping pso was introduced by eberhart and kennedy 1995 in this study a modified version of pso fig 4 as proposed by shi and eberhart 1998 is used as an optimizer in the used pso algorithm first m number of particles are arbitrarily selected in defined search space in second step particles are evaluated for the objective function in the final step particles modify their location based on best objective function value governed by velocity v a of the particle equation 16 poli et al 2007 the velocity of each particle equation 17 governs by constant inertia weight w cognitive constant c 1 social

the velocity based on difference of x a from x gp and x bp r is used to introduce the randomness in the direction of the movement 3 application of the developed methodology the performance of the developed methodology is tested against 4 scenarios of saltwater intrusion first three are hypothetical study areas with different pumping scenarios fourth scenario is a real life case study of a coastal aquifer in puri city of india discussed in the section below 3 1 hypothetical study area to test the developed methodology three different scenarios of pumping from a coastal aquifer are considered the study area fig 5 comprises of a homogeneous isotropic three dimensional unconfined coastal aquifer having an area of 25 2 105 m2 1800 m 1400 m thickness of the aquifer is 100 m with a uniform impervious layer beneath the study area is discretized into finite difference grids 10 m 10 m 10 m in size the right hand side boundary of the study area is the sea and the left hand side boundary is considered as fixed head boundary the remaining two sides of the study area are considered as no flow boundaries at the start of simulation the head is considered linearly varying from land surface at 9 m to seaside at 0 m initial salt concentration in the aquifer is assumed to be zero dirichlet boundary condition is assigned at land side and sea side with concentration 0 kg m3 and 35 kg m3 respectively the aquifer is studied for a period of 10 years other parameters of the study area used in the model are summarized in table 1 it is assumed that the aquifer is pumped uniformly throughout its depth at the well locations in scenario one and two coastal aquifer is pumped using six pumping wells each locations of the six pumping wells for scenario one and two are different in third scenario nine pumping wells are used the wells are steadily pumped throughout the study period 10 years the upper and lower limit of pumping is considered as 35 000 m3 day and 300 m3 day respectively for all pumping wells in all the three scenarios in fourth scenario the method is applied to real life case of salt water intrusion in puri city of india 3 2 groundwater flow and transport simulation model for puri city puri is a coastal city which is situated on east coast of india it lies between 19 47 to 19 50 north latitudes and 85 48 to 85 52 east longitudes the slope of the area is 18 m from msl from north west to 0 m from msl south east according to 2011 census report total population of puri city is about 200 thousand jena 2014 puri city is supplied with 20 5 103 m3 day freshwater form 36 pumping wells the city has two pumping fields i e chakratirtha and balia panda in chakratirtha water field 19 pumping wells are present and 13 pumping wells are at balia panda water field four other wells are spread across the city freshwater is also extracted from hundreds of hand pumps and dug wells vijay and mohapatra 2016 though in very small amount the study period for the developed model is considered during post monsoon 2006 to pre monsoon 2017 i e between september 2006 to may 2017 groundwater head data between september 2006 to may 2007 is used to calibrate the model the daily average recharge is calculated from rainfall data according to imd in the year 2006 and 2007 puri city received 2112 and 1290 mm of precipitation respectively vijay et al 2011 according to vijay and mohapatra 2016 recharge from the precipitation in this area was about 33 of average precipitation of the year 2006 and 2007 i e 561 mm therefore 1 54 mm day is taken as the average recharge for the puri city during calibration period the entire period between june 2007 to may 2017 is used to calculate the maximum allowable daily pumping from the coastal aquifer of puri city aquifer of puri city is divided in 100 m 100 m finite difference grid with three layers fig 7 a fixed head value of 0 m and constant salt concentration of 35 kg m3 is taken along the coast for the land side the constant salt concentration of 0 kg m3 is taken the head at the boundary is determined based on the contour from average head during post monsoon of 2006 and pre monsoon of 2007 provided by vijay et al 2011 though there are 19 production wells in chakratirtha water field and 13 production wells in balia panda water field fig 6 only four production wells in chakratirtha water field and a single pumping well in balia panda water field is considered in the finite difference model as some of the wells are so close to each other that they fall in one grid location or adjacent grids and therefore can effectively be represented by one well when the distance between the two well is less than four gird locations it is considered as single well and the entire group is substituted by an equivalent well this also eliminated the influence of draw down of one well on the neighboring wells this grouping of wells reduces the well count down to four in chakratirtha and one in balia panda water fields table 3 also wells within 4 grids of the boundary of the study area are not considered in the simulation because influence of those wells are limited near the boundary the city is underlain by sand beneath a thin layer of clay of varying thicknesses dey and prakash 2019a vijay et al 2011 therefore the aquifer is considered as unconfined homogeneous and isotropic the other hydrogeological parameters are discussed in table 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 performance evaluation for hypothetical study area the iterative process of pumping optimization followed by density ratio optimization is run 31 times for scenario 1 and 15 times on scenario 2 and 3 respectively to test the stopping criterion and find optimal pumping corresponding density ratio is also calculated that would reflect the effect of dispersion and diffusion in a sharp interface simulation model thereby giving a more realistic estimate of pumping without causing saltwater intrusion the performance evaluation results of optimal pumping value and corresponding density ratio is presented in fig 8 it was observed that total optimal pumping achieved is 35 375 103 m3 day after 7 iterations for scenario 1 35 648 103 m3 day after 9 iterations for scenario 2 and 30 036 103 m3 day after 8 iterations for scenario 3 in addition corresponding optimal density ratio is found to be 0 0108 after 7 iterations in scenario 1 0 0124 after 9 iterations for scenario 2 and 0 0120 after 8 iterations for scenario 3 no significant improvement in pumping or change in density ratio is observed after 7th iteration in scenario 1 9th iteration in scenario 2 and 8th iteration in scenario 3 till end of the iteration table 4 shows the final pumping value for each of the production wells in the scenarios though scenario 2 has same number of wells as in scenario 1 the pumping from scenario 2 is slightly higher than scenario 1 because three pumping wells are located more inland compared to two wells in scenario 1 fig 4 in scenario 1 well 5 and well 6 are pumped at the maximum limit 15 000 103 m3 day in scenario 3 though the total number of production wells increases but total pumping decreases this is because most of the wells are near the seashore therefore decrease in the total pumping is observed compared to scenario 1 and scenario 2 in scenario 3 well 2 and well 4 are farthest from the sea and those pumped at the 15 000 103 m3 day and 12 939 103 m3 day respectively well 7 in scenario 3 is pumped at 0 300 103 m3 day due its proximity of well 3 and well 1 it is also observed that the obtained density ratio is different for the three scenarios at maximum pumping therefore it is apprehended that location and proximity of the wells have significant impact on the pumping and density ratio the toe locations calculated by sharp interface and isosalinity contour are presented in fig 9 it was found that for test scenario 1 fig 9 a sharp interface crosses well locations 2 3 and 4 by less than 5 m since the grid size taken in this study is 10 m these violations could be the result of interpolation and can be easily neglected fig 9 shows a significant gap between the isosalinity contour and location of the interface in all three scenarios this is due to difference in the head values estimated using seawat and modflow the calculated head by density dependent model seawat is not the same as calculated by modflow because density dependent model calculates equivalent freshwater head guo and langevin 2002 instead of total head as in case of modflow in addition to optimal pumping total cpu run time of sharp interface model density dependent model and the iterative process is recorded table 5 it was found that average cpu run time for sharp interface model was 8 698 s on an i7 3 6 ghz cpu the maximum recorded cpu run time for sharp interface model was 30 696 s and minimum recorded cpu run time recorded was 3 569 s density dependent model i e seawat is also run for the same data set to compare the run time of two models the average cpu run time for seawat was recorded as 150 min it is found that minimum cpu run time for seawat is 95 min and maximum run time is 310 min in addition it was also noted that average cpu run time for single iteration of developed method i e from pumping optimization by sharp interface model till checking the termination criteria fig 3 was about 420 min the maximum recorded time for the developed model was 896 58 min and the minimum run time was 350 17 min the advantage of the developed methodology can be understood by comparing time taken by traditional simulation optimization using density dependent model with time taken by the developed method it is clear from the results for scenario 1 2 3 that an average of 8 iterations are required for the sharp interface model to produce an optimal pumping therefore total time required to produce an optimal solution by this iterative methodology of pumping optimization followed by density ratio optimization is 8 420 min 3360 min 2 days 8 h it takes 70 runs on an average of the sharp interface simulation model with 30 particles pso parameter within one iteration of the developed methodology had the same problem been solved using density dependent model in a traditional simulation optimization scheme it would have taken 150 min 70 30 315 000 min 218 days 18 h it is to be noted that the density optimization step would not be required as the density dependent model takes density variation due to dispersion and diffusion into account therefore only one iteration would be required while using density dependent model in a traditional simulation optimization scheme from this calculation it is clear that it is possible to reduce the computational time by 315 000 3360 min 311 640 min or 216 days 10 h or 98 93 while using the developed methodology 4 2 application of the developed methodology in puri city the developed iterative methodology is applied to puri city to find the maximum rate at which freshwater can be extracted without causing saltwater intrusion and to verify if the current rates of extraction were within safe limits it is observed that total maximum pumping achieved without causing saltwater intrusion is 50 580 103 m3 day the corresponding optimal density ratio was 0 0173 the pumping and corresponding density ratio for every iteration is shown in fig 10 it is seen in fig 10 that after 4th iteration no significant improvement is observed in the total pumping or change in the density ratio though there are no significant change in density ratio or total maximum pumping the model is converged at 21 iterations to ensure the optimality of the results location of the sharp interface and location of the isosalinity contour is shown in fig 11 it can be seen that sharp interface and isosalinity contour closely match maximum pumping achieved for different wells is given in table 6 it is clear that the interface obtained from both sharp interface and isosalinity contour moves inwards toward the pumping wells near the two pumping fields it passes very close to pumping well pc 9 but does not cross the well location at no point the interface crosses well locations ensuring that there is no saltwater intrusion at the pumping well locations the total combined pumping at balia panda water fields represented by pc 1 new is about 7 4 103 m3 day the maximum allowable pumping as per the developed methodology is 12 1 103 m3 day the total combined pumping at chakratirtha water fields is 10 81 103 m3 day the maximum allowable pumping as per the developed methodology is 28 2 103 m3 day thus we can say that the current rates of pumping at both the water fields are within the maximum allowable limits and hence safe from saltwater intrusion however any change in the pumping should ensure that pc 9 is not effected by saltwater intrusion as this happens to be very close to the interface line 5 conclusions and recommendations in this study a heuristic optimization coupled with sharp interface and density dependent simulation model for maximizing freshwater pumping without causing saltwater intrusion is developed the methodology performs satisfactorily in finding maximum pumping without causing saltwater intrusion in a limited data availability scenario without excessive computational burden the developed methodology is successful in estimating the maximum allowable pumping in hypothetical study scenarios as well as for real life scenario of puri city number of production wells and their location in the study area is an important factor in deciding the maximum allowable pumping same number of pumping wells but with varying placement can alter the maximum allowable pumping the developed methodology overcomes one of the biggest limitations while using sharp interface models i e the accuracy of prediction the coupled used of sharp interface and density dependent model accounts for greater accuracy compared to using sharp interface model alone the developed methodology is able to reduce the computational time by 98 93 compared to conventional simulation optimization method based on density dependent simulation model therefore the developed methodology is a viable option to predict saltwater intrusion for real life scenarios application of the developed methodology to puri city shows that the puri coastal aquifer is currently under pumped and has potential to be pumped at twice the current rate without causing saltwater intrusion this is also supported by vijay and mohapatra 2016 while using the developed methodology the number of iterations required before reaching an optimal result is subjective and may vary from one scenario to another therefore large number of iterations are sometimes required to ascertain the optimality of the results the impact of number of production wells and their locations need to be further investigated in finding maximum allowable pumping declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

simulation models available density dependent numerical simulation models incorporate effects of dispersion and diffusion which makes the model more realistic abarca et al 2007 dausman et al 2010 dokou and karatzas 2012 to incorporate effects of dispersion and diffusion flow and transport equations are solved sequentially which increases the computational budget dey and prakash 2019b werner et al 2013 as pumping optimization problems in coastal aquifers are non convex in nature heuristic optimization techniques are found to be suitable singh 2014 sreekanth and datta 2010 for finding optimal pumping heuristic optimization has been successfully applied to solving various groundwater management problems prakash and datta 2013 2014 2015 however use of heuristic optimization algorithm with density dependent simulation model increases the computational budget significantly dhar and datta 2009b surrogate models have been used with heuristic optimization algorithms to reduce computational effort generally faced by numerical simulation models like density dependent model surrogate models are pattern recognition algorithms like artificial neural network ann which maps the relationship between production well pumping and location of the saltwater freshwater front datta et al 2014 sreekanth and datta 2011a ann was earlier applied as surrogate model banerjee et al 2011 bhattacharjya and datta 2009 kourakos and mantoglou 2009 rao et al 2003 2004 but in recent times modular neural network ataie ashtiani et al 2013 kourakos and mantoglou 2009 genetic algorithm sreekanth and datta 2011a 2011b 2014 fuzzy inference system roy and datta 2017a and multivariate adaptive regression spline roy and datta 2017b are also used as surrogates surrogate models need large comprehensive data sets to train the model besides changes in hydrogeological conditions also affect the performance of surrogate models werner et al 2013 thus limiting their practical applicability another simulation model is the sharp interface model which is a trade off between accuracy of prediction and computational efficiency in the case of sharp interface model saltwater and freshwater are considered as two immiscible fluids therefore a sharp interface is present between saltwater and freshwater in reality there is a mixing zone present between freshwater and saltwater due to dispersion and diffusion in the sharp interface effects of dispersion and diffusion are not considered which leads to inaccuracy in prediction christelis and mantoglou 2013 dausman et al 2010 llopis albert and pulido velazquez 2014 pool and carrera 2011 sharp interface model based on strack 1976 potential is widely used in pumping optimization study ataie ashtiani et al 2013 eissa et al 2018 kourakos and mantoglou 2015 it is evident from the above discussion that realistic representation of coastal aquifers is performed by density dependent model but requires large computational budget sharp interface model requires less computational budget but lack in prediction accuracy therefore it is necessary to develop a methodology that reduces computational effort and still predicts the saltwater freshwater front accurately pool and carrera 2011 and christelis and mantoglou 2016 showed that the outcome of the sharp interface model could be more realistic if the effects of dispersion and diffusion can be incorporated in the model based on the above hypothesis a new methodology is presented in this paper where optimal pumping values derived using a sharp interface model is further adjusted with the help of density dependent model to achieve greater accuracy in prediction of saltwater freshwater front in pumping optimization problem first a sharp interface model is called within an optimization algorithm and optimal pumping value is estimated this optimal pumping value is used in a density dependent numerical simulation model within an optimization algorithm to update the density ratio the adjusted density ratio is again passed on to the sharp interface model to improve the optimal pumping value with the new density ratio this iterative procedure is repeated until there is no improvement in the density ratio value obtained from the density dependent model particle swarm optimization pso algorithm is used for solving the pumping maximization 2 methodology 2 1 formulation of pumping optimization problem the main objective is to maximize pumping from the coastal aquifer without causing saltwater intrusion at the pumping wells all the pumping wells in the study area are considered together to maximize the pumping yield from the aquifer given by equation 1 all the pumping wells in the study area are considered together to maximize the pumping yield from the aquifer given by equation 1 to achieve this objective optimization algorithm is linked with a simulation model to analyze the impact of each candidate pumping scenario 1 maximize q t m 1 m q m 2 subjected to x mk x τk 3 q m max q m q m min where q m is pumping from mth pumping well m is total number of pumping wells x mk is distance of mth well from shoreline x τk is saltwater freshwater interface toe location from shoreline corresponding to mth well is minimum allowable pumping from mth well q m max is maximum allowable pumping from mth well freshwater pumping from production wells are maximized subject to constraint set given by equations 2 and 3 equation 2 essentially constrains the location of saltwater freshwater front in such a way that it never reaches the pumping well location this ensures that saltwater never reaches the production well thus preventing saltwater intrusion 2 2 simulation models for saltwater intrusion the main objective is to maximize freshwater pumping in a coastal aquifer such that it meets the freshwater demand without causing saltwater intrusion this objective is achieved by linking simulation models within a pso optimization framework to evaluate various pumping based management alternatives in this section used simulation models are discussed 2 2 1 sharp interface model the developed sharp interface model is based on the principles of ghyben herzberg relationship and dupuit s approximation todd 1959 saltwater and freshwater are considered as two immiscible fluids assuming a sharp interface separates the two fluids though the zones are segregated by densities sharp interface does not consider the mixing of the fluids therefore only advection is considered in this simulation model a typical cross section of sharp interface model for an unconfined coastal aquifer is shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 there are two distinct zones present in the aquifer zone 1 where only freshwater is present and zone 2 where both freshwater and saltwater are present but separated by a sharp interface the head of the water from datum is h depth of freshwater below the water table is b and d is the height of mean sea level msl from the datum in addition let ρ f be the density of the fresh water and ρ s be the density of saltwater density ratio be ε defined as 4 ε ρ s ρ f ρ f from ghyben herzberg observation the relation between the height of freshwater above msl h f and depth of freshwater below msl h s for zone 2 is given by equations 5 and 6 respectively 5 h f ε h s 6 h d ε h s strack 1976 and mantoglou et al 2004 developed a differential equation based on a single potential ϕ which applies to both the zones in an unconfined aquifer given by equation 7 7 x k ϕ x y k ϕ y q t 0 where k is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and q t is total pumping form the aquifer the potential for zone 1 ϕ 1 and zone 2 ϕ 2 is given by equations 8 and 9 respectively 8 ϕ 1 h 2 1 ε d 2 9 ϕ 2 1 ε ε h d 2 the potential at toe location of interface ϕ τ is defined by equation 10 cheng et al 2000 mantoglou et al 2004 10 ϕ τ ε ε 1 2 d 2 modflow 2000 harbaugh et al 2000 is used to solve equation 7 and a lagrangian interpolation equation 11 method is used to calculate toe location of interface ϕ τ equation 10 11 x τk j 1 n ϕ τ ϕ j k i 1 n x ik ϕ τ ϕ ik j 1 j i n ϕ ik ϕ jk here at kth row and ith column the potential is ϕ ik and the distance of interface from the sea is x ik n is the total number of columns for jth column potential is ϕ jk the flow potential at toe of interface is ϕ τ and the corresponding location is x τk 2 2 2 density dependent model in an undisturbed coastal aquifer a mixing zone is present between freshwater and saltwater in this zone density of water gradually decreases from density of saltwater to density of freshwater this zone is created due to hydrodynamic dispersion this coupled flow advection hydrodynamic dispersion is expressed mathematically in form of a partial differential equation given in equation 12 guo and langevin 2002 12 ρ q ρ q s ρ s p p t θ ρ c c t where ρ is fluid density q is specific discharge vector ρ is fluid density entering or leaving the medium q s is volumetric flow rate at source or sink θ is porosity t is time p is fluid pore pressure c is concentration of solute equation 9 is a combination of flow and transport equation linked by density term there are various finite difference and finite element based methods to solve this equation in this study finite difference based model seawat guo and langevin 2002 is used to solve equation 12 seawat uses flow model modflow harbaugh et al 2000 and transport model mt3d zheng and wang 1999 together to solve the above equation to find the salt concentration on different locations which is used to calculate an isosalinity contour which is compared with the sharp interface the isosalinity contour is calculated from the lagrangian interpolation equation 13 13 x c k j 1 n c τ c j k i 0 n x i k c τ c i k j 1 i j n c i k c j k here at kth row and ith column the concentration is c i k and the distance from the sea is x i k n is the total number of columns for jth column concentration is c j k the concentration at which isosalinity contour is calculated is c τ and the corresponding location is x c k 2 3 linking of sharp interface model with density dependent model as discussed earlier simulation based pumping optimization techniques has some distinct advantage over surrogate based pumping optimization in terms of data requirement at the same time drawbacks of simulation optimization framework in saltwater intrusion problem are accuracy of prediction and computational time above mentioned drawbacks are addressed by developing a new methodology which reduces computational time without compromising on the accuracy of prediction for saltwater freshwater front in a limited data availability scenario the goal is met by modifying the density ratio in the sharp interface model such that freshwater saltwater interface predicted by this modified density ratio represents the actual freshwater saltwater interface as would have been predicted by a density dependent model which incorporates the effect of dispersion and diffusion it is well documented that sharp interface model over estimates the toe location of the interface because it does not consider dispersion and diffusion to overcome this problem an iterative process is designed where first pumping is optimized using only sharp interface simulation model for a given density ratio ε 0 035 ε 0 this optimized pumping value is then used in a density dependent model to find the corresponding isosalinity contour toe location density dependent model has been used to calculate isosalinity contour corresponding to a concentration of 5 kg m3 the residual error between the toe location obtained using sharp interface simulation model for optimal pumping and the corresponding isosalinity contour toe location obtained using density dependent model for the same pumping is minimized the density is varied based on the idea that at optimal density ratio toe location obtained from sharp interface and toe location obtained from isosalinity contour using density dependent simulation model should match fig 2 for a given pumping scenario the optimization model chooses any candidate density value between 35 kg m3 and 0 kg m3 and calculates the toe location for the corresponding value of density the optimization model in subsequent iterations suitably modifies the density value based on optimization parameters until a density value is found that gives the minimum residual error between the estimated toe location and the actual toe location since the density ratio is dependent on the value of density the density ratio also gets modified this formulation to optimize density ratio is given by equation 14 subject to constraint in equation 15 14 minimize τ m m 1 m x τmk x cmk 15 subjected to 0 035 ε 0 where x τmk is distance of toe location obtained using sharp interface simulation model from sea boundary at mth well location x cmk is distance of toe location of isosalinity contour obtained using density dependent simulation model from sea boundary at mth well location the advantage of this methodology is that it eliminates the need to run the density dependent model in every iteration of pumping optimization and therefore reduces computational budget this method is similar to as discussed by christelis and mantoglou 2016 according to christelis and mantoglou 2019 this method can quickly attain solution in a simulation optimization based framework optimization model finds the possible solution as is with any heuristic optimization there is a possibility that the solution may converge to local optima to overcome this difficulty stopping criterion is introduced in the developed methodology the stopping of the algorithm is performed when last five iterations shows a good match between them the iterative process has two parts as shown in fig 3 first part is optimization of pumping with help of sharp interface model linked with pso sharp interface is function of water table head and density ratio therefore pumping optimization is initialized with an estimated density ratio ε between 0 035 as the upper limit and 0 as the lower limit as proposed by pool and carrera 2011 and christelis and mantoglou 2016 in the second step density ratio is optimized the optimized pumping value from pumping optimization by sharp interface model is used to run the density dependent model seawat then the outcome of seawat is used to locate toe of isosalinity contour with help of lagrangian interpolation equation 13 the optimization algorithm in second case minimizes the difference between toe location of isosalinity contour and toe location obtained from sharp interface fig 3 density ratio corresponding to optimal value of this minimization problem is used to update the density ratio in the sharp interface model in the next iteration this process is continued until there is no significant change in density ratio value for five consecutive iterations 2 4 particle swarm optimization in this study heuristic optimization pso is chosen for solving the optimization problem working principle of pso is derived from movement of a flock of birds or a school of fish with the help of collective intelligence exhibited by a flock of birds or a school of fish the group is able to locate food which otherwise would have been impossible if attempted by an individual thus the strength in search for food essentially comes from sharing information gathered by each individual within the group this concept is used in pso to find an optimal pumping pso was introduced by eberhart and kennedy 1995 in this study a modified version of pso fig 4 as proposed by shi and eberhart 1998 is used as an optimizer in the used pso algorithm first m number of particles are arbitrarily selected in defined search space in second step particles are evaluated for the objective function in the final step particles modify their location based on best objective function value governed by velocity v a of the particle equation 16 poli et al 2007 the velocity of each particle equation 17 governs by constant inertia weight w cognitive constant c 1 social

the velocity based on difference of x a from x gp and x bp r is used to introduce the randomness in the direction of the movement 3 application of the developed methodology the performance of the developed methodology is tested against 4 scenarios of saltwater intrusion first three are hypothetical study areas with different pumping scenarios fourth scenario is a real life case study of a coastal aquifer in puri city of india discussed in the section below 3 1 hypothetical study area to test the developed methodology three different scenarios of pumping from a coastal aquifer are considered the study area fig 5 comprises of a homogeneous isotropic three dimensional unconfined coastal aquifer having an area of 25 2 105 m2 1800 m 1400 m thickness of the aquifer is 100 m with a uniform impervious layer beneath the study area is discretized into finite difference grids 10 m 10 m 10 m in size the right hand side boundary of the study area is the sea and the left hand side boundary is considered as fixed head boundary the remaining two sides of the study area are considered as no flow boundaries at the start of simulation the head is considered linearly varying from land surface at 9 m to seaside at 0 m initial salt concentration in the aquifer is assumed to be zero dirichlet boundary condition is assigned at land side and sea side with concentration 0 kg m3 and 35 kg m3 respectively the aquifer is studied for a period of 10 years other parameters of the study area used in the model are summarized in table 1 it is assumed that the aquifer is pumped uniformly throughout its depth at the well locations in scenario one and two coastal aquifer is pumped using six pumping wells each locations of the six pumping wells for scenario one and two are different in third scenario nine pumping wells are used the wells are steadily pumped throughout the study period 10 years the upper and lower limit of pumping is considered as 35 000 m3 day and 300 m3 day respectively for all pumping wells in all the three scenarios in fourth scenario the method is applied to real life case of salt water intrusion in puri city of india 3 2 groundwater flow and transport simulation model for puri city puri is a coastal city which is situated on east coast of india it lies between 19 47 to 19 50 north latitudes and 85 48 to 85 52 east longitudes the slope of the area is 18 m from msl from north west to 0 m from msl south east according to 2011 census report total population of puri city is about 200 thousand jena 2014 puri city is supplied with 20 5 103 m3 day freshwater form 36 pumping wells the city has two pumping fields i e chakratirtha and balia panda in chakratirtha water field 19 pumping wells are present and 13 pumping wells are at balia panda water field four other wells are spread across the city freshwater is also extracted from hundreds of hand pumps and dug wells vijay and mohapatra 2016 though in very small amount the study period for the developed model is considered during post monsoon 2006 to pre monsoon 2017 i e between september 2006 to may 2017 groundwater head data between september 2006 to may 2007 is used to calibrate the model the daily average recharge is calculated from rainfall data according to imd in the year 2006 and 2007 puri city received 2112 and 1290 mm of precipitation respectively vijay et al 2011 according to vijay and mohapatra 2016 recharge from the precipitation in this area was about 33 of average precipitation of the year 2006 and 2007 i e 561 mm therefore 1 54 mm day is taken as the average recharge for the puri city during calibration period the entire period between june 2007 to may 2017 is used to calculate the maximum allowable daily pumping from the coastal aquifer of puri city aquifer of puri city is divided in 100 m 100 m finite difference grid with three layers fig 7 a fixed head value of 0 m and constant salt concentration of 35 kg m3 is taken along the coast for the land side the constant salt concentration of 0 kg m3 is taken the head at the boundary is determined based on the contour from average head during post monsoon of 2006 and pre monsoon of 2007 provided by vijay et al 2011 though there are 19 production wells in chakratirtha water field and 13 production wells in balia panda water field fig 6 only four production wells in chakratirtha water field and a single pumping well in balia panda water field is considered in the finite difference model as some of the wells are so close to each other that they fall in one grid location or adjacent grids and therefore can effectively be represented by one well when the distance between the two well is less than four gird locations it is considered as single well and the entire group is substituted by an equivalent well this also eliminated the influence of draw down of one well on the neighboring wells this grouping of wells reduces the well count down to four in chakratirtha and one in balia panda water fields table 3 also wells within 4 grids of the boundary of the study area are not considered in the simulation because influence of those wells are limited near the boundary the city is underlain by sand beneath a thin layer of clay of varying thicknesses dey and prakash 2019a vijay et al 2011 therefore the aquifer is considered as unconfined homogeneous and isotropic the other hydrogeological parameters are discussed in table 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 performance evaluation for hypothetical study area the iterative process of pumping optimization followed by density ratio optimization is run 31 times for scenario 1 and 15 times on scenario 2 and 3 respectively to test the stopping criterion and find optimal pumping corresponding density ratio is also calculated that would reflect the effect of dispersion and diffusion in a sharp interface simulation model thereby giving a more realistic estimate of pumping without causing saltwater intrusion the performance evaluation results of optimal pumping value and corresponding density ratio is presented in fig 8 it was observed that total optimal pumping achieved is 35 375 103 m3 day after 7 iterations for scenario 1 35 648 103 m3 day after 9 iterations for scenario 2 and 30 036 103 m3 day after 8 iterations for scenario 3 in addition corresponding optimal density ratio is found to be 0 0108 after 7 iterations in scenario 1 0 0124 after 9 iterations for scenario 2 and 0 0120 after 8 iterations for scenario 3 no significant improvement in pumping or change in density ratio is observed after 7th iteration in scenario 1 9th iteration in scenario 2 and 8th iteration in scenario 3 till end of the iteration table 4 shows the final pumping value for each of the production wells in the scenarios though scenario 2 has same number of wells as in scenario 1 the pumping from scenario 2 is slightly higher than scenario 1 because three pumping wells are located more inland compared to two wells in scenario 1 fig 4 in scenario 1 well 5 and well 6 are pumped at the maximum limit 15 000 103 m3 day in scenario 3 though the total number of production wells increases but total pumping decreases this is because most of the wells are near the seashore therefore decrease in the total pumping is observed compared to scenario 1 and scenario 2 in scenario 3 well 2 and well 4 are farthest from the sea and those pumped at the 15 000 103 m3 day and 12 939 103 m3 day respectively well 7 in scenario 3 is pumped at 0 300 103 m3 day due its proximity of well 3 and well 1 it is also observed that the obtained density ratio is different for the three scenarios at maximum pumping therefore it is apprehended that location and proximity of the wells have significant impact on the pumping and density ratio the toe locations calculated by sharp interface and isosalinity contour are presented in fig 9 it was found that for test scenario 1 fig 9 a sharp interface crosses well locations 2 3 and 4 by less than 5 m since the grid size taken in this study is 10 m these violations could be the result of interpolation and can be easily neglected fig 9 shows a significant gap between the isosalinity contour and location of the interface in all three scenarios this is due to difference in the head values estimated using seawat and modflow the calculated head by density dependent model seawat is not the same as calculated by modflow because density dependent model calculates equivalent freshwater head guo and langevin 2002 instead of total head as in case of modflow in addition to optimal pumping total cpu run time of sharp interface model density dependent model and the iterative process is recorded table 5 it was found that average cpu run time for sharp interface model was 8 698 s on an i7 3 6 ghz cpu the maximum recorded cpu run time for sharp interface model was 30 696 s and minimum recorded cpu run time recorded was 3 569 s density dependent model i e seawat is also run for the same data set to compare the run time of two models the average cpu run time for seawat was recorded as 150 min it is found that minimum cpu run time for seawat is 95 min and maximum run time is 310 min in addition it was also noted that average cpu run time for single iteration of developed method i e from pumping optimization by sharp interface model till checking the termination criteria fig 3 was about 420 min the maximum recorded time for the developed model was 896 58 min and the minimum run time was 350 17 min the advantage of the developed methodology can be understood by comparing time taken by traditional simulation optimization using density dependent model with time taken by the developed method it is clear from the results for scenario 1 2 3 that an average of 8 iterations are required for the sharp interface model to produce an optimal pumping therefore total time required to produce an optimal solution by this iterative methodology of pumping optimization followed by density ratio optimization is 8 420 min 3360 min 2 days 8 h it takes 70 runs on an average of the sharp interface simulation model with 30 particles pso parameter within one iteration of the developed methodology had the same problem been solved using density dependent model in a traditional simulation optimization scheme it would have taken 150 min 70 30 315 000 min 218 days 18 h it is to be noted that the density optimization step would not be required as the density dependent model takes density variation due to dispersion and diffusion into account therefore only one iteration would be required while using density dependent model in a traditional simulation optimization scheme from this calculation it is clear that it is possible to reduce the computational time by 315 000 3360 min 311 640 min or 216 days 10 h or 98 93 while using the developed methodology 4 2 application of the developed methodology in puri city the developed iterative methodology is applied to puri city to find the maximum rate at which freshwater can be extracted without causing saltwater intrusion and to verify if the current rates of extraction were within safe limits it is observed that total maximum pumping achieved without causing saltwater intrusion is 50 580 103 m3 day the corresponding optimal density ratio was 0 0173 the pumping and corresponding density ratio for every iteration is shown in fig 10 it is seen in fig 10 that after 4th iteration no significant improvement is observed in the total pumping or change in the density ratio though there are no significant change in density ratio or total maximum pumping the model is converged at 21 iterations to ensure the optimality of the results location of the sharp interface and location of the isosalinity contour is shown in fig 11 it can be seen that sharp interface and isosalinity contour closely match maximum pumping achieved for different wells is given in table 6 it is clear that the interface obtained from both sharp interface and isosalinity contour moves inwards toward the pumping wells near the two pumping fields it passes very close to pumping well pc 9 but does not cross the well location at no point the interface crosses well locations ensuring that there is no saltwater intrusion at the pumping well locations the total combined pumping at balia panda water fields represented by pc 1 new is about 7 4 103 m3 day the maximum allowable pumping as per the developed methodology is 12 1 103 m3 day the total combined pumping at chakratirtha water fields is 10 81 103 m3 day the maximum allowable pumping as per the developed methodology is 28 2 103 m3 day thus we can say that the current rates of pumping at both the water fields are within the maximum allowable limits and hence safe from saltwater intrusion however any change in the pumping should ensure that pc 9 is not effected by saltwater intrusion as this happens to be very close to the interface line 5 conclusions and recommendations in this study a heuristic optimization coupled with sharp interface and density dependent simulation model for maximizing freshwater pumping without causing saltwater intrusion is developed the methodology performs satisfactorily in finding maximum pumping without causing saltwater intrusion in a limited data availability scenario without excessive computational burden the developed methodology is successful in estimating the maximum allowable pumping in hypothetical study scenarios as well as for real life scenario of puri city number of production wells and their location in the study area is an important factor in deciding the maximum allowable pumping same number of pumping wells but with varying placement can alter the maximum allowable pumping the developed methodology overcomes one of the biggest limitations while using sharp interface models i e the accuracy of prediction the coupled used of sharp interface and density dependent model accounts for greater accuracy compared to using sharp interface model alone the developed methodology is able to reduce the computational time by 98 93 compared to conventional simulation optimization method based on density dependent simulation model therefore the developed methodology is a viable option to predict saltwater intrusion for real life scenarios application of the developed methodology to puri city shows that the puri coastal aquifer is currently under pumped and has potential to be pumped at twice the current rate without causing saltwater intrusion this is also supported by vijay and mohapatra 2016 while using the developed methodology the number of iterations required before reaching an optimal result is subjective and may vary from one scenario to another therefore large number of iterations are sometimes required to ascertain the optimality of the results the impact of number of production wells and their locations need to be further investigated in finding maximum allowable pumping declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

iron supplements as a measure to prevent anemia hemoglobin concentration below a specified level according to age and sex high prevalence of anemia in children 33 1 and women 26 still poses a public health concern rahman et al 2016 while iron is essential for many physiological functions an excess amount of iron may lead to various side effects e g diarrhea nausea vomiting and respiratory tract infection soofi et al 2013 further iron is a pro oxidant which in the free state may lead to the potential damaging effects scholl 2005 with possible adversaries in key organs heart liver pancreas bowman and russell 2006 hence on the backdrop of a fair amount of iron naturally acquired from drinking groundwater an optimization of the body iron level is pertinent in the context of a blanket supplementation of iron iron containing micronutrients for prevention of population level anemia this optimization is required to decrease the iron related side effects and to increase the compliance and coverage of the supplementation programs in order for this optimization rahman et al recommended for assessment of groundwater iron prior to the design of anemia prevention iron supplementation programs rahman et al 2016 as an intervention for anemia the low iron supplements e g low iron micronutrient powders has been tested and has shown to be efficacious in preventing anemia and inducing fewer side effects among bangladeshi under five children residing in the area with high level iron in groundwater rahman et al 2019 for control of anemia in pregnant women a recommendation has been made to lower the present dose of the supplemental iron by half in women exposed to high groundwater iron bangladesh national anemia consultation 2016 as stated above groundwater iron in bangladesh is wide spread and the concentration is variable however taking into consideration the specified concentration of iron in drinking water 2 mg l which limits the intake of iron within the tolerable amount the country can be potentially disentangled by two type of areas based on the iron concentration areas with predominantly high 2 mg l and areas with predominantly low 2 mg l groundwater iron as stated elsewhere there were two nationally representative surveys which estimated the groundwater iron concentration in bangladesh both the surveys depicted the country with mapping for iron in groundwater however the surveys had limitations the surveys did not report any epidemiological method to calculate the sample size and sampling strategy the dphe bgs 2001 sampled 3530 tube well water samples for iron across the country on average just 8 wells were sampled per sub district upazila which was 0 03 0 05 of all tube wells of the country the ndwqs 2009 sampled 2896 tubewells for iron assessment the latter survey though reported disaggregated data by district the small number of samples per district ñ20 100 is non representative at the district level which have on average a few millions of population the current surveys therefore are not optimum to disentangle the country into high iron and low iron groundwater areas with good reliability hence an updated mapping of groundwater iron is required which would be better representative at the level of sub district upazila a survey with higher representativeness at the population level e g at sub district level and there are 500 sub districts in the country would require sampling of tens of thousands of tube wells in the low income countries the devices and reagents for measuring the concentration of iron in groundwater are imported expensive and not readily available thus such a robust mapping for groundwater iron using any device laboratory based method would be prohibitively expensive therefore we attempted to develop and standardize a simple and non device based method of taste rating of groundwater sample for the level of iron for a semi quantitative assessment of groundwater iron the basis of the taste rating is the anecdotal experience that the metallic bitterly taste of the water sample is associated with iron level in groundwater recently we conducted a small pilot study n 13 which observed a positive association of taste rating of groundwater sample and its concentration of iron rahman et al 2018 the present study with a much larger sample attempted to develop and standardize the method a simple device free taste rating tool for iron assessment in groundwater sample can be economic and may potentially serve the intended purpose of the iron mapping the resulting iron mapping of groundwater showing just two categories high iron and low iron of areas i e sub districts can guide the national anemia control authorities of bangladesh to customize the iron supplement interventions 2 methods 2 1 study area and sample size the study was conducted in two sub districts belkuchi 24 2917 n 89 7000 e and pirganj 25 51 3 n 88 22 e situated in the north west and northern part of bangladesh respectively fig 1 according to the report of the dphe bgs 2001 belkuchi and pirganj represented a predominantly high and a predominantly low groundwater iron areas respectively we considered the high level of iron in groundwater based on the joint fao who expert committee on food additives who 2017 who 2004 defined upper limit 2 mg l of iron in the water there is a paucity of data on the number of tube wells at the sub district level of bangladesh the total number of tube wells in bangladesh is up to 11 million dphe bgs 2001 and the total population of the country is 166 million worldometers 2017 this translates in one tube well for roughly 15 people we triangulated the usage rate of the tube wells and the population of the sub districts banglapedia 2012 and estimated the number of tube wells in belkuchi and pirganj as 20 178 and 14 383 respectively supplementary table 1 the sample size was estimated based on the proportion p of tube wells which the assessor taste rated to have some level of iron in the water sample observed in our pilot study considering p 76 rahman et al 2018 5 error margin 95 confidence level and an estimated total number of 20 178 tube wells the required sample size in belkuchi was 277 however as the study was nested in a larger trial on the efficacy of a novel micronutrient formulation we assessed 400 tube wells for taste rating similarly in pirganj with an estimated total number of tube wells of 14 383 and considering the above stated statistical parameters the required sample size was 270 we could assess 266 wells hence a total of 666 households with a tube well were assessed for taste rating of the water samples in the two areas 2 2 procedure the tube wells were selected at random from 8 and 3 villages of belkuchi and pirganj respectively after obtaining the consent of the household head two external assessors undertook the assessment of the well water samples separately and recorded their taste ratings to one of the following categories a no iron b some iron and c heavy iron then the assessors asked the respondent of the households how they perceive the taste for iron of the water of the tube wells used by them for drinking the respondents rated their taste experiences to one of the above categories this sequence of the taste assessment was followed so that the external assessors could avoid the potential information bias for their ratings from the respondents the proportional magnitude of different taste ratings and concentration of iron in groundwater by the taste ratings was studied in both study areas the association of the taste ratings of the water sample and its concentration of iron and the agreement of the taste ratings between the various raters were studied in the high groundwater iron area belkuchi the weighted average of concentration of iron in groundwater of the study sub districts was calculated by summation of the product of the proportions of different taste categories and the corresponding reference iron concentrations supplementary text 1 fig 4 2 3 development and standardization of taste rating of the water sample at first the selected tube well was pumped for 5 min to get away with any buildup of oxidized residual iron at the inner surface of the tube well wall which might have come in contact with the upcoming water and contaminate the sample further pumping water for some time would help reach the deeper aquifer which represents the actual milieu of groundwater merrill et al 2011 the sample water was taken in a 50 ml beaker before tasting the water sample the assessors gurgled and washed their mouth with distilled water to neutralize the surface of the tongue and to remove any food particles dirt which might otherwise interfere with the taste sensation the assessor took a sip of the sample water in the mouth held it for up to 10 s to assess the taste and sensation experienced of the sample the assessment needed careful observation to determine the category of the taste and sensation at the time of the assessment the taste of the water sample might change for example the taste might appear sweet when the sample is put in the mouth first time however after a few seconds it might be felt bitter it might appear sharply bitter immediately after putting the water in the mouth however tasting of the subsequent sips might appear just mildly bitter hence the decision was made after several attempts when the assessor felt confident of the type of taste and the presence of any sensation to define the taste categories for the study we did a brief piloting exercise to disentangle the categories based on iron concentrations of tube well waters before data collection the assessors were provided with an orientation and practical understanding of the different kind of taste and sensations of the well water samples and how to pick a rating following the operational definitions and the process of tasting described in the method of all the assessors the best two who rated consistently correct ratings as per the operational characteristics and had good uniformities between them were selected for the study for the study we devised operational characteristics of the taste and sensations of the iron rich well water sample as shown in table 1 2 4 assessment of iron concentration of the tube well water the iron concentration of the well water was estimated by the iron test kit devices hi 3834 hanna instruments usa the iron test kit device was used because it has been validated against the gold standard atomic absorption spectrophotometry and was observed to have good correlation spearman rank 0 98 and agreement merrill et al 2009a 2009b at first the tube well was pumped for 5 min the test water sample was taken up to the 10 ml mark in the manufacturer supplied test beaker the supplied reagent phenanthroline was poured onto the sample water and thoroughly mixed the reagent mixed test water was poured into the test chamber of the device after 4 min the resultant color of the test water was matched with a reference color given with the device the matching indicated the concentration of iron in the test water sample the test kit device provides the measurement of iron concentration up to the concentration of 5 mg l if the color of the test sample appeared to have exceeded the reference color equivalent to 5 mg l the test was repeated with a two five or ten fold dilutions of the test water sample as needed the dilution was done by mixing distilled water with the sample water at an appropriate ratio according to the extent of dilution required the final reading of iron concentration was adjusted by multiplying by the corresponding units of dilution 2 5 statistical analysis we calculated the proportions of the taste ratings and correlations and agreements of the taste ratings given by various assessors the distribution of concentration of iron in water by various taste raters and the taste rating categories was presented and the non parametric test was used to determine the statistical difference in the mean estimates of iron concentration in the water the spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship of the perceived taste ratings for iron and iron concentration in the water sample the kendall s τ b coefficients were estimated to examine the correlation of the taste ratings between the respondents vs the assessors and between the assessors since there were many tied values over the corresponding ranks

and the respondents was 0 15 p 0 001 fig 5c 4 discussion this study reports the development and standardization of the taste rating of groundwater sample for the level of iron to establish a tool for a semi quantitative assessment of groundwater iron content the concentration of iron in groundwater was measured by different taste rating categories in the predominantly high and low groundwater iron areas in bangladesh the results showed that the taste rating categories by different raters were significantly different in groundwater iron concentration and higher concentrations of iron were observed with the higher ratings this substantiated the utility of the taste rating tool the results further showed a significant positive correlation of the taste ratings by the assessors and the respondents and the concentration of iron of the well water the coefficient appeared larger for external assessors than that for the respondents one way of explaining this is the assumption that the local respondents who are accustomed to using the water might have developed a tolerance to the iron level and thus tended to under report the taste ratings showed the positive correlations between various raters however the coefficient for the inter assessor ratings was much larger compared to that for between the assessor 1 vs respondents and the assessor 2 vs respondents the findings further indicate that the higher level of mismatch of ratings between the respondents and the external assessors which might have resulted from the respondent s under reporting of iron these findings indicate that the trained external assessors may provide the unbiased and objective taste ratings of the groundwater sample for the levels of iron there was a marked difference between the high and low iron areas regarding the proportion of the perceived taste category no iron in the high iron area the reporting of no iron was negligible 5 while in the low iron area the proportion of the rating was higher up to 40 among the respondents this owes to the level of iron in groundwater which was much lower in the low iron area and this resulted in higher number of responses from the respondents and the assessors reporting no iron the mean concentration of iron differed over the high and low iron areas within the same taste rating categories one way of explaining this is the fact that we observed a wide range of distribution of iron concentrations within a particular taste rating category results not shown this is an inherent limitation of precision of human taste perception relative to a range of iron concentrations hence the taste ratings were the same category despite the mean iron concentrations were considerably different between high and low groundwater iron areas because of this the study was conducted both in the high and low groundwater iron areas as the reference iron level by the taste rating categories from a high iron area would not represent for a low iron area the present study used a large number of water samples from the areas with a predominantly high and low level of iron in groundwater therefore the estimates of the mean concentration of iron by the taste categories were likely to be reliable for the subsequent application of the tool in a defined geographical area the requirement will be the taste ratings of the tube well water samples by the trained external assessors the sampling of the tube wells can be done by applying a random or systematic epidemiological sampling procedure the proportion of different taste ratings of the tube well water thus obtained could be used in conjunction with the mean iron concentration by the taste categories derived from the present study i e reference iron concentration a weighted average of iron concentration can be estimated to account for differential proportions of taste ratings supplementary text 1 the reference iron concentrations obtained by the taste categories for the high and low groundwater iron areas of the present study can be used for prospective assessment of groundwater iron in a predominantly high and low groundwater iron areas respectively supplementary text 1 fig 4 it is important to decide on the appropriate reference iron value which should be used to calculate the average concentration of groundwater iron of an area this can be informed by preexisting reference data of groundwater iron e g reports of the department of public health engineering geological surveys and geological studies these data might inform the magnitude of the groundwater iron level in the area based on the iron levels high or low the appropriate reference values of concentration of iron by the taste categories from the present study can be used if the area to be assessed is geographically large and both high and low levels of groundwater iron are apparent both the reference values can be used as per the requirement if there is no background data of groundwater iron available a small pilot study to measure iron can be done to have an idea of the iron level in groundwater before assessing the iron concentration by the taste rating tool the present study demonstrate a simple low cost supplementary text 2 fast and non device based way for a semi quantitative assessment of the iron level of groundwater which has the potential to apply for groundwater iron assessment in the defined geographical areas generally this may inform the program designers by identifying and prioritizing the geographical areas for programming and or modifying the program interventions of iron supplements specifically the taste rating tool potentially can be used to update iron mapping of bangladesh for groundwater and categorize the country into the high and low groundwater iron areas with a higher representative level of tube wells i e sub district upazila level thus the map may enable in the sub districts with predominantly high concentration of groundwater iron 2 mg l to implement a low dose iron supplements and thus has potential to promote the coverage of the national programs through minimization of side effects the finding of the positive correlation of the taste ratings of the water sample and the concentration of iron in groundwater is consistent with our pilot study n 13 rahman et al 2018 which is the only similar study available on the topic merrill et al studied a slightly different aspect of the users rating of the their well water for the level of iron based on their overall perception and the study observed the positive association of the perceived rating for iron in groundwater and its concentration of iron merrill et al 2010 there are other studies which used human sensory perception to assess mineral contents in groundwater annaduzzaman et al studied and validated a tool using the visual perception of the coloration formed on the tube well platforms to assess the arsenic content of groundwater of shallow aquifers of bangladesh annaduzzaman et al 2018 similarly biswas et al reported that platform color was fairly predictive of the arsenic and manganese content of the tube well water in the west bengal india biswas et al 2012 the color perception tool applied in these studies was sensitive and specific to predict those mineral contents however the intent of our taste perception tool is not to predict iron concentration of the tube wells but to map defined geographical areas to categorize them either as high 2 mg l or low 2 mg l iron groundwater areas hence a validation study of the tool in assessing the classification of the areas into high and low groundwater iron areas against the same assessed through the measurement by the standard laboratory and or standard devices will greatly endorse its real life application nearly 100 of the tube wells of the high iron area had the iron concentration of 2 mg l cut off defining high iron status and 91 of the wells of the low iron area had the iron concentration 2 mg l results not shown hence the study areas were fairly representative of the high and low iron groundwater areas of bangladesh respectively besides the study used a large number of tube wells to derive the estimates of the iron concentration of groundwater therefore the reference estimates of iron concentration by the taste categories are potentially generalizable in bangladesh and in similar settings although the colorimetric test kit device was validated against the atomic absorption spectrophotometer and reported to have a good agreement merrill et al 2009a 2009b the device is not a gold standard the usage of the device to measure the iron concentration of the water sample is a limitation of the study iron and manganese can give roughly a similar metallic perception of groundwater who 2011 however iron is found in much higher amount in the crust of the earth and in groundwater sandatlas 2020 although there might be shared presence the metallic taste of groundwater is predominantly imparted to iron this is substantiated by the finding of increasingly higher concentrations of iron over the higher taste rating categories nonetheless the fact that we did not measure manganese was an additional limitation zinc lead copper as well as low level ph can also give metallic taste advanced purification engineering corporation us we did not measure these metals in groundwater however historic data suggests that the concentration of zinc in the study areas is 0 026 0 027 mg l ndwqs 2009 which is much lower than the limit which is consistent with the taste in the water samples 3 mg l who 1993 similarly the presence of copper is at the trace level 0 008 mg l dphe bgs 2001 data on groundwater lead is scant in bangladesh but a limited study reported generally a low level 0 3 μg l across the country dphe bgs 2001 hence these metals were unlikely to bias the taste of the groundwater samples we measured ph of the water samples mean and median ph was 6 65 and 6 7 respectively which is slightly acidic results not shown despite an acidic ph can be associated with some taste in groundwater sample taste is an inherent characteristic of high concentrations of iron and other metals e g copper zinc lead manganese etc in groundwater advanced purification engineering corporation us we assume that in the context of a slight acidic ph and a presumed insignificant presence of the metals copper zinc lead the predominant presence of iron imparted primarily to the taste of the studied water samples 5 conclusion taste rating of groundwater sample for iron may offer a simple low cost fast and a device free way of semi quantitative assessment of groundwater iron in defined geographical areas external assessors may provide reliable ratings subject to validation the tool can potentially be used in settings where groundwater iron is a source of iron through potable supplies for an appraisal of groundwater iron content and thus developing the iron mapping for groundwater such an assessment is important for designing and customization of an appropriate iron supplementation program for prevention and control of anemia in the populations

2017 this translates in one tube well for roughly 15 people we triangulated the usage rate of the tube wells and the population of the sub districts banglapedia 2012 and estimated the number of tube wells in belkuchi and pirganj as 20 178 and 14 383 respectively supplementary table 1 the sample size was estimated based on the proportion p of tube wells which the assessor taste rated to have some level of iron in the water sample observed in our pilot study considering p 76 rahman et al 2018 5 error margin 95 confidence level and an estimated total number of 20 178 tube wells the required sample size in belkuchi was 277 however as the study was nested in a larger trial on the efficacy of a novel micronutrient formulation we assessed 400 tube wells for taste rating similarly in pirganj with an estimated total number of tube wells of 14 383 and considering the above stated statistical parameters the required sample size was 270 we could assess 266 wells hence a total of 666 households with a tube well were assessed for taste rating of the water samples in the two areas 2 2 procedure the tube wells were selected at random from 8 and 3 villages of belkuchi and pirganj respectively after obtaining the consent of the household head two external assessors undertook the assessment of the well water samples separately and recorded their taste ratings to one of the following categories a no iron b some iron and c heavy iron then the assessors asked the respondent of the households how they perceive the taste for iron of the water of the tube wells used by them for drinking the respondents rated their taste experiences to one of the above categories this sequence of the taste assessment was followed so that the external assessors could avoid the potential information bias for their ratings from the respondents the proportional magnitude of different taste ratings and concentration of iron in groundwater by the taste ratings was studied in both study areas the association of the taste ratings of the water sample and its concentration of iron and the agreement of the taste ratings between the various raters were studied in the high groundwater iron area belkuchi the weighted average of concentration of iron in groundwater of the study sub districts was calculated by summation of the product of the proportions of different taste categories and the corresponding reference iron concentrations supplementary text 1 fig 4 2 3 development and standardization of taste rating of the water sample at first the selected tube well was pumped for 5 min to get away with any buildup of oxidized residual iron at the inner surface of the tube well wall which might have come in contact with the upcoming water and contaminate the sample further pumping water for some time would help reach the deeper aquifer which represents the actual milieu of groundwater merrill et al 2011 the sample water was taken in a 50 ml beaker before tasting the water sample the assessors gurgled and washed their mouth with distilled water to neutralize the surface of the tongue and to remove any food particles dirt which might otherwise interfere with the taste sensation the assessor took a sip of the sample water in the mouth held it for up to 10 s to assess the taste and sensation experienced of the sample the assessment needed careful observation to determine the category of the taste and sensation at the time of the assessment the taste of the water sample might change for example the taste might appear sweet when the sample is put in the mouth first time however after a few seconds it might be felt bitter it might appear sharply bitter immediately after putting the water in the mouth however tasting of the subsequent sips might appear just mildly bitter hence the decision was made after several attempts when the assessor felt confident of the type of taste and the presence of any sensation to define the taste categories for the study we did a brief piloting exercise to disentangle the categories based on iron concentrations of tube well waters before data collection the assessors were provided with an orientation and practical understanding of the different kind of taste and sensations of the well water samples and how to pick a rating following the operational definitions and the process of tasting described in the method of all the assessors the best two who rated consistently correct ratings as per the operational characteristics and had good uniformities between them were selected for the study for the study we devised operational characteristics of the taste and sensations of the iron rich well water sample as shown in table 1 2 4 assessment of iron concentration of the tube well water the iron concentration of the well water was estimated by the iron test kit devices hi 3834 hanna instruments usa the iron test kit device was used because it has been validated against the gold standard atomic absorption spectrophotometry and was observed to have good correlation spearman rank 0 98 and agreement merrill et al 2009a 2009b at first the tube well was pumped for 5 min the test water sample was taken up to the 10 ml mark in the manufacturer supplied test beaker the supplied reagent phenanthroline was poured onto the sample water and thoroughly mixed the reagent mixed test water was poured into the test chamber of the device after 4 min the resultant color of the test water was matched with a reference color given with the device the matching indicated the concentration of iron in the test water sample the test kit device provides the measurement of iron concentration up to the concentration of 5 mg l if the color of the test sample appeared to have exceeded the reference color equivalent to 5 mg l the test was repeated with a two five or ten fold dilutions of the test water sample as needed the dilution was done by mixing distilled water with the sample water at an appropriate ratio according to the extent of dilution required the final reading of iron concentration was adjusted by multiplying by the corresponding units of dilution 2 5 statistical analysis we calculated the proportions of the taste ratings and correlations and agreements of the taste ratings given by various assessors the distribution of concentration of iron in water by various taste raters and the taste rating categories was presented and the non parametric test was used to determine the statistical difference in the mean estimates of iron concentration in the water the spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship of the perceived taste ratings for iron and iron concentration in the water sample the kendall s τ b coefficients were estimated to examine the correlation of the taste ratings between the respondents vs the assessors and between the assessors since there were many tied values over the corresponding ranks

human research ethics committee australia 3 results assessment of taste rating for iron and measurement of the iron concentration of the groundwater samples were done of 400 tube wells in belkuchi and 266 tube wells in pirganj table 2 shows the proportions of taste ratings for iron in groundwater and the distribution of concentration of iron by taste ratings and the taste raters in the

and the respondents was 0 15 p 0 001 fig 5c 4 discussion this study reports the development and standardization of the taste rating of groundwater sample for the level of iron to establish a tool for a semi quantitative assessment of groundwater iron content the concentration of iron in groundwater was measured by different taste rating categories in the predominantly high and low groundwater iron areas in bangladesh the results showed that the taste rating categories by different raters were significantly different in groundwater iron concentration and higher concentrations of iron were observed with the higher ratings this substantiated the utility of the taste rating tool the results further showed a significant positive correlation of the taste ratings by the assessors and the respondents and the concentration of iron of the well water the coefficient appeared larger for external assessors than that for the respondents one way of explaining this is the assumption that the local respondents who are accustomed to using the water might have developed a tolerance to the iron level and thus tended to under report the taste ratings showed the positive correlations between various raters however the coefficient for the inter assessor ratings was much larger compared to that for between the assessor 1 vs respondents and the assessor 2 vs respondents the findings further indicate that the higher level of mismatch of ratings between the respondents and the external assessors which might have resulted from the respondent s under reporting of iron these findings indicate that the trained external assessors may provide the unbiased and objective taste ratings of the groundwater sample for the levels of iron there was a marked difference between the high and low iron areas regarding the proportion of the perceived taste category no iron in the high iron area the reporting of no iron was negligible 5 while in the low iron area the proportion of the rating was higher up to 40 among the respondents this owes to the level of iron in groundwater which was much lower in the low iron area and this resulted in higher number of responses from the respondents and the assessors reporting no iron the mean concentration of iron differed over the high and low iron areas within the same taste rating categories one way of explaining this is the fact that we observed a wide range of distribution of iron concentrations within a particular taste rating category results not shown this is an inherent limitation of precision of human taste perception relative to a range of iron concentrations hence the taste ratings were the same category despite the mean iron concentrations were considerably different between high and low groundwater iron areas because of this the study was conducted both in the high and low groundwater iron areas as the reference iron level by the taste rating categories from a high iron area would not represent for a low iron area the present study used a large number of water samples from the areas with a predominantly high and low level of iron in groundwater therefore the estimates of the mean concentration of iron by the taste categories were likely to be reliable for the subsequent application of the tool in a defined geographical area the requirement will be the taste ratings of the tube well water samples by the trained external assessors the sampling of the tube wells can be done by applying a random or systematic epidemiological sampling procedure the proportion of different taste ratings of the tube well water thus obtained could be used in conjunction with the mean iron concentration by the taste categories derived from the present study i e reference iron concentration a weighted average of iron concentration can be estimated to account for differential proportions of taste ratings supplementary text 1 the reference iron concentrations obtained by the taste categories for the high and low groundwater iron areas of the present study can be used for prospective assessment of groundwater iron in a predominantly high and low groundwater iron areas respectively supplementary text 1 fig 4 it is important to decide on the appropriate reference iron value which should be used to calculate the average concentration of groundwater iron of an area this can be informed by preexisting reference data of groundwater iron e g reports of the department of public health engineering geological surveys and geological studies these data might inform the magnitude of the groundwater iron level in the area based on the iron levels high or low the appropriate reference values of concentration of iron by the taste categories from the present study can be used if the area to be assessed is geographically large and both high and low levels of groundwater iron are apparent both the reference values can be used as per the requirement if there is no background data of groundwater iron available a small pilot study to measure iron can be done to have an idea of the iron level in groundwater before assessing the iron concentration by the taste rating tool the present study demonstrate a simple low cost supplementary text 2 fast and non device based way for a semi quantitative assessment of the iron level of groundwater which has the potential to apply for groundwater iron assessment in the defined geographical areas generally this may inform the program designers by identifying and prioritizing the geographical areas for programming and or modifying the program interventions of iron supplements specifically the taste rating tool potentially can be used to update iron mapping of bangladesh for groundwater and categorize the country into the high and low groundwater iron areas with a higher representative level of tube wells i e sub district upazila level thus the map may enable in the sub districts with predominantly high concentration of groundwater iron 2 mg l to implement a low dose iron supplements and thus has potential to promote the coverage of the national programs through minimization of side effects the finding of the positive correlation of the taste ratings of the water sample and the concentration of iron in groundwater is consistent with our pilot study n 13 rahman et al 2018 which is the only similar study available on the topic merrill et al studied a slightly different aspect of the users rating of the their well water for the level of iron based on their overall perception and the study observed the positive association of the perceived rating for iron in groundwater and its concentration of iron merrill et al 2010 there are other studies which used human sensory perception to assess mineral contents in groundwater annaduzzaman et al studied and validated a tool using the visual perception of the coloration formed on the tube well platforms to assess the arsenic content of groundwater of shallow aquifers of bangladesh annaduzzaman et al 2018 similarly biswas et al reported that platform color was fairly predictive of the arsenic and manganese content of the tube well water in the west bengal india biswas et al 2012 the color perception tool applied in these studies was sensitive and specific to predict those mineral contents however the intent of our taste perception tool is not to predict iron concentration of the tube wells but to map defined geographical areas to categorize them either as high 2 mg l or low 2 mg l iron groundwater areas hence a validation study of the tool in assessing the classification of the areas into high and low groundwater iron areas against the same assessed through the measurement by the standard laboratory and or standard devices will greatly endorse its real life application nearly 100 of the tube wells of the high iron area had the iron concentration of 2 mg l cut off defining high iron status and 91 of the wells of the low iron area had the iron concentration 2 mg l results not shown hence the study areas were fairly representative of the high and low iron groundwater areas of bangladesh respectively besides the study used a large number of tube wells to derive the estimates of the iron concentration of groundwater therefore the reference estimates of iron concentration by the taste categories are potentially generalizable in bangladesh and in similar settings although the colorimetric test kit device was validated against the atomic absorption spectrophotometer and reported to have a good agreement merrill et al 2009a 2009b the device is not a gold standard the usage of the device to measure the iron concentration of the water sample is a limitation of the study iron and manganese can give roughly a similar metallic perception of groundwater who 2011 however iron is found in much higher amount in the crust of the earth and in groundwater sandatlas 2020 although there might be shared presence the metallic taste of groundwater is predominantly imparted to iron this is substantiated by the finding of increasingly higher concentrations of iron over the higher taste rating categories nonetheless the fact that we did not measure manganese was an additional limitation zinc lead copper as well as low level ph can also give metallic taste advanced purification engineering corporation us we did not measure these metals in groundwater however historic data suggests that the concentration of zinc in the study areas is 0 026 0 027 mg l ndwqs 2009 which is much lower than the limit which is consistent with the taste in the water samples 3 mg l who 1993 similarly the presence of copper is at the trace level 0 008 mg l dphe bgs 2001 data on groundwater lead is scant in bangladesh but a limited study reported generally a low level 0 3 μg l across the country dphe bgs 2001 hence these metals were unlikely to bias the taste of the groundwater samples we measured ph of the water samples mean and median ph was 6 65 and 6 7 respectively which is slightly acidic results not shown despite an acidic ph can be associated with some taste in groundwater sample taste is an inherent characteristic of high concentrations of iron and other metals e g copper zinc lead manganese etc in groundwater advanced purification engineering corporation us we assume that in the context of a slight acidic ph and a presumed insignificant presence of the metals copper zinc lead the predominant presence of iron imparted primarily to the taste of the studied water samples 5 conclusion taste rating of groundwater sample for iron may offer a simple low cost fast and a device free way of semi quantitative assessment of groundwater iron in defined geographical areas external assessors may provide reliable ratings subject to validation the tool can potentially be used in settings where groundwater iron is a source of iron through potable supplies for an appraisal of groundwater iron content and thus developing the iron mapping for groundwater such an assessment is important for designing and customization of an appropriate iron supplementation program for prevention and control of anemia in the populations

the use of flow cytometry cheswick et al 2019 more recently water quality index wqi has been calculated using a formula designed by evaluating some physicochemical parameters wqi is a simplified way of conveying water quality information to the policymakers and the public it can also be used to assess the suitability of water samples for different uses water quality is commonly affected by contaminants from anthropogenic sources including industries and agricultural sources unfortunately in most african countries water consumption is not discouraged by their poor microbiological and physicochemical status they are mostly used without further processing nigeria is a developing country in west africa with limited access to potable water although water is fairly available in most cities and towns the microbiological and physicochemical quality of the water sources are generally poor ayandiran et al 2014 meanwhile water may become very scarce in the dry season ogbomoso is one of the biggest towns in nigeria but substantially lacks pipe borne water and dwellers rely on groundwater such as wells boreholes and sometimes rainwater for domestic and agricultural uses the poor citizens often have to rely on fetching water from hand dug wells and boreholes it is therefore essential to ascertain the suitability of these groundwater sources for drinking and hence its sustainability the geology of the area has been determined to belong to the meta sedimentary series and migmatite gneiss quartzite complex with the direction of groundwater flow mainly southward and westward adegoke et al 2013 michael et al 2013 previously to the best of our knowledge only a study had been conducted to assess the potability of water in ogbomoso township lateef et al 2012 but none has been comprehensive enough by using different tools to determine the potability of these water sources 2 methodology 2 1 study area ogbomoso is a main town in oyo state provided with a highway linking the northern part of nigeria to the western part the town is situated in the south western region of nigeria between latitude 8 06 98 7 n and longitude 4 14 28 2 e ogbomoso metropolis is mainly divided into two local governments ogbomoso south and ogbomoso north local governments fig 1 its being in the savannah zone makes agribusiness the main livelihood of individuals in the area other occupations include trading teaching and artisans there are very few industries of which they are mostly into sachet water and drug production 2 2 sample collection one hundred and twenty two 122 water samples were collected from ogbomoso north and south local government in oyo state nigeria eighty 80 water samples were collected from wells while 42 samples were from boreholes a sterile 1000 ml screw capped bottle was used to aseptically collect the water samples borehole water samples were collected by pre cleaning the tap and allowing its free flow for 5 min before obtaining the mid stream samples for the well water sampling was done by tying a rope to the sterile containers and using this to draw out water then tightly corked all samples were conveyed to the laboratory in an ice pack and processed on the same day within 2 h 2 3 physico chemical analysis of water samples the total hardness chloride content turbidity ph conductivity total dissolved solids and colour were estimated titrimetric method was used to determine the total hardness and chloride content while electrometric method was used to determine the total dissolved solids and conductivity turbidity of the samples and ph was estimated using turbidity and ph meter respectively physicochemical data were analyzed using spss version 21 and was presented as mean values the standard deviations of the physicochemical parameters were also determined pearson s product moment correlation analysis was done to check for the relationship between the water quality parameters 2 4 water quality index

was used to assess the total coliforms this was carried out using the presumptive confirmed and completed tests as described previously apha et al 1998 briefly 10 1 0 and 0 1 ml of water samples were inoculated into 9 ml of lactose broth in tubes a loopful of suspension from positive presumptive tubes were transferred into brilliant green lactose bile broth incubated at 35 c for 48 h gas production in the blgb tubes within 48 h confirmed the presence of total coliforms chatanga et al 2019 the tubes showing positive confirmed tests were cultured on macconkey agar plates and incubated for 24 h at 35 c for enumeration 2 6 microbiological analysis of water samples using direct culture technique each sample was serially diluted and an aliquot of 0 2 ml from each dilution of 10 2 and 10 4 was aseptically inoculated on salmonella shigella agar ssa and mannitol salt agar msa using spread plate technique the plates were incubated at 37 c for 24 h and the total colony count was estimated per plate on ssa and msa the colony counts were expressed as cfu ml of the water sample the discrete colonies were subcultured to obtain pure isolates the pure isolates were characterized using biochemical tests mainly motility catalase coagulase indole oxidase voges proskauer methyl red urease citrate glucose maltose lactose sucrose and mannitol test and also by cultural and morphological characteristics of the isolates such as cells morphology shape size elevation edges colour pigment surface and gram staining 2 7 antibiotic susceptibility testing the sensitivity of the isolates to antibiotics was tested eucast 2014 antibiotic multi disks that were used consist of chloramphenicol 30 μg septrin 30 μg sparfloxacin 10 μg amoxicillin 30 μg ciprofloxacin 10 μg augmentin 30 μg perfloxacin 30 μg streptomycin 30 μg tarivids 10 μg and gentamicin 10 μg standardized inoculum size using 0 5 mcfarland standard was inoculated on mueller hinton agar with the antibiotic discs firmly placed on the agar surface incubated at 37 c for 18 24 h thereafter the zones of inhibition were measured in millimetres and the isolates were reported as either sensitive or resistant 3

indicates excellent poor and unsuitable for drinking when represented as 0 25 51 75 and 100 respectively therefore the boreholes understudy are poor sources of drinking water 3 4 total coliform count the microbiological analysis of both well and borehole water samples indicated contamination by different bacterial species table 5 klebsiella species recorded the highest number in the well water samples with a value of 1600 mpn 100 ml which far exceeded the standard requirement of 0 coliform 100 ml as per who and nsdwq standards this was followed by e coli 14 180 cfu 100 ml and s aureus 10 79

different countries was reported by sanganyado and gwenzi et al 2019 antibiotic resistance in drinking water needs continuous monitoring and appropriate management to curb some of its ill effects including disease outbreak increased pathogenicity virulence and mortality in developing countries consumption of untreated water from boreholes wells and springs might expose citizens to antibiotic resistant bacteria strains and this can be a health risk sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 several studies have linked disease outbreaks to drinking water that are contaminated with antibiotic resistant bacteria finley et al 2013 gupta et al 2016 ma et al 2017 qamar et al 2018 water quality index estimation is one of the best tools in assessing and managing water quality acuna alonso et al 2020 while microbiological appraisal of water quality remains an indispensable tool this study is similar to the background principle used in the design of fuzzy logic an artificial intelligence approach gharibi et al 2012 the main difference lies in the non inclusion of heavy metals as a part of the physicochemical parameters in this study and the obvious use of computational methods in the former in this study the water quality index showed that the water under consideration is a poor source of drinking water similar results have been reported in other countries gharibi et al 2012 acharjee et al 2013 abbasnia et al 2019 hence there is a need for the water to undergo some treatment processes such as the physical and chemical processes before consumption 5 conclusion this study comprehensively assessed well and borehole water in this region using a physicochemical mathematical and microbiological approach the results emphasized the poor quality of these drinking water sources the different approaches used in this assessment will be of value to policymakers worldwide we emphasize that it is necessary to continue to monitor and assess the quality of our drinking water for maximum human

12097,a total of one hundred and twenty two water samples were obtained from hand dug wells and boreholes in ogbomoso metropolis oyo state nigeria physico chemical most probable number technique direct culture methods and water quality index were used to assess the drinking water quality in this region some of the physicochemical parameters were within the acceptable limits with the exemption of conductivity 940 μscm 1 total dissolved solids 1120 mgl 1 total hardness 404 mg caco3l 1 and cl ion 220 mg l escherichia coli klebsiella sp staphylococcus aureus shigella dysenteriae proteus vulgaris pseudomonas aeruginosa salmonella sp and serratia sp are some of the isolates obtained from the water samples total coliform count in the well water samples was higher than those from boreholes with e coli having up to 180 and 45 cfu ml for well and borehole water samples respectively the calculated water quality index indicated poor drinking water quality some of the isolates were resistant to nothing less than three antibiotics and a maximum of ten antibiotics all approaches used for assessing the water samples emphasize the need for improvement in water quality to safeguard public health drinking water from hand dug wells and boreholes in this region requires treatment by chlorination filtration and boiling before consumption government bodies saddled with environmental and health responsibilities in the region should provide a potable water supply graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater ogbomoso drinking water microbiological assessment physicochemical antibiotic resistance water quality index 1 introduction water scarcity has led to the reuse of wastewater for irrigation and in some instances the level of microorganisms such water may harbour are not considered inyinbor et al 2018 besides water meant for drinking purposes can also be significantly laden with pathogenic organisms and some emerging environmental contaminants water contamination as a result of microbial pollutants has brought about waterborne diseases like typhoid fever cholera and dysentery smith 2017 waterborne sicknesses are caused by pathogenic microorganisms such as protozoa viruses and bacteria which are specifically transmitted when sullied water is expended potter 2016 according to who 2017 9 of the world s population amounting to 663 million people have no access to good drinking water and over 3 5 million individuals meet their demise every year from water related malady of which 84 are children world health organisation who 2018 this is a major reason why the improvement of drinking water quality and sanitation is one of the united nations sustainable development goals un 2015 public health can be at risk if drinking water is contaminated biologically chemically and physically yousefi et al 2017 clean water is a basic component of human survival and health good quality water should have no odour no colour practically with no taste and absence of faecal contamination ocheli et al 2020 to ascertain that drinking water supply fulfils these guiding principles water must be regularly checked for indicators of pollution world health organisation who 2018 routinely it is difficult to monitor water supply sources for the presence of pathogens associated with water borne diseases because of the complexity of the assessment time and the price related to it most preferentially indicator organisms that can be easily linked to the presence of pathogens and associated health hazards in water are used cheswick et al 2019 ideally a suitable indicator organism should fulfil some criteria it should be present when target pathogens are present and should be absent in unpolluted water access to ample safe drinking water should be of concern to many government and international bodies it is the core constituent of basic health care and a basic component of human development likewise a necessity for man s success in dealing with poverty starvation and death sopac who 2005 the quality of potable water supplies can be improved through disinfection usually by chlorination filtration thorough boiling and maintenance of proper waste management microbiological and physicochemical parameters are useful assessment criteria in judging the potability of drinking water and methods that detect indicator organisms are superior to the use of flow cytometry cheswick et al 2019 more recently water quality index wqi has been calculated using a formula designed by evaluating some physicochemical parameters wqi is a simplified way of conveying water quality information to the policymakers and the public it can also be used to assess the suitability of water samples for different uses water quality is commonly affected by contaminants from anthropogenic sources including industries and agricultural sources unfortunately in most african countries water consumption is not discouraged by their poor microbiological and physicochemical status they are mostly used without further processing nigeria is a developing country in west africa with limited access to potable water although water is fairly available in most cities and towns the microbiological and physicochemical quality of the water sources are generally poor ayandiran et al 2014 meanwhile water may become very scarce in the dry season ogbomoso is one of the biggest towns in nigeria but substantially lacks pipe borne water and dwellers rely on groundwater such as wells boreholes and sometimes rainwater for domestic and agricultural uses the poor citizens often have to rely on fetching water from hand dug wells and boreholes it is therefore essential to ascertain the suitability of these groundwater sources for drinking and hence its sustainability the geology of the area has been determined to belong to the meta sedimentary series and migmatite gneiss quartzite complex with the direction of groundwater flow mainly southward and westward adegoke et al 2013 michael et al 2013 previously to the best of our knowledge only a study had been conducted to assess the potability of water in ogbomoso township lateef et al 2012 but none has been comprehensive enough by using different tools to determine the potability of these water sources 2 methodology 2 1 study area ogbomoso is a main town in oyo state provided with a highway linking the northern part of nigeria to the western part the town is situated in the south western region of nigeria between latitude 8 06 98 7 n and longitude 4 14 28 2 e ogbomoso metropolis is mainly divided into two local governments ogbomoso south and ogbomoso north local governments fig 1 its being in the savannah zone makes agribusiness the main livelihood of individuals in the area other occupations include trading teaching and artisans there are very few industries of which they are mostly into sachet water and drug production 2 2 sample collection one hundred and twenty two 122 water samples were collected from ogbomoso north and south local government in oyo state nigeria eighty 80 water samples were collected from wells while 42 samples were from boreholes a sterile 1000 ml screw capped bottle was used to aseptically collect the water samples borehole water samples were collected by pre cleaning the tap and allowing its free flow for 5 min before obtaining the mid stream samples for the well water sampling was done by tying a rope to the sterile containers and using this to draw out water then tightly corked all samples were conveyed to the laboratory in an ice pack and processed on the same day within 2 h 2 3 physico chemical analysis of water samples the total hardness chloride content turbidity ph conductivity total dissolved solids and colour were estimated titrimetric method was used to determine the total hardness and chloride content while electrometric method was used to determine the total dissolved solids and conductivity turbidity of the samples and ph was estimated using turbidity and ph meter respectively physicochemical data were analyzed using spss version 21 and was presented as mean values the standard deviations of the physicochemical parameters were also determined pearson s product moment correlation analysis was done to check for the relationship between the water quality parameters 2 4 water quality index assessment the water quality index wqi of the borehole was estimated to determine its suitability for drinking purposes using the physicochemical parameters as described previously ewaid and abed 2017 the use of wqi enables the conversion of the many values obtained from the physicochemical assessments into a single value this value describes the quality of the water understudy as excellent good moderate poor or fair table 1 the calculation was performed as described by ewaid and abed 2017 1 q i m i l i s i l i 100 2 w i k s i 3 w q i i 1 n w i q i i 1 n w i where mi is the monitored value of

the proportionality constant n is the number of parameters and wi is the unit weightage of the ith parameter 2 5 evaluation of total coliform the most probable number mpn technique nester et al 2001 was used to assess the total coliforms this was carried out using the presumptive confirmed and completed tests as described previously apha et al 1998 briefly 10 1 0 and 0 1 ml of water samples were inoculated into 9 ml of lactose broth in tubes a loopful of suspension from positive presumptive tubes were transferred into brilliant green lactose bile broth incubated at 35 c for 48 h gas production in the blgb tubes within 48 h confirmed the presence of total coliforms chatanga et al 2019 the tubes showing positive confirmed tests were cultured on macconkey agar plates and incubated for 24 h at 35 c for enumeration 2 6 microbiological analysis of water samples using direct culture technique each sample was serially diluted and an aliquot of 0 2 ml from each dilution of 10 2 and 10 4 was aseptically inoculated on salmonella shigella agar ssa and mannitol salt agar msa using spread plate technique the plates were incubated at 37 c for 24 h and the total colony count was estimated per plate on ssa and msa the colony counts were expressed as cfu ml of the water sample the discrete colonies were subcultured to obtain pure isolates the pure isolates were characterized using biochemical tests mainly motility catalase coagulase indole oxidase voges proskauer methyl red urease citrate glucose maltose lactose sucrose and mannitol test and also by cultural and morphological characteristics of the isolates such as cells morphology shape size elevation edges colour pigment surface and gram staining 2 7 antibiotic susceptibility testing the sensitivity of the isolates to antibiotics was tested eucast 2014 antibiotic multi disks that were used consist of chloramphenicol 30 μg septrin 30 μg sparfloxacin 10 μg amoxicillin 30 μg ciprofloxacin 10 μg augmentin 30 μg perfloxacin 30 μg streptomycin 30 μg tarivids 10 μg and gentamicin 10 μg standardized inoculum size using 0 5 mcfarland standard was inoculated on mueller hinton agar with the antibiotic discs firmly placed on the agar surface incubated at 37 c for 18 24 h thereafter the zones of inhibition were measured in millimetres and the isolates were reported as either sensitive or resistant 3

isolates were also reported for water samples from bangladesh parvez et al 2016 in the usa kawecki et al 2017 also isolated strains of s aureus that showed resistance to ciprofloxacin and ampicillin this implies that antibiotic resistance is not limited to the developing countries rather it is a global menace an in depth survey of antibiotic resistant bacteria from drinking water system in different countries was reported by sanganyado and gwenzi et al 2019 antibiotic resistance in drinking water needs continuous monitoring and appropriate management to curb some of its ill effects including disease outbreak increased pathogenicity virulence and mortality in developing countries consumption of untreated water from boreholes wells and springs might expose citizens to antibiotic resistant bacteria strains and this can be a health risk sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 several studies have linked disease outbreaks to drinking water that are contaminated with antibiotic resistant bacteria finley et al 2013 gupta et al 2016 ma et al 2017 qamar et al 2018 water quality index estimation is one of the best tools in assessing and managing water quality acuna alonso et al 2020 while microbiological appraisal of water quality remains an indispensable tool this study is similar to the background principle used in the design of fuzzy logic an artificial intelligence approach gharibi et al 2012 the main difference lies in the non inclusion of heavy metals as a part of the physicochemical parameters in this study and the obvious use of computational methods in the former in this study the water quality index showed that the water under consideration is a poor source of drinking water similar results have been reported in other countries gharibi et al 2012 acharjee et al 2013 abbasnia et al 2019 hence there is a need for the water to undergo some treatment processes such as the physical and chemical processes before consumption 5 conclusion this study comprehensively assessed well and borehole water in this region using a physicochemical mathematical and microbiological approach the results emphasized the poor quality of these drinking water sources the different approaches used in this assessment will be of value to policymakers worldwide we emphasize that it is necessary to continue to monitor and assess the quality of our drinking water for maximum human

electrical soundings were carried out across the study area applying the schlumberger electrode configuration and the data were analysed using the winresist software package which delineated the geoelectric layers in terms of their resistivities depths and thicknesses the aquifer resistivity was obtained to be within the range of 2681 3 16255 0 ωm with an average value of 9163 8 ωm while the aquifer thickness ranged from 47 4 to 128 0 m with an average value of 60 71 m the geohydraulic parameters estimated from the geoelectric data showed the following results the hydraulic conductivity ranging from 0 0456 to 0 4278 m day transmissivity ranged from 2 1611 to 54 7536 m2 day and aquifer porosity ranging from 11 6040 to 21 6787 the protective capacity of the aquifer was determined using the longitudinal conductance which has a range of values of 0 0029 0 3010 ω 1 and an average value of 0 0187ω 1 the results show a general low groundwater potential delineated from the values of the

drilled in the study area the receding of the surface water located from ngwo adada the popular adada river that was the main source of water for the building of most structures in the university of nigeria nsukka within 1960s was attributed to the will of the gods this portrays the level of ignorance of the people as no scientific means was recorded to have been applied to ascertain the cause of the river receding the growing population of the community and the increasing demand of water for their domestic use agricultural purposes and recreational activities has given rise to the urgent need to address the issue of groundwater potential and vulnerability within the area and possibly unravel the mystery of adada river groundwater is a major source of potable water due to its quality when compared with other sources of water and hence requires little or no treatment before use anomohanran 2013 venkata et al 2014 obiora et al 2015 ibuot et al 2017 unavailability of geophysical

electrical sounding ves technique is extensively used in electrical resistivity surveys and is applied to a horizontally or approximately horizontally layered earth geological targets of interest maybe sedimentary rocks of dissimilar lithologies layered aquifers of dissimilar properties sedimentary rocks overlying igneous rocks or the weathering zone of igneous rocks etc can be studied by earth scientist this study aims at investigating the groundwater repositories of ibagwa aka so as to determine the aquifer characteristics groundwater potential and vulnerability of the area using electrical resistivity data 1 1 location and geology of the study area the study was carried out in ibagwa aka a town located in igbo eze south local government area of enugu state nigeria and lies within latitude 6 9224 n and longitude 7 4003 e fig 1a the study area has an area of about 158 km2 and elevation which range from 256 m to 333 m and is found within the anambra sedimentary basin with the upper nsukka formation and the underlying ajali sandstone fig 1 b as the geologic formations ofomata 1967 also found within the study area are the residual hills which sometimes form the outliers on the ajali sandstone and are capped by thick deposit of red earthy material and the permeable laterite which allow easy water percolation and groundwater recharge agagu et al 1985 the major component of the ajali sandstone is the medium to coarse grained sands which are occasionally iron stained the vesicular nature is responsible for the laterite capping in the area and these lateritic caps are underlain by a less pervious clay beds which leads to the formation of perched aquifer whose discharge is seen in asho hill in nsukka aku hill in obukpa abile hill in ibagwa aka and awula in ibagwa ani 2 materials and method the resistivity measurements were taken using the igis resistivity meter model ssr mp ats and its accessories the vertical electrical sounding was carried out in 10 selected points in ibagwa aka the resistivity data was acquired by means of vertical electrical sounding ves using schlumberger array with maximum current electrode spacing ab of 800 m and potential electrode spacing mn of 40 m most of the measurements were taken along approximately straight roads where the electrodes were moved in a straight line the measured resistance was recorded in the field and later converted to apparent resistivity ρ a for the schlumberger array using equation 1 1 ρ a π a b 2 2 m n 2 2 m n r a equation 1 was reduced to 2 ρ a g r a where g π a b 2 2 m n 2 2 m n is the geometric factor and r a is the apparent electrical resistance measured from the equipment the next stage was the plotting of the vertical electrical sounding curves for each of the survey locations and was smoothened in order to remove noisy signatures chakravarthi et al 2007 akpan et al 2006 winresist resistivity interpretation software was used to quantitatively interpret the data with the apparent resistivities used as input parameters this is a direct approach which generates quantitatively the values of the true resistivity depth and thickness of the subsurface after thirty iterations for each ves points the ves curves show the relationship between the apparent resistivity and the half current electrode spacing as presented in figs 2 4 the hydraulic properties of the study area were determined using the primary aquifer parameters the dar zarrouk parameters transverse resistance t and longitudinal conductance s evaluate the protective capacity and transmissivity of the aquifer layers maillet 1947 niwas and singhal 1981 mbonu et al 1991 the transverse resistance t and longitudinal conductance s were calculated using 3 t h ρ 4 s h ρ where h is the layer thickness ρ is the electrical resistivity of the layer transmissivity t r indicates the ability of the aquifer layer with permeability k to transmit fluid through its entire thickness h permeability portrays the possibility for water to percolate into the aquifer if aquifer is rechargeable and ability to transmit water stored if aquifer is dischargeable and is defined according to niwas and singhal 1981 as 5 t r k h where k is the hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity estimates the rate of flow of groundwater and is an important property for assessing groundwater repositories singh 2005 the hydraulic conductivity was estimated using equation 6 heigold et al 1979 6 k 386 40 r r w 9 3283 where rrw is the aquifer resistivity porosity ϕ of a geological material is the quantity of fluid the material can hold and can be calculated using equation 7 marotz 1968 7 ϕ 25 5 4 5 lnk where k is the hydraulic conductivity in m d a y 3 results and discussion the result of the interpreted data is presented in table 1 the analysis delineates 5 to 6 geo electric layers the study area is characterized by akqh and aaak ves 1 and ves 9 aak ves 2 3 5 7 and 8 akq ves 6 and 10 and khk ves 4 with aak being dominant the values of the first layer resistivity ranges from 92 5 to 2981 9 ωm while its thickness and depth ranges from 0 4 to 4 1 m respectively the values of the second layer resistivity are within the range of 419 4 1589 5 ωm with thickness range of 1 6 16 4 m and a depth range of 2 0 20 4 m in the third layer the resistivity ranges from 294 9 to 15746 4 ωm the thickness ranges from 4 4 to 68 7 m and the depth ranges from 9 4 to 86 6 m the resistivity of the fourth layer varies between 1881 8 and 16255 0 ωm with the thickness ranging from 8 0 to 93 7 m and the depth ranging from 34 6 to 167 3 m the fifth layer resistivity values range from 257 7 to 16957 4 ωm while its thickness and depth are undefined except at ves 1 and 10 the sixth layer observed at ves 1 and 10 with resistivity values of 1577 9 ωm and 13402 3 ωm groundwater potential is evaluated based on the geohydraulic properties which are the aquifer resistivity ρa aquifer thickness ha transverse resistance t hydraulic conductivity k transmissivity tr and porosity ϕ these parameters are estimated and their results displayed in table 2 aquifer resistivity varies between 1 92 and 16 26 kωm with a mean value of 9 16 kωm the large difference in the range of aquifer resistivity may be attributed to the heterogeneity of the subsurface layer and the compact nature of the study area the contour map fig 5 shows that the resistivity has its lowest values in the northwest of the study area with high values observed in the northeast of the study area the implication of this is that areas with low resistivity contain geo conductive materials such as clayey sediments while the high resistivity in some other areas may be due to the highly resistive earth materials the values of aquifer thickness range from 47 4 to 128 0 m with an average value of 60 71 m fig 6 shows the spread of aquifer thickness across the study area it is seen from the contour map that aquifer thickness is highest in the central part of the study area since aquifer thickness is proportional to the quantity of groundwater in an aquifer the implication is that the central part of the study area may likely have substantial quantity of groundwater stored compared to other parts it will be interesting to know that ngwo adada ves 1 is the location of the mysteriously dry up surface water with its aquifer thickness of 128 0 m it could be inferred that there is every possibility of prolific aquifer in this location the calculated hydraulic conductivity k values vary from 0 045593 to 0 427763 m day with a mean value of 0 142405 m day the contour map fig 7 shows that the central part and the northeast have high values of hydraulic conductivity the variation in hydraulic conductivity across the study area may be attributed to the pore geometry as well as fluid viscosity and density the values of transverse resistance of the study area ranged from 114 924 ωm2 to 1 240 513 ωm2 with a mean value of 678 198 ωm2 from the contour map fig 8 it is observed that areas in the southeast and northwest have the least values of transverse resistance and gradually increases towards the northwest and part of the souththeast given its direct proportionality to the aquifer resistivity it can also be used to predict the presence of groundwater this implies that increase in resistivity will lead to a corresponding increase in transverse resistance the transmissivity values of the study area range from 2 1611 to 54 7538 m2 day with an average value of 12 2795m2 day it could be inferred that ibagwa aka generally have low groundwater potential except at ves 1 ngwo adada the location of the mysteriously dry up surface water which has moderate groundwater potential the contour map fig 9 shows that low transmissivity is dominant in the southeast and northwest but the highest transmissivity is observed in the central part of the study area which shows moderate transmissivity hence indicating moderate groundwater potential it is observed that the variation is in the same trend as the hydraulic conductivity thickness and porosity which shows transmissivity of aquifer transmissivity is influence by these parameters porosity shows values ranging from 11 6040 to 21 6787 and an average value of 12 2795 this indicates the presence of consolidated sediments like sandstone and unconsolidated sediments like sand and gravels it is observed from the contour map fig 10 that porosity is highest in the central and also in the northeastern part of the study area it could be inferred that porosity influence the aquifer transmissivity the grain sizes shapes the degree of sorting and degree of cementation are factors which may like affect the variation of porosity in the study area since these factors control aquifer porosity george et al 2015b ibuot et al 2019 groundwater vulnerability was estimated by two major geoelectric parameters viz aquifer resistivity and thickness contaminants reduce the resistivity of groundwater since the infiltrated contaminants affects the electrical properties of the subsurface rocks and increases it electrical conductivity obiora et al 2015 it can therefore be inferred that areas with very low aquifer resistivity values are likely to have contaminated groundwater the longitudinal conductance shows values ranging from 0 002916ω 1 to 0 30097ω 1 with a mean value of 0 018703ω 1 the generally low longitudinal conductance indicates that the aquifer repositories in the study area are susceptible to contamination from different pollution sources which includes leakage from septic tank improper use and disposal of pesticides and herbicides used in farmlands and refuse dumps infiltration from pit toilets is not exempted the contour map fig 11 shows that areas in the western and southern have low values of longitudinal conductance while the northeastern region has high value of longitudinal conductance it may be inferred that the regions with low longitudinal conductance are vulnerable to contamination from surface contaminants which may likely affect the groundwater repositories the results is an indication that aquifer geohydraulic parameters can be estimated with simplicity and less cost by employing surface resistivity data in the study area and could also be use in other areas with similar geologic characteriustics 4 conclusion the study was carried out to investigate the groundwater potential and protective capacity of ibagwa aka in igbo eze south lga of enugu state nigeria vertical electrical sounding applying the schlumberger electrode configuration was employed the results show that the groundwater potential is moderate it is important to point out that the northwest area of ibagwa aka shows exceptional indication of a high groundwater potential which is the location of the mysterious dry up river the protective capacity of the aquifer is generally low the aquifer in the western region have higher chances of being contaminated this raises concerns and recommendation for the inhabitants to imbibe on proper waste management and also minimize the use of artificial fertilizers in their farmlands as the chemicals can percolate and contaminate the groundwater the inhabitants should be encouraged to desist from digging and using of pit toilets the results through the estimated parameters have revealed the true nature of the subsurface aquifer repositories and the information can be used for groundwater development and management in ibagwa aka and also in areas where there is no or limited

the groundwater quality for irrigation purposes by single value using the iwqi it was ascertained that the groundwater from confined aquifer had better irrigation properties than the groundwater from unconfined aquifer geo statistical analysis of the iwqi showed that the spatial distribution of the groundwater in masis province was divided into 3 zones class i class ii and class iii in masis province the main type of the unconfined aquifer groundwater belonged to the class ii which is characterized as good and of the confined aquifer groundwater to the class i which is characterized as excellent the unconfined aquifer groundwater with the worst irrigation properties is located by small areas in the southeast part of the province and the confined aquifer groundwater of such quality in the southwest part of the studied territory the long term irrigation by such groundwater and the neglect of implementation of soil quality improvement measures can lead to negative changes in the soil therefore in order to avoid soil degradation suitable preventive measures are needed graphical abstract image 1 capsule using the irrigation water quality index iwqi it was ascertained that in masis province of armenia the groundwater from confined aquifer had better irrigation properties than the groundwater from unconfined aquifer keywords groundwater quality irrigation hydrochemical indices geo statistical analysis iwqi armenia 1 introduction groundwater is an important source of irrigation water in many parts of the world and in the masis province of armenia as well the enlargement of agricultural lands that are used to provide food for the growing population highly depends on the availability of irrigation water to satisfy the demand of irrigation water thousands of wells in the arid and semiarid regions have been constructed by farmers however in this issue not only the availability of groundwater is important but also its sufficient quality to use for irrigation purposes in case of insufficient quality of groundwater changes in the physical and chemical structure of soil can be observed which may have a significant influence on crop yield simsek and gunduz 2007 the irrigation water quality has a huge influence on soil salinization process global total area of the salt affected soils is about 950 million hectares accounting for 7 26 of the earth s land area wang et al 1993 the area of salt affected soils is about 30000 ha in armenia the main part of which is distributed in the ararat plain the soils in ararat plain are more affected to salinization since all natural climatic conditions such as dry and hot summers poor precipitations high level of groundwater etc contributing to salinization are available there furthermore the anthropogenic activities namely the implementation of farm works by traditional methods intensify the soil salinization process groundwater quality in turn depends on various factors such as general geology the degree of mineral weathering ion exchanges evaporation groundwater flow and various human activities al shaibani 2008 appelo and postma 2010 chidambaram et al 2011 domenico 1972 hussein 2004 kumar et al 2006 prasanna et al 2011 schuh et al 1997 consequently the groundwater from different horizons may have different qualities and different irrigation properties the monitoring of groundwater quality is a significant tool that promotes the sustainable development of agricultural regions and provides important data for water management many researchers offer the hydrochemical indices such as sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage na magnesium hazard mh residual sodium carbonate rsc and permeability index pi to describe the quality of groundwater and the practical sides of this water for agriculture nonetheless good outcomes can be received by analyzing the chemistry of all ions rather than the groundwater single parameters hem 1985 more effective solution for this issue is the irrigation water quality index iwqi which combines numerous indicators and expresses the quality of groundwater in the form of one value bozdag 2015 meireles et al 2010 saeedi et al 2010 stambuck giljanovic 1999 in various studies the different ways for the calculation of iwqi were elaborated taking into account the same hydrophysical and hydrochemical characteristics but with different methods of statistical analysis and interpretation of parameter values amiri et al 2014 brindha and kavitha 2015 also the significant requirement for undertaking the groundwater quality evaluation is a map creation by identifying the regions where the groundwater is not sufficient for irrigation such maps are the useful tools for the spatial distribution of the indices of groundwater quality evaluation and for the development of a comparative assessment map as well the combination of gis and geo statistical analysis makes an important tool for the study of environmental geochemistry ella et al 2001 kumar and ahmed 2003 liu et al 2009 lu et al 2007 uyan and cay 2010 all above mentioned is becoming an important part of groundwater management strategy now taking into account all these circumstances the main objectives of our study were the assessment of masis province s groundwater quality from different depths for irrigation purpose the introduction of iwqi use as the method of groundwater quality monitoring and the mapping of groundwater quality based on geo statistical analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the masis province is located in the central part of ararat plain stretching from east to west and has an area of 182 2 km2 that makes up to 0 61 of the area of armenia fig 1 it is considered as one of the most important agricultural areas of armenia the average height of the province is 800 m and it has a flat topography the semi desert landscape prevails in the study area the climate is dry continental the annual precipitation is 200 300 mm the average temperature in july is 22 26 c in january from 5 c to 6 c the amount of clear days ranges mostly from 131 to 140 vardanyan and shahumyan 2008 about 64 of precipitation falls in spring and autumn and only 18 in summer such scarce summer rainfall goes with the highest air temperature in this province due to arid condition of the land the irrigation of arable lands is required the irrigation is performed by either groundwater or water of hrazdan river for irrigation of agricultural lands both the groundwater from unconfined aquifer the depth of which reaches to 60 m and the groundwater from confined aquifer with the depth of 80 m and more are used the groundwater from unconfined aquifer is not pressurized it does not rise to the earth surface by self flowing and farmers use small pumps for the irrigation of their small homestead lands contrastingly the groundwater from confined aquifer is pressurized it rises in general by self flowing up to the earth surface and is used for the irrigation of larger agricultural areas according to studies the withdrawal of groundwater for irrigation from confined aquifer horizon constitutes 11 9 m3 s achoyan and hakobyan 2017 the irrigation starts in march and ends in november and the most intense irrigation is performed in the period from june to august all this creates favorable conditions for photophilous and thermophilous crops in masis province the vegetable crops are mostly cultivated the masis province is a region where natural salinity accumulation process occurred in soils of some areas due to their geological and climatic characteristics soil salinization process caused both by natural geological climatic and anthropogenic poor quality of irrigation water disturbance of irrigation methods and norms factors is one of the most important environmental issues in masis province as the environmental conditions and sustainable agriculture development in this province are seriously violated 2 2 sampling and laboratory measurements for the study of the groundwater of masis province 27 monitoring wells approximately uniformly apportioned throughout the study area were previously selected from all monitoring wells 15 had the depths up to 60 m and were intended for withdrawal of groundwater from unconfined aquifer while 12 wells with the depths more than 80 m were used for the extraction of groundwater from confined aquifer the groundwater samples were collected monthly during the period from march to november 2019 and 243 samples on the whole were taken during the study period during the selection of monitoring wells their even spatial distribution as well as the intensity of groundwater use and the density of existing wells in the given part of the whole study area were taken into consideration an equal number of samples were taken from all monitoring wells from each well 1 sample monthly and 9 samples in total after the sampling they were air proofed momentarily and sent to the laboratory for future analysis within 2 days the electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were determined by the conductivity meter маrк 603 the contents of k na ca2 mg2 and cl were measured by laboratory ionometer i 160 м hco3 and co3 2 were measured by the acid titration method the values of ph by the ph meter after the research from the data obtained during the three months of each season spring summer autumn the average seasonal values of all studied indicators were calculated 2 3 data processing and methods of hydrochemical classification for assessing the suitability of the groundwater for irrigation purposes we used the computational and graphical methods the first group of evaluations includes the determination of the following indices sar na rsc mh pi and some hydrochemical parameters of the groundwater such as ec ph and cl the classification of the groundwater for irrigation purposes based on these computational methods is presented in table 1 the second group includes methods that can give the graphical representations of groundwater suitability for irrigation purposes united states salinity laboratory ussl and wilcox plots 2 4 generation of iwqi for the combined assessment of the quality of groundwater for irrigation purposes we used the iwqi during the processing of this method we rely on the evaluation criteria dated in fao paper no 29 ayers and westcot 1994 as well as we took into consideration the specific characters of the area studied the excellence of the iwqi is that the varied quality indicators of the groundwater are generalized through it and represented by a single value value of iwqi can change from 0 to 100 table 1 during the computation of the iwqi four main groups of factors were taken into account which had harmful effect on soil quality and crop yield the succession of them according to their importance is 1 influencing the soil salinity 2 influencing the soil infiltration character 3 toxic ions 4 influencing the plants by different ways table 2 for every group the weighting factor wf was defined the aim of which was to show the comparative importance of each group and to clarify the interconnections between the different groups the wf of each group was calculated by equation 1 1 w f i 1 k i i 1 n 1 k i the k i is a temporary weight value of each group that varied from 1 highly important to 5 less important for calculation of iwqi equation 2 was used 2 i w q i i 1 n w f i i 1 m q r i m where iwqi is the irrigation water quality index wf i is the n th group s weighting factor qr i is the quality rating of n th group s m th parameter m is the quantity of parameters in n th group 2 5 geo statistical analysis and mapping for the interpolation and formation of thematic maps arcgis 10 4 and geo statistical analyst wizard were used particularly the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method was used the idw method is one of the most commonly used geo statistical and mathematical interpolation techniques that is applied to predict the target parameters in the field of hydrology science idw uses the assumption that the objects situated closer to each other resemble to a greater extent than the remote objects in order to find the value in one or another point the idw method uses the points of reference located in the neighborhood of the desired point the idw method assumes that each point of reference exerts local influence that decreases along with the decrease of distance to the points located in the neighborhood of the desired point the greater weight values are assigned than to the remote points the idw is calculated by the following equation 3 ž s 0 i 1 n λ i z s i where ž s 0 is the desired value for point s 0 λ i are the weights assigned to each point of reference from amongst the points that will be used during the calculation these weights decrease along with the decrease of the distance z s i is the measured value in the point s i n is the number of points of reference located in the neighborhood of desired point and used in calculations the weights are determined by the following equation 4 λ i d i 0 p i 1 n d i 0 p where d i0 is the distance between the desired point s 0 and the point of reference s i the weight decreases along with the increase of the distance at the expense of coefficient р the p parameter of degree has an influence on designation of weights to the points of reference that is the more the distance between the points of reference and the desired point increases the more the influence or the weight that the point of reference will exert on the desired point decreases exponentially the sum of the weights of reference points that will be used during the interpolation should be equal to 1 5 i 1 n λ i 1 3 results 3 1 statistical summary of hydrochemical parameters of groundwater from different horizons the statistical summary of the average seasonal values of some hydrochemical parameters of the groundwater is given in tables 3 and 4 the values of ph of the groundwater from unconfined aquifer and confined aquifer in masis province in different seasons varied between 6 4 7 0 and 6 6 7 2 accordingly which means that the groundwater system of province had chemical reaction from subacid to weakly alkaline according to averaged data the largest value of ph of groundwater from unconfined was observed in summer while in case of groundwater from confined aquifer the slight decrease of ph value was registered during the vegetation period according to ph evaluation scale of ayers and westcot 1994 the groundwater from both horizons mostly belong to the class ii and such groundwater can be used for irrigation with moderate restriction table 1 specifically it is necessary to conduct intermittently a monitoring of ph of soils irrigated by this groundwater and in case of ph decrease to apply lime for the correction of low ph ayers and westcot 1994 the spatial distribution of ph is shown in figs 2 and 3 geo statistical analysis by the idw method shows that class i groundwater from unconfined aquifer according to ph value is located in the central part of masis province and class ii groundwater is distributed in other parts of the province as can be seen from fig 3 class iii groundwater from confined aquifer occurs only in the southern part of masis province the ec was determined as one of the important hydrochemical parameters of the quality of groundwater used for irrigation the values of ec of groundwater from unconfined aquifer ranged in different seasons from 1108 to 5096 μs cm 1 and the ec values of groundwater from confined aquifer ranged from 618 to 3274 μs cm 1 tables 3 and 4 the average ec values of the groundwater from all monitoring wells in the studied 9 months march november are presented in tables 6 and 7 based on the scale of wilcox 1955 according to ec value the studied groundwater from unconfined aquifer belonged to the following categories 60 of wells belonged to the permissible category and 40 of wells belonged to the doubtful category the groundwater from confined aquifer belonged to the following categories 16 7 of wells belonged to the good category 58 3 of wells belonged to the permissible category and 25 of wells belonged to the doubtful category the great range in the values of electrical conductivity is essentially specified by geochemical processes and human activities in particular exorbitant use of groundwater for irrigation and fish farming purposes application of mineral fertilizers etc dominating in masis province the spatial variation of ec values showed that according to this indicator the worst quality groundwater from unconfined aquifer is located in the southeast part of masis province and the worst quality groundwater from confined aquifer is situated in the southwest part of mentioned province figs 4 and 5 the value of tds depends on dissolved solids inorganic salts and small quantity of organic substances in water tds in the groundwater from unconfined aquifer of studied province varied in different seasons in the range of 742 3558 mg l and tds values of groundwater from confined aquifer in the range of 405 2279 mg l in groundwater from both horizons the average minimal value seasonably was observed in spring that was conditioned by the aquifer water supply peculiarities melt waters and abundant rainfall the high tds increases the osmotic potential in the soil which complicates the water absorption by plants na is the second widely spread cation its content in groundwater mainly depends on cation exchange and human impact the source of sodium ion in the groundwater is due to the feldspar weathering and groundwater overexploitation as well the values of na in groundwater from unconfined aquifer in different seasons ranged from 82 5 to 400 mg l and from confined aquifer it ranged from 53 3 to 312 mg l the average value in the 15 unconfined aquifer wells was 218 98 mg l in the spring 186 51 mg l in the summer 180 73 mg l in the autumn and in the 12 confined aquifer wells 138 98 mg l 123 34 mg l and 118 21 mg l respectively tables 3 and 4 the higher concentration of na was observed during the spring when compared with summer and autumn indicating the dominance of groundwater feeding from precipitation and melt waters as well as the leaching from upper layers of soil the values of mg2 and ca2 in groundwater from unconfined aquifer in different seasons ranged from 58 3 to 322 8 and 54 5 325 mg l accordingly while in groundwater from confined aquifer from 38 to 224 3 and from 38 4 to 189 mg l the concentration of potassium in groundwater mainly increases from two sources geochemical weathering of potash silicate minerals and various human activities use of wastewater and surface water for irrigation application of potash fertilizers over regulated usage k in different seasons ranged from 1 94 to 34 mg l and the mean values in the masis province groundwater from unconfined aquifer and confined aquifer were 13 74 and 8 43 mg l in the spring 21 and 5 91 mg l in the summer 13 78 and 7 07 mg l in the autumn respectively the minimal content of k in both aquifers was observed in the summer and on the whole the content of k in the confined aquifer was less than in the unconfined aquifer that was conditioned by feeding peculiarities of horizons of the first aquifer in particular in confined aquifer the soil leaching process during irrigation and precipitation is feebly marked the weathering of silicate minerals and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and the soil were the main sources of co3 2 and hco3 which in turn contribute the dissolution of other minerals jeong 2001 in the samples of studied groundwater the co3 2 was not found out the amount of hco3 in the groundwater from unconfined aquifer during the study period varied from 302 1 to 665 5 mg l and in the groundwater from confined aquifer from 151 8 to 598 9 mg l cl ion may have the toxicity effect depending on its concentration in the irrigation water and the sensitivity of agricultural crops concentrations of cl in the groundwater from both aquifers of masis province ranged from 60 3 to 757 mg l in different seasons based on the doneen s 1958 classification according to mean annual value of cl the assessment of irrigation properties of groundwater from all wells of different aquifers was carried out as well as the thematic maps were generated by the idw interpolation method figs 6 and 7 according to mentioned classification 53 34 of wells from unconfined aquifer belonged to the class i 33 33 belonged to the class ii 13 33 belonged to the class iii and 75 of wells from confined aquifer belonged to the class i and 25 belonged to the class iii as seen in figures the worst quality groundwater from unconfined aquifer is distributed in the southeastern parts of masis province while such quality groundwater from confined aquifer is located in the southwestern parts it should be mentioned that the groundwater of class iii could have potential toxic effects on crops in studied both horizons of groundwater mg2 was the main dominant cation while hco3 and cl were the main dominant anions in groundwater from unconfined and confined aquifers respectively the allocation character of studied anions and cations in the groundwater from unconfined aquifer of masis province according to the average values of all studied periods meq l was as hco3 cl co3 2 and mg2 na ca2 k accordingly and in the case of groundwater from confined aquifer cl hco3 co3 2 and mg2 na ca2 k 3 2 matrix of correlation the correlation between hydrochemical parameters could be determined by correlation analysis the correlation coefficient of pearson s rank is expressed by ρ the value of which is continuously from 1 0 to 1 0 a positive ρ matches to an increasing monotonic trend between two water quality parameters whereas a negative ρ matches to a decreasing monotonic trend among two parameters of water quality a high level correlation coefficient nearby 1 0 or 1 0 means an effective relationship among two variables if the value is nearby zero it aims no relationship between them srivastava and ramanathan 2008 pearson s rank coefficient of correlation between nine parameters of groundwater quality ph ec tds hco3 cl ca2 mg2 na k iwqi and depth of wells were calculated correlation analysis was done for the average values of hydrochemical parameters of the groundwater from 27 wells for the period from march to november the correlation analysis was carried out for the studied 27 wells to determine whether the changes of the main hydrochemical parameters of water quality have identical trend or not in all wells during the entire study period and if these changes have certain dependence from the depth of wells correlation matrix is given in table 5 the positive correlation was observed between all hydrochemical parameters except between ph and cl in all wells ph showed low positive correlation with almost all parameters and k had the low or moderate correlation all the other hydrochemical parameters ec tds cl ca2 mg2 na had the strong correlation together except ca2 and mg2 with anions in case of which the moderate correlation 0 7 r 0 5 was observed such correlations obviously identified the contribution of major ions to groundwater salinity also these ions had similar tendency to increase or decrease that related with geochemical and human factors mineral weathering ion exchanges water rock interaction irrigation leaching use of fertilizer etc the strong positive correlation between the main exchangeable ions magnesium calcium sodium magnesium shows that the similar decline and rise of these ions is the result of precipitation dissolution reactions and the effect of concentration the negative correlation was observed between iwqi and all hydrochemical parameters this means that the increasing of the values of these hydrochemical parameters results in deterioration of irrigation water quality in particular the ec tds and na have the greatest negative influence on it from the correlation analysis it was also found that along with the increase of the depths of wells the decrease of values of all hydrochemical parameters and vice versa the certain increase in iwqi values were observed and consequently the improvement of groundwater irrigation properties 4 discussion 4 1 sodium adsorption ratio sar sar values indicate the degree when groundwater goes into cation exchange reactions in soil sar is one of the most considerable quality characteristics of the groundwater used for irrigation purposes sar shows the sodium hazard of the groundwater that is defined by the comparative and absolute concentrations of the main cations khodapanah et al 2009 subba rao 2006 subramani et al 2005 if the value of sar is high then the sodium supersedes changing magnesium and calcium harms structure of the soil by making it dense and impermeable todd 1980 consequently the estimation of sodium amount in the groundwater is necessary when taking into account the irrigation suitability the value of sar was determined using equation 6 richards 1954 6 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 where given concentrations of cations were expressed in meq l the groundwater classification by sar is presented in table 1 in tables 6 and 7 the average sar values of groundwater of monitoring wells from different horizons for the whole study period are given according to the scale of richards 1954 all studied groundwater belongs to the excellent category as can be seen from the comparative analysis of groundwater from two horizons a slight deterioration of the quality of unconfined aquifer groundwater according to sar value was observed richards 1954 offered ussl diagram for evaluating the quality of groundwater used for irrigation where two important indicators were taken into account sar and ec based on this approach the groundwater can be categorized in 4 groups by sodium hazard s1 s2 s3 s4 and salinity hazard c1 c2 c3 c4 these two important parameters indicated the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes ussl diagrams of 27 wells groundwater of masis province are shown in figs 8a and 9 a the data of analysis of ussl diagrams showed that the 60 wells groundwater from unconfined aquifer fell in the field of c3 s1 big salinity and low alkalinity hazard and this groundwater is applicable for irrigation use on nearly all types of soil with low hazard of exchangeable na nevertheless the special management to control the salinity is needed the groundwater samples of 20 wells from unconfined aquifer fell in the field of c4 s1 very high salinity and low alkalinity hazard the samples of 20 wells fell in the field of c4 s2 very high salinity and medium alkalinity hazard this groundwater can lead to accumulation of salts in the upper horizons of soils the process of soil salinization depends on both climatic conditions little rainfall and high potential evaporation and soil hydraulic properties conditioned by its texture in arable lands of masis province compared to the residential lands orchards and grasslands the content of sand is lower and on the contrary the content of silt and clay is rather high clay clay loam and silty clay texture classes of soil are mainly found there which may promote the water capillary rise and the accumulation of salts in the upper horizons of soils huang et al 2013 the method of irrigation also affects the process of soil salinization marlet et al 2009 rhoades et al 1992 in masis province the flood method of irrigation was implemented which had lower efficiency in comparison with the drip irrigation and summoned the rise of the groundwater level as it is shown in fig 9a the groundwater from confined aquifer has better quality that is 16 7 wells groundwater fell in the field of c2 s1 medium salinity and low alkalinity hazard samples of 58 3 wells fell in the field of c3 s1 big salinity and low alkalinity hazard and samples of 25 wells fell in the field of c4 s1 very high salinity and low alkalinity hazard summarizing it is fair to say that the groundwater from confined aquifer is less dangerous for the use in irrigation purposes than the groundwater from unconfined aquifer the long term irrigation with water of medium alkalinity hazard can lead to the development of an alkaline soil soil on drying becomes compact and hard and the infiltration of water decreases nishanthiny et al 2010 thus the physical structure of soil will degrade and the agricultural plant growth will be suppressed 4 2 sodium percentage na the sodium percentage is the second significant factor for the characterization of na hazard as well as for the assessment of the groundwater quality for irrigation purposes in case of high amount of na the irrigation water will raise the content of exchangeable sodium in the soil deteriorate infiltration rate and texture of the soil and suppress the plant growth varol and davraz 2015 na amount was calculated by equation 7 wilcox 1955 7 n a n a k 100 c a 2 m g 2 n a k where the concentrations of cations were reported in meq l the groundwater classification by na is presented in table 1 the values of na in masis province s groundwater from unconfined aquifer varied from 12 86 to 40 89 with an average value of 30 37 table 6 and the values of na of groundwater from confined aquifer varied from 20 76 to 36 74 with an average value of 29 03 table 7 the quality of unconfined aquifer groundwater from 6 7 of wells was in a permissible category it may have some negative influence on soil permeability and texture from other 6 7 of wells in excellent category for irrigation purposes and from the rest 86 6 of wells was in a good category for irrigation purposes all samples of groundwater from confined aquifer were also in a good category for irrigation purposes the results of geo statistical analysis are presented in figs 10 and 11 they indicate that according to na index the best quality groundwater from unconfined aquifer is located in the western and northeastern parts of masis province wilcox 1955 offered graphical method for evaluating the quality of groundwater used for irrigation where two important indicators such as na and ec were taken into account wilcox diagram shows that the unconfined aquifer groundwater from 8 wells falls under good to permissible category the groundwater from 3 wells falls under doubtful to unsuitable category and the groundwater from 4 wells falls under unsuitable category fig 8b it should be noted that all wells with poor quality groundwater are located in the eastern part of masis province in case of confined aquifer the groundwater of 2 wells falls under excellent to good category the groundwater of 7 wells falls under good to permissible category the groundwater of 3 wells falls under doubtful to unsuitable category and the groundwater of 1 well falls under unsuitable category fig 9b the sampling points with bad quality groundwater are located in the south east of masis province poor quality of groundwater in some areas may be caused by both natural climate and geological characteristics of the region and anthropogenic particularly large scale agricultural activities processes 4 3 magnesium hazard mh mg2 and ca2 are necessary cations for the growth of a plant but a high quantity of magnesium has negative influence on the structure of soil and may reduce the crop yield kumar et al 2007 paliwal 1972 szabolcs and darab 1964 offered the mh for evaluating the quality of groundwater used for irrigation mh was calculated by the following equation 8 m h m g 2 m g 2 c a 2 100 where the concentrations of cations were expressed in meq l the groundwater classification by mh is given in table 1 as shown in the table if the value of mh of the groundwater is less than 50 this groundwater is suitable for irrigation and if the value of the mentioned index is more than 50 the groundwater is not suitable for irrigation the studies showed that in all cases the values of mh have exceeded 50 the average values of mh in masis province groundwater from unconfined aquifer and from confined aquifer were 64 23 and 65 86 respectively tables 6 and 7 in other words according to this index the masis province s groundwater is mostly unsuitable for irrigation use and can have an adverse effect on crop yield and increase the alkalinity of the soil 4 4 residual sodium content rsc richards 1954 has defined the co3 2 and hco3 negative effect on water quality which is expressed through the rsc if the concentration of bicarbonate and carbonate is higher than that of calcium and magnesium it will have an influence on suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes in case of high rsc value the increase of ph value of groundwater was observed as well as the agricultural area irrigated with such groundwater was turned to barren due to deposition of na2co3 fine et al 1959 the value of rsc was determined by the use of equation 9 9 rsc co3 2 hco3 ca2 mg2 concentrations of all ions were reported in meq l the classification of groundwater quality by rsc values is given in table 1 our studies showed that in groundwater of masis province the rsc value was less than 1 25 thus according to this index the groundwater is safe and na2co3 will not be accumulated in the soil irrigated by these waters tables 6 and 7 4 5 permeability index pi poor quality of groundwater for irrigation can have a negative impact on soil permeability such effect on soil is caused mainly by the content of na mg2 ca2 and hco3 ions in irrigation water doneen 1964 has developed a principle for evaluating the quality of the groundwater for irrigation purposes based on pi this index was calculated by the following equation 10 p i n a h c o 3 c a 2 m g 2 n a 100 where the concentrations of cations and the anion were expressed in meq l the water quality evaluation criteria depending on pi are shown in table 1 pi in unconfined aquifer wells of masis province ranged between 20 84 and 51 53 with an average value of 39 86 table 6 and in confined aquifer wells ranged between 33 72 and 51 89 with a mean value of 42 18 table 7 the groundwater from unconfined and confined aquifers of masis province mainly fell within the class ii and was suitable for irrigation according to doneen 1964 classification and only the groundwater of one well from unconfined aquifer fell within the class iii and was unsuitable for irrigation the spatial distribution of pi is shown in figs 12 and 13 and as can be seen in the maps the groundwater of poor quality is located in the western part of masis province 4 6 main geochemical factors influencing the groundwater chemistry the chemistry of the groundwater in masis province depends on various processes and factors for understanding these geochemical processes we used the gibbs 1970 diagram the interaction between aquifer minerals and groundwater has significant influence on groundwater quality and is very helpful in understanding the origin of water mineralization gibbs considered three natural processes influencing the groundwater chemistry they are rock dominance evaporation crystallization and precipitation processes feth and gibbs 1971 gibbs 1970 gibbs diagram is plotted by dependence of some anions and cations on tds figs 14 and 15 gibbs diagram showed that among the processes determining the unconfined aquifer groundwater chemistry the rock dominance made up to 66 7 and evaporation crystallization dominance 33 3 and for confined aquifer groundwater chemistry the rock dominance consists 75 and evaporation crystallization dominance 25 in these two horizons the evaporation crystallization process has a relatively higher impact on groundwater chemistry of unconfined aquifer that is conditioned by the feeding peculiarities of mentioned two aquifers specifically the unconfined aquifer is mainly fed by precipitations and surface flows of ararat plain while confined aquifer is fed by depth streams formed in several river basins of armenia notably of the akhurian kasagh and azat rivers from the spatial distribution of obtained data on diagrams is seen that rock dominance and evaporation crystallization process have approximately uniform impact on unconfined aquifer groundwater chemistry this is caused by climatic characteristics of masis province high potential evaporation and low precipitation water and moisture evaporation from the upper soil layer leads to the accumulation and deposition of salts that ultimately leach into the groundwater the long term agricultural activities leading to erosion and weathering of soil also increases the mineralization of groundwater this process is also typical for the other arid and semiarid zones and leads to the increasing of the concentration of salts in groundwater richter and kreitler 1993 human impact irrigation return flows irrigation in excess of the planned rates massive loss of irrigation water use of fertilizers and pesticides may also be the related factor which finally leads to the increase of ions in groundwater caused by evaporation the process of rock dominance has more expressed influence on confined aquifer groundwater chemistry that is explained by the peculiarities of feeding of the given aquifer groundwater when the pressure of groundwater in aquifer is high it is not being fed from the groundwater located in the higher horizons but when the pressure decreases the aquifer is fed on such groundwater consequently this groundwater may have an impact on confined aquifer groundwater chemistry 4 7 irrigation water quality index iwqi one of the greatest problems with which the agricultural workers are permanently confronted is how to analyze various groundwater quality data that describe irrigation suitability and how to choose the optimal irrigation methods and norms the good solution for this issue could be the iwqi which is a properly calculated aggregated index of water quality in a wide range of complex data and may give a clear description of the groundwater quality for irrigation purpose by one value in table 2 the groundwater suitability scheme by iwqi is proposed the groundwater classification by iwqi is presented in table 1 in the whole study period the average iwqi values in different unconfined aquifer wells ranged from 46 30 to 83 45 with a mean value of 71 50 table 6 and in confined aquifer wells ranged from 56 88 to 88 40 with a mean value of 77 78 table 7 according to the iwqi scheme the groundwater from unconfined aquifer of masis province fell in the following categories 13 3 of wells belonged to class i 73 4 of wells belonged to class ii 13 3 of wells belonged to class iii and in case of groundwater from confined aquifer 58 4 of wells belonged to class i 33 3 of wells belonged to class ii 8 3 of wells belonged to class iii it should be noted that almost in all unconfined aquifer wells from indices of all four groups the indices of the first and the second groups of factors influencing the soil salinity and the soil infiltration properties decreased the most from their maximal values by about 30 and these factors were the main cause for the decline of the iwqi the situation was other in the case of confined aquifer wells the indices of the fourth group of factors exerting miscellaneous effects on soil decreased the most from their maximal values by about 33 but since the wf of the fourth group was low it did not have considerable negative influence on irrigation water quality furthermore despite the fact that the indices of the first group of factors decreased the less from their maximal values by about 16 it had significant negative influence on irrigation water quality due to high value of wf the second group of factors influencing infiltration properties of soil also had great impact on water quality deterioration the indices of this group decreased from their maximal values by about 29 on the average the long usage of the class iii water will undoubtedly have the negative influence on qualitative properties of soil thereby for the maintenance of the salt balance in the soil and for the preservation of crop yields in masis province a good drainage is required according to some researchers the subsurface drainage is much effective for desalination of salty soils and the process of salt leaching may begin immediately after it bahceci and nacar 2008 correlation analysis between the iwqi and hydrochemical parameters of irrigation water showed that the increasing of ec tds and na values had more negative impact on quality of irrigation water than the other parameters table 5 the spatial variation of iwqi determined by idw interpolation method is presented in figs 16 and 17 geo statistical analysis showed that in masis province according to the complex qualitative index the spatial distribution of the groundwater from unconfined and confined aquifers was divided into 3 zones as can be seen from the maps the excellent quality groundwater from unconfined aquifer is located mainly in the northwest of the province whereas such quality groundwater from confined aquifer is located mainly in the central part and in the small area of the western part of masis province as can be seen from figures the area occupied by the excellent quality groundwater from confined aquifer is incomparably larger than that occupied by such groundwater from unconfined aquifer the groundwater belonging to class iii takes up only a small area in masis province and for its use for the irrigation it is necessary to implement certain preventive measures implementation of more effective methods of irrigation a good leaching regime drainage in order to avoid the secondary salinization of the soils of masis province it should be noted that the deterioration of groundwater quality is conditioned by climatic peculiarities scanty precipitation intensive evaporation hydrogeological composition of studied area as well as by high farming activities and improper farm operations nevertheless the involvement of local farmers in the activities against salinization is also very important for the attainment of the best results as they may become the key initiators of technical solutions of their environmental problems thus through the iwqi method it was possible to give the assessment of the quality of groundwater of masis province for irrigation purposes by single value avoiding various values that are derived from the evaluation by traditional single index methods 5 conclusion the groundwater quality from different aquifers of masis province was studied to comprehend its suitability for the irrigation purposes for this issue various hydrochemical parameters of the groundwater were studied the distribution character of ions in the groundwater from unconfined aquifer of masis province according to the mean values of the whole studied period was as mg2 na ca2 hco3 cl k co3 2 meq l and in the groundwater from confined aquifer mg2 cl hco3 na ca2 k co3 2 correlation analysis showed that there was a strong correlation between the following hydrochemical parameters ec tds cl ca2 mg2 and na except ca2 and mg2 with anions for the identification of geochemical processes influencing the groundwater chemistry the gibbs diagram was used and the studies showed that the rock dominance was a key process determining the groundwater chemistry the suitability of the groundwater of masis province for irrigation was evaluated by computational sar na mh rsc pi and some hydrochemical parameters ec ph cl and graphical ussl and wilcox plots methods some of the obtained data were also subjected to geo statistical analysis by idw interpolation method and the thematic maps were generated to show their spatial variation the groundwater suitability for irrigation purpose by different hydrochemical indices varied from excellent to unsuitable categories in order to avoid such variety of data iwqi method was used and the various quality indicators of the groundwater were generalized and represented by single value based on the iwqi it was ascertained that the groundwater from confined aquifer had better irrigation properties than the groundwater from unconfined aquifer geo statistical analysis idw interpolation method of the iwqi showed that the spatial distribution of the groundwater in masis province was divided into 3 zones class i class ii and class iii in masis province the main type of the unconfined aquifer groundwater belonged to the class ii which is characterized as good and of the confined aquifer groundwater to the class i which is characterized as excellent the unconfined aquifer groundwater with the worst irrigation properties is located by small areas in the southeast part of the province and the confined aquifer groundwater of such quality in the southwest part of the studied territory the long term irrigation by such groundwater and the neglect of implementation of soil quality improvement measures can lead to negative changes in the soil which in turn will disturb the environmental conditions of masis province and impede the sustainable agricultural development in this region taking all this into consideration the continuous monitoring of the groundwater the control of salinity by appropriate management the implementation of more effective methods of irrigation a good leaching regime the maintenance of the low level of groundwater as well as the awareness of agricultural workers are required in order to decrease the degradation process of soils in masis province credit authorship

12099,groundwater is a significant source of irrigation water in masis province of armenia in this sense not only the availability of groundwater is important but also its appropriate quality for the study 243 groundwater samples were collected from 27 monitoring wells during march november 2019 and different hydrochemical parameters were analyzed the assessment of suitability of the groundwater for irrigation purposes was implemented by hydrochemical parameters ph ec and cl and different indices sar na mh rsc pi as well as by graphical representations some obtained data were studied by geo statistical analysis and their spatial variation in masis province was given for the combination and summarizing of various obtained data irrigation water quality index iwqi method was used which gave the groundwater quality for irrigation purposes by single value using the iwqi it was ascertained that the groundwater from confined aquifer had better irrigation properties than the groundwater from unconfined aquifer geo statistical analysis of the iwqi showed that the spatial distribution of the groundwater in masis province was divided into 3 zones class i class ii and class iii in masis province the main type of the unconfined aquifer groundwater belonged to the class ii which is characterized as good and of the confined aquifer groundwater to the class i which is characterized as excellent the unconfined aquifer groundwater with the worst irrigation properties is located by small areas in the southeast part of the province and the confined aquifer groundwater of such quality in the southwest part of the studied territory the long term irrigation by such groundwater and the neglect of implementation of soil quality improvement measures can lead to negative changes in the soil therefore in order to avoid soil degradation suitable preventive measures are needed graphical abstract image 1 capsule using the irrigation water quality index iwqi it was ascertained that in masis province of armenia the groundwater from confined aquifer had better irrigation properties than the groundwater from unconfined aquifer keywords groundwater quality irrigation hydrochemical indices geo statistical analysis iwqi armenia 1 introduction groundwater is an important source of irrigation water in many parts of the world and in the masis province of armenia as well the enlargement of agricultural lands that are used to provide food for the growing population highly depends on the availability of irrigation water to satisfy the demand of irrigation water thousands of wells in the arid and semiarid regions have been constructed by farmers however in this issue not only the availability of groundwater is important but also its sufficient quality to use for irrigation purposes in case of insufficient quality of groundwater changes in the physical and chemical structure of soil can be observed which may have a significant influence on crop yield simsek and gunduz 2007 the irrigation water quality has a huge influence on soil salinization process global total area of the salt affected soils is about 950 million hectares accounting for 7 26 of the earth s land area wang et al 1993 the area of salt affected soils is about 30000 ha in armenia the main part of which is distributed in the ararat plain the soils in ararat plain are more affected to salinization since all natural climatic conditions such as dry and hot summers poor precipitations high level of groundwater etc contributing to salinization are available there furthermore the anthropogenic activities namely the implementation of farm works by traditional methods intensify the soil salinization process groundwater quality in turn depends on various factors such as general geology the degree of mineral weathering ion exchanges evaporation groundwater flow and various human activities al shaibani 2008 appelo and postma 2010 chidambaram et al 2011 domenico 1972 hussein 2004 kumar et al 2006 prasanna et al 2011 schuh et al 1997 consequently the groundwater from different horizons may have different qualities and different irrigation properties the monitoring of groundwater quality is a significant tool that promotes the sustainable development of agricultural regions and provides important data for water management many researchers offer the hydrochemical indices such as sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage na magnesium hazard mh residual sodium carbonate rsc and permeability index pi to describe the quality of groundwater and the practical sides of this water for agriculture nonetheless good outcomes can be received by analyzing the chemistry of all ions rather than the groundwater single parameters hem 1985 more effective solution for this issue is the irrigation water quality index iwqi which combines numerous indicators and expresses the quality of groundwater in the form of one value bozdag 2015 meireles et al 2010 saeedi et al 2010 stambuck giljanovic 1999 in various studies the different ways for the calculation of iwqi were elaborated taking into account the same hydrophysical and hydrochemical characteristics but with different methods of statistical analysis and interpretation of parameter values amiri et al 2014 brindha and kavitha 2015 also the significant requirement for undertaking the groundwater quality evaluation is a map creation by identifying the regions where the groundwater is not sufficient for irrigation such maps are the useful tools for the spatial distribution of the indices of groundwater quality evaluation and for the development of a comparative assessment map as well the combination of gis and geo statistical analysis makes an important tool for the study of environmental geochemistry ella et al 2001 kumar and ahmed 2003 liu et al 2009 lu et al 2007 uyan and cay 2010 all above mentioned is becoming an important part of groundwater management strategy now taking into account all these circumstances the main objectives of our study were the assessment of masis province s groundwater quality from different depths for irrigation purpose the introduction of iwqi use as the method of groundwater quality monitoring and the mapping of groundwater quality based on geo statistical analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the masis province is located in the central part of ararat plain stretching from east to west and has an area of 182 2 km2 that makes up to 0 61 of the area of armenia fig 1 it is considered as one of the most important agricultural areas of armenia the average height of the province is 800 m and it has a flat topography the semi desert landscape prevails in the study area the climate is dry continental the annual precipitation is 200 300 mm the average temperature in july is 22 26 c in january from 5 c to 6 c the amount of clear days ranges mostly from 131 to 140 vardanyan and shahumyan 2008 about 64 of precipitation falls in spring and autumn and only 18 in summer such scarce summer rainfall goes with the highest air temperature in this province due to arid condition of the land the irrigation of arable lands is required the irrigation is performed by either groundwater or water of hrazdan river for irrigation of agricultural lands both the groundwater from unconfined aquifer the depth of which reaches to 60 m and the groundwater from confined aquifer with the depth of 80 m and more are used the groundwater from unconfined aquifer is not pressurized it does not rise to the earth surface by self flowing and farmers use small pumps for the irrigation of their small homestead lands contrastingly the groundwater from confined aquifer is pressurized it rises in general by self flowing up to the earth surface and is used for the irrigation of larger agricultural areas according to studies the withdrawal of groundwater for irrigation from confined aquifer horizon constitutes 11 9 m3 s achoyan and hakobyan 2017 the irrigation starts in march and ends in november and the most intense irrigation is performed in the period from june to august all this creates favorable conditions for photophilous and thermophilous crops in masis province the vegetable crops are mostly cultivated the masis province is a region where natural salinity accumulation process occurred in soils of some areas due to their geological and climatic characteristics soil salinization process caused both by natural geological climatic and anthropogenic poor quality of irrigation water disturbance of irrigation methods and norms factors is one of the most important environmental issues in masis province as the environmental conditions and sustainable agriculture development in this province are seriously violated 2 2 sampling and laboratory measurements for the study of the groundwater of masis province 27 monitoring wells approximately uniformly apportioned throughout the study area were previously selected from all monitoring wells 15 had the depths up to 60 m and were intended for withdrawal of groundwater from unconfined aquifer while 12 wells with the depths more than 80 m were used for the extraction of groundwater from confined aquifer the groundwater samples were collected monthly during the period from march to november 2019 and 243 samples on the whole were taken during the study period during the selection of monitoring wells their even spatial distribution as well as the intensity of groundwater use and the density of existing wells in the given part of the whole study area were taken into consideration an equal number of samples were taken from all monitoring wells from each well 1 sample monthly and 9 samples in total after the sampling they were air proofed momentarily and sent to the laboratory for future analysis within 2 days the electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were determined by the conductivity meter маrк 603 the contents of k na ca2 mg2 and cl were measured by laboratory ionometer i 160 м hco3 and co3 2 were measured by the acid titration method the values of ph by the ph meter after the research from the data obtained during the three months of each season spring summer autumn the average seasonal values of all studied indicators were calculated 2 3 data processing and methods of hydrochemical classification for assessing the suitability of the groundwater for irrigation purposes we used the computational and graphical methods the first group of evaluations includes the determination of the following indices sar na rsc mh pi and some hydrochemical parameters of the groundwater such as ec ph and cl the classification of the groundwater for irrigation purposes based on these computational methods is presented in table 1 the second group includes methods that can give the graphical representations of groundwater suitability for irrigation purposes united states salinity laboratory ussl and wilcox plots 2 4 generation of iwqi for the combined assessment of the quality of groundwater for irrigation purposes we used the iwqi during the processing of this method we rely on the evaluation criteria dated in fao paper no 29 ayers and westcot 1994 as well as we took into consideration the specific characters of the area studied the excellence of the iwqi is that the varied quality indicators of the groundwater are generalized through it and represented by a single value value of iwqi can change from 0 to 100 table 1 during the computation of the iwqi four main groups of factors were taken into account which had harmful effect on soil quality and crop yield the succession of them according to their importance is 1 influencing the soil salinity 2 influencing the soil infiltration character 3 toxic ions 4 influencing the plants by different ways table 2 for every group the weighting factor wf was defined the aim of which was to show the comparative importance of each group and to clarify the interconnections between the different groups the wf of each group was calculated by equation 1 1 w f i 1 k i i 1 n 1 k i the k i is a temporary weight value of each group that varied from 1 highly important to 5 less important for calculation of iwqi equation 2 was used 2 i w q i i 1 n w f i i 1 m q r i m where iwqi is the irrigation water quality index wf i is the n th group s weighting factor qr i is the quality rating of n th group s m th parameter m is the quantity of parameters in n th group 2 5 geo statistical analysis and mapping for the interpolation and formation of thematic maps arcgis 10 4 and geo statistical analyst wizard were used particularly the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method was used the idw method is one of the most commonly used geo statistical and mathematical interpolation techniques that is applied to predict the target parameters in the field of hydrology science idw uses the assumption that the objects situated closer to each other resemble to a greater extent than the remote objects in order to find the value in one or another point the idw method uses the points of reference located in the neighborhood of the desired point the idw method assumes that each point of reference exerts local influence that decreases along with the decrease of distance to the points located in the neighborhood of the desired point the greater weight values are assigned than to the remote points the idw is calculated by the following equation 3 ž s 0 i 1 n λ i z s i where ž s 0 is the desired value for point s 0 λ i are the weights assigned to each point of reference from amongst the points that will be used during the calculation these weights decrease along with the decrease of the distance z s i is the measured value in the point s i n is the number of points of reference located in the neighborhood of desired point and used in calculations the weights are determined by the following equation 4 λ i d i 0 p i 1 n d i 0 p where d i0 is the distance between the desired point s 0 and the point of reference s i the weight decreases along with the increase of the distance at the expense of coefficient р the p parameter of degree has an influence on designation of weights to the points of reference that is the more the distance between the points of reference and the desired point increases the more the influence or the weight that the point of reference will exert on the desired point decreases exponentially the sum of the weights of reference points that will be used during the interpolation should be equal to 1 5 i 1 n λ i 1 3 results 3 1 statistical summary of hydrochemical parameters of groundwater from different horizons the statistical summary of the average seasonal values of some hydrochemical parameters of the groundwater is given in tables 3 and 4 the values of ph of the groundwater from unconfined aquifer and confined aquifer in masis province in different seasons varied between 6 4 7 0 and 6 6 7 2 accordingly which means that the groundwater system of province had chemical reaction from subacid to weakly alkaline according to averaged data the largest value of ph of groundwater from unconfined was observed in summer while in case of groundwater from confined aquifer the slight decrease of ph value was registered during the vegetation period according to ph evaluation scale of ayers and westcot 1994 the groundwater from both horizons mostly belong to the class ii and such groundwater can be used for irrigation with moderate restriction table 1 specifically it is necessary to conduct intermittently a monitoring of ph of soils irrigated by this groundwater and in case of ph decrease to apply lime for the correction of low ph ayers and westcot 1994 the spatial distribution of ph is shown in figs 2 and 3 geo statistical analysis by the idw method shows that class i groundwater from unconfined aquifer according to ph value is located in the central part of masis province and class ii groundwater is distributed in other parts of the province as can be seen from fig 3 class iii groundwater from confined aquifer occurs only in the southern part of masis province the ec was determined as one of the important hydrochemical parameters of the quality of groundwater used for irrigation the values of ec of groundwater from unconfined aquifer ranged in different seasons from 1108 to 5096 μs cm 1 and the ec values of groundwater from confined aquifer ranged from 618 to 3274 μs cm 1 tables 3 and 4 the average ec values of the groundwater from all monitoring wells in the studied 9 months march november are presented in tables 6 and 7 based on the scale of wilcox 1955 according to ec value the studied groundwater from unconfined aquifer belonged to the following categories 60 of wells belonged to the permissible category and 40 of wells belonged to the doubtful category the groundwater from confined aquifer belonged to the following categories 16 7 of wells belonged to the good category 58 3 of wells belonged to the permissible category and 25 of wells belonged to the doubtful category the great range in the values of electrical conductivity is essentially specified by geochemical processes and human activities in particular exorbitant use of groundwater for irrigation and fish farming purposes application of mineral fertilizers etc dominating in masis province the spatial variation of ec values showed that according to this indicator the worst quality groundwater from unconfined aquifer is located in the southeast part of masis province and the worst quality groundwater from confined aquifer is situated in the southwest part of mentioned province figs 4 and 5 the value of tds depends on dissolved solids inorganic salts and small quantity of organic substances in water tds in the groundwater from unconfined aquifer of studied province varied in different seasons in the range of 742 3558 mg l and tds values of groundwater from confined aquifer in the range of 405 2279 mg l in groundwater from both horizons the average minimal value seasonably was observed in spring that was conditioned by the aquifer water supply peculiarities melt waters and abundant rainfall the high tds increases the osmotic potential in the soil which complicates the water absorption by plants na is the second widely spread cation its content in groundwater mainly depends on cation exchange and human impact the source of sodium ion in the groundwater is due to the feldspar weathering and groundwater overexploitation as well the values of na in groundwater from unconfined aquifer in different seasons ranged from 82 5 to 400 mg l and from confined aquifer it ranged from 53 3 to 312 mg l the average value in the 15 unconfined aquifer wells was 218 98 mg l in the spring 186 51 mg l in the summer 180 73 mg l in the autumn and in the 12 confined aquifer wells 138 98 mg l 123 34 mg l and 118 21 mg l respectively tables 3 and 4 the higher concentration of na was observed during the spring when compared with summer and autumn indicating the dominance of groundwater feeding from precipitation and melt waters as well as the leaching from upper layers of soil the values of mg2 and ca2 in groundwater from unconfined aquifer in different seasons ranged from 58 3 to 322 8 and 54 5 325 mg l accordingly while in groundwater from confined aquifer from 38 to 224 3 and from 38 4 to 189 mg l the concentration of potassium in groundwater mainly increases from two sources geochemical weathering of potash silicate minerals and various human activities use of wastewater and surface water for irrigation application of potash fertilizers over regulated usage k in different seasons ranged from 1 94 to 34 mg l and the mean values in the masis province groundwater from unconfined aquifer and confined aquifer were 13 74 and 8 43 mg l in the spring 21 and 5 91 mg l in the summer 13 78 and 7 07 mg l in the autumn respectively the minimal content of k in both aquifers was observed in the summer and on the whole the content of k in the confined aquifer was less than in the unconfined aquifer that was conditioned by feeding peculiarities of horizons of the first aquifer in particular in confined aquifer the soil leaching process during irrigation and precipitation is feebly marked the weathering of silicate minerals and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and the soil were the main sources of co3 2 and hco3 which in turn contribute the dissolution of other minerals jeong 2001 in the samples of studied groundwater the co3 2 was not found out the amount of hco3 in the groundwater from unconfined aquifer during the study period varied from 302 1 to 665 5 mg l and in the groundwater from confined aquifer from 151 8 to 598 9 mg l cl ion may have the toxicity effect depending on its concentration in the irrigation water and the sensitivity of agricultural crops concentrations of cl in the groundwater from both aquifers of masis province ranged from 60 3 to 757 mg l in different seasons based on the doneen s 1958 classification according to mean annual value of cl the assessment of irrigation properties of groundwater from all wells of different aquifers was carried out as well as the thematic maps were generated by the idw interpolation method figs 6 and 7 according to mentioned classification 53 34 of wells from unconfined aquifer belonged to the class i 33 33 belonged to the class ii 13 33 belonged to the class iii and 75 of wells from confined aquifer belonged to the class i and 25 belonged to the class iii as seen in figures the worst quality groundwater from unconfined aquifer is distributed in the southeastern parts of masis province while such quality groundwater from confined aquifer is located in the southwestern parts it should be mentioned that the groundwater of class iii could have potential toxic effects on crops in studied both horizons of groundwater mg2 was the main dominant cation while hco3 and cl were the main dominant anions in groundwater from unconfined and confined aquifers respectively the allocation character of studied anions and cations in the groundwater from unconfined aquifer of masis province according to the average values of all studied periods meq l was as hco3 cl co3 2 and mg2 na ca2 k accordingly and in the case of groundwater from confined aquifer cl hco3 co3 2 and mg2 na ca2 k 3 2 matrix of correlation the correlation between hydrochemical parameters could be determined by correlation analysis the correlation coefficient of pearson s rank is expressed by ρ the value of which is continuously from 1 0 to 1 0 a positive ρ matches to an increasing monotonic trend between two water quality parameters whereas a negative ρ matches to a decreasing monotonic trend among two parameters of water quality a high level correlation coefficient nearby 1 0 or 1 0 means an effective relationship among two variables if the value is nearby zero it aims no relationship between them srivastava and ramanathan 2008 pearson s rank coefficient of correlation between nine parameters of groundwater quality ph ec tds hco3 cl ca2 mg2 na k iwqi and depth of wells were calculated correlation analysis was done for the average values of hydrochemical parameters of the groundwater from 27 wells for the period from march to november the correlation analysis was carried out for the studied 27 wells to determine whether the changes of the main hydrochemical parameters of water quality have identical trend or not in all wells during the entire study period and if these changes have certain dependence from the depth of wells correlation matrix is given in table 5 the positive correlation was observed between all hydrochemical parameters except between ph and cl in all wells ph showed low positive correlation with almost all parameters and k had the low or moderate correlation all the other hydrochemical parameters ec tds cl ca2 mg2 na had the strong correlation together except ca2 and mg2 with anions in case of which the moderate correlation 0 7 r 0 5 was observed such correlations obviously identified the contribution of major ions to groundwater salinity also these ions had similar tendency to increase or decrease that related with geochemical and human factors mineral weathering ion exchanges water rock interaction irrigation leaching use of fertilizer etc the strong positive correlation between the main exchangeable ions magnesium calcium sodium magnesium shows that the similar decline and rise of these ions is the result of precipitation dissolution reactions and the effect of concentration the negative correlation was observed between iwqi and all hydrochemical parameters this means that the increasing of the values of these hydrochemical parameters results in deterioration of irrigation water quality in particular the ec tds and na have the greatest negative influence on it from the correlation analysis it was also found that along with the increase of the depths of wells the decrease of values of all hydrochemical parameters and vice versa the certain increase in iwqi values were observed and consequently the improvement of groundwater irrigation properties 4 discussion 4 1 sodium adsorption ratio sar sar values indicate the degree when groundwater goes into cation exchange reactions in soil sar is one of the most considerable quality characteristics of the groundwater used for irrigation purposes sar shows the sodium hazard of the groundwater that is defined by the comparative and absolute concentrations of the main cations khodapanah et al 2009 subba rao 2006 subramani et al 2005 if the value of sar is high then the sodium supersedes changing magnesium and calcium harms structure of the soil by making it dense and impermeable todd 1980 consequently the estimation of sodium amount in the groundwater is necessary when taking into account the irrigation suitability the value of sar was determined using equation 6 richards 1954 6 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 where given concentrations of cations were expressed in meq l the groundwater classification by sar is presented in table 1 in tables 6 and 7 the average sar values of groundwater of monitoring wells from different horizons for the whole study period are given according to the scale of richards 1954 all studied groundwater belongs to the excellent category as can be seen from the comparative analysis of groundwater from two horizons a slight deterioration of the quality of unconfined aquifer groundwater according to sar value was observed richards 1954 offered ussl diagram for evaluating the quality of groundwater used for irrigation where two important indicators were taken into account sar and ec based on this approach the groundwater can be categorized in 4 groups by sodium hazard s1 s2 s3 s4 and salinity hazard c1 c2 c3 c4 these two important parameters indicated the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes ussl diagrams of 27 wells groundwater of masis province are shown in figs 8a and 9 a the data of analysis of ussl diagrams showed that the 60 wells groundwater from unconfined aquifer fell in the field of c3 s1 big salinity and low alkalinity hazard and this groundwater is applicable for irrigation use on nearly all types of soil with low hazard of exchangeable na nevertheless the special management to control the salinity is needed the groundwater samples of 20 wells from unconfined aquifer fell in the field of c4 s1 very high salinity and low alkalinity hazard the samples of 20 wells fell in the field of c4 s2 very high salinity and medium alkalinity hazard this groundwater can lead to accumulation of salts in the upper horizons of soils the process of soil salinization depends on both climatic conditions little rainfall and high potential evaporation and soil hydraulic properties conditioned by its texture in arable lands of masis province compared to the residential lands orchards and grasslands the content of sand is lower and on the contrary the content of silt and clay is rather high clay clay loam and silty clay texture classes of soil are mainly found there which may promote the water capillary rise and the accumulation of salts in the upper horizons of soils huang et al 2013 the method of irrigation also affects the process of soil salinization marlet et al 2009 rhoades et al 1992 in masis province the flood method of irrigation was implemented which had lower efficiency in comparison with the drip irrigation and summoned the rise of the groundwater level as it is shown in fig 9a the groundwater from confined aquifer has better quality that is 16 7 wells groundwater fell in the field of c2 s1 medium salinity and low alkalinity hazard samples of 58 3 wells fell in the field of c3 s1 big salinity and low alkalinity hazard and samples of 25 wells fell in the field of c4 s1 very high salinity and low alkalinity hazard summarizing it is fair to say that the groundwater from confined aquifer is less dangerous for the use in irrigation purposes than the groundwater from unconfined aquifer the long term irrigation with water of medium alkalinity hazard can lead to the development of an alkaline soil soil on drying becomes compact and hard and the infiltration of water decreases nishanthiny et al 2010 thus the physical structure of soil will degrade and the agricultural plant growth will be suppressed 4 2 sodium percentage na the sodium percentage is the second significant factor for the characterization of na hazard as well as for the assessment of the groundwater quality for irrigation purposes in case of high amount of na the irrigation water will raise the content of exchangeable sodium in the soil deteriorate infiltration rate and texture of the soil and suppress the plant growth varol and davraz 2015 na amount was calculated by equation 7 wilcox 1955 7 n a n a k 100 c a 2 m g 2 n a k where the concentrations of cations were reported in meq l the groundwater classification by na is presented in table 1 the values of na in masis province s groundwater from unconfined aquifer varied from 12 86 to 40 89 with an average value of 30 37 table 6 and the values of na of groundwater from confined aquifer varied from 20 76 to 36 74 with an average value of 29 03 table 7 the quality of unconfined aquifer groundwater from 6 7 of wells was in a permissible category it may have some negative influence on soil permeability and texture from other 6 7 of wells in excellent category for irrigation purposes and from the rest 86 6 of wells was in a good category for irrigation purposes all samples of groundwater from confined aquifer were also in a good category for irrigation purposes the results of geo statistical analysis are presented in figs 10 and 11 they indicate that according to na index the best quality groundwater from unconfined aquifer is located in the western and northeastern parts of masis province wilcox 1955 offered graphical method for evaluating the quality of groundwater used for irrigation where two important indicators such as na and ec were taken into account wilcox diagram shows that the unconfined aquifer groundwater from 8 wells falls under good to permissible category the groundwater from 3 wells falls under doubtful to unsuitable category and the groundwater from 4 wells falls under unsuitable category fig 8b it should be noted that all wells with poor quality groundwater are located in the eastern part of masis province in case of confined aquifer the groundwater of 2 wells falls under excellent to good category the groundwater of 7 wells falls under good to permissible category the groundwater of 3 wells falls under doubtful to unsuitable category and the groundwater of 1 well falls under unsuitable category fig 9b the sampling points with bad quality groundwater are located in the south east of masis province poor quality of groundwater in some areas may be caused by both natural climate and geological characteristics of the region and anthropogenic particularly large scale agricultural activities processes 4 3 magnesium hazard mh mg2 and ca2 are necessary cations for the growth of a plant but a high quantity of magnesium has negative influence on the structure of soil and may reduce the crop yield kumar et al 2007 paliwal 1972 szabolcs and darab 1964 offered the mh for evaluating the quality of groundwater used for irrigation mh was calculated by the following equation 8 m h m g 2 m g 2 c a 2 100 where the concentrations of cations were expressed in meq l the groundwater classification by mh is given in table 1 as shown in the table if the value of mh of the groundwater is less than 50 this groundwater is suitable for irrigation and if the value of the mentioned index is more than 50 the groundwater is not suitable for irrigation the studies showed that in all cases the values of mh have exceeded 50 the average values of mh in masis province groundwater from unconfined aquifer and from confined aquifer were 64 23 and 65 86 respectively tables 6 and 7 in other words according to this index the masis province s groundwater is mostly unsuitable for irrigation use and can have an adverse effect on crop yield and increase the alkalinity of the soil 4 4 residual sodium content rsc richards 1954 has defined the co3 2 and hco3 negative effect on water quality which is expressed through the rsc if the concentration of bicarbonate and carbonate is higher than that of calcium and magnesium it will have an influence on suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes in case of high rsc value the increase of ph value of groundwater was observed as well as the agricultural area irrigated with such groundwater was turned to barren due to deposition of na2co3 fine et al 1959 the value of rsc was determined by the use of equation 9 9 rsc co3 2 hco3 ca2 mg2 concentrations of all ions were reported in meq l the classification of groundwater quality by rsc values is given in table 1 our studies showed that in groundwater of masis province the rsc value was less than 1 25 thus according to this index the groundwater is safe and na2co3 will not be accumulated in the soil irrigated by these waters tables 6 and 7 4 5 permeability index pi poor quality of groundwater for irrigation can have a negative impact on soil permeability such effect on soil is caused mainly by the content of na mg2 ca2 and hco3 ions in irrigation water doneen 1964 has developed a principle for evaluating the quality of the groundwater for irrigation purposes based on pi this index was calculated by the following equation 10 p i n a h c o 3 c a 2 m g 2 n a 100 where the concentrations of cations and the anion were expressed in meq l the water quality evaluation criteria depending on pi are shown in table 1 pi in unconfined aquifer wells of masis province ranged between 20 84 and 51 53 with an average value of 39 86 table 6 and in confined aquifer wells ranged between 33 72 and 51 89 with a mean value of 42 18 table 7 the groundwater from unconfined and confined aquifers of masis province mainly fell within the class ii and was suitable for irrigation according to doneen 1964 classification and only the groundwater of one well from unconfined aquifer fell within the class iii and was unsuitable for irrigation the spatial distribution of pi is shown in figs 12 and 13 and as can be seen in the maps the groundwater of poor quality is located in the western part of masis province 4 6 main geochemical factors influencing the groundwater chemistry the chemistry of the groundwater in masis province depends on various processes and factors for understanding these geochemical processes we used the gibbs 1970 diagram the interaction between aquifer minerals and groundwater has significant influence on groundwater quality and is very helpful in understanding the origin of water mineralization gibbs considered three natural processes influencing the groundwater chemistry they are rock dominance evaporation crystallization and precipitation processes feth and gibbs 1971 gibbs 1970 gibbs diagram is plotted by dependence of some anions and cations on tds figs 14 and 15 gibbs diagram showed that among the processes determining the unconfined aquifer groundwater chemistry the rock dominance made up to 66 7 and evaporation crystallization dominance 33 3 and for confined aquifer groundwater chemistry the rock dominance consists 75 and evaporation crystallization dominance 25 in these two horizons the evaporation crystallization process has a relatively higher impact on groundwater chemistry of unconfined aquifer that is conditioned by the feeding peculiarities of mentioned two aquifers specifically the unconfined aquifer is mainly fed by precipitations and surface flows of ararat plain while confined aquifer is fed by depth streams formed in several river basins of armenia notably of the akhurian kasagh and azat rivers from the spatial distribution of obtained data on diagrams is seen that rock dominance and evaporation crystallization process have approximately uniform impact on unconfined aquifer groundwater chemistry this is caused by climatic characteristics of masis province high potential evaporation and low precipitation water and moisture evaporation from the upper soil layer leads to the accumulation and deposition of salts that ultimately leach into the groundwater the long term agricultural activities leading to erosion and weathering of soil also increases the mineralization of groundwater this process is also typical for the other arid and semiarid zones and leads to the increasing of the concentration of salts in groundwater richter and kreitler 1993 human impact irrigation return flows irrigation in excess of the planned rates massive loss of irrigation water use of fertilizers and pesticides may also be the related factor which finally leads to the increase of ions in groundwater caused by evaporation the process of rock dominance has more expressed influence on confined aquifer groundwater chemistry that is explained by the peculiarities of feeding of the given aquifer groundwater when the pressure of groundwater in aquifer is high it is not being fed from the groundwater located in the higher horizons but when the pressure decreases the aquifer is fed on such groundwater consequently this groundwater may have an impact on confined aquifer groundwater chemistry 4 7 irrigation water quality index iwqi one of the greatest problems with which the agricultural workers are permanently confronted is how to analyze various groundwater quality data that describe irrigation suitability and how to choose the optimal irrigation methods and norms the good solution for this issue could be the iwqi which is a properly calculated aggregated index of water quality in a wide range of complex data and may give a clear description of the groundwater quality for irrigation purpose by one value in table 2 the groundwater suitability scheme by iwqi is proposed the groundwater classification by iwqi is presented in table 1 in the whole study period the average iwqi values in different unconfined aquifer wells ranged from 46 30 to 83 45 with a mean value of 71 50 table 6 and in confined aquifer wells ranged from 56 88 to 88 40 with a mean value of 77 78 table 7 according to the iwqi scheme the groundwater from unconfined aquifer of masis province fell in the following categories 13 3 of wells belonged to class i 73 4 of wells belonged to class ii 13 3 of wells belonged to class iii and in case of groundwater from confined aquifer 58 4 of wells belonged to class i 33 3 of wells belonged to class ii 8 3 of wells belonged to class iii it should be noted that almost in all unconfined aquifer wells from indices of all four groups the indices of the first and the second groups of factors influencing the soil salinity and the soil infiltration properties decreased the most from their maximal values by about 30 and these factors were the main cause for the decline of the iwqi the situation was other in the case of confined aquifer wells the indices of the fourth group of factors exerting miscellaneous effects on soil decreased the most from their maximal values by about 33 but since the wf of the fourth group was low it did not have considerable negative influence on irrigation water quality furthermore despite the fact that the indices of the first group of factors decreased the less from their maximal values by about 16 it had significant negative influence on irrigation water quality due to high value of wf the second group of factors influencing infiltration properties of soil also had great impact on water quality deterioration the indices of this group decreased from their maximal values by about 29 on the average the long usage of the class iii water will undoubtedly have the negative influence on qualitative properties of soil thereby for the maintenance of the salt balance in the soil and for the preservation of crop yields in masis province a good drainage is required according to some researchers the subsurface drainage is much effective for desalination of salty soils and the process of salt leaching may begin immediately after it bahceci and nacar 2008 correlation analysis between the iwqi and hydrochemical parameters of irrigation water showed that the increasing of ec tds and na values had more negative impact on quality of irrigation water than the other parameters table 5 the spatial variation of iwqi determined by idw interpolation method is presented in figs 16 and 17 geo statistical analysis showed that in masis province according to the complex qualitative index the spatial distribution of the groundwater from unconfined and confined aquifers was divided into 3 zones as can be seen from the maps the excellent quality groundwater from unconfined aquifer is located mainly in the northwest of the province whereas such quality groundwater from confined aquifer is located mainly in the central part and in the small area of the western part of masis province as can be seen from figures the area occupied by the excellent quality groundwater from confined aquifer is incomparably larger than that occupied by such groundwater from unconfined aquifer the groundwater belonging to class iii takes up only a small area in masis province and for its use for the irrigation it is necessary to implement certain preventive measures implementation of more effective methods of irrigation a good leaching regime drainage in order to avoid the secondary salinization of the soils of masis province it should be noted that the deterioration of groundwater quality is conditioned by climatic peculiarities scanty precipitation intensive evaporation hydrogeological composition of studied area as well as by high farming activities and improper farm operations nevertheless the involvement of local farmers in the activities against salinization is also very important for the attainment of the best results as they may become the key initiators of technical solutions of their environmental problems thus through the iwqi method it was possible to give the assessment of the quality of groundwater of masis province for irrigation purposes by single value avoiding various values that are derived from the evaluation by traditional single index methods 5 conclusion the groundwater quality from different aquifers of masis province was studied to comprehend its suitability for the irrigation purposes for this issue various hydrochemical parameters of the groundwater were studied the distribution character of ions in the groundwater from unconfined aquifer of masis province according to the mean values of the whole studied period was as mg2 na ca2 hco3 cl k co3 2 meq l and in the groundwater from confined aquifer mg2 cl hco3 na ca2 k co3 2 correlation analysis showed that there was a strong correlation between the following hydrochemical parameters ec tds cl ca2 mg2 and na except ca2 and mg2 with anions for the identification of geochemical processes influencing the groundwater chemistry the gibbs diagram was used and the studies showed that the rock dominance was a key process determining the groundwater chemistry the suitability of the groundwater of masis province for irrigation was evaluated by computational sar na mh rsc pi and some hydrochemical parameters ec ph cl and graphical ussl and wilcox plots methods some of the obtained data were also subjected to geo statistical analysis by idw interpolation method and the thematic maps were generated to show their spatial variation the groundwater suitability for irrigation purpose by different hydrochemical indices varied from excellent to unsuitable categories in order to avoid such variety of data iwqi method was used and the various quality indicators of the groundwater were generalized and represented by single value based on the iwqi it was ascertained that the groundwater from confined aquifer had better irrigation properties than the groundwater from unconfined aquifer geo statistical analysis idw interpolation method of the iwqi showed that the spatial distribution of the groundwater in masis province was divided into 3 zones class i class ii and class iii in masis province the main type of the unconfined aquifer groundwater belonged to the class ii which is characterized as good and of the confined aquifer groundwater to the class i which is characterized as excellent the unconfined aquifer groundwater with the worst irrigation properties is located by small areas in the southeast part of the province and the confined aquifer groundwater of such quality in the southwest part of the studied territory the long term irrigation by such groundwater and the neglect of implementation of soil quality improvement measures can lead to negative changes in the soil which in turn will disturb the environmental conditions of masis province and impede the sustainable agricultural development in this region taking all this into consideration the continuous monitoring of the groundwater the control of salinity by appropriate management the implementation of more effective methods of irrigation a good leaching regime the maintenance of the low level of groundwater as well as the awareness of agricultural workers are required in order to decrease the degradation process of soils in masis province credit authorship
