6360,with increasing population and urbanization in the deltas across global mega river basins groundwater stress is increasing due to changing ocean land disposition hydroclimatic extremes over exploitation and natural anthropogenic contamination such change in coastal hydrodynamic process makes an impact in to the resilience of groundwater sourced drinking water vulnerability the groundwater responses studied in this work in the ecologically vulnerable unesco world heritage site of the sundarbans delta front aquifers at the river ganges brahmaputra mega delta demonstrate a unique example of such intricacies and complexities high resolution temporal depth dependent hydraulic connectivity and hydrochemistry was studied for this complex climate driven tidal induced hydrological interactions between surface water seawater of bay of bengal bob and ganges river water with shallow and deep groundwater by stable isotopic δ18o and δd signatures and piezometry a wide range of salinity content and δ18o composition of groundwater samples for 14 25 salinity 3 45 ppt δ18o 3 63 to 1 15 and 30 50 meter below ground level mbgl salinity 5 25 ppt δ18o 3 41 to 1 34 was recorded while comparatively a narrow range of temporal variability was observed for the depths of 115 salinity 1 4 ppt δ18o 5 04 to 2 15 and 333mbgl salinity 1 to 3 ppt δ18o 4 43 to 2 81 study results revealed that vertical transport of solute has been induced by coastal hydrodynamics however human interferences in terms of groundwater abstraction and land use land cover change e g brackish aquaculture do have substantial impact on evolving groundwater response thereby impacting resilience to drinking water option in this densely populated area fluctuations of groundwater level in relation with δ18ogw composition showed shallow depths 14 50 mbgl are hydraulically connected by local flow and conducive of chemical exchanges the deeper groundwater 115 330 mbgl depths flow suggests regional scale hydraulic connections along flow paths in spite of sub meter scale seasonal groundwater level changes salinity variability is observed between 1 and 4 ppt at 100 mbgl depths suggest mixing between chemically distinct water reservoirs conserving hydraulic mass balance however such observation suggests severe implications for groundwater vulnerability which might aggravate with future intensification of irrigational abstraction as well as with changing hydroclimatological regime and extreme events thus future planning and management strategies of sustainable supply of safe water in such ecologically sensitive groundwater systems need to incorporate such dynamic chemical evolution keywords isotopic composition mixing model groundwater sundarbans ganges delta 1 introduction assessment of groundwater quality in an active alluvial system needs attention in the field of surface water groundwater sw gw interaction study near tropical ocean both by piezometry and hydrogeochemistry from long past to present day alluvial systems are being exposed to fluvio dynamic process sea level changes and tectonic movements mukherjee et al 2009 with the changing time groundwater is being subjected to geogenic contamination and in the present day by anthropogenic stresses both in shallow and deeper aquifer especially near the tropical ocean excessive abstraction of groundwater more than the rate of recharge has lead to the land subsidence declining base flow to the rivers salt water intrusion swi and water quality degradation in different parts of the world fishman et al 2011 joshi et al 2018 mukherjee et al 2018 hussain et al 2018 mukherjee 2018 this trend of groundwater use has raised a question on the groundwater security in the 21st century especially in modern alluvial aquifer encompassed by global ocean globally swi near coastal areas are well documented but groundwater salinization always may not be because of swi the other sources of groundwater salinization include leakage of water from contaminated shallow aquifer entrapped saline water in clay layer connate saline water and upcoming of underlying brine waters jones et al 1999 vengosh et al 2002 huge abstraction of groundwater severely distorts the flow pattern sikdar et al 2001 michael et al 2013 induces high vertical hydraulic gradients with a wide cone of depression mukherjee et al 2007a this would affect the groundwater quality by inviting the contaminants from the surrounding sources 1 from the shallow depths 2 from the regional scale flow in deeper depths and 3 salinization of groundwater due to diffusion of connate water sikdar et al 2001 michael et al 2009 mukherjee et al 2011 uncontrolled abstraction of groundwater has a high chance of causing groundwater salinization in shallow aquifer due to pumping and density differences khan et al 2011 michael et al 2013 these density differences of fluids in low gradient system will change the fluid dynamics especially in shallow depths changes in deeper groundwater pumping trends would enhance the vertical flow from shallow depths and also transport to the deeper depths if the aquifer is hydraulically or physically connected therefore the hydrogeological conditions with hydraulic gradients are essential to understand these sw gw interactions where density dependent flow is plausible robinson et al 2006 this process of contamination of the shallow and deeper groundwater in various spatio temporal scale near tropical ocean is rarely hypothesized and addressed the ganga brahmaputra meghna gbm basin is an alluvial plain and according to physiographic characteristics divided in to five distinct regions which includes sundarbans a unesco world heritage site umitsu 1987 this fragile system represents a complex hydrogeological system resulting from constant physical and chemical evolution of the residing groundwater in various spatio temporal scales morphologically the study area is getting affected by 1 the regional tectonic setup in millennia scale 2 by coastal hydrodynamic behavior than fluvial action and 3 anthropogenic interferences in daily scale to annual scale ghosh and mukhopadhyay 2016 the importance of sw gw interaction in this dynamic area of indian sundarbans where sea level rise slr trend is 5 mm yr unnikrishnan et al 2015 has rarely been understood and hypothesized the present study was conducted in ganges delta front aquifer in sundarbans to address this global sw gw interaction issue in alluvial settings the primary objective of the study is to identify the sw gw interaction in heterogeneous aquifer aquitard framework from shallow to deeper depths in temporal scales by the application of stable water isotopes δ18o and δd coupled with salinity content the study focused on the examining off the influence of groundwater pumping in shallow and deeper depths and its plausible hydraulic connectivity with the seawater and surface water in the vicinity of tropical ocean 2 methodology 2 1 study area description the study area encompasses about 16 km2 area and lies between 21 33 22 87 n to 21 35 54 64 n latitude and 88 14 43 47 e to 88 17 13 98 e longitude fig 1 b the area is situated in the extreme western periphery of sundarbans which is a ganges delta front of namkhana community development block south 24 parganas district west bengal studied area is a part of the largest fluvio deltaic system drained jointly by river ganges and river bhagirathi hooghly the river bhagirathi hooghly passes through the west and the extreme southern part of the area extends till the bay of bengal bob this prograding delta has experienced marine transgression from 10 000 to 7000 years bp and resulted in the deposition of fine sediments experiencing slr goodbred and kuehl 2000 geomorphic changes are dominant in delta front eastern part is experiencing severe erosion by tidal actions whereas the western part is lesser active respectively mondal et al 2015 ghosh and mukhopadhyay 2016 2 2 hydrogeological condition due to its close proximity with bob and the tropic of cancer the study area experiences warm and humid climatic condition across all the seasons mukherjee et al 2007b based on rainfall pattern and changes in atmospheric temperature and water vapor end of february to june is considered as pre monsoon july to september as monsoon and october to beginning of february as post monsoon season the study area mostly experiences bulk of rainfall from the end of june to september fig 1c local convectional storms may contribute to some pre monsoonal rainfall and converged moisture source from indian ocean along with local moisture sources may be responsible for monsoonal rainfall events 2 3 hydrostratigraphy lithological structure of the bengal basin was previously explained by mukherjee et al 2007a to validate the aquifer aquitard framework lithologs of study location were collected from the public health engineering department phed government of west bengal database total 5 lithologs of drinking water and observation wells are used for this study area which were drilled all across the studied locations depths of all the logs range from the 115 to 300 meter below ground level mbgl fig 2 the lithology of the logs was recorded in 1 m vertical resolution the major types of unconsolidated sediments that are identified are clay clayey sand silty clay silty sand sandy clay fine sand medium sand and coarse sand from the general hydrogeological information these sediments are categorized in aquifer silty sand and sandy clay and aquitard clay clayey sand and silty clay framework the shallow depths have varying aquifer properties up to depths of 55 mbgl shallow depths are divided from the deeper depths by the clay and clayey sand layer which varies in depth range from 55 to maximum 90 mbgl fig 2 a deeper aquifer properties was identified around the depths of 105 mbgl in all the logs and another deeper layer was observed below the of 280 mbgl in basin scale the lithology is similar to the aquifer aquitard framework of western bengal basin proposed by mukherjee et al 2007a here we are comparing our logs with the basin scale aquifer aquitard framework as we are identifying the hydraulic connectivity of shallow and deeper aquifer in local to regional scale lithologically the aquifer of the studied area was classified in to three zones viz i shallow upper aquifer ii the main aquifer and iii the deeper aquifer the southern part of the bengal basin was considered as the shallow upper aquifer up to 60 mbgl the main aquifer is semi confined to locally unconfined which consists of medium to coarse grained sand with alternate gravel layers vary in thickness up to 75 m in southern part up to depth of 140 to 150 mbgl and the deeper confined aquifer 150 m separated from the main aquifer by a clay layer consists of medium to coarse sands with inter beds of silt and clay the main deeper aquifer in southern part of the basin 200 m have several intermediate depth clay aquitards which divide main aquifer into laterally connected confined aquifers mukherjee et al 2007a 2009 in the present study groundwater from fresh groundwater well of 333 mbgl has been considered which is beyond the studied depth of the hydrostratigraphic model of mukherjee et al 2007a 2 4 field instrumentation 2 4 1 groundwater sampling total fifteen installed wells have been considered in this present study of them 13 for groundwater sampling and 2 for the monitoring of groundwater levels thirteen installed observation wells were mainly considered for continuous monitoring of physical and chemical parameters of groundwater samples fig 2 the wells were installed at five locations a b c d and e in the depth ranges of 14 to 25 30 to 50 115 and 333 mbgl fig 2 each of the five wells were installed at a depth of 14 25 and 30 50mbgl in all five locations while location b and d each have two at 115 mbgl and location a have one observation well at 333 mbgl for the sw gw interaction study the groundwater samples were collected for a period of one hydrologic year from may to february of the successive year 2017 18 by maintaining 12 20 days interval and most accessible conditions in terms of weather and locations a total of 189 groundwater samples were considered in the present study across all seasons where total 71 samples were from 14 to 25 mbgl depth 76 samples from 30 to 50 mbgl 29 samples from 115 mbgl and 13 samples from 333 mbgl depth 2 4 2 surface water sampling to study the sw gw interaction in this dynamic environment one upstream location has been considered from river bhagirathi hooghly south 24 parganas fig 1a all the river water samples were collected in pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon seasons seawater samples from bob were collected from near shore location 21 34 15 73 n and 88 13 58 72 e in 7 to 10 days interval with best accessible and suitable weather conditions from march 2017 to may 2018 fig 1b 2 4 3 rainfall sampling and collection of data rainfall samples were collected during all the rainfall events at near shore location 21 33 37 24 n and 88 15 44 19 e of bob during studied period five samples from pre monsoon 51 and 13 samples from monsoon and post monsoon season were considered for studied period in present study total rainfall data for each month for last 5 years in at south 24 parganas district were collected from the indian meteorological department imd and presented in fig 1c average rainfall for last five years was 1806 mm year with minimum 1579 mm in the year of 2014 and maximum 2300 mm in 2013 imd 2017 the total rainfall for studied period of 2017 was found to be highest in monsoon season 1024 mm with an average of 341 mm for the monsoon months whereas lowest recorded average rainfall was in pre monsoon total 174 mm avg 87 mm than post monsoon season total 337 mm avg 168 mm rainfall monthly amount are compared with the composite of δ18o values in monthly scale in section 3 1 the monthly average δ18o of rainfall was calculated by considering the number of rainfall events for each of the months rather than the days of respective months therefore these point data cannot be used to investigate the causes of daily or event based variations in precipitation amount over the processes in this studied hydrological year 2 4 4 piezometry two water level loggers were installed at depth of 15 and 115 mbgl in location c and only one barologger was installed at 24 mbgl of location e water level sensors solinist levelogger 3001 were used to measure the sub meter scale water level fluctuations the water level driver was installed at location c in a well of 15 and 115 mbgl depths with a pre set 30 minutes interval for data collection a barologger was also installed in location e to record atmospheric pressure the depths of groundwater level are represented in reversed order with respect of ground surface elevation the level logger measures groundwater levels with an accuracy of 0 05 fs full scale while barologger measures and logs changes in atmospheric pressure which are then used to compensate water level readings recorded by the level logger with an accuracy of 0 05 kpa 2 5 sample preservation and analysis river water seawater and groundwater samples were collected by following standard hydrochemical procedures wood 1981 groundwater samples were collected from the observation wells after flushing for 30 40 minutes in order to obtain representative samples under minimal atmospheric contact salinity was measured using multi parameter probe hanna hi929829 and recorded after stabilization of field parameters samples were filtered through 0 22 µm filter paper in in situ condition and preserved in 8 ml hdpe bottle without headspace for isotopic analysis collected samples were analyzed in high precision laser cavity ring down spectrometry method picarro inc model no l2130 i without further treatment of the samples thorsen et al 2011 at the laboratory of school of environmental science and engineering indian institute of technology kharagpur iit kharagpur samples were filled in 1 5 ml air tight glass vials and injected through 10 µl syringe to vaporizer for analysis of stable water isotope ratios all the high saline samples were measured without the salt liner which reduces the effect of salt deposition on vaporizer therefore to avoid the effect of salinity and high tds samples were measured in high precision mode of given 6 run for each samples and considered only last 3 results of the sample to avoid the memory effect walker et al 2016 analytical precisions were less than 1 0 and 0 1 for δd and δ18o respectively conventional ratios of 18o 16o and 2h 1h were expressed in delta notations of their relative abundances as deviations in per mil from vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow analysed samples were normalized to vsmow by the replicate analysis with respect to internal standard used internal standard was calibrated to vsmow and standard light antarctic precipitation slap certified reference materials 2 6 mixing model the mixing of upstream fresh water and seawater from bob with groundwater at the study site and at different depth involves two or more discrete end members that mix due to convergence of different source water through the aquifer media it was assumed that the groundwater gw of gangetic delta front aquifers mixes with two components i e river water rw and seawater seaw and the numerical equation of mixed groundwater can be expressed by eq 1 rai et al 2009 ghosh et al 2013 we have quantified the fraction of seawater and river water mixes with the groundwater of the study area by two component separation approach yehdegho et al 1997 stichler et al 1986 to find the rw and seaw component fraction on groundwater we have used δ18o concentration of rw and seaw samples in a solute mass balance equation the generic mass balance equation looks like eq 2 the calculated fraction river water f rw from the eq 2 is used to calculate the seawater fraction f seaw from the eq 1 to find out the mixed proportional of f rw and f seaw in groundwater f gw after the calculation of the fraction from eq 1 was converted to percentage of rw and seaw with respect to gw 1 f gw f rw f seaw 2 f rw δ 18 o gw δ 18 o seaw δ 18 o rw δ 18 o seaw where f rw and f seaw denote proportion of river water and seawater respectively that mixes with the groundwater f gw 3 result 3 1 rainfall isotopic variation the measured δ18o and δd composition of rainwater samples ranges from 7 42 to 0 33 and 52 to 16 in pre monsoon season 13 4 to 4 89 and 92 to 32 in monsoon season and 13 63 to 9 74 and 102 to 66 in post monsoon season respectively changes in median δ18o composition of rainfall have an inverse relationship with the total rainfall amount in all the observed months fig 3 a highest depleted δ18o composition was observed δ18o 13 63 at beginning of post monsoon season month october observed highest median depleted δ18o composition 8 98 was recorded in post monsoon season than monsoon and pre monsoon season there was a distinct inverse relation of depleted δ18o with amount rainfall which represents a signature of atmospheric moisture source responsible for rainfall in monthly scale variations fig 3a the observed variations of rainfall δ18o composition with the amount in this present study is similar to the case of tropical rainfall gourcy et al 2005 these significant variations in rainfall isotopic composition could be modulated by large scale process like convection associated with the monsoonal intra seasonal oscillation additionally low pressure system can significantly reduce the isotopic compositions which may have influence on moisture source of that area sengupta and ravichandran 2001 sengupta et al 2013 chakraborty et al 2016 the global meteoric water line gmwl is considered as reference line which is linearly related to the value of precipitation that has not been evaporated as δd 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 the δ18o and δd values of rainwater samples are plotted to develop local meteoric water line lmwl eq 3 fig 4 and the calculated slope of the lmwl is 7 5 which is lower than that of the gmwl m 8 the calculated slope of the lmwl in this present study is also lower than the calculated weighted δd 8 14δ18o 10 9 r2 0 98 and unweighted δd 8 07δ18o 9 9 r2 0 98 gmwl of gourcy et al 2005 the seasonal isotopic values vary significantly and the seasonal slope for the lmwl has also been calculated the calculated slope of the pre monsoonal lmwl prem eq 4 is 7 6 whereas the monsoonal lmwl m eq 5 and post monsoonal lmwl postm eq 6 calculated slopes are 7 2 and 8 2 respectively the slope of lmwl prem and lmwl m are lower than that of the gmwl whereas the lmwl postm slope is equal to that of the gmwl the equations for the meteoric water lines are represented here through eqs 4 6 the seasonal variations in intercepts in all the seasonal lmwl are might be a resultant of evaporation effects due to temperature variations in different seasons or local re evaporated moisture vapour sourced rainfall in different seasons 3 lmwl δ d 7 5 δ 18 o 5 12 r 2 0 97 4 lmwl prem δ d 7 6 δ 18 o 9 47 r 2 0 87 5 lmwl m δ d 7 2 δ 18 o 3 21 r 2 0 95 6 lmwl postm δ d 8 2 δ 18 o 12 24 r 2 0 92 the deuterium excess d excess value is calculated by using the equation d δd 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 and remarkable changes were observed in the transition periods between two seasons fig 3b a sharp decrease of d excess value was observed in the transition between pre monsoon and monsoon season and a sharp increase of d excess value was observed between monsoon and post monsoon season this sharp change in d excess values of respective seasons might be due to the convergence of multiple moisture source and locally re evaporated moisture sources of that particular area the changes in rainfall d excess values are following the pattern of reported values in northern hemisphere froehlich et al 2002 pfahl and sodemann 2014 the observed d excess values are highest in september and lowest around the month of july fig 3b the overall selected trend of d excess variability in study period is similar to reported study in kolkata by sengupta and sarkar 2006 which approximately 130 km away from our location besides the higher variability we got negative d excess values of rainfall the relatively low mean condensation temperature for the heaviest rain i e very high clouds possibly causes a negative d excess possibly the heavy rainfall from tropical cyclone very high clouds hereby has a negative d excess this similar kind of negative d excess values of rainfall was also reported by the fudeyasu et al 2008 3 2 groundwater 3 2 1 temporal variation of stable water isotopic composition of groundwater samples δ18o composition of groundwater samples for the pre monsoon season varies from 2 86 to 1 74 for 14 25 mbgl n 23 3 41 to 2 08 for 30 50 mbgl n 23 5 04 to 2 73 for 115 mbgl n 9 and 4 43 to 3 36 for the depth of 333 mbgl n 4 in monsoon season δ18o composition ranges from 3 44 to 1 93 3 15 to 2 21 3 20 to 2 57 and 3 58 to 3 24 for the depth of 14 25 n 17 30 50 n 19 115 n 7 and 333 mbgl n 3 respectively whereas in post monsoon δ18o varies from 3 63 to 2 01 3 27 to 2 32 2 83 to 2 48 and 3 13 to 3 04 for the depth of 14 25 n 31 30 50 n 34 115 n 13 and 333 mbgl n 6 table 1 sub parallel trend line of δd vs δ18o of groundwater samples was plotted with the gmwl and lmwl for understanding the degree of interaction with meteoric water in present climatic condition fig 5 the seasonal variation of rainfall isotopic signature is a function of local fluctuating weather conditions humidity and variable mixing of vapour mass craig and gordon 1965 gat 1971 araguas araguas et al 2000 the discreet clustering of groundwater samples around the lmwl and gmwl indicate meteoric recharge across the seasons groundwater samples of 14 25 and 30 50 mbgl have wide range of δ18o values with respect to115 and 333 mbgl fig 5e for the groundwater of 14 25 mbgl depth monsoonal slope m 6 48 is close to monsoonal lmwl but the slopes for other two seasons are deviating from the lmwl fig 5a groundwater samples from the depth of 30 50 mbgl have slope m 5 across all seasons which is lower than that of lmwl and gmwl fig 5b whereas the groundwater samples from the depth of 115 and 333 mbgl deviate from the lmwl and gmwl slope lies within 4 across all three seasons fig 5c and d 3 2 2 variation of groundwater salinity content salinity content of the groundwater samples vary from 17 to 42 ppt for 14 25 mbgl 10 25 ppt for 30 50 mbgl and 2 3 ppt for 115 and 333 mbgl during pre monsoon season and 21 45 ppt 11 25 ppt 1 4 ppt and 1 2 ppt in 14 25 30 50 115 and 333 mbgl respectively for monsoon season however in post monsoon season salinity varies from 3 to 44 ppt 5 to 22 ppt 1 to 4 ppt and 1 to 2 ppt at 14 25 30 50 115 and 333 mbgl depths wide variability in the salinity of groundwater samples have been observed in the depth range of 14 25 and 30 50 mbgl with the standard deviation of 7 7 and 3 5 respectively fig 6 a 3 2 3 fluctuation of groundwater level the groundwater level in 15 and 115 mbgl depths varies significantly across the seasons average groundwater level from the surface varies from 1 46 to 1 32 mbgl and 2 1 to 2 08 mbgl in end of pre monsoon for the depths of 15 and 115 mbgl the groundwater level was risen up to the 0 36 and 1 41 mbgl for the depths of 15 and 115 mbgl in monsoon season when rainfall is high and again it fells down to 0 93 and 2 00 mbgl in post monsoon season with low rainfall amount respectively but the fluctuations of water level were significant for the shallow depth where it varies within the range of 1 55 m across the season fluctuation of groundwater level was relatively lower in the depth of 115 mbgl than 15 mbgl the groundwater level at the depth of 115 m fluctuates within a range of 0 55 m across the hydrological year fig 7 more interestingly groundwater fluctuations were not uniform across all the seasons in shallow depth which significantly rising up to 0 65 m within five days interval similar trend of fluctuation for the deeper depth was recorded with respect to shallow depths but the range of fluctuations is comparatively low 3 3 variation of stable isotopic composition and salinity content of river water and seawater average δ18o compositions of the river water were 4 95 4 58 and 4 98 in pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon season respectively whereas average δd composition were 41 41 41 05 and 41 36 in the aforesaid three seasons respectively average observed salinity was 0 37 ppt with maximum 0 44 ppt in pre monsoon and minimum 0 26 ppt in post monsoon season seawater samples n 35 from bob shows a wide range of δ18o composition across all three seasons for the entire study period variability of δ18o and δd values of seawater ranges from 2 31 to 0 19 and 17 67 to 1 05 in pre monsoon n 14 2 59 to 0 11 and 24 to 0 59 in monsoon n 11 and 2 99 to 1 47 and 22 to 11 45 in post monsoon n 10 season respectively the d excess values of seawater ranges from 7 68 to 2 29 across all three seasons the highest negative d excess values of seawater were observed in pre monsoon season while highest value also observed in pre monsoon season in monsoon and post monsoon season the d excess values ranges from 5 84 to 0 77 avg 2 32 and 2 88 to 1 08 avg 0 17 fig 9 the seasonal changes in d excess values are related to intensity of evaporation from sea surface possible highest negative d excess in pre monsoon season might be a resultant of very high evaporation or sudden intense rainfall possibly due to some atmospheric depressions the change in d excess over the monsoon season is might be a resultant of surface water flux to seawater of bob and monsoonal intense rainfall over bob salinity content of the seawater also varies seasonally recorded highest in pre monsoon avg 25 ppt with gradually decrease in monsoon avg 19 ppt and again increase in post monsoon season avg 24 ppt depleted isotopic signature with low salinity content in seawater samples of monsoon and post monsoon season is an indication of possible higher monsoonal discharge of fresh water from river bhagirathi hooghly local regional rainfall runoff to bob and fresh groundwater discharge 3 4 mixing component the average δ18o composition of river water rw 4 84 and seawater seaw 0 99 was used in eqs 1 and 2 for estimation of mixing source component to groundwater average value for seawater has been calculated for this mixing model only by considering the pre monsoon and late post monsoon δ18o composition due to higher monsoonal variability of seawater δ18o composition than non monsoon seasons the δ18o composition of seawater from bob varies within the range of 1 0 to 1 from shallow to the deeper depths in reported study of sengupta et al 2013 but in present study the range of bob δ18ovariability is very high might be due to the huge amount of surface water flux from the bhagirathi hooghly river or sgd to bob which changes the bob δ18o values from 3 0 to 2 0 in seasonal scale based on the observed higher δ18o variability of bob seawater and to avoid the biased end member output of two component mixing model we have chosen the average δ18o values of seawater as previously described in this section two component end member mixing analysis suggests that groundwater from the depth of 14 25 mbgl have dominant proportion of seawater with highest in pre monsoon season f seaw 84 similarly groundwater from the depth of 30 50 mbgl have highest seawater proportion in pre monsoon season f seaw 77 and it goes down in post monsoon season f seaw 69 groundwater from the depth of 333 mbgl has higher river water proportion than the groundwater from 115 mbgl all the river water proportion in groundwater at 333 mbgl depth are more than 50 whereas groundwater at 115 mbgl have seasonal river water proportion f rw within 35 41 4 discussion 4 1 spatial and depth wise variation of isotopic composition and salinity content of groundwater with seawater and rainfall seawater from bob has significant variation on salinity and δ18o content on seasonal scale whereas river water has negligible range of variation the changes in salinity and δ18o composition of bob may be controlled by the local to regional rainfall and upstream fresh water discharge higher discharge of upstream fresh water accumulation of surface runoff and submarine groundwater discharge sgd to seawater may lower the salinity and significantly deplete the δ18o composition debnath et al 2019 therefore during the transition from monsoon to post monsoon season seawater has depleted δ18o composition fig 8 these significant changes in seawater chemical composition in terms of salinity and δ18o are also similar to the changes in groundwater from the shallow depths variations of δ18o composition in groundwater samples from the depth of 14 25 mbgl have relatively similar variability with seawater δ18o in pre monsoon and post monsoon season reflects possible swi effect while in monsoon season groundwater from the same depths have similar variability with meteoric water reflects possibility of interaction with local meteoric water in shallow aquifer fig 5a groundwater from the 30 50 mbgl depth have influence of meteoric water in seasonal scale observed from the δ18o variations but changes in salinity content over the seasons reflects less swi the swi effects in groundwater from the depth of 30 50 mbgl is lesser than the groundwater from the 14 25 mbgl bivariate plot of δ18o vs salinity shows that groundwater from 14 25 and 30 50 mbgl depth range fall within the seasonal seawater region more likely groundwater samples from the 14 25 mbgl have higher salinity and relatively heavier δ18o composition which surpluses the seawater regime might be due to conservative behaviour of salinity with higher swi effects fig 10 a and b groundwater samples from the depth of 115 and 333 mbgl were falling outside the seasonal seawater region fig 10c and d slope of the groundwater samples from this depth also deviated from lmwl and gmwl suggesting recharge during different climatic conditions mukherjee et al 2007b the δ18o signatures of groundwater samples at 115 mbgl depth show approximately similar results reported in aggarwal et al 2000 though the minimal shift in δ18o values 3 occurs due to the circulation of seawater and the location near to the bob groundwater samples from the depth of 333 mbgl have similar δ18o signature 3 to 6 as reported in mukherjee et al 2007b and aggarwal et al 2000 changes in salinity content during pre and post monsoon are negligible at both the depths of 115 and 333 mbgl this may be caused due to hydrostratigraphic differences or by the circulation of seawater in far offshore distances which may not have reached the nearshore locations of deeper coastal aquifer spatial and depth wise variation of isotopic composition may not always explain the mixing of other source water with groundwater a study from majumder et al 2011 showed that groundwater from shallow depths 70 mbgl have average isotopic composition of 4 1 and another study at meghna and south east estuary of bangladesh reported that the δ18o composition was 2 75 for the depth of 50 m hoque and burgess 2012 the study of majumder et al 2011 also reported deep groundwater have an average δ18o composition of 3 5 but the groundwater from near coastal zone were more enriched and have values within the range of 2 1 to 1 0 in this present study we observed similar trend of δ18o values from enrichment in shallow depths to depletion in deeper depth with changes in salinity δ18o values in deep aquifer in our study area is within the range of 5 04 to 2 22 depth 115 mbgl and 4 43 to 2 93 depth 333 mbgl is close to the other reported studies of aggarwal et al 2000 mukherjee et al 2007b majumder et al 2011 and hoque and burgess 2012 spatially salinity content varies from near shore location to inland within this small 16 km2 area high salinity was observed in shallow depth 14 25 mbgl and at nearshore location location a than other inland locations and deeper depths similarly wide variability of d excess was observed in the depth of 14 25 mbgl at location a near the shoreline and location b 1 5 km inland and comparatively low d excess at location c and d but higher at e owing to its proximity to the shoreline fig 11 more interestingly observed d excess was higher in post monsoon season for 30 40 mbgl depths than 14 25 mbgl in location c and d certain changes in monsoonal salinity and δ18o at location c and d might be a resultant of dense mangrove forest presence of mangrove forest ahead of location c and d controls the interaction process of groundwater with the seawater possible changes in groundwater salinization in shallow aquifer are not completely influenced by swi the changes in salinity in shallow depths were exaggerated by the intensive land use pattern like farming of brackish water fishes which was evident in the studied area 4 2 depth wise variation of d excess observed d excess values of groundwater samples from 14 25 mbgl are similar to the rainfall d excess values in monsoon season which depicts the possible mixing of meteoric water with shallow groundwater but d excess values for the shallower depths 14 25 mbgl in pre monsoon have similar variability like seawater than that of the rainfall reflects dominant circulation of seawater in that season figs 9a and 12 a the dominant mixing of meteoric water with shallow groundwater might be due to the small vertical distance travel to reach saturated water level evaporative enrichment was also observed for the groundwater samples from the depth of 30 50 mbgl which was comparatively lower than the groundwater from 14 to 25 mbgl depth fig 9a and 12a the highest observed d excess value for the depth of 333 mbgl was 12 with an average of 6 denotes lower evaporation effects on recharge in deeper depths this higher depth d excess values are close to the values from higher himalayas d excess value 10 joshi et al 2018 along with surface water mixture d excess values 5 fig 12b 4 3 mixing of sw gw groundwater samples from the depth of 14 25 mbgl have a dominant interaction with seawater f seaw 63 in pre monsoon reflects from the two component mixing model with lesser seawater interaction f seaw 59 in monsoon season highest average salinity with lower seawater fraction and depleted δ18o 1 93 in monsoon season suggests interaction with the meteoric water with highest evaporative enrichment again in post monsoon season when water level exhibit a decreasing trend δ18o gets depleted and presence of lower seawater fraction f seaw 57 was observed fig 13 groundwater from the depth of 30 50 mbgl have the highest influence of seawater circulation in pre monsoon season f seaw 58 19ppt and 2 1 than monsoon f seaw 53 18ppt and 2 2 and post monsoon season f seaw 51 25ppt and 2 3 observed from the mixing model salinity and δ18o variations the average salinity of 30 50 mbgl depth 18ppt across all the seasons has been always much lower than the groundwater samples from the depth of 14 25 mbgl average 30ppt groundwater from the deeper depths have lower fraction of seawater f seaw 30 which varies with the season the changes in δ18o composition for the deeper depths depict the longer residence time of the groundwater mukherjee et al 2007b aggarwal et al 2000 changes in salinity content might be a result of down word migration of saline water from the shallow depths more than the swi from the bob negligible influence of swi from the bob might be due to the longer distance to travel by the intruded water the minimal presence of saline water f seaw 30 might be the result of regional hydraulic connectivity between the shallow and deeper aquifer than the local connectivity 4 4 possible effect of pumping on sw gw interaction process and hydraulic connectivity to identify the hydraulic connectivity and possible local to regional groundwater flow pattern between shallow and deeper depths water level from the depth of 15 and 115 mbgl have been plotted with the δ18o composition fig 13c and d the hydraulic connectivity between the groundwater from shallow unconfined 14 25 mbgl semi confined 30 50 mbgl aquifer to confined deeper aquifer was observed from the changes in hydraulic heads across the season in diurnal scale although the lithostratigraphic structure showed that locally shallower unconfined layer is disconnected from deeper confining unit by approximate 33 m hard clay layer from the 52 to 85 mbgl fig 13a the changes in groundwater level are wider in shallow depth 1 55 m but are synchronous to the deeper depth 0 55 m the changes in δ18o composition in both shallow and deeper depths are dissimilar fig 13c and d the trend of δ18o composition variations between 14 25 and 30 50 mbgl is similar while 115 and 333 mbgl is similar to each other respectively fig 13c and d but the trend and ranges of δ18o composition was different in shallow 14 25 and 30 50 mbgl than deeper depths 100 mbgl the range of isotopic signature in shallow depths varied within the ranges of 3 5 to 1 where as in deeper depths it ranges from 5 to 2 this changes in δ18o composition of 14 25 and 30 50 mbgl with water level fluctuation depicts that the local flow is dominant both in horizontal and vertical direction between these shallow unconfined up to 25 mbgl and semi confined layer 30 50 mbgl but the different ranges of δ18o composition at the depths of 115 and 333 mbgl shows less to negligible local flow with dominant regional groundwater flow fig 13a but the trends of δ18o changes depict the possible regional scale hydraulic connectivity in groundwater of heterogeneous aquifer system with minimal chances of transportation of solutes to deeper depths as per mukherjee et al 2007a the aquifer structure of western bengal basin varied from the northern to southern part there was several discontinuous aquitards in to multiple occasionally connected layers stretched up to few hundreds of kilometres from the southern part of the basin these discontinuous connected layers have differences in chemistry from upper to lower layer but the presence of high salinity in shallow groundwater is a resultant of swi from the bob mukherjee et al 2009 mukherjee et al 2007a groundwater from the 333 mbgl is just below the murshidabad aquitard might be from another deeper aquifer system which have a similar pattern of δ18o variation with the groundwater from the depths of 115 mbgl described previously this similar variation of δ18o composition in 115 mbgl with the 333 mbgl shows a significant hydraulic connection between these two depths although the aquifer aquitard framework above 300 mbgl depth was unknown but it signifies the plausible discontinuity of murshidabad aquitard in far inland and a strong hydraulic connection with dominant regional flow within these two deeper aquifer this hydraulic connection between shallow and deeper depths within this complex lithostratigraphic unit indicates a possible threat of excessive groundwater pumping towards seawater encroachment the aquifer heterogeneity due to variable sedimentary framework in relation with anthropogenic activity controls the groundwater flow and recharge processes in far inland van dijk et al 2016 joshi et al 2018 conceptually the decline of piezometric head in deeper aquifers would attract hydrodynamic transport of solutes from the shallower depths along enhanced vertical gradients as well as potential swi from the adjoining bob resultant swi will deplete the fresh groundwater resources in near future for local residents in delta fronts and in distant future up to far inlands of bengal basin if the groundwater pumping would not have managed the salinization of coastal aquifers would be more pervasive rapid and acute if hydraulic connectivity exists across local scale heterogeneous aquifers mukherjee et al 2009 indicated the presence of both fresh and brackish groundwater residence in isolated pockets within these complex aquifer frameworks of the study area if groundwater is extracted at an unsustainable rate from these aquifers subsequent disruption of regional groundwater flow pattern can lead to transport of saline water to fresh water aquifers sikdar et al 2001 4 5 implications to coastal resources in the backdrop of arsenic and salinity problem in shallow alluvial groundwater system the threat to deeper groundwater resources been poorly understood the hydraulic inter connectedness of deeper groundwater resources depicts that the pumping effect from one level may have impacts both from above and below level of pumping which may not be significantly explored over a short period of times slr amplification of storm surges and intensification of rainfall that results from climate change may exacerbate threats to the quality of deep groundwater due to the hydraulic interconnection with shallow contaminated groundwater resources in global alluvial settings the changes in salinity across vertical hydraulic profiles are consistent with human induced gradients vertical downward gradients reflect regional groundwater discharge near coastal area although in our study upward hydraulic gradients reflecting regional groundwater discharge are restricted to extreme coastal locations by enhancing the salinity content due to brackish water encroachment one important implication of coastal groundwater is of the salinization associated with vulnerability of fresh groundwater resources to slr climate induced slr is not directly related to lateral seawater intrusion rather it depends up on the hydraulic properties and a balance with rising sea levels although not considered in this study werner and simmons 2009 michael et al 2013 holding and allen 2015 examples of shallow groundwater salinization due to local storm surges in coastal areas have been recorded in the floridan and lousiana coast of usa by 2005 hurricane katrina tomaszewski and lovelace 2005 and the indian coast of sundarbans by 2009 cyclone aila kabir et al 2015 the vertical salinization of coastal aquifer due to ocean surges is dependent mainly on the vertical hydraulic connectivity and the topography of the area the oceanic surge sourced inundation in areas with the low topographic gradient have strong influence on the spatial heterogeneity and extent of groundwater salinization over time yu et al 2016 this whole process has a strong impact on subsurface biogeochemical cycles and solute exchanges sawyer et al 2016 spatial and temporal relationship of salinity ph and redox frei and fleckenstein 2014 and nutrient cycling chambers and osborne 2013 of in the near surface coastal aquifers even though traditionally the sundarbans have managed the salinity problem and the distribution of its species and productivity raha et al 2012 ghosh et al 2015 but such rapid intrusion and decadal change in salinity abruptly affects abundance of its species and declining overall areas due to elevated level of salinity sundari trees h fomes are dying with declining forest growth and productivity raha et al 2012 4 6 implications for sustainable drinking water options our results are expected to contribute directly to development of policy for sustainable drinking water supply and to sustain the deeper groundwater resources salinity is a widespread problem in shallow groundwater in the coastal region but there has been threat of deeper fresh drinking groundwater depletion due to swi and abstraction induced vertical transport of contaminated water from shallower depths we have investigated hydraulic and hydrochemical connectivity between shallow and deeper groundwater and the nature and scale of impacts of pumping on deeper groundwater in this vertically hydraulically connected system based on this present scenario if the groundwater abstraction is not is not managed the scarcity of fresh drinking water will be prevalent in the near future although the rate of salinization and groundwater abstraction has not been considered in this study groundwater storage in modern alluvial system is under serious threat to the continuously increasing abstraction rate and future uncertainty of precipitation rate macdonald et al 2015 degradation of water quality in gbm aquifer is likely to be due to both phreatic salinization from shallow water tables and mobilization of brackish connate water within the heterogeneous aquifer aquitard system potable water should ideally have 1 ppt salinity which was only detected in groundwater at depths 300 mbgl while groundwater from shallow depth 14 25 and 30 50 mbgl has elevated salinity levels that are only usable for the farming of brackish saline water fish water from the depth of 115 mbgl have salinity range of 2 4 ppt is usable for non domestic purposes and limited purpose like aquaculture iwm 2003 however salinity of even this groundwater also increase 3 ppt across the hydrological year salinity 1 ppt as encountered in the study area with 100 000 groundwater dependent resident can lead to serious human health issues hence in absence of understanding of groundwater response and vulnerability to various stresses e g hydrologic climatic anthropogenic modifications the drinking water options for the huge human population living in the present study area as well as other delta front habitation can be severely jeopardized and more so with threat of predicted impending potential changes of global sea levels 5 conclusion this study documents the complex temporally variable multi depth salinity conditions and mixing processes between groundwater with adjoining surface water including a tropic ocean bay of bengal and discharging mega river ganges river the abstraction induced interaction processes leading to decline of groundwater level resulting in increased salinity is dominant in shallow depth than the deeper depth the groundwater level was fluctuating within the range of 1 55 and 0 55 m for the depths of 15 and 115 mbgl in entire period of study with higher range of variability of salinity in shallow depths and comparatively lower ranges in deeper depths this range of fluctuating water level with the variability of salinity content and δ18o composition in deeper depths salinity 1 4 ppt and δ18o 5 04 to 2 15 are notably different than the shallow depths salinity 3 45 ppt and δ18o 3 63 to 1 15 potentially influenced by aquifer heterogeneity anisotropy and climate induced recharging process that are potentially different from mechanisms existing at shallower aquifers our results demonstrate the spatio temporal variability of hydraulic and hydrochemical connectivity and exchanges between shallow and deeper groundwater the impacts of deep groundwater pumping generating strong vertical hydraulic gradient accentuate these differences groundwater extraction at unsustainable rates in these hydraulically connected porous aquifer systems specifically in a climate induced ecohydrologically vulnerable region like the study area would lead to disruption of groundwater flow and solute transport systems including salinization of yet fresh water zone the outcome of these approaches would be useful in understanding of groundwater response and vulnerability to various stresses e g

6360,with increasing population and urbanization in the deltas across global mega river basins groundwater stress is increasing due to changing ocean land disposition hydroclimatic extremes over exploitation and natural anthropogenic contamination such change in coastal hydrodynamic process makes an impact in to the resilience of groundwater sourced drinking water vulnerability the groundwater responses studied in this work in the ecologically vulnerable unesco world heritage site of the sundarbans delta front aquifers at the river ganges brahmaputra mega delta demonstrate a unique example of such intricacies and complexities high resolution temporal depth dependent hydraulic connectivity and hydrochemistry was studied for this complex climate driven tidal induced hydrological interactions between surface water seawater of bay of bengal bob and ganges river water with shallow and deep groundwater by stable isotopic δ18o and δd signatures and piezometry a wide range of salinity content and δ18o composition of groundwater samples for 14 25 salinity 3 45 ppt δ18o 3 63 to 1 15 and 30 50 meter below ground level mbgl salinity 5 25 ppt δ18o 3 41 to 1 34 was recorded while comparatively a narrow range of temporal variability was observed for the depths of 115 salinity 1 4 ppt δ18o 5 04 to 2 15 and 333mbgl salinity 1 to 3 ppt δ18o 4 43 to 2 81 study results revealed that vertical transport of solute has been induced by coastal hydrodynamics however human interferences in terms of groundwater abstraction and land use land cover change e g brackish aquaculture do have substantial impact on evolving groundwater response thereby impacting resilience to drinking water option in this densely populated area fluctuations of groundwater level in relation with δ18ogw composition showed shallow depths 14 50 mbgl are hydraulically connected by local flow and conducive of chemical exchanges the deeper groundwater 115 330 mbgl depths flow suggests regional scale hydraulic connections along flow paths in spite of sub meter scale seasonal groundwater level changes salinity variability is observed between 1 and 4 ppt at 100 mbgl depths suggest mixing between chemically distinct water reservoirs conserving hydraulic mass balance however such observation suggests severe implications for groundwater vulnerability which might aggravate with future intensification of irrigational abstraction as well as with changing hydroclimatological regime and extreme events thus future planning and management strategies of sustainable supply of safe water in such ecologically sensitive groundwater systems need to incorporate such dynamic chemical evolution keywords isotopic composition mixing model groundwater sundarbans ganges delta 1 introduction assessment of groundwater quality in an active alluvial system needs attention in the field of surface water groundwater sw gw interaction study near tropical ocean both by piezometry and hydrogeochemistry from long past to present day alluvial systems are being exposed to fluvio dynamic process sea level changes and tectonic movements mukherjee et al 2009 with the changing time groundwater is being subjected to geogenic contamination and in the present day by anthropogenic stresses both in shallow and deeper aquifer especially near the tropical ocean excessive abstraction of groundwater more than the rate of recharge has lead to the land subsidence declining base flow to the rivers salt water intrusion swi and water quality degradation in different parts of the world fishman et al 2011 joshi et al 2018 mukherjee et al 2018 hussain et al 2018 mukherjee 2018 this trend of groundwater use has raised a question on the groundwater security in the 21st century especially in modern alluvial aquifer encompassed by global ocean globally swi near coastal areas are well documented but groundwater salinization always may not be because of swi the other sources of groundwater salinization include leakage of water from contaminated shallow aquifer entrapped saline water in clay layer connate saline water and upcoming of underlying brine waters jones et al 1999 vengosh et al 2002 huge abstraction of groundwater severely distorts the flow pattern sikdar et al 2001 michael et al 2013 induces high vertical hydraulic gradients with a wide cone of depression mukherjee et al 2007a this would affect the groundwater quality by inviting the contaminants from the surrounding sources 1 from the shallow depths 2 from the regional scale flow in deeper depths and 3 salinization of groundwater due to diffusion of connate water sikdar et al 2001 michael et al 2009 mukherjee et al 2011 uncontrolled abstraction of groundwater has a high chance of causing groundwater salinization in shallow aquifer due to pumping and density differences khan et al 2011 michael et al 2013 these density differences of fluids in low gradient system will change the fluid dynamics especially in shallow depths changes in deeper groundwater pumping trends would enhance the vertical flow from shallow depths and also transport to the deeper depths if the aquifer is hydraulically or physically connected therefore the hydrogeological conditions with hydraulic gradients are essential to understand these sw gw interactions where density dependent flow is plausible robinson et al 2006 this process of contamination of the shallow and deeper groundwater in various spatio temporal scale near tropical ocean is rarely hypothesized and addressed the ganga brahmaputra meghna gbm basin is an alluvial plain and according to physiographic characteristics divided in to five distinct regions which includes sundarbans a unesco world heritage site umitsu 1987 this fragile system represents a complex hydrogeological system resulting from constant physical and chemical evolution of the residing groundwater in various spatio temporal scales morphologically the study area is getting affected by 1 the regional tectonic setup in millennia scale 2 by coastal hydrodynamic behavior than fluvial action and 3 anthropogenic interferences in daily scale to annual scale ghosh and mukhopadhyay 2016 the importance of sw gw interaction in this dynamic area of indian sundarbans where sea level rise slr trend is 5 mm yr unnikrishnan et al 2015 has rarely been understood and hypothesized the present study was conducted in ganges delta front aquifer in sundarbans to address this global sw gw interaction issue in alluvial settings the primary objective of the study is to identify the sw gw interaction in heterogeneous aquifer aquitard framework from shallow to deeper depths in temporal scales by the application of stable water isotopes δ18o and δd coupled with salinity content the study focused on the examining off the influence of groundwater pumping in shallow and deeper depths and its plausible hydraulic connectivity with the seawater and surface water in the vicinity of tropical ocean 2 methodology 2 1 study area description the study area encompasses about 16 km2 area and lies between 21 33 22 87 n to 21 35 54 64 n latitude and 88 14 43 47 e to 88 17 13 98 e longitude fig 1 b the area is situated in the extreme western periphery of sundarbans which is a ganges delta front of namkhana community development block south 24 parganas district west bengal studied area is a part of the largest fluvio deltaic system drained jointly by river ganges and river bhagirathi hooghly the river bhagirathi hooghly passes through the west and the extreme southern part of the area extends till the bay of bengal bob this prograding delta has experienced marine transgression from 10 000 to 7000 years bp and resulted in the deposition of fine sediments

respectively mondal et al 2015 ghosh and mukhopadhyay 2016 2 2 hydrogeological condition due to its close proximity with bob and the tropic of cancer the study area experiences warm and humid climatic condition across all the seasons mukherjee et al 2007b based on rainfall pattern and changes in atmospheric temperature and water vapor end of february to june is considered as pre monsoon july to september as monsoon and october to beginning of february as post monsoon season the study area mostly experiences bulk of rainfall from the end of june to september fig 1c local convectional storms may contribute to some pre monsoonal rainfall and converged moisture source from indian ocean along with local moisture sources may be responsible for monsoonal rainfall events 2 3 hydrostratigraphy lithological structure of the bengal basin was previously explained by mukherjee et al 2007a to validate the aquifer aquitard framework lithologs of study location were collected from the public health engineering department phed government of west bengal database total 5 lithologs of drinking water and observation wells are used for this study area which were drilled all across the studied locations depths of all the logs range from the 115 to 300 meter below ground level mbgl fig 2 the lithology of the logs was recorded in 1 m vertical resolution the major types of unconsolidated sediments that are identified are clay clayey sand silty clay silty sand sandy clay fine sand medium sand and coarse sand from the general hydrogeological information these sediments are categorized in aquifer silty sand and sandy clay and aquitard clay clayey sand and silty clay framework the shallow depths have varying aquifer properties up to depths of 55 mbgl shallow depths are divided from the deeper depths by the clay and clayey sand layer which varies in depth range from 55 to maximum 90 mbgl fig 2 a deeper aquifer properties was identified around the depths of 105 mbgl in all the logs and another deeper layer was observed below the of 280 mbgl in basin scale the lithology is similar to the aquifer aquitard framework of western bengal basin proposed by mukherjee et al 2007a here we are comparing our logs with the basin scale aquifer aquitard framework as we are identifying the hydraulic connectivity of shallow and deeper aquifer in local to regional scale lithologically the aquifer of the studied area was classified in to three zones viz i shallow upper aquifer ii the main aquifer and iii the deeper aquifer the southern part of the bengal basin was considered as the shallow upper aquifer up to 60 mbgl the main aquifer is semi confined to locally unconfined which consists of medium to coarse grained sand with alternate gravel layers vary in thickness up to 75 m in southern part up to depth of 140 to 150 mbgl and the deeper confined aquifer 150 m separated from the main aquifer by a clay layer consists of medium to coarse sands with inter beds of silt and clay the main deeper aquifer in southern part of the basin 200 m have several intermediate depth clay aquitards which divide main aquifer into laterally connected confined aquifers mukherjee et al 2007a 2009 in the present study groundwater from fresh groundwater well of 333 mbgl has been considered which is beyond the studied depth of the hydrostratigraphic model of mukherjee et al 2007a 2 4 field instrumentation 2 4 1 groundwater sampling total fifteen installed wells have been considered in this present study of them 13 for groundwater sampling and 2 for the monitoring of groundwater levels thirteen installed observation wells were mainly considered for continuous monitoring of physical and chemical parameters of groundwater samples fig 2 the wells were installed at five locations a b c d and e in the depth ranges of 14 to 25 30 to 50 115 and 333 mbgl fig 2 each of the five wells were installed at a depth of 14 25 and 30 50mbgl in all five locations while location b and d each have two at 115 mbgl and location a have one observation well at 333 mbgl for the sw gw interaction study the groundwater samples were collected for a period of one hydrologic year from may to february of the successive year 2017 18 by maintaining 12 20 days interval and most accessible conditions in terms of weather and locations a total of 189 groundwater samples were considered in the present study across all seasons where total 71 samples were from 14 to 25 mbgl depth 76 samples from 30 to 50 mbgl 29 samples from 115 mbgl and 13 samples from 333 mbgl depth 2 4 2 surface water sampling to study the sw gw interaction in this dynamic environment one upstream location has been considered from river bhagirathi hooghly south 24 parganas fig 1a all the river water samples were collected in pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon seasons seawater samples from bob were collected from near shore location 21 34 15 73 n and 88 13 58 72 e in 7 to 10 days interval with best accessible and suitable weather conditions from march 2017 to may 2018 fig 1b 2 4 3 rainfall sampling and collection of data rainfall samples were collected during all the rainfall events at near shore location 21 33 37 24 n and 88 15 44 19 e of bob during studied period five samples from pre monsoon 51 and 13 samples from monsoon and post monsoon season were considered for studied period in present study total rainfall data for each month for last 5 years in at south 24 parganas district were collected from the indian meteorological department imd and presented in fig 1c average rainfall for last five years was 1806 mm year with minimum 1579 mm in the year of 2014 and maximum 2300 mm in 2013 imd 2017 the total rainfall for studied period of 2017 was found to be highest in monsoon season 1024 mm with an average of 341 mm for the monsoon months whereas lowest recorded average rainfall was in pre monsoon total 174 mm avg 87 mm than post monsoon season total 337 mm avg 168 mm rainfall monthly amount are compared with the composite of δ18o values in monthly scale in section 3 1 the monthly average δ18o of rainfall was calculated by considering the number of rainfall events for each of the months rather than the days of respective months therefore these point data cannot be used to investigate the causes of daily or event based variations in precipitation amount over the processes in this studied hydrological year 2 4 4 piezometry two water level loggers were installed at depth of 15 and 115 mbgl in location c and only one barologger was installed at 24 mbgl of location e water level sensors solinist levelogger 3001 were used to measure the sub meter scale water level fluctuations the water level driver was installed at location c in a well of 15 and 115 mbgl depths with a pre set 30 minutes interval for data collection a barologger was also installed in location e to record atmospheric pressure the depths of groundwater level are represented in reversed order with respect of ground surface elevation the level logger measures groundwater levels with an accuracy of 0 05 fs full scale while barologger measures and logs changes in atmospheric pressure which are then used to compensate water level readings recorded by the level logger with an accuracy of 0 05 kpa 2 5 sample preservation and analysis river water seawater and groundwater samples were collected by following standard hydrochemical procedures wood 1981 groundwater samples were collected from the observation wells after flushing for 30 40 minutes in order to obtain representative samples under minimal atmospheric contact salinity was measured using multi parameter probe hanna hi929829 and recorded after stabilization of field parameters samples were filtered through 0 22 µm filter paper in in situ condition and preserved in 8 ml hdpe bottle without headspace for isotopic analysis collected samples were analyzed in high precision laser cavity ring down spectrometry method picarro inc model no l2130 i without further treatment of the samples thorsen et al 2011 at the laboratory of school of environmental science and engineering indian institute of technology kharagpur iit kharagpur samples were filled in 1 5 ml air tight glass vials and injected through 10 µl syringe to vaporizer for analysis of stable water isotope ratios all the high saline samples were measured without the salt liner which reduces the effect of salt deposition on vaporizer therefore to avoid the effect of salinity and high tds samples were measured in high precision mode of given 6 run for each samples and considered only last 3 results of the sample to avoid the memory effect walker et al 2016 analytical precisions were less than 1 0 and 0 1 for δd and δ18o respectively conventional ratios of 18o 16o and 2h 1h were expressed in delta notations of their relative abundances as deviations in per mil from vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow analysed samples were normalized to vsmow by the replicate analysis with respect to internal standard used internal standard was calibrated to vsmow and standard light antarctic precipitation slap certified reference materials 2 6 mixing model the mixing of upstream fresh water and seawater from bob with groundwater at the study site and at different depth involves two or more discrete end members that mix due to convergence of different source water through the aquifer media it was assumed that the groundwater gw of gangetic delta front aquifers mixes with two components i e river water rw and seawater seaw and the numerical equation of mixed groundwater can be expressed by eq 1 rai et al 2009 ghosh et al 2013 we have quantified the fraction of seawater and river water mixes with the groundwater of the study area by two component separation approach yehdegho et al 1997 stichler et al 1986 to find the rw and seaw component fraction on groundwater we have used δ18o concentration of rw and seaw samples in a solute mass balance equation the generic mass balance equation looks like eq 2 the calculated fraction river water f rw from the eq 2 is used to calculate the seawater fraction f seaw from the eq 1 to find out the mixed proportional of f rw and f seaw in groundwater f gw after the calculation of the fraction from eq 1 was converted to percentage of rw and seaw with respect to gw 1 f gw f rw f seaw 2 f rw δ 18 o gw δ 18 o seaw δ 18 o rw δ 18 o seaw where f rw and f seaw denote proportion of river water and seawater respectively that mixes with the groundwater f gw 3 result 3 1 rainfall isotopic variation the measured δ18o and δd composition of rainwater samples ranges from 7 42 to 0 33 and 52 to 16 in pre monsoon season 13 4 to 4 89 and 92 to 32 in monsoon season and 13 63 to 9 74 and 102 to 66 in post monsoon season respectively changes in median δ18o composition of rainfall have an inverse relationship with the total rainfall amount in all the observed months fig 3 a highest depleted δ18o composition was observed δ18o 13 63 at beginning of post monsoon season month october observed highest median depleted δ18o composition 8 98 was recorded in post monsoon season than monsoon and pre monsoon season there was a distinct inverse relation of depleted δ18o with amount rainfall which represents a signature of atmospheric moisture source responsible for rainfall in monthly scale variations fig 3a the observed variations of rainfall δ18o composition with the amount in this present study is similar to the case of tropical rainfall gourcy et al 2005 these significant variations in rainfall isotopic composition could be modulated by large scale process like convection associated with the monsoonal intra seasonal oscillation additionally low pressure system can significantly reduce the isotopic compositions which may have influence on moisture source of that area sengupta and ravichandran 2001 sengupta et al 2013 chakraborty et al 2016 the global meteoric water line gmwl is considered as reference line which is linearly related to the value of precipitation that has not been evaporated as δd 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 the δ18o and δd values of rainwater samples are plotted to develop local meteoric water line lmwl eq 3 fig 4 and the calculated slope of the lmwl is 7 5 which is lower than that of the gmwl m 8 the calculated slope of the lmwl in this present study is also lower than the calculated weighted δd 8 14δ18o 10 9 r2 0 98 and unweighted δd 8 07δ18o 9 9 r2 0 98 gmwl of gourcy et al 2005 the seasonal isotopic values vary significantly and the seasonal slope for the lmwl has also been calculated the calculated slope of the pre monsoonal lmwl prem eq 4 is 7 6 whereas the monsoonal lmwl m eq 5 and post monsoonal lmwl postm eq 6 calculated slopes are 7 2 and 8 2 respectively the slope of lmwl prem and lmwl m are lower than that of the gmwl whereas the lmwl postm slope is equal to that of the gmwl the equations for the meteoric water lines are represented here through eqs 4 6 the seasonal variations in intercepts in all the seasonal lmwl are might be a resultant of evaporation effects due to temperature variations in different seasons or local re evaporated moisture vapour sourced rainfall in different seasons 3 lmwl δ d 7 5 δ 18 o 5 12 r 2 0 97 4 lmwl prem δ d 7 6 δ 18 o 9 47 r 2 0 87 5 lmwl m δ d 7 2 δ 18 o 3 21 r 2 0 95 6 lmwl postm δ d 8 2 δ 18 o 12 24 r 2 0 92 the deuterium excess d excess value is calculated by using the equation d δd 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 and remarkable changes were observed in the transition periods between two seasons fig 3b a sharp decrease of d excess value was observed in the transition between pre monsoon and monsoon season and a sharp increase of d excess value was observed between monsoon and post monsoon season this sharp change in d excess values of respective seasons might be due to the convergence of multiple moisture source and locally re evaporated moisture sources of that particular area the changes in rainfall d excess values are following the pattern of reported values in northern hemisphere froehlich et al 2002 pfahl and sodemann 2014 the observed d excess values are highest in september and lowest around the month of july fig 3b the overall selected trend of d excess variability in study period is similar to reported study in kolkata by sengupta and sarkar 2006 which approximately 130 km away from our location besides the higher variability we got negative d excess values of rainfall the relatively low mean condensation temperature for the heaviest rain i e very high clouds possibly causes a negative d excess possibly the heavy rainfall from tropical cyclone very high clouds hereby has a negative d excess this similar kind of negative d excess values of rainfall was also reported by the fudeyasu et al 2008 3 2 groundwater 3 2 1 temporal variation of stable water isotopic composition of groundwater samples δ18o composition of groundwater samples for the pre monsoon season varies from 2 86 to 1 74 for 14 25 mbgl n 23 3 41 to 2 08 for 30 50 mbgl n 23 5 04 to 2 73 for 115 mbgl n 9 and 4 43 to 3 36 for the depth of 333 mbgl n 4 in monsoon season δ18o composition ranges from 3 44 to 1 93 3 15 to 2 21 3 20 to 2 57 and 3 58 to 3 24 for the depth of 14 25 n 17 30 50 n 19 115 n 7 and 333 mbgl n 3 respectively whereas in post monsoon δ18o varies from 3 63 to 2 01 3 27 to 2 32 2 83 to 2 48 and 3 13 to 3 04 for the depth of 14 25 n 31 30 50 n 34 115 n 13 and 333 mbgl n 6 table 1 sub parallel trend line of δd vs δ18o of groundwater samples was plotted with the gmwl and lmwl for understanding the degree of interaction with meteoric water in present climatic condition fig 5 the seasonal variation of rainfall isotopic signature is a function of local fluctuating weather conditions humidity and variable mixing of vapour mass craig and gordon 1965 gat 1971 araguas araguas et al 2000 the discreet clustering of groundwater samples around the lmwl and gmwl indicate meteoric recharge across the seasons groundwater samples of 14 25 and 30 50 mbgl have wide range of δ18o values with respect to115 and 333 mbgl fig 5e for the groundwater of 14 25 mbgl depth monsoonal slope m 6 48 is close to monsoonal lmwl but the slopes for other two seasons are deviating from the lmwl fig 5a groundwater samples from the depth of 30 50 mbgl have slope m 5 across all seasons which is lower than that of lmwl and gmwl fig 5b whereas the groundwater samples from the depth of 115 and 333 mbgl deviate from the lmwl and gmwl slope lies within 4 across all three seasons fig 5c and d 3 2 2 variation of groundwater salinity content salinity content of the groundwater samples vary from 17 to 42 ppt for 14 25 mbgl 10 25 ppt for 30 50 mbgl and 2 3 ppt for 115 and 333 mbgl during pre monsoon season and 21 45 ppt 11 25 ppt 1 4 ppt and 1 2 ppt in 14 25 30 50 115 and 333 mbgl respectively for monsoon season however in post monsoon season salinity varies from 3 to 44 ppt 5 to 22 ppt 1 to 4 ppt and 1 to 2 ppt at 14 25 30 50 115 and 333 mbgl depths wide variability in the salinity of groundwater samples have been observed in the depth range of 14 25 and 30 50 mbgl with the standard deviation of 7 7 and 3 5 respectively fig 6 a 3 2 3 fluctuation of groundwater level the groundwater level in 15 and 115 mbgl depths varies significantly across the seasons average groundwater level from the surface varies from 1 46 to 1 32 mbgl and 2 1 to 2 08 mbgl in end of pre monsoon for the depths of 15 and 115 mbgl the groundwater level was risen up to the 0 36 and 1 41 mbgl for the depths of 15 and 115 mbgl in monsoon season when rainfall is high and again it fells down to 0 93 and 2 00 mbgl in post monsoon season with low rainfall amount respectively but the fluctuations of water level were significant for the shallow depth where it varies within the range of 1 55 m across the season fluctuation of groundwater level was relatively lower in the depth of 115 mbgl than 15 mbgl the groundwater level at the depth of 115 m fluctuates within a range of 0 55 m across the hydrological year fig 7 more interestingly groundwater fluctuations were not uniform across all the seasons in shallow depth which significantly rising up to 0 65 m within five days interval similar trend of fluctuation for the deeper depth was recorded with respect to shallow depths but the range of fluctuations is comparatively low 3 3 variation of stable isotopic composition and salinity content of river water and seawater average δ18o compositions of the river water were 4 95 4 58 and 4 98 in pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon season respectively whereas average δd composition were 41 41 41 05 and 41 36 in the aforesaid three seasons respectively average observed salinity was 0 37 ppt with maximum 0 44 ppt in pre monsoon and minimum 0 26 ppt in post monsoon season seawater samples n 35 from bob shows a wide range of δ18o composition across all three seasons for the entire study period variability of δ18o and δd values of seawater ranges from 2 31 to 0 19 and 17 67 to 1 05 in pre monsoon n 14 2 59 to 0 11 and 24 to 0 59 in monsoon n 11 and 2 99 to 1 47 and 22 to 11 45 in post monsoon n 10 season respectively the d excess values of seawater ranges from 7 68 to 2 29 across all three seasons the highest negative d excess values of seawater were observed in pre monsoon season while highest value also observed in pre monsoon season in monsoon and post monsoon season the d excess values ranges from 5 84 to 0 77 avg 2 32 and 2 88 to 1 08 avg 0 17 fig 9 the seasonal changes in d excess values are related to intensity of evaporation from sea surface possible highest negative d excess in pre monsoon season might be a resultant of very high evaporation or sudden intense rainfall possibly due to some atmospheric depressions the change in d excess over the monsoon season is might be a resultant of surface water flux to seawater of bob and monsoonal intense rainfall over bob salinity content of the seawater also varies seasonally recorded highest in pre monsoon avg 25 ppt with gradually decrease in monsoon avg 19 ppt and again increase in post monsoon season avg 24 ppt depleted isotopic signature with low salinity content in seawater samples of monsoon and post monsoon season is an indication of possible higher monsoonal discharge of fresh water from river bhagirathi hooghly local regional rainfall runoff to bob and fresh groundwater discharge 3 4 mixing component the average δ18o composition of river water rw 4 84 and seawater seaw 0 99 was used in eqs 1 and 2 for estimation of mixing source component to groundwater average value for seawater has been calculated for this mixing model only by considering the pre monsoon and late post monsoon δ18o composition due to higher monsoonal variability of seawater δ18o composition than non monsoon seasons the δ18o composition of seawater from bob varies within the range of 1 0 to 1 from shallow to the deeper depths in reported study of sengupta et al 2013 but in present study the range of bob δ18ovariability is very high might be due to the huge amount of surface water flux from the bhagirathi hooghly river or sgd to bob which changes the bob δ18o values from 3 0 to 2 0 in seasonal scale based on the observed higher δ18o variability of bob seawater and to avoid the biased end member output of two component mixing model we have chosen the average δ18o values of seawater as previously described in this section two component end member mixing analysis suggests that groundwater from the depth of 14 25 mbgl have dominant proportion of seawater with highest in pre monsoon season f seaw 84 similarly groundwater from the depth of 30 50 mbgl have highest seawater proportion in pre monsoon season f seaw 77 and it goes down in post monsoon season f seaw 69 groundwater from the depth of 333 mbgl has higher river water proportion than the groundwater from 115 mbgl all the river water proportion in groundwater at 333 mbgl depth are more than 50 whereas groundwater at 115 mbgl have seasonal river water proportion f rw within 35 41 4 discussion 4 1 spatial and depth wise variation of isotopic composition and salinity content of groundwater with seawater and rainfall seawater from bob has significant variation on salinity and δ18o content on seasonal scale whereas river water has negligible range of variation the changes in salinity and δ18o composition of bob may be controlled by the local to regional rainfall and upstream fresh water discharge higher discharge of upstream fresh water accumulation of surface runoff and submarine groundwater discharge sgd to seawater may lower the salinity and significantly deplete the δ18o composition debnath et al 2019 therefore during the transition from monsoon to post monsoon season seawater has depleted δ18o composition fig 8 these significant changes in seawater chemical composition in terms of salinity and δ18o are also similar to the changes in groundwater from the shallow depths variations of δ18o composition in groundwater samples from the depth of 14 25 mbgl have relatively similar variability with seawater δ18o in pre monsoon and post monsoon season reflects possible swi effect while in monsoon season groundwater from the same depths have similar variability with meteoric water reflects possibility of interaction with local meteoric water in shallow aquifer fig 5a groundwater from the 30 50 mbgl depth have influence of meteoric water in seasonal scale observed from the δ18o variations but changes in salinity content over the seasons reflects less swi the swi effects in groundwater from the depth of 30 50 mbgl is lesser than the groundwater from the 14 25 mbgl bivariate plot of δ18o vs salinity shows that groundwater from 14 25 and 30 50 mbgl depth range fall within the seasonal seawater region more likely groundwater samples from the 14 25 mbgl have higher salinity and relatively heavier δ18o composition which surpluses the seawater regime might be due to conservative behaviour of salinity with higher swi effects fig 10 a and b groundwater samples from the depth of 115 and 333 mbgl were falling outside the seasonal seawater region fig 10c and d slope of the groundwater samples from this depth also deviated from lmwl and gmwl suggesting recharge during different climatic conditions mukherjee et al 2007b the δ18o signatures of groundwater samples at 115 mbgl depth show approximately similar results reported in aggarwal et al 2000 though the minimal shift in δ18o values 3 occurs due to the circulation of seawater and the location near to the bob groundwater samples from the depth of 333 mbgl have similar δ18o signature 3 to 6 as reported in mukherjee et al 2007b and aggarwal et al 2000 changes in salinity content during pre and post monsoon are negligible at both the depths of 115 and 333 mbgl this may be caused due to hydrostratigraphic differences or by the circulation of seawater in far offshore distances which may not have reached the nearshore locations of deeper coastal aquifer spatial and depth wise variation of isotopic composition may not always explain the mixing of other source water with groundwater a study from majumder et al 2011 showed that groundwater from shallow depths 70 mbgl have average isotopic composition of 4 1 and another study at meghna and south east estuary of bangladesh reported that the δ18o composition was 2 75 for the depth of 50 m hoque and burgess 2012 the study of majumder et al 2011 also reported deep groundwater have an average δ18o composition of 3 5 but the groundwater from near coastal zone were more enriched and have values within the range of 2 1 to 1 0 in this present study we observed similar trend of δ18o values from enrichment in shallow depths to depletion in deeper depth with changes in salinity δ18o values in deep aquifer in our study area is within the range of 5 04 to 2 22 depth 115 mbgl and 4 43 to 2 93 depth 333 mbgl is close to the other reported studies of aggarwal et al 2000 mukherjee et al 2007b majumder et al 2011 and hoque and burgess 2012 spatially salinity content varies from near shore location to inland within this small 16 km2 area high salinity was observed in shallow depth 14 25 mbgl and at nearshore location location a than other inland locations and deeper depths similarly wide variability of d excess was observed in the depth of 14 25 mbgl at location a near the shoreline and location b 1 5 km inland and comparatively low d excess at location c and d but higher at e owing to its proximity to the shoreline fig 11 more interestingly observed d excess was higher in post monsoon season for 30 40 mbgl depths than 14 25 mbgl in location c and d certain changes in monsoonal salinity and δ18o at location c and d might be a resultant of dense mangrove forest presence of mangrove forest ahead of location c and d controls the interaction process of groundwater with the seawater possible changes in groundwater salinization in shallow aquifer are not completely influenced by swi the changes in salinity in shallow depths were exaggerated by the intensive land use pattern like farming of brackish water fishes which was evident in the studied area 4 2 depth wise variation of d excess observed d excess values of groundwater samples from 14 25 mbgl are similar to the rainfall d excess values in monsoon season which depicts the possible mixing of meteoric water with shallow groundwater but d excess values for the shallower depths 14 25 mbgl in pre monsoon have similar variability like seawater than that of the rainfall reflects dominant circulation of seawater in that season figs 9a and 12 a the dominant mixing of meteoric water with shallow groundwater might be due to the small vertical distance travel to reach saturated water level evaporative enrichment was also observed for the groundwater samples from the depth of 30 50 mbgl which was comparatively lower than the groundwater from 14 to 25 mbgl depth fig 9a and 12a the highest observed d excess value for the depth of 333 mbgl was 12 with an average of 6 denotes lower evaporation effects on recharge in deeper depths this higher depth d excess values are close to the values from higher himalayas d excess value 10 joshi et al 2018 along with surface water mixture d excess values 5 fig 12b 4 3 mixing of sw gw groundwater samples from the depth of 14 25 mbgl have a dominant interaction with seawater f seaw 63 in pre monsoon reflects from the two component mixing model with lesser seawater interaction f seaw 59 in monsoon season highest average salinity with lower seawater fraction and depleted δ18o 1 93 in monsoon season suggests interaction with the meteoric water with highest evaporative enrichment again in post monsoon season when water level exhibit a decreasing trend δ18o gets depleted and presence of lower seawater fraction f seaw 57 was observed fig 13 groundwater from the depth of 30 50 mbgl have the highest influence of seawater circulation in pre monsoon season f seaw 58 19ppt and 2 1 than monsoon f seaw 53 18ppt and 2 2 and post monsoon season f seaw 51 25ppt and 2 3 observed from the mixing model salinity and δ18o variations the average salinity of 30 50 mbgl depth 18ppt across all the seasons has been always much lower than the groundwater samples from the depth of 14 25 mbgl average 30ppt groundwater from the deeper depths have lower fraction of seawater f seaw 30 which varies with the season the changes in δ18o composition for the deeper depths depict the longer residence time of the groundwater mukherjee et al 2007b aggarwal et al 2000 changes in salinity content might be a result of down word migration of saline water from the shallow depths more than the swi from the bob negligible influence of swi from the bob might be due to the longer distance to travel by the intruded water the minimal presence of saline water f seaw 30 might be the result of regional hydraulic connectivity between the shallow and deeper aquifer than the local connectivity 4 4 possible effect of pumping on sw gw interaction process and hydraulic connectivity to identify the hydraulic connectivity and possible local to regional groundwater flow pattern between shallow and deeper depths water level from the depth of 15 and 115 mbgl have been plotted with the δ18o composition fig 13c and d the hydraulic connectivity between the groundwater from shallow unconfined 14 25 mbgl semi confined 30 50 mbgl aquifer to confined deeper aquifer was observed from the changes in hydraulic heads across the season in diurnal scale although the lithostratigraphic structure showed that locally shallower unconfined layer is disconnected from deeper confining unit by approximate 33 m hard clay layer from the 52 to 85 mbgl fig 13a the changes in groundwater level are wider in shallow depth 1 55 m but are synchronous to the deeper depth 0 55 m the changes in δ18o composition in both shallow and deeper depths are dissimilar fig 13c and d the trend of δ18o composition variations between 14 25 and 30 50 mbgl is similar while 115 and 333 mbgl is similar to each other respectively fig 13c and d but the trend and ranges of δ18o composition was different in shallow 14 25 and 30 50 mbgl than deeper depths 100 mbgl the range of isotopic signature in shallow depths varied within the ranges of 3 5 to 1 where as in deeper depths it ranges from 5 to 2 this changes in δ18o composition of 14 25 and 30 50 mbgl with water level fluctuation depicts that the local flow is dominant both in horizontal and vertical direction between these shallow unconfined up to 25 mbgl and semi confined layer 30 50 mbgl but the different ranges of δ18o composition at the depths of 115 and 333 mbgl shows less to negligible local flow with dominant regional groundwater flow fig 13a but the trends of δ18o changes depict the possible regional scale hydraulic connectivity in groundwater of heterogeneous aquifer system with minimal chances of transportation of solutes to deeper depths as per mukherjee et al 2007a the aquifer structure of western bengal basin varied from the northern to southern part there was several discontinuous aquitards in to multiple occasionally connected layers stretched up to few hundreds of kilometres from the southern part of the basin these discontinuous connected layers have differences in chemistry from upper to lower layer but the presence of high salinity in shallow groundwater is a resultant of swi from the bob mukherjee et al 2009 mukherjee et al 2007a groundwater from the 333 mbgl is just below the murshidabad aquitard might be from another deeper aquifer system which have a similar pattern of δ18o variation with the groundwater from the depths of 115 mbgl described previously this similar variation of δ18o composition in 115 mbgl with the 333 mbgl shows a significant hydraulic connection between these two depths although the aquifer aquitard framework above 300 mbgl depth was unknown but it signifies the plausible discontinuity of murshidabad aquitard in far inland and a strong hydraulic connection with dominant regional flow within these two deeper aquifer this hydraulic connection between shallow and deeper depths within this complex lithostratigraphic unit indicates a possible threat of excessive groundwater pumping towards seawater encroachment the aquifer heterogeneity due to variable sedimentary framework in relation with anthropogenic activity controls the groundwater flow and recharge processes in far inland van dijk et al 2016 joshi et al 2018 conceptually the decline of piezometric head in deeper aquifers would attract hydrodynamic transport of solutes from the shallower depths along enhanced vertical gradients as well as potential swi from the adjoining bob resultant swi will deplete the fresh groundwater resources in near future for local residents in delta fronts and in distant future up to far inlands of bengal basin if the groundwater pumping would not have managed the salinization of coastal aquifers would be more pervasive rapid and acute if hydraulic connectivity exists across local scale heterogeneous aquifers mukherjee et al 2009 indicated the presence of both fresh and brackish groundwater residence in isolated pockets within these complex aquifer frameworks of the study area if groundwater is extracted at an unsustainable rate from these aquifers subsequent disruption of regional groundwater flow pattern can lead to transport of saline water to fresh water aquifers sikdar et al 2001 4 5 implications to coastal resources in the backdrop of arsenic and salinity problem in shallow alluvial groundwater system the threat to deeper groundwater resources been poorly understood the hydraulic inter connectedness of deeper groundwater resources depicts that the pumping effect from one level may have impacts both from above and below level of pumping which may not be significantly explored over a short period of times slr amplification of storm surges and intensification of rainfall that results from climate change may exacerbate threats to the quality of deep groundwater due to the hydraulic interconnection with shallow contaminated groundwater resources in global alluvial settings the changes in salinity across vertical hydraulic profiles are consistent with human induced gradients vertical downward gradients reflect regional groundwater discharge near coastal area although in our study upward hydraulic gradients reflecting regional groundwater discharge are restricted to extreme coastal locations by enhancing the salinity content due to brackish water encroachment one important implication of coastal groundwater is of the salinization associated with vulnerability of fresh groundwater resources to slr climate induced slr is not directly related to lateral seawater intrusion rather it depends up on the hydraulic properties and a balance with rising sea levels although not considered in this study werner and simmons 2009 michael et al 2013 holding and allen 2015 examples of shallow groundwater salinization due to local storm surges in coastal areas have been recorded in the floridan and lousiana coast of usa by 2005 hurricane katrina tomaszewski and lovelace 2005 and the indian coast of sundarbans by 2009 cyclone aila kabir et al 2015 the vertical salinization of coastal aquifer due to ocean surges is dependent mainly on the vertical hydraulic connectivity and the topography of the area the oceanic surge sourced inundation in areas with the low topographic gradient have strong influence on the spatial heterogeneity and extent of groundwater salinization over time yu et al 2016 this whole process has a strong impact on subsurface biogeochemical cycles and solute exchanges sawyer et al 2016 spatial and temporal relationship of salinity ph and redox frei and fleckenstein 2014 and nutrient cycling chambers and osborne 2013 of in the near surface coastal aquifers even though traditionally the sundarbans have managed the salinity problem and the distribution of its species and productivity raha et al 2012 ghosh et al 2015 but such rapid intrusion and decadal change in salinity abruptly affects abundance of its species and declining overall areas due to elevated level of salinity sundari trees h fomes are dying with declining forest growth and productivity raha et al 2012 4 6 implications for sustainable drinking water options our results are expected to contribute directly to development of policy for sustainable drinking water supply and to sustain the deeper groundwater resources salinity is a widespread problem in shallow groundwater in the coastal region but there has been threat of deeper fresh drinking groundwater depletion due to swi and abstraction induced vertical transport of contaminated water from shallower depths we have investigated hydraulic and hydrochemical connectivity between shallow and deeper groundwater and the nature and scale of impacts of pumping on deeper groundwater in this vertically hydraulically connected system based on this present scenario if the groundwater abstraction is not is not managed the scarcity of fresh drinking water will be prevalent in the near future although the rate of salinization and groundwater abstraction has not been considered in this study groundwater storage in modern alluvial system is under serious threat to the continuously increasing abstraction rate and future uncertainty of precipitation rate macdonald et al 2015 degradation of water quality in gbm aquifer is likely to be due to both phreatic salinization from shallow water tables and mobilization of brackish connate water within the heterogeneous aquifer aquitard system potable water should ideally have 1 ppt salinity which was only detected in groundwater at depths 300 mbgl while groundwater from shallow depth 14 25 and 30 50 mbgl has elevated salinity levels that are only usable for the farming of brackish saline water fish water from the depth of 115 mbgl have salinity range of 2 4 ppt is usable for non domestic purposes and limited purpose like aquaculture iwm 2003 however salinity of even this groundwater also increase 3 ppt across the hydrological year salinity 1 ppt as encountered in the study area with 100 000 groundwater dependent resident can lead to serious human health issues hence in absence of understanding of groundwater response and vulnerability to various stresses e g hydrologic climatic anthropogenic modifications the drinking water options for the huge human population living in the present study area as well as other delta front habitation can be severely jeopardized and more so with threat of predicted impending potential changes of global sea levels 5 conclusion this study documents the complex temporally variable multi depth salinity conditions and mixing processes between groundwater with adjoining surface water including a tropic ocean bay of bengal and discharging mega river ganges river the abstraction induced interaction processes leading to decline of groundwater level resulting in increased salinity is dominant in shallow depth than the deeper depth the groundwater level was fluctuating within the range of 1 55 and 0 55 m for the depths of 15 and 115 mbgl in entire period of study with higher range of variability of salinity in shallow depths and comparatively lower ranges in deeper depths this range of fluctuating water level with the variability of salinity content and δ18o composition in deeper depths salinity 1 4 ppt and δ18o 5 04 to 2 15 are notably different than the shallow depths salinity 3 45 ppt and δ18o 3 63 to 1 15 potentially influenced by aquifer heterogeneity anisotropy and climate induced recharging process that are potentially different from mechanisms existing at shallower aquifers our results demonstrate the spatio temporal variability of hydraulic and hydrochemical connectivity and exchanges between shallow and deeper groundwater the impacts of deep groundwater pumping generating strong vertical hydraulic gradient accentuate these differences groundwater extraction at unsustainable rates in these hydraulically connected porous aquifer systems specifically in a climate induced ecohydrologically vulnerable region like the study area would lead to disruption of groundwater flow and solute transport systems including salinization of yet fresh water zone the outcome of these approaches would be useful in understanding of groundwater response and vulnerability to various stresses e g

6361,the stable hydrogen δd and oxygen δ18o isotope composition of modern meteoric water are influenced by changes in global temperature rayleigh distillation processes and moisture transport history however on a global scale the relative influence of these different meteorological variables is spatially heterogeneous we collected daily precipitation samples from meteorological stations in the armenian highlands for a period of one year in order to determine the constraints on δd and δ18o and relationship to broader climatic conditions these data are coupled with hysplit back trajectory analysis to determine how these compositions relate to moisture source and transport path multivariate analysis shows the strongest relationship between δd and δ18o and climate variables is temperature at the sampling site along with temperature the intensity of the north atlantic oscillation a pattern of atmospheric circulation which determines the strength and location of northern hemisphere midlatitude westerlies is significant p 0 05 for both δ18o and δd values of precipitation this correlation between nao and isotopes in precipitation is also observed in four nearby gnip stations from 2008 to 2015 negative nao phases are associated with weakened westerlies which allows precipitation enriched in heavy isotopes from the mediterranean and southerly sources to penetrate into the armenian highlands whereas positive nao phases are associated with stronger westerlies bringing more negative precipitation from the black sea this relationship is most significant p 0 001 during the winter and spring months december to may these data demonstrate that paleo archives of δd and δ18o in the armenian highlands could serve as a tool to measure changes in the nao in the past

typical of precipitation in the northern hemisphere froehlich et al 2002 the relationship between δd and δ18o values of samples in this study is δ d 7 74 δ 18 o 10 32 in order for this regression to be comparable to the majority of the published literature on meteoric water lines we used an ordinary least square regression though recent publications have suggested alternatives for calculating local meteoric water lines crawford et al 2014 hughes and crawford 2012 this relationship is similar to the global meteoric water line craig 1961 and has a slightly steeper slope and higher intercept than gnip data from bordering turkey and georgia fig 5 since meteoric water lines can be influenced by source of precipitation the difference between the mwl in this study and the regional gnip data may be partially due to source effects see further discussion below 3 3 hysplit hysplit back trajectories for days with precipitation events are predominantly westerlies as is expected with the mid latitude location of armenia fig 6 clusters 2 4 and 6 8 back trajectories in these westerly clusters account for 45 of the total precipitation events during the collection period making this storm track the most common observed however three clusters do not follow this pattern fig 6 clusters 1 3 and 5 the mean trajectory of cluster 1 follows a southerly route to the armenian highland bringing precipitation from the red sea and persian gulf over the arabian peninsula and accounts for 25 of the precipitation events during the study period clusters 3 and 5 follow easterly tracks bringing precipitation from the caspian sea to the armenian highland and accounts for 30 of the precipitation events in the study period cluster 2 follows a westerly route with mean storm tracks following the northern border of the mediterranean sea mean storm tracks of cluster 6 11 also follow this more southern westerly trajectory passing over the anatolian peninsula and reaching the armenian highland clusters 4 12 7 2 and 8 3 follow a northern westerly route passing over the black sea 4 discussion a strong correlation between temperature at the sampling site and the isotopic values of precipitation is observed in the armenian highlands this correlation amounts to a change α of 0 47 c change in δ18o and a 3 54 c in δd these slopes are consistent with other measurements of precipitation isotope values in the mid latitudes bowen 2008 kohn and welker 2005 when compared to precipitation δd and δ18o turkey and georgia available from the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip the event based isotope and temperature regression is similar to the monthly gnip data fig 7 the data from this study has more variability than the gnip data likely due to the difference in sampling strategy monthly vs daily a lack of statistically significant correlations for the δd and δ18o values with elevation may be in part due to the nature of the data collected the relatively small difference in elevation between the stations included in this study 1 4 km between kapan and dilijan coupled with the high variability of event based temperatures may have obscured the relationship between elevation and precipitation isotope values further work expanding the elevation range of stations sampled as well as studying the spatial variability of individual precipitation events across multiple sampling sites could shed further light on this relationship other than temperature at the sampling site the only variable included in the multivariate analysis to have a significant correlation with both δd and δ18o is the nao index the intensity of the nao influences the location and strength of the mid latitude westerlies and as such influences air mass circulation over the armenian highlands negative nao phases are associated with weakened mid latitude westerlies and increased meridional flow hurrell et al 2003 75 of the precipitation events on days with a negative nao index fall in hysplit clusters 1 2 and 3 these clusters represent storm tracks that are southerlies cluster 1 south westerlies derived over the eastern mediterranean cluster 2 or easterlies derived over the caspian sea cluster 3 positive nao phases are associated with more northern westerly storm tracks typically passing over the black sea these observations of hysplit trajectories fit the expectations that strongly developed westerlies would penetrate into the armenian highlands during positive nao phases while weakened nao phases would allow easterlies and meridonal flow from the mediterranean sea the relationship between nao and isotopes in precipitation is negative meaning weakened westerlies systems negative nao index are associated with more positive isotope values given the penetration of southerlies and mediterranean storm tracks to the armenian highlands in these negative nao phases the isotope effect of the nao is likely associated with differences in the initial source water composition of cloud formation the mediterranean sea δ18o 2 δd 8 surface water has significantly more positive surface water isotope values than does the black sea δ18o 2 5 δd 22 dubinin and dubinina 2014 gat et al 1996 legrande and schmidt 2006 rank et al 1999 therefore clouds forming over these waters will lead to precipitation events with more positive isotope values the influence of the nao index on δd and δ18o values of precipitation in the armenian highlands is greatest during the winter and spring table 1 the intensity of the nao did not have a statistically significant effect on δd and δ18o values in the spring and summer months previous studies have documented a significant relationship between isotopes in precipitation and the nao in the winter field 2010 during winter the variability of the nao is highest hurrell et al 2003 whereas temperature variability in the armenian highlands was low during this period the statistically significant negative relationship between nao and precipitation isotope values is not limited to the event based samples collected in this study but is persistent in other meteorological stations in the southern caucasus region four stations in georgia bakuriani batumi tbilisi and telavi fig 1 with monthly δd and δ18o values collected from 2008 to 2015 in the gnip show this same relationship fig 8 monthly samples from these four stations n 186 are negatively correlated with monthly mean nao values the correlation coefficients for monthly samples in georgia δd pearson ρ 0 31 p 0 0001 δ18o pearson ρ 0 32 p 0 0001 in the long term gnip dataset is nearly identical to those from the event based samples in armenia δd pearson ρ 0 36 δ18o pearson ρ 0 35 the appearance of a significant relationship between nao and precipitation isotopes in independent monthly samples in the southern caucasus over a period of seven years further solidifies our interpretation of this relationship the relationship between δd and δ18o values in precipitation also differs by precipitation source fig 9 the slope of the meteoric water lines of samples with back trajectories over the black δ d 7 66 δ 18 o 8 44 and caspian seas δ d 7 61 δ 18 o 9 58 are lower with lower intercepts than the precipitation derived from samples in the mediterranean sea δ d 7 86 δ 18 o 11 21 and southerly winds δ d 7 74 δ 18 o 11 17 though this difference is not significant mediterranean sea precipitation has previously been demonstrated to produce meteoric water lines with high intercepts i e high d excess values gat and carmi 1970 in agreement with the data collected here the samples originating from black sea precipitation fig 6 clusters 4 7 and 8 show a similar meteoric water line to gnip samples from batumi georgia and rize turkey δ d 7 20 δ 18 o 8 04 two stations which are directly on the black sea the nearest gnip to the caspian sea is astrakhan russia which has a similar slope but much lower intercept to its meteoric water line δ d 7 34 δ 18 o 1 28 compared to the easterly precipitation tracks this may indicate that while there is incorporation of evaporation of caspian sea waters in our precipitation data it is not the source for most of the cloud moisture d excess values show source dependent seasonal changes fig 10 generally precipitation samples from the caspian and southerly sources have higher d excess values than do events from the black and mediterranean seas since moisture recycling can increase the d excess values of clouds during transport froehlich et al 2008 jouzel et al 1997 it is likely that the caspian and southerly precipitation transport paths have undergone significant continental moisture recycling during their transport increased d excess values may also reflect initial evaporation conditions of the clouds at the moisture source since there is a negative relationship between d excess and relative humidity at the moisture source precipitation transported from the arid regions of central asia and the arabian peninsula would be expected to have higher d excess values michelsen et al 2015 these results indicate that palaeo archives of stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in the armenia highlands could provide proxies for the intensity of the nao given the strength of the relationship between precipitation isotopes and temperature palaeo reconstructions of the nao would be done most effectively in archives that provide independent records of temperature and precipitation isotopes recent advances in temperature reconstruction from lipid biomarkers such as glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers gdgt e g wang et al 2017 or clumped carbon and oxygen isotopes δ47 in calcium carbonates eiler 2011 2007 huntington and lechler 2015 may offer a means to do this paleo reconstructions of the intensity of the nao have demonstrated that during the holocene there has been generally consistent positive nao phases zielhofer et al 2017 however negative nao phases are associated with decadal periods of atlantic cooling baker et al 2015 olsen et al 2012 trouet et al 2009 zielhofer et al 2017 given the negative correlation between nao index and isotope values in precipitation this may cause paleo archives of δd and δ18o in the armenian highlands to be out of phase with global climate records based on these studies linking negative nao phases with cooler temperatures in the atlantic our results suggest this will increase the d and 18o enriched air masses reaching the armenian highland therefore the changes in precipitation source associated with changes in the nao would lead to more positive isotope values in paleoclimate archives than could be expected from a strictly temperature dominated trend though the relationship we describe in this study between nao and precipitation sources in the armenian highland may hold during the holocene glacial ice distributions may further complicate nao reconstructions in the pleistocene atmospheric circulation models for the last glacial maximum show that presence of glaciers in the northern hemisphere weakened the latitudinal migration of the nao derived westerlies and instead the fluctuations between positive and negative nao phases would change the extension of the westerly jet with the positive nao phase associated with eastward extension of the jet riviére et al 2010 based on this model we would expect nao signature on isotope composition of precipitation in the armenian highlands to be similar in the pleistocene as it is in the present with positive nao phases increasing the penetration of westerlies into the armenian highlands bringing more negative precipitation from the black sea given the predicted lack of latitudinal migration of westerlies in this model negative nao phases rather than shifting precipitation to a southwesterly track from the mediterranean would increase easterlies and southerlies bringing more positive precipitation from the red and caspian seas however other circulation models show glacial topography could completely reorganize the nao to a four center pressure system from its current two center system justino and peltier 2005 this second model predicts positive nao phases would lead to increased southerlies opposite to the current holocene trend coupled proxy records of pleistocene temperature and meteoric water δd and δ18o in the armenian highlands may allow us to test these two scenarios 5 conclusions in conclusion temperature at the sampling site is the dominant control of precipitation δd and δ18o values in the armenian highlands we also observe variability of the north atlantic oscillation index is significantly correlated with δd and δ18o values independent of other meteorological variables negative nao phases which are associated with weakened westerlies and southerly and easterly storm trajectories in the armenian highlands have more positive δd and δ18o values whereas positive nao phases associated with stronger westerlies and precipitation from the black sea have more negative δd and δ18o values the influence of the nao is strongest in the winter and

6361,the stable hydrogen δd and oxygen δ18o isotope composition of modern meteoric water are influenced by changes in global temperature rayleigh distillation processes and moisture transport history however on a global scale the relative influence of these different meteorological variables is spatially heterogeneous we collected daily precipitation samples from meteorological stations in the armenian highlands for a period of one year in order to determine the constraints on δd and δ18o and relationship to broader climatic conditions these data are coupled with hysplit back trajectory analysis to determine how these compositions relate to moisture source and transport path multivariate analysis shows the strongest relationship between δd and δ18o and climate variables is temperature at the sampling site along with temperature the intensity of the north atlantic oscillation a pattern of atmospheric circulation which determines the strength and location of northern hemisphere midlatitude westerlies is significant p 0 05 for both δ18o and δd values of precipitation this correlation between nao and isotopes in precipitation is also observed in four nearby gnip stations from 2008 to 2015 negative nao phases are associated with weakened westerlies which allows precipitation enriched in heavy isotopes from the mediterranean and southerly sources to penetrate into the armenian highlands whereas positive nao phases are associated with stronger westerlies bringing more negative precipitation from the black sea this relationship is most significant p 0 001

associated with the most negative δd values reaching its lowest point on march 5th 2015 208 at dilijan this sample was also the most negative δ18o value 27 4 δd and δ18o values of precipitation were compared to four climate variables temperature at the location of precipitation amount of precipitation north atlantic oscillation index and elevation fig 3 single variable correlation demonstrates that temperature is a statistically significant variable for both δ18o pearson ρ 0 74 p 0 001 and δd pearson ρ 0 71 p 0 001 in precipitation samples nao index is also significant for both δ18o pearson ρ 0 35 p 0 001 and δd pearson ρ 0 36 p 0 001 the amount of precipitation is not significant for δ18o pearson ρ 0 08 p 0 05 nor for δd pearson ρ 0 07 p 0 05 finally δd pearson ρ 0 07 p 0 05 and δ18o pearson 0 05 p 0 05 values are not significantly correlated with elevation since nao can influence meteorological variables such as temperature and amount of precipitation türkeş and erlat 2018 2009 we also performed multivariate regression table 1 this reveals similar results to the single variable correlation tests vif values for the independent variables temperature 1 188 precipitation amount 1 020 nao index 1 192 and elevation 1 025 show a low degree of multilinearity lechler and niemi 2011 δ18o α 0 47 p 0 001 and δd α 3 54 p 0 001 are significantly correlated with temperature at the sampling site nao index is also significant for both δ18o α 0 50 p 0 05 and δd α 4 72 p 0 05 amount of precipitation is not significant for either δ18o α 0 69 p 0 05 or δd α 0 40 p 0 05 elevation is significant for δd α 7 22 p 0 05 but not for δ18o α 0 69 p 0 05 table 2 3 2 d excess and local meteoric water line single variable regression analysis for d excess shows a significant relationship with temperature at the sampling site pearson ρ 0 32 p 0 001 amount of precipitation pearson ρ 0 12 p 0 05 and elevation pearson ρ 0 12 p 0 05 with insignificant relationship with nao values pearson ρ 0 03 p 0 05 table 1 fig 3 however in the multivariate analysis nao index is also significant at the p 0 05 level d excess values are highest in the winter and lowest in the summer fig 4 which is typical of precipitation in the northern hemisphere froehlich et al 2002 the relationship between δd and δ18o values of samples in this study is δ d 7 74 δ 18 o 10 32 in order for this regression to be comparable to the majority of the published literature on meteoric water lines we used an ordinary least square regression though recent publications have suggested alternatives for calculating local meteoric water lines crawford et al 2014 hughes and crawford 2012 this relationship is similar to the global meteoric water line craig 1961 and has a slightly steeper slope and higher intercept than gnip data from bordering turkey and georgia fig 5 since meteoric water lines can be influenced by source of precipitation the difference between the mwl in this study and the regional gnip data may be partially due to source effects see further discussion below 3 3 hysplit hysplit back trajectories for days with precipitation events are predominantly westerlies as is expected with the mid latitude location of armenia fig 6 clusters 2 4 and 6 8 back trajectories in these westerly clusters account for 45 of the total precipitation events during the collection period making this storm track the most common observed however three clusters do not follow this pattern fig 6 clusters 1 3 and 5 the mean trajectory of cluster 1 follows a southerly route to the armenian highland bringing precipitation from the red sea and persian gulf over the arabian peninsula and accounts for 25 of the precipitation events during the study period clusters 3 and 5 follow easterly tracks bringing precipitation from the caspian sea to the armenian highland and accounts for 30 of the precipitation events in the study period cluster 2 follows a westerly route with mean storm tracks following the northern border of the mediterranean sea mean storm tracks of cluster 6 11 also follow this more southern westerly trajectory passing over the anatolian peninsula and reaching the armenian highland clusters 4 12 7 2 and 8 3 follow a northern westerly route passing over the black sea 4 discussion a strong correlation between temperature at the sampling site and the isotopic values of precipitation is observed in the armenian highlands this correlation amounts to a change α of 0 47 c change in δ18o and a 3 54 c in δd these slopes are consistent with other measurements of precipitation isotope values in the mid latitudes bowen 2008 kohn and welker 2005 when compared to precipitation δd and δ18o turkey and georgia available from the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip the event based isotope and temperature regression is similar to the monthly gnip data fig 7 the data from this study has more variability than the gnip data likely due to the difference in sampling strategy monthly vs daily a lack of statistically significant correlations for the δd and δ18o values with elevation may be in part due to the nature of the data collected the relatively small difference in elevation between the stations included in this study 1 4 km between kapan and dilijan coupled with the high variability of event based temperatures may have obscured the relationship between elevation and precipitation isotope values further work expanding the elevation range of stations sampled as well as studying the spatial variability of individual precipitation events across multiple sampling sites could shed further light on this relationship other than temperature at the sampling site the only variable included in the multivariate analysis to have a significant correlation with both δd and δ18o is the nao index the intensity of the nao influences the location and strength of the mid latitude westerlies and as such influences air mass circulation over the armenian highlands negative nao phases are associated with weakened mid latitude westerlies and increased meridional flow hurrell et al 2003 75 of the precipitation events on days with a negative nao index fall in hysplit clusters 1 2 and 3 these clusters represent storm tracks that are southerlies cluster 1 south westerlies derived over the eastern mediterranean cluster 2 or easterlies derived over the caspian sea cluster 3 positive nao phases are associated with more northern westerly storm tracks typically passing over the black sea these observations of hysplit trajectories fit the expectations that strongly developed westerlies would penetrate into the armenian highlands during positive nao phases while weakened nao phases would allow easterlies and meridonal flow from the mediterranean sea the relationship between nao and isotopes in precipitation is negative meaning weakened westerlies systems negative nao index are associated with more positive isotope values given the penetration of southerlies and mediterranean storm tracks to the armenian highlands in these negative nao phases the isotope effect of the nao is likely associated with differences in the initial source water composition of cloud formation the mediterranean sea δ18o 2 δd 8 surface water has significantly more positive surface water isotope values than does the black sea δ18o 2 5 δd 22 dubinin and dubinina 2014 gat et al 1996 legrande and schmidt 2006 rank et al 1999 therefore clouds forming over these waters will lead to precipitation events with more positive isotope values the influence of the nao index on δd and δ18o values of precipitation in the armenian highlands is greatest during the winter and spring table 1 the intensity of the nao did not have a statistically significant effect on δd and δ18o values in the spring and summer months previous studies have documented a significant relationship between isotopes in precipitation and the nao in the winter field 2010 during winter the variability of the nao is highest hurrell et al 2003 whereas temperature variability in the armenian highlands was low during this period the statistically significant negative relationship between nao and precipitation isotope values is not limited to the event based samples collected in this study but is persistent in other meteorological stations in the southern caucasus region four stations in georgia bakuriani batumi tbilisi and telavi fig 1 with monthly δd and δ18o values collected from 2008 to 2015 in the gnip show this same relationship fig 8 monthly samples from these four stations n 186 are negatively correlated with monthly mean nao values the correlation coefficients for monthly samples in georgia δd pearson ρ 0 31 p 0 0001 δ18o pearson ρ 0 32 p 0 0001 in the long term gnip dataset is nearly identical to those from the event based samples in armenia δd pearson ρ 0 36 δ18o pearson ρ 0 35 the appearance of a significant relationship between nao and precipitation isotopes in independent monthly samples in the southern caucasus over a period of seven years further solidifies our interpretation of this relationship the relationship between δd and δ18o values in precipitation also differs by precipitation source fig 9 the slope of the meteoric water lines of samples with back trajectories over the black δ d 7 66 δ 18 o 8 44 and caspian seas δ d 7 61 δ 18 o 9 58 are lower with lower intercepts than the precipitation derived from samples in the mediterranean sea δ d 7 86 δ 18 o 11 21 and southerly winds δ d 7 74 δ 18 o 11 17 though this difference is not significant mediterranean sea precipitation has previously been demonstrated to produce meteoric water lines with high intercepts i e high d excess values gat and carmi 1970 in agreement with the data collected here the samples originating from black sea precipitation fig 6 clusters 4 7 and 8 show a similar meteoric water line to gnip samples from batumi georgia and rize turkey δ d 7 20 δ 18 o 8 04 two stations which are directly on the black sea the nearest gnip to the caspian sea is astrakhan russia which has a similar slope but much lower intercept to its meteoric water line δ d 7 34 δ 18 o 1 28 compared to the easterly precipitation tracks this may indicate that while there is incorporation of evaporation of caspian sea waters in our precipitation data it is not the source for most of the cloud moisture d excess values show source dependent seasonal changes fig 10 generally precipitation samples from the caspian and southerly sources have higher d excess values than do events from the black and mediterranean seas since moisture recycling can increase the d excess values of clouds during transport froehlich et al 2008 jouzel et al 1997 it is likely that the caspian and southerly precipitation transport paths have undergone significant continental moisture recycling during their transport increased d excess values may also reflect initial evaporation conditions of the clouds at the moisture source since there is a negative relationship between d excess and relative humidity at the moisture source precipitation transported from the arid regions of central asia and the arabian peninsula would be expected to have higher d excess values michelsen et al 2015 these results indicate that palaeo archives of stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in the armenia highlands could provide proxies for the intensity of the nao given the strength of the relationship between precipitation isotopes and temperature palaeo reconstructions of the nao would be done most effectively in archives that provide independent records of temperature and precipitation isotopes recent advances in temperature reconstruction from lipid biomarkers such as glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers gdgt e g wang et al 2017 or clumped carbon and oxygen isotopes δ47 in calcium carbonates eiler 2011 2007 huntington and lechler 2015 may offer a means to do this paleo reconstructions of the intensity of the nao have demonstrated that during the holocene there has been generally consistent positive nao phases zielhofer et al 2017 however negative nao phases are associated with decadal periods of atlantic cooling baker et al 2015 olsen et al 2012 trouet et al 2009 zielhofer et al 2017 given the negative correlation between nao index and isotope values in precipitation this may cause paleo archives of δd and δ18o in the armenian highlands to be out of phase with global climate records based on these studies linking negative nao phases with cooler temperatures in the atlantic our results suggest this will increase the d and 18o enriched air masses reaching the armenian highland therefore the changes in precipitation source associated with changes in the nao would lead to more positive isotope values in paleoclimate archives than could be expected from a strictly temperature dominated trend though the relationship we describe in this study between nao and precipitation sources in the armenian highland may hold during the holocene glacial ice distributions may further complicate nao reconstructions in the pleistocene atmospheric circulation models for the last glacial maximum show that presence of glaciers in the northern hemisphere weakened the latitudinal migration of the nao derived westerlies and instead the fluctuations between positive and negative nao phases would change the extension of the westerly jet with the positive nao phase associated with eastward extension of the jet riviére et al 2010 based on this model we would expect nao signature on isotope composition of precipitation in the armenian highlands to be similar in the pleistocene as it is in the present with positive nao phases increasing the penetration of westerlies into the armenian highlands bringing more negative precipitation from the black sea given the predicted lack of latitudinal migration of westerlies in this model negative nao phases rather than shifting precipitation to a southwesterly track from the mediterranean would increase easterlies and southerlies bringing more positive precipitation from the red and caspian seas however other circulation models show glacial topography could completely reorganize the nao to a four center pressure system from its current two center system justino and peltier 2005 this second model predicts positive nao phases would lead to increased southerlies opposite to the current holocene trend coupled proxy records of pleistocene temperature and meteoric water δd and δ18o in the armenian highlands may allow us to test these two scenarios 5 conclusions in conclusion temperature at the sampling site is the dominant control of precipitation δd and δ18o values in the armenian highlands we also observe variability of the north atlantic oscillation index is significantly correlated with δd and δ18o values independent of other meteorological variables negative nao phases which are associated with weakened westerlies and southerly and easterly storm trajectories in the armenian highlands have more positive δd and δ18o values whereas positive nao phases associated with stronger westerlies and precipitation from the black sea have more negative δd and δ18o values the influence of the nao is strongest in the winter and spring these results demonstrate the potential for paleo archives of precipitation isotope values in the armenian highlands to preserve records of past nao variability declaration of competing

6362,knowledge of the geologic structure at a field site is a useful piece of information for hydrologic modeling since it can serve as more site specific prior information about the hydraulic parameter patterns at the site than generic spatial statistics widely accepted electrical resistivity tomography ert survey for mapping subsurface anomalies could be a viable tool for acquiring this information however their ability to delineate geologic structures has not been thoroughly investigated in this study two dimensional ert numerical experiments were first conducted to study the effects of boundary conditions on the dipole dipole and pole pole array configurations an ert setup subsequently was implemented in a sandbox consisting of complex layers of different sands a continuous copper wire was installed along the sides of the sandbox to impose potential boundaries using data collected with the pole pole array in the sandbox under different degrees of drainage and the successive linear estimator sle algorithm we show that ert yields electrical conductivity estimates of complex layer structures with small uncertainties in addition using sle with physically meaningful correlation scales as prior information can lead to an electrical conductivity field that is consistent with visually observed layer structures the correlation scale concept also was demonstrated to provide guidance to the design of the electrode spacing in the surveys moreover the estimated field was validated by predicting electrical potential fields from two independent ert surveys using electrodes at different locations results of this study suggest that the combination of ert and sle is a viable geophysical survey tool for mapping geologic layer structures research significance this study develops a method to implement prescribed potential boundaries for enhancing the pole pole ert survey illustrates the importance of correlation scales and develops an approach for validating ert results keywords electrical resistivity tomography successive linear estimator sandbox experiment fine resolution geophysics uncertainty validation 1 introduction the increasing interest in predictions of groundwater flow and solute transport in the subsurface has prompted a large number of studies on an accurate characterization of subsurface heterogeneity although hydraulic tomography ht has been developed and proven as an effective technique to hydraulic heterogeneity in the subsurface over past years yeh and liu 2000 bohling et al 2002 zhu and yeh 2005 illman et al 2007 2009 cardiff et al 2009 2012 mao et al 2013 prior large scale geologic conceptual models built upon borehole logs still play an important role when the number of pumping tests and drawdown measuring points is sparse besides these conceptual models improve ht analysis as well as hydrogeological forward modeling efforts tso et al 2016 zha et al 2017 zhao and illman 2017 nonetheless borehole information often is sparse and it provides discrete and local scale descriptions of geology to improve the large scale geologic conceptual model inexpensive electrical resistivity surveys e g hermans et al 2015 2017 may be the solution surface resistivity surveys have been widely used in the field they measure the difference in voltage generated by injection of electric current between two electrodes implanted at the ground surface then the electric potentials induced by many combinations of transmitting and receiving electrodes were measured to interpret the distribution of subsurface resistive or conductive zones yeh et al 2002 parsekian et al 2015 which are then used to construct the geologic conceptual model similar to the surface surveys shima and sakayama 1987 proposed electrical resistivity tomography ert based on cross borehole and borehole to surface resistivity surveys for reconstructing a resistivity or electrical conductivity cross section sasaki 1992 and yeh et al 2002 showed the resolution of subsurface images from the tomography technique is much clear than that of the surface resistivity surveys notice the resolution is a measure of the level of detail that can be seen using an ert survey over the past decades ert has increasingly been recognized as a useful geophysical method to investigate the subsurface resistivity anomalies lapenna et al 2005 miller et al 2008 it also has been widely applied to environmental and hydrogeological studies binley et al 2010 binley et al 2015 hayley et al 2009 revil et al 2012 singha et al 2015 slater 2007 because ert surveys are sensitive to the conductivity contrast due to differences in porosity moisture content xu et al 2016 geologic layering loke et al 2013 or presence and migration of contaminants deng et al 2017 mao et al 2016 in the subsurface further ert is easy to implement and relatively inexpensive loke et al 2013 deciphering the data from an ert survey however often involves large uncertainty first the volume of the geologic medium to be surveyed is large and the density of ert array is generally low additionally the electrical potential response at a location to a transmitting current at a different location represents the cumulative response from all parts of the medium while the tomographic survey aims to collect non redundant responses using sparse measurement arrays to make the inverse problem better defined yeh et al 2015a b the uncertainty associated with the interpretation remains large for hydrogeological applications translating electrical resistivity to hydrologic properties such as hydraulic conductivity moisture content and concentration adds another uncertainty first of all the bulk electrical conductivity of geologic media is affected by many factors such as soil texture moisture content porosity temperature mineralogy and geochemistry see slater 2007 although some constitutive relationships i e petrophysical model such as archie s law archie 1942 for the relationship between porosity and resistivity and log log relationships between hydraulic conductivity and resistivity purvance and andricevic 2000a b are often used to relate the resistivity to these factors these constitutive relationships are empirical scale dependent yeh et al 2002 slater 2007 moreover the parameters e g the cementation factor in archie s law in the relationships are not uniform for a given site but spatially varying yeh et al 2002 due to the local geologic and geochemical environment purvance and andricevic 2000a b slater 2007 to avoid the aforementioned uncertainty and assess the usefulness of ert applications to hydrogeological problems over the past few decades many researchers have conducted controlled laboratory experiments for example chen et al 2016 used the ert to estimate groundwater flow velocity and monitor the advection of a conductive plume in a sandbox using archie s law similarly pollock and cirpka 2012 conducted a salt tracer experiment in a sandbox to determine the hydraulic conductivity distribution based on the fully coupled hydrogeophysical inversion pollock and cirpka 2008 2010 of time lapse ert and hydraulic head measurements slater et al 2002 conducted a 3d cross borehole ert in a large heterogeneous experimental tank to study solute transport processes they converted the time series of electrical images into estimated fluid conductivity breakthrough curves which were in good agreements with direct measures of fluid conductivity in the sampling ports other similar studies include mao et al 2015 clement and moreau 2016 slater et al 2000 and binley et al 1996 as for interpreting the results of ert survey the least squares optimization method with regularization has been widely used to estimate the electrical conductivity distribution from the observed potentials through the governing current and electric potential equations cockett et al 2015 gunther et al 2006 loke et al 2013 2014 pidlisecky et al 2007 blaschek et al 2008 lelievre et al 2009 for example using a smoothness constraint e g a discrete second difference matrix constable et al 1987 occam s algorithm aims to find the most featureless models that are consistent with the measurements gouveia and scales 1997 while such a smoothness constraint resolves the underdetermined nature of the inverse problem the solution to the problem remains highly uncertain that is the smoothness constraint does not necessarily lead to an estimate which is the best unbiased and has the minimum variance in comparison with the true field to overcome this shortcoming recent studies emphasized inversions based on regularization approach e g covariance based regularization that incorporates prior information of the geologic structure and some direct measurements of parameters robinson et al 2013 johnson et al 2007 hermans et al 2012 2016 bouchedda et al 2017 jordi et al 2018 to incorporate prior information of the geologic structure and direct measurements of parameters yeh et al 2002 introduced a geostatistics based successive linear estimator sle approach to the ert inverse modeling this iterative geostatistical technique incorporates the spatial statistics point measurements of variables as prior information to derive the conditional mean estimates and residual covariance which describes the uncertainty associated with the estimates liu and yeh 2004 demonstrated the utility of the sle method for monitoring 3 d moisture content distributions using numerical experiments solving mathematical ert inverse problems also encounters the issues related to the unknown boundary conditions in laboratory experiments insulated boundary conditions are known because of isolation of the sandbox however a solution domain surrounded by insulated boundaries is a mathematically ill posed forward problem constant potential boundaries or arbitrarily assigning a constant potential in the domain has often been used to avoid this mathematical issue for the laboratory experiment sentenac et al 2015 albeit precise interpretation of ert as discussed above may be difficult ert remains as an attractive tool for mapping different scale geologic structures in terms of different electrode spacing this geologic structure information is beneficial to the characterization of geologic hydraulic properties since it serves as a site specific prior geologic structure information for hydrologic inverse modeling efforts or hydraulic tomography as demonstrated by tso et al 2016 zha et al 2017 in spite of the fact that ert has shown some promising results such as hermans and irving 2017 its ability to map geologic layers at different scales remains to be further verified in particular in controlled laboratory scale experiments the purpose of this paper therefore is to demonstrate the ert inversion using sle for mapping soil layers and to validate its estimates using sandbox experiments for this purpose a design that facilitates constant electrical potential boundaries was implemented in the sandbox to allow fast easy pole pole array measurements sle was then used to interpret the observations to demonstrate the effects of electrical conductivity contrasts in the sandbox at different degrees of saturation we then elucidate the importance of spatial correlation scales as well as measurement electrode spacing on ert the estimated electrical conductivity field was further validated by predicting the response during ert surveys using different source electrode arrays while quantifying the uncertainty of parameter estimates we believe these are new and important contributions to ert surveys and analyses 2 methodology 2 1 governing equations the electric potential field in geologic media induced by a direct current transmission generally can be described by 1 σ u i δ x x s δ y y s δ z z s 0 where σ σ x y z is a given electrical conductivity s m 1 distribution in a cartesian system of coordinates x y z u u x y z the electrostatic potential v i the source current a at a location x s y s z s and δ the dirac delta function in order to solve eq 1 boundary conditions must be specified and they are 2 u γ 1 u or 3 σ u n γ 2 j where u is the electrical potential specified at the boundary γ 1 j denotes the prescribed current density per unit area a m 2 and n is the unit vector normal to the boundary γ 2 yeh et al 2002 pidlisecky et al 2007 2 2 sle for ert tomography in this study the inversion of ert surveys was conducted using a stochastic estimation model successive linear estimator sle which has been successfully used in hydraulic tomography as well as ert for details refer to yeh and liu 2000 yeh et al 2002 liu and yeh 2004 zhu and yeh 2005 yeh et al 2008 xiang et al 2009 and zha et al 2018 due to spatial variability of the properties of geologic media sle first conceptualizes the natural logarithm of electrical conductivity ln σ x as a spatial stochastic process or random field characterized by a joint probability distribution with given mean variance and correlation lengths this conceptualization is a general description of the spatial varying conductivity of a geologic medium in the geostatistical framework yeh et al 2015a b a major distinction between sle and the covariance based regularized inversion that is sle assumes the conductivity properties at a site in terms of the average value the deviation from the average and the average dimensions length width and thickness of different conductivity clusters i e geologic structures likewise the electrical potential u x is treated as a spatial stochastic process these random fields are then expressed as ln σ x f f x and u x u d x where f and u are the mean i e f ln u x the angle bracket denotes expected value f x and d x are the perturbations with zero means i e f x 0 and d x 0 afterward the estimated conductivity vector given the measured electrical potentials is f c subscript c denotes conditional given the measured potentials since the relationship between the conductivity and potential in inverse modeling is nonlinear the conductivity vector is iteratively determined using the following stochastic linear estimator 4 f c r 1 f c r ω f t d q k g h f c r q k where r is the iteration index d q k is a vector consisting of the measured electrical potentials corresponding to the current transmission at the kth location q k g h denotes eq 1 which simulates the potentials induced by the current transmission using the parameters f c r at iteration r note that r 0 f c 0 f unconditional mean value the word unconditional implies that no measured potential has been used to modify them suppose we discretize an estimation domain into n elements we have the current transmissions at p locations and each transmission has l potential measurements as a result we have a total number of potential measurements m p l with this survey the dimension of f c r is an n 1 vector d q k and g h are m 1 vectors the coefficient matrix ω t then has a dimension of n m and the superscript t denotes the transpose this matrix the weights assigns the contribution of the difference between the observed and simulated potential at each measurement electrode during each transmission to the previously estimated conductivity value at each element the coefficient matrix ω t is determined by solving the following equation 5 r dd r θ r diag r dd r ω f r r df r where r dd r is the auto covariance of the potential measurement and r df r is the cross covariance between the conductivity and the potential measurements the parameter θ r is a dynamic stability multiplier and diag r dd r is a stability matrix which is a diagonal matrix which is the same as the diagonal elements of r dd r the auto covariance r dd r and cross covariance r df r are calculated using the first order numerical approximation zhu and yeh 2005 sun et al 2013 6 r df r j d r r ff r r dd r j d r r ff r j d r t where r ff r n n is the auto covariance of the conductivity j d r m n is the sensitivity jacobian matrix of potentials with respect to the element wise parameter evaluated using the conductivity estimated at the current iteration an adjoint state variable approach is adopted sykes et al 1985 li and yeh 1998 mao et al 2013 to compute the sensitivity matrix for r 1 the covariance function is updated to represent the conditional or residual covariance of the conductivity according to 7 r ff r 1 r ff r ω f t r df r this update is to reflect the improvement i e reduction of the uncertainty of the estimate due to the inclusion of the measured potentials note that at iteration r 0 r ff 0 n n is the unconditional covariance of parameters which could be characterized by an exponential spatial covariance function or other covariance functions see zha et al 2018 8 r ff p p ζ f 2 exp x x 2 λ x 2 z z 2 λ z 2 in eq 8 ζ f 2 is the variance of ln σ λ x and λ z are the correlation scales in x and z directions i e the average length and width of geologic layers yeh et al 2015b respectively this covariance implies that the correlation relationship between the σ at the point p x z and p x z decreases with an increasing separation distance between the two points normalized by the correlation length two convergence criteria are used to terminate the iteration 1 if a change in the spatial variance of the estimated conductivity field between the current and last iterations is smaller than a specified tolerance implying that the sle cannot improve the estimation any further 2 if a change of simulated potentials between successive iterations is smaller than a given tolerance indicating that the estimates will not significantly improve the potential field once one of the two criteria is met the estimates are considered to be optimal and the iteration procedure is terminated with respect to resolving the ill posed nature of ert inversion sle takes a different approach to the traditional occam e g hu et al 2013 covariance based regularized inversion hermans et al 2016 jordi et al 2018 and bayesian inversion of data gouveia and scales 1997 the occam approach solves a regularized least squares problem via a roughening operator e g a discrete second difference operator to find the smoothest model the covariance based regularized approach yields solutions via using the covariance matrix and optimized damping factor as prior information e g geostatistical regularization operator while fixing the damping factor to unity would give the same solution as a true geostatistical solution tarantola 2005 the bayesian approach is philosophically similar to sle however bayesian inversion generally does not relate a priori model covariance matrix to the spatial statistics of the variability of geophysical properties furthermore sle is explicitly formulated from a covariance matrix which represents the spatial characteristics of the variability of conductivity e g mean variance and correlation scale of the heterogeneous medium using this geostatistical representation of spatial variability sle then establishes the cross correlation between the potential measurements and electrical conductivity everywhere in the domain via the sensitivity based on the governing equation afterward sle seeks the conditional effective electrical conductivity field the most likely conductivity values given the measured potentials at every location as opposed to the conductivity field which best matches the observed potentials the likely deviation uncertainty of the conditional effective conductivity from the true one is subsequently quantified by the diagonal terms of r ff in eq 7 i e residual variance in addition the prior model covariance the residual covariance matrix is updated at each iteration eq 7 while it is not considered in the bayesian approach see zha et al 2018 for a detailed comparison this update of the residual covariance is designed to reflect the reduced uncertainty of the estimates as more information about the heterogeneity is extracted from the voltage measurements during each iteration however this residual variance is an approximate estimate of the uncertainty under the assumptions of the sle i e multi gaussianity 3 numerical experiments in cross hole resistivity tomography surveying pole pole and dipole dipole arrays are widely used for 2d or 3d resistivity imaging while other types of tri electrode and four electrode configurations e g schlumberger are similar to a dipole dipole array bing and greenhalgh 2000 as for the dipole dipole configuration the potential difference was measured between the two potential electrodes measurement pairs along with two opposite polarity current electrodes source pairs at boreholes however the pole pole array has two remote electrodes i e one of the current electrodes and one of the potential electrodes they are placed far away from the other electrodes regarded as zero voltage reference points shima 1992 bing and greenhalgh 2000 since the complete pole pole data sets have maximum information and other configuration data sets can be derived from them the pole pole array theoretically should produce the best estimate of the study region under a low noise level condition bing and greenhalgh 2000 prior to the sandbox experiments unknown noise numerical experiments noise free were conducted to investigate the effects of different ert surveys i e dipole dipole or pole pole configurations under different boundary conditions of the laboratory sandbox experiments for this purpose the numerical experiments consider a two dimensional vertical profile 180 by 90 cm this profile is discretized into 36 vertical and 36 horizontal elements totally 1296 elements with a dimension of 5 cm length 2 5 cm width the electrical conductivity value for each element was created using a stochastic random field generator with a geometric mean of 0 01 s m 1 4 95 in log scale a variance of 0 0001 s2 m 2 0 7 in log scale and an exponential correlation structure with a horizontal correlation scale of 90 cm and a vertical correlation scale of 5 cm this heterogeneous conductivity field fig 1 a is the reference field in which six vertical lines of electrodes for the ert survey were installed at a horizontal interval of 30 cm along each line sixteen electrodes were placed at 5 cm interval the solid circles in fig 1a three cases were examined in this numerical experiment case 1 represents the situation where dipole dipole configures were used with insulated boundaries on the four sides of the profile case 2 is the same as case 1 but the top right hand and left hand sides of the profile were replaced with a constant electrical potential boundary pole pole configurations were used in case 3 in which the top right hand and left hand sides of the profile were assigned a constant electrical potential boundary in cases 1 and 2 where the dipole dipole array was used six different current transmitter pairs a1 b1 a2 b2 a3 b3 a4 b4 a5 b5 and a6 b6 in fig 1a were employed to yield six voltage current datasets each set consists of 93 voltage difference measurements between the selected reference electrodes r1 r2 r3 r4 r5 and r6 and the other measuring electrodes in case 1 where the profile was surrounded by insulated boundary conditions one of the reference electrodes was assigned a potential value so that a unique solution can be obtained for the governing equations in case 3 where pole pole configurations were used the reference electrodes of the transmitters and receivers were assumed to be at the constant potential boundaries the current transmission locations were the locations of the six pairs of dipole source electrodes in case 1 and case 2 therefore case 3 yielded 12 voltage current datasets which included a total of 1140 electrical potential measurements the estimated conditional effective conductivity fields for the three cases were then derived from sle with the true mean and covariance functions of the reference field as prior information estimates from case 1 dipole dipole with insulated boundaries are displayed in fig 1b while the estimates from case 2 dipole dipole with three prescribed potential boundaries are illustrated in fig 1c estimates from case 3 are shown in fig 1d in comparison with the reference field and the estimated fields from the three cases we notice that in spite of different configurations using the constant potential boundaries the estimated heterogeneous structures as well as the magnitudes of the estimates in fig 1c and 1d are in agreements with the reference field however the configurations with fixed electrodes as a reference point in case 1 yields a low resolution image fig 1b likely this is attributed to the fact that at insulated boundaries the potentials are unknown and more unknowns are to be solved during the inverse modeling the scatterplots with hexbin of the reference electrical conductivity field versus the estimated for the three cases are shown in fig 2 a 2b and 2c all the data are scattering around the 45 degree line indicating that the estimates from sle are unbiased notice that the case 2 and 3 have a higher coefficient of determination r2 0 77 and 0 79 respectively another statistics norm l2 which is the mean square error of the true field against the estimated field also indicates that the surveys with the prescribed potential condition have smaller l2 norm 0 173 for dipole dipole and 0 155 for pole pole than that with insulated boundaries 0 322 for case 1 as for norm l1 it has the same trend as norm l2 for the three cases 0 425 0 312 and 0 293 for case 1 2 and 3 respectively thus the pole pole array with three potential boundary sides yielded the best image i e highest resolution contour plots of the residual variances conditional variances which represent the uncertainty of the estimate at each location for the three cases are depicted in fig 3 a b and c we notice that the estimates using survey arrays with four insulated boundaries have relatively higher residual variances especially around the boundaries indicating that higher uncertainty of estimated electrical conductivity these results are consistent with the estimated electrical conductivity fields and their scatterplots fig 2 additionally contour plots of the error in the estimate for three cases were shown in fig 4 a b and c the error was defined by the square of the difference between the estimate and true field the general behaviors between the residual variance and the error are the same small differences near observation locations and vice versa however since the residual variance is an ensemble statistical concept it does not necessarily correspond exactly the difference between the estimate and the true 4 sandbox experiments 4 1 setup to illustrate the effectiveness and merits of our new ert design in a laboratory sandbox we constructed a heterogeneous soil profile in a 180 cm long 90 cm high and 10 cm thick sandbox with 19 layers of sands of different grain sizes fig 5 a and b based on the numerical experiments we installed 96 copper electrodes at 5 cm vertical spacing and 30 cm horizontal spacing on one side of the sandbox black circles in fig 5c after the sandbox was packed with sands the grain size saturated hydraulic conductivity and porosity for five materials were listed in table 1 since thickness averaged electrical potentials were our primary interest the length of the electrode was made long enough to penetrate 90 of the thickness of the sandbox avoiding influences of the water on the other side of the sandbox wall in addition to decrease the contact resistance between the electrodes and the sands we enlarged the electrode contact surface area as much as possible hence copper electrodes were designed as 9 cm in length with 0 18 cm in diameter the front part approximately 8 cm of the electrode was in direct contact with the sands while the rest about 1 cm was wrapped with non conductive pvc heat shrink tube and fixed on the glass to avoid possible impacts of water between the sand and this side of the wall as illustrated in fig 5a and c both sides and top of the sandbox are compartments for water reservoirs transparent boundaries in fig 5a or areas bounded by the solid black lines and dotted lines in fig 5c before the experiments the sandbox was repeatedly filled with tap water by increasing the water level in the reservoirs on the two sides to completely fill the upper reservoir and then drained to ensure that the sand is fully compacted and settled the water was drained from the lower left and lower right outlets of the two side reservoirs 4 2 ert data acquisition based on the results of our numerical experiments we employed a pole pole approach with constant potential boundaries during the sandbox experiments to create a constant potential boundary along the three sides of the sandbox we inserted a continuous copper wire into the sands around the upper left and right sides of the sandbox red line in fig 5c this wire is connected to the negative pole of the current source as well as the negative pole of the receiver as such this wire serves as a constant zero electrical potential boundaries the positive pole of the source then introduced the direct current to one of the 96 electrodes and the potentials at the other 95 electrodes are monitored i e one snapshot a given current was transmitted at selected ten different locations the black solid rectangles and dashed ellipses in fig 5c a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7 and a8 for calibration a9 and a10 for validation in section 4 6 individually to scan the sandbox under drainage and fully saturated conditions all the datasets acquired for above the configurations were taken by agi supersting 8 channel resistivity meter the measurement time was about 0 4 sec which including current injection period and data recording time for each individual following each measurement the current source was shut down for 0 4 sec to reduce induced polarization effect generally 10 snapshots for pole pole array took less than 20 min 4 3 electrical potential fields at different drainage times the aforementioned data acquisition method was applied to the sandbox under a fully saturated condition t 0 and unsaturated conditions with different drainage times t 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 h this drainage experiment was conducted based on the fact that after drainage fine textured sands will retain more water and the coarse ones will retain less due to the difference in capillary forces as documented in the results of the field study by ye et al 2005 in effect stochastic analysis of unsaturated flow by yeh et al 1985b also suggested that variances of local scale pressure head moisture content and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity increase as the average moisture content of a medium decreases we thus expect that after drainage the electric conductivity of the fine textured sands should be higher than those of the coarse textured sands the contrasts in electric conductivity of different layers should increase and the general shape of different layers could be detected in fig 6 the contour maps show the electric potential fields after current injection at a location 0 75 0 7 for the fully saturated condition t 0 and the unsaturated condition at t 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 h all the potentials in mv were scaled to 1 ma current injection for the saturated condition the contour map shows concentric circles around the injection point due to the nearly homogeneous resistivity distributions after 0 5 h of drainage the potential distributions became elliptic they stretched in horizontal directions at later times suggesting anisotropic behaviors reflecting layering effects similar behaviors were observed when the sources were at other locations these observations seem to corroborate the moisture dependent anisotropy theory for unsaturated hydraulic conductivity yeh et al 1985b the theory stated that water in stratified soils tend to move horizontally as the soils become less saturated that is the electrical potential field behaves in a manner similar to the pressure head or moisture content field in flow through porous media even though the underlining physics is different nevertheless these potential maps did not clearly reveal the layer structure of the sands in the sandbox as some might expect on the other hand the smoothness of the map is indicative of the diffusive nature of the electrical potential the change in potentials due to variation in resistivity is small the smoothness of the potential field is similar to the drawdown distribution induced by a pumping test in an aquifer aquifer heterogeneity does not affect drawdown distribution significantly the results are consistent with the results of the stochastic analysis of the effects of heterogeneity on the drawdown of groundwater flow gelhar 1993 4 4 sle inversion results the raw data from the ert surveys were then inputted to sle algorithm to estimate the electric conductivity fields of the sandbox at the fully saturated condition 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 h after drainage for these inverse modeling the prior mean conductivity was 0 05 s m 1 3 2 in log scale and its variance was 0 0018 s2 m 2 0 5 in log scale they were estimates based on apparent resistivity ρ a in ohm m calculated by differential potentials δ v and injected current i 9 ρ a k δ v i where k is the geometric factor see loke et al 2013 depending on the configurations a value of 5 cm was assigned for the vertical correlation scale and 90 cm for the horizontal correlation scale these correlation scales were estimated based on the visual examination of the average thickness and length of the layers in the sandbox the estimated conductivity field under a fully saturated condition is illustrated in fig 7 a it does not reveal the layer structure likely due to the dominance of the electrical conductivity of the tap water and small contrast in the porosity of the different sands around 0 37 0 39 see table 1 according to archie s law stochastic theories of groundwater flow gelhar 1993 and unsaturated flow yeh et al 1985a b c may suggest a solution to this issue these theories stated the head variance will increase in a heterogeneous media if the hydraulic gradient increases even if the heterogeneity remains the same thus a large injected current should increase the potential variation reflecting heterogeneity such that it can be detected clearly by the sensor under this large input voltage ert may be able to detect the layer structure in the sandbox nevertheless verification of this hypothesis is out of the scope of this study as discussed earlier the drainage of the sandbox could increase the resistivity contrasts in the sandbox to support this hypothesis the estimated variances and the spatial mean of the estimated conductivity fields at the fully saturated condition 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 h after drainage are shown in fig 7b the spatial mean average over the entire sandbox of the estimated conductivity field changed from 0 1 s m at the saturation to around 0 05 s m at the end of the drainage period see the right hand side axis this decreasing trend in spatial mean agrees with the fact that less water in the sandbox the less conductive the medium is the variance of the lnσ field is 0 3 at the saturation rises rapidly and stabilizes at 2 0 with increasing of the drainage time consistent with our earlier speculation to further substantiate our speculation that increasing the resistivity contrast in the sandbox ert will be able to delineate the layering structure the estimated conductivity distribution at 2 5 h after drainage and its residual variance map are illustrated in fig 8 a and b respectively the black lines in fig 8a and b are the outlines of the 19 layers based on our visualization examining fig 8a we notice that the layer structures from ert estimate generally agree with the layer structure visually observed from the sandbox the coarse sand layers have low electrical conductivity values and the fine sands have high values the conductivities of the regions at the bottom of the sandbox i e blue layer 1 and orange layer 2 were high due to the accumulation of undrained water at the bottom 4 5 importance of prior information for sle sle was used to interpret the ert survey data this inverse or estimation problem is underdetermined or ill defined more parameters than potential measurements and cannot be solved exactly in order to overcome this difficulty sle uses the spatial covariance function r ff spatial correlation between parameters as prior information to regularize the problem the covariance function is an exponential function which extends the influences of the sensitivity of potential measurements to conductivity at different parts of the profile sun et al 2013 such influences are controlled by the horizontal and vertical correlation scales as well as the sensitivity of potential to change in electric conductivity a plot of the estimated conductivity field using a vertical correlation scale of 5 cm and a horizontal correlation scale of 10 cm smaller than the average length of the physical layers as prior information is displayed in fig 8c the estimated field exhibits several localized anomalously high conductivity blocks in comparison with the estimates in fig 8a which was obtained by using a horizontal correlation scale of 90 cm besides the layer structures near the boundaries of the sandbox are not visible these high conductivity zones and blurred boundaries suggest that the covariance function and the sensitivity do not capture the true spatial relationship between the measured potential and adjacent conductivity anomalies on the other hand based on the experiments not shown here we notice that using values greater than 90 cm as the horizontal correlation scale did not further improve the estimates in comparison with those in fig 8a another way to assess the different estimated models is by comparing the data misfits or rms i e root mean square error between the potential predictions and observations linde et al 2015 as expected the rms for the estimates in fig 8c has much larger value about 23 07 mv than that of the estimates in fig 8a around 17 65 mv although the covariance function is analogous to the regularization term in other inverse methods such as occam s inversion or bayesian approach the correlation scales in the covariance function of sle or other geostatistics based algorithms e g kitanidis 1995 were derived from visual examinations of the sandbox fig 5a or b under field situations examinations of outcrops geologic map or borehole logs could suggest some approximate correlation scales yeh et al 2015b pointed out that the correlation scales do not have to be exact but they have to be reasonably close to the average dimensions of the heterogeneity they are soft constraints to the inverse modeling efforts the effects will be overridden once measurements become abundant i e many samples within the correlation scale note that regularization approaches using covariance based solution likely reach the similar conclusion about the effect of the choice of prior covariance model e g hansen et al 2006 the prior information determines the unconstrained part of model with little measurements and is honored only when it is consistent with the observed data the correlation scales also play an important role in the design of electrode spacing during ert surveys as a rule of thumb the receiver electrode spacing should be smaller than the dimension of the dominant anomalies of our interests yeh et al 2015b and this was verified in yeh and liu 2000 for hydraulic tomography specifically the optimal distance of the monitoring network at least should be smaller than 0 5 times the correlation scale of heterogeneity of our interest for instance the estimated conductivity field using data collected from the vertical electrode spacing of 10 cm is presented in fig 8d the estimates in fig 8d are not as detailed as those in fig 8a this finding therefore could be of practical importance to the design of the ert layout 4 6 validation of the estimated parameters the true electrical conductivity distributions of a field site as well as the sandbox in this study are unknown one possible approach to quantitatively assess the accuracy of the estimates from ert is to validate the estimates using independent surveys independent surveys should be conducted at new transmitter and receiver locations which were never used in the previous inverse modeling effects that is had the conductivity field been completely characterized by the ert survey the estimated field would have predicted exact electric field induced by the independent surveys otherwise the predicted electric field will deviate from the observed as reported in hydraulic tomography by huang et al 2011 in order to carry out this validation exercise we chose to use sle to estimate a new conductivity field of the sandbox at 2 5 h after drainage using potential measurements at 18 electrodes white circles in fig 9 a this is because the aforementioned ert inversion all 96 electrodes were used as either transmitters or receivers to create the new estimated field the current transmission locations and the prior information of sle remain the same as those in fig 8a eight red rectangles in fig 9a this arrangement left us a total of 72 electrodes for validation the new estimated field is illustrated in fig 9a and the scatter plot of the calibrated vs measured potentials is shown in fig 9b as shown in the scatter plot the calibration is as good as those based on dense measurement electrodes nonetheless the newly estimated field fig 9a has a lower resolution than those in fig 8a and d because the potential measurement interval in the vertical direction is 25 cm much larger than 5 cm and 10 cm in fig 8a this newly estimated field was then used to predict the two potential fields measured at those discarded electrode rows induced by the current transmissions at locations a9 and a10 these transmission electrodes were not used as either transmission or receiver electrodes in the creation of the new estimated field the validation results scatter plots of the predicted vs the measured potentials are displayed in fig 9c and d respectively for a9 and a10 transmitters as expected the predicted potentials versus the observed are generally scattering along the 45 degree line indicating that sle yields unbiased conditional effective conductivity field but at a lower resolution i e larger scatterings in the scatter plots in fig 9c and d than those in fig 9b these large scatterings confirm that these two validation tests are independent of the tests used in the model calibration since they carry non redundant information wen et al 2019 more importantly the new estimated electrical conductivity field can predict the potential fields due to stresses at different locations unbiasedly with some discrepancies these discrepancies are the effects of unresolved conductivity heterogeneity resulting from the low density of the survey on the other hand the results also imply that these two independent tests could increase the resolution of the estimates if they were included in the inverse modeling they carry new information about the heterogeneity while a similar concept has been used in hydraulic tomography e g liu et al 2007 xiang et al 2009 and others this independent test approach has not been reported in the literature of ert surveys this is particularly of importance in hydrogeophysics since ert results have been generally compared with the estimates from borehole resistivity surveys since ert and borehole geophysics are at different scales the comparison may be limited to large scale features only for this reason we believe that this validation approach may be a new way to substantiate the ert survey estimates in the field of hydrogeophysics 5 discussions and conclusions our study suggests that the ert survey using a pole pole array with constant potential boundaries is more effective than using the dipole dipole array to implement constant potential boundaries in our sandbox experiments we embedded a continuous copper wire in the sands on three sides of the sandbox and connected it to the negative pole of the current source as well as the negative pole of the receiver such a pole pole setup facilitated a fast measurement and better conductivity estimation and lowered its uncertainties further it expedited convergence of the estimation because of the precise boundary conditions i e zero electrical potential albeit the above approach appears to be limited to the sandbox experiment it has the potential for field applications as a matter of the fact rucker et al 2010 2011 used steel casing wells connected to the current source as long electrodes near the target to electrically monitor the waste plumes in the vadose zone at the t tank farm at the hanford nuclear site which overcomes the smearing issue by the upper conductive layer and obtained better deeper subsurface information yang et al 2017 present a 3d ert modeling with long electrode sources their results showed that the arrays with long electrode sources are more sensitive to the subsurface anomalies than those with point electrode sources based on these studies it is rational to speculate that steel wells i e long electrodes or steel sheets can be used as constant potential boundary conditions by connecting to the source of the ert survey these studies and our results may lead to new research on field applications of this approach although it might be a limitation to extend the method to the field at this moment unlike most ert inversion methods which are based on tikhonov regularization the sle approach inherently uses physically meaningful correlation scales as prior information these correlation scales do not have to be exact they can be guessed based on borehole logs for example the vertical correlation scale could be easily obtained from the average thickness of layers in boreholes while the horizontal scales can be estimated from the continuity of stratifications between boreholes with this prior information sle yields the unbiased conditional effective electrical conductivity field and quantifies the uncertainties of the estimated field by the residual conditional variance the locations of large differences between the true and estimated electrical conductivity fields on the average coincide the locations where the sle predicts high conditional variance also the correlation scale concept further suggests the electrode spacing be smaller or equal to the correlation scales of dominant geologic heterogeneity of our interest this study also demonstrates that independent tests could be a viable means to validate the estimates of ert surveys this validation concept involves the issue of redundant moderately and highly non redundant datasets which are related to the change of current flow fields wen et al 2019 not just a jackknifing resampling approach validation means verifying if the estimated parameters from an inverse model can yield unbiased predictions of processes under different stresses while the concept has been used in hydraulic tomography this independent test approach has not been reported in the literature of ert surveys we further show that ert with appropriate measurement setups and sle can yield realistic images of layers of different sands in the sandbox under unsaturated conditions this is attributed to that unsaturated conditions increase the resistivity contrast due to the difference in moisture content among different sands such that the layer structures are visible to ert survey the contrast in resistivity was due to the differences in water retained in each layer after drainage which is related to the pore size distribution of the layer again such a condition is not limited to our sandbox experiment for example ye et al 2005 used neutron probes to detect 3d moisture distribution at hanford site and they found that the field site was under steady state unit gradient drainage conditions fine textured layers remain wet while coarse textured ones remain dry moisture distributions at the site were consistent with the geologic structure therefore it is likely that ert surveys could be used to map the spatial continuity of layers at the site declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this research was supported by the china scholarship council grant 201706410014 the national natural science foundation of

6362,knowledge of the geologic structure at a field site is a useful piece of information for hydrologic modeling since it can serve as more site specific prior information about the hydraulic parameter patterns at the site than generic spatial statistics widely accepted electrical resistivity tomography ert survey for mapping subsurface anomalies could be a viable tool for acquiring this information however their ability to delineate geologic structures has not been thoroughly investigated in this study two dimensional ert numerical experiments were first conducted to study the effects of boundary conditions on the dipole dipole and pole pole array configurations an ert setup subsequently was implemented in a sandbox consisting of complex layers of different sands a continuous copper wire was installed along the sides of the sandbox to impose potential boundaries using data collected with the pole pole array in the sandbox under different degrees of drainage and the successive linear estimator sle algorithm we show that ert yields electrical conductivity estimates of complex layer structures with small uncertainties in addition using sle with physically meaningful correlation scales as prior information can lead to an electrical conductivity field that is consistent with visually observed layer structures the correlation scale concept also was demonstrated to provide guidance to the design of the electrode spacing in the surveys moreover the estimated field was validated by predicting electrical potential fields from two independent ert surveys using electrodes at different locations results of this study suggest that the combination of ert and sle is a viable geophysical survey tool for mapping geologic layer structures research significance this study develops a method to implement prescribed potential boundaries for enhancing the pole pole ert survey illustrates the importance of correlation scales and develops an approach for validating ert results keywords electrical resistivity tomography successive linear estimator sandbox experiment fine resolution geophysics uncertainty validation 1 introduction the increasing interest in predictions of groundwater flow and solute transport in the subsurface has prompted a large number of studies on an accurate characterization of subsurface heterogeneity although hydraulic tomography ht has been developed and proven as an effective technique to hydraulic heterogeneity in the subsurface over past years yeh and liu 2000 bohling et al 2002 zhu and yeh 2005 illman et al 2007 2009 cardiff et al 2009 2012 mao et al 2013 prior large scale geologic conceptual models built upon borehole logs still play an important role when the number of pumping tests and drawdown measuring points is sparse besides these conceptual models improve ht analysis as well as hydrogeological forward modeling efforts tso et al 2016 zha et al 2017 zhao and illman 2017 nonetheless borehole information often is sparse and it provides discrete and local scale descriptions of geology to improve the large scale geologic conceptual model inexpensive electrical resistivity surveys e g hermans et al 2015 2017 may be the solution surface resistivity surveys have been widely used in the field they measure the difference in voltage generated by injection of electric current between two electrodes implanted at the ground surface then the electric potentials induced by many combinations of transmitting and receiving electrodes were measured to interpret the distribution of subsurface resistive or conductive zones yeh et al 2002 parsekian et al 2015 which are then used to construct the geologic conceptual model similar to the surface surveys shima and sakayama 1987 proposed electrical resistivity tomography ert based on cross borehole and borehole to surface resistivity surveys for reconstructing a resistivity or electrical conductivity cross section sasaki 1992 and yeh et al 2002 showed the resolution of subsurface images from the tomography technique is much clear than that of the surface resistivity surveys notice the resolution is a measure of the level of detail that can be seen using an ert survey over the past decades ert has increasingly been recognized as a useful geophysical method to investigate the subsurface resistivity anomalies lapenna et al 2005 miller et al 2008 it also has been widely applied to environmental and hydrogeological studies binley et al 2010 binley et al 2015 hayley et al 2009 revil et al 2012 singha et al 2015 slater 2007 because ert surveys are sensitive to the conductivity contrast due to differences in porosity moisture content xu et al 2016 geologic layering loke et al 2013 or presence and migration of contaminants deng et al 2017 mao et al 2016 in the subsurface further ert is easy to implement and relatively inexpensive loke et al 2013 deciphering the data from an ert survey however often involves large uncertainty first the volume of the geologic medium to be surveyed is large and the density of ert array is generally low additionally the electrical potential response at a location to a transmitting current at a different location represents the cumulative response from all parts of the medium while the tomographic survey aims to collect non redundant responses using sparse measurement arrays to make the inverse problem better defined yeh et al 2015a b the uncertainty associated with the interpretation remains large for hydrogeological applications translating electrical resistivity to hydrologic properties such as hydraulic conductivity moisture content and concentration adds another uncertainty first of all the bulk electrical conductivity of geologic media is affected by many factors such as soil texture moisture content porosity temperature mineralogy and geochemistry see slater 2007 although some constitutive relationships i e petrophysical model such as archie s law archie 1942 for the relationship between porosity and resistivity and log log relationships between hydraulic conductivity and resistivity purvance and andricevic 2000a b are often used to relate the resistivity to these factors these constitutive relationships are empirical scale dependent yeh et al 2002 slater 2007 moreover the parameters e g the cementation factor in archie s law in the relationships are not uniform for a given site but spatially varying yeh et al 2002 due to the local geologic and geochemical environment purvance and andricevic 2000a b slater 2007 to avoid the aforementioned uncertainty and assess the usefulness of ert applications to hydrogeological problems over the past few decades many researchers have conducted controlled laboratory experiments for example chen et al 2016 used the ert to estimate groundwater flow velocity and monitor the advection of a conductive plume in a sandbox using archie s law similarly pollock and cirpka 2012 conducted a salt tracer experiment in a sandbox to determine the hydraulic conductivity distribution based on the fully coupled hydrogeophysical inversion pollock and cirpka 2008 2010 of time lapse ert and hydraulic head measurements slater et al 2002 conducted a 3d cross borehole ert in a large heterogeneous experimental tank to study solute transport processes they converted the time series of electrical images into estimated fluid conductivity breakthrough curves which were in good agreements with direct measures of fluid conductivity in the sampling ports other similar studies include mao et al 2015 clement and moreau 2016 slater et al 2000 and binley et al 1996 as for interpreting the results of ert survey the least squares optimization method with regularization has been widely used to estimate the electrical conductivity distribution from the observed potentials through the governing current and electric potential equations cockett et al 2015 gunther et al 2006 loke et al 2013 2014 pidlisecky et al 2007 blaschek et al 2008 lelievre et al 2009 for example using a smoothness constraint e g a discrete second difference matrix constable et al 1987 occam s algorithm aims to find the most featureless models that are consistent with the measurements gouveia and scales 1997 while such a smoothness constraint resolves the underdetermined nature of the inverse problem the solution to the problem remains highly uncertain that is the smoothness constraint does not necessarily lead to an estimate which is the best unbiased and has the minimum variance in comparison with the true field to overcome this shortcoming recent studies emphasized inversions based on regularization approach e g covariance based regularization that incorporates prior information of the geologic structure and some direct measurements of parameters robinson et al 2013 johnson et al 2007 hermans et al 2012 2016 bouchedda et al 2017 jordi et al 2018 to incorporate prior information of the geologic structure and direct measurements of parameters yeh et al 2002 introduced a geostatistics based successive linear estimator sle approach to the ert inverse modeling this iterative geostatistical technique incorporates the spatial statistics point measurements of variables as prior information to derive the conditional mean estimates and residual covariance which describes the uncertainty associated with the estimates liu and yeh 2004 demonstrated the utility of the sle method for monitoring 3 d moisture content distributions using numerical experiments solving mathematical ert inverse problems also encounters the issues related to the unknown boundary conditions in laboratory experiments insulated boundary conditions are known because of isolation of the sandbox however a solution domain surrounded by insulated boundaries is a mathematically ill posed forward problem constant potential boundaries or arbitrarily assigning a constant potential in the domain has often been used to avoid this mathematical issue for the laboratory experiment sentenac et al 2015 albeit precise interpretation of ert as discussed above may be difficult ert remains as an attractive tool for mapping different scale geologic structures in terms of different electrode spacing this geologic structure information is beneficial to the characterization of geologic hydraulic properties since it serves as a site specific prior geologic structure information for hydrologic inverse modeling efforts or hydraulic tomography as demonstrated by tso et al 2016 zha et al 2017 in spite of the fact that ert has shown some promising results such as hermans and irving 2017 its ability to map geologic layers at different scales remains to be further verified in particular in controlled laboratory scale experiments the purpose of this paper therefore is to demonstrate the ert inversion using sle for mapping soil layers and to validate its estimates using sandbox experiments for this purpose a design that facilitates constant electrical potential boundaries was implemented in the sandbox to allow fast easy pole pole array measurements sle was then used to interpret the observations to demonstrate the effects of electrical conductivity contrasts in the sandbox at different degrees of saturation we then elucidate the importance of spatial correlation scales as well as measurement electrode spacing on ert the estimated electrical conductivity field was further validated by predicting the response during ert surveys using different source electrode arrays while quantifying the uncertainty of parameter estimates we believe these are new and important contributions to ert surveys and analyses 2 methodology 2 1 governing equations the electric potential field in geologic media

to the boundary γ 2 yeh et al 2002 pidlisecky et al 2007 2 2 sle for ert tomography in this study the inversion of ert surveys was conducted using a stochastic estimation model successive linear estimator sle which has been successfully used in hydraulic tomography as well as ert for details refer to yeh and liu 2000 yeh et al 2002 liu and yeh 2004 zhu and yeh 2005 yeh et al 2008 xiang et al 2009 and zha et al 2018 due to spatial variability of the properties of geologic media sle first conceptualizes the natural logarithm of electrical conductivity ln σ x as a spatial stochastic process or random field characterized by a joint probability distribution with given mean variance and correlation lengths this conceptualization is a general description of the spatial varying conductivity of a geologic medium in the geostatistical framework yeh et al 2015a b a major distinction between sle and the covariance based regularized inversion that is sle assumes the conductivity properties at a site in terms of the average value the deviation from the average and the average dimensions length width and thickness of different conductivity clusters i e geologic structures likewise the electrical potential u x is treated as a spatial stochastic process these random fields are then expressed as ln σ x f f x and u x u d x where f and u are the mean i e f ln u x the angle bracket denotes expected value f x and d x are the perturbations with zero means i e f x 0 and d x 0 afterward the estimated conductivity vector given the measured electrical potentials is f c subscript c

unconditional mean value the word unconditional implies that no measured potential has been used to modify them suppose we discretize an estimation domain into n elements we have the current transmissions at p locations and each transmission has l potential measurements as a result we have a total number of potential measurements m p l with this survey the dimension of f c r is an n 1 vector d q k and g h are m 1 vectors the coefficient matrix ω t then has a dimension of n m and the superscript t denotes the transpose this matrix the weights assigns the contribution of the difference between the observed and simulated potential at each measurement electrode during each transmission to the previously estimated conductivity value at each element the coefficient matrix ω t is determined by solving the following equation 5 r dd r θ r diag r dd r ω f r r df r where r dd r is the auto covariance of the potential measurement and r df r is the cross covariance between the conductivity and the potential measurements the parameter θ r is a dynamic stability multiplier and diag r dd r is a stability matrix which is a diagonal matrix which is the same as the diagonal elements of r dd r the auto covariance r dd r and cross covariance r df r are calculated using the first order numerical approximation zhu and yeh 2005 sun et al 2013 6 r df r j d r r ff r r dd r j d

conductivity estimated at the current iteration an adjoint state variable approach is adopted sykes et al 1985 li and yeh 1998 mao et al 2013 to compute the sensitivity matrix for r 1 the covariance function is updated to represent the conditional or residual covariance of the conductivity according to 7 r ff r 1 r ff r ω f t r df r this update is to reflect the improvement i e reduction of the uncertainty of the estimate due to the inclusion of the measured potentials note that at iteration r 0 r ff 0 n n is the unconditional covariance of parameters which could be characterized by an exponential spatial covariance function or other covariance functions see zha et al 2018 8 r ff p p ζ f 2 exp x x 2 λ x 2 z z 2 λ z 2 in eq 8 ζ f 2 is the variance of ln σ λ x and λ z are the correlation scales in x and z directions i e the average length and width of geologic layers yeh et al 2015b respectively this covariance implies that the correlation relationship between the σ at the point p x z and p x z decreases with an increasing separation distance between the two points normalized by the correlation length two convergence criteria are used to terminate the iteration 1 if a change in the spatial variance of the estimated conductivity field between the current and last iterations is smaller than a specified tolerance implying that the sle cannot improve the estimation any further 2 if a change of simulated potentials between successive iterations is smaller than a given tolerance indicating that the estimates will not significantly improve the potential field once one of the two criteria is met the estimates are considered to be optimal and the iteration procedure is terminated with respect to resolving the ill posed nature of ert inversion sle takes a different approach to the traditional occam e g hu et al 2013 covariance based regularized inversion hermans et al 2016 jordi et al 2018 and bayesian inversion of data gouveia and scales 1997 the occam approach solves a regularized least squares problem via a roughening operator e g a discrete second difference operator to find the smoothest model the covariance based regularized approach yields solutions via using the covariance matrix and optimized damping factor as prior information e g geostatistical regularization operator while fixing the damping factor to unity would give the same solution as a true geostatistical solution tarantola 2005 the bayesian approach is philosophically similar to sle however bayesian inversion generally does not relate a priori model covariance matrix to the spatial statistics of the variability of geophysical properties furthermore sle is explicitly formulated from a covariance matrix which represents the spatial characteristics of the variability of conductivity e g mean variance and correlation scale of the heterogeneous medium using this geostatistical representation of spatial variability sle then establishes the cross correlation between the potential measurements and electrical conductivity everywhere in the domain via the sensitivity based on the governing equation afterward sle seeks the conditional effective electrical conductivity field the most likely conductivity values given the measured potentials at every location as opposed to the conductivity field which best matches the observed potentials the likely deviation uncertainty of the conditional effective conductivity from the true one is subsequently quantified by the diagonal terms of r ff in eq 7 i e residual variance in addition the prior model covariance the residual covariance matrix is updated at each iteration eq 7 while it is not considered in the bayesian approach see zha et al 2018 for a detailed comparison this update of the residual covariance is designed to reflect the reduced uncertainty of the estimates as more information about the heterogeneity is extracted from the voltage measurements during each iteration however this residual variance is an approximate estimate of the uncertainty under the assumptions of the sle i e multi gaussianity 3 numerical experiments in cross hole resistivity tomography surveying pole pole and dipole dipole arrays are widely used for 2d or 3d resistivity imaging while other types of tri electrode and four electrode configurations e g schlumberger are similar to a dipole dipole array bing and greenhalgh 2000 as for the dipole dipole configuration the potential difference was measured between the two potential electrodes measurement pairs along with two opposite polarity current electrodes source pairs at boreholes however the pole pole array has two remote electrodes i e one of the current electrodes and one of the potential electrodes they are placed far away from the other electrodes regarded as zero voltage reference points shima 1992 bing and greenhalgh 2000 since the complete pole pole data sets have maximum information and other configuration data sets can be derived from them the pole pole array theoretically should produce the best estimate of the study region under a low noise level condition bing and greenhalgh 2000 prior to the sandbox experiments unknown noise numerical experiments noise free were conducted to investigate the effects of different ert surveys i e dipole dipole or pole pole configurations under different boundary conditions of the laboratory sandbox experiments for this purpose the numerical experiments consider a two dimensional vertical profile 180 by 90 cm this profile is discretized into 36 vertical and 36 horizontal elements totally 1296 elements with a dimension of 5 cm length 2 5 cm width the electrical conductivity value for each element was created using a stochastic random field generator with a geometric mean of 0 01 s m 1 4 95 in log scale a variance of 0 0001 s2 m 2 0 7 in log scale and an exponential correlation structure with a horizontal correlation scale of 90 cm and a vertical correlation scale of 5 cm this heterogeneous conductivity field fig 1 a is the reference field in which six vertical lines of electrodes for the ert survey were installed at a horizontal interval of 30 cm along each line sixteen electrodes were placed at 5 cm interval the solid circles in fig 1a three cases were examined in this numerical experiment case 1 represents the situation where dipole dipole configures were used with insulated boundaries on the four sides of the profile case 2 is the same as case 1 but the top right hand and left hand sides of the profile were replaced with a constant electrical potential boundary pole pole configurations were used in case 3 in which the top right hand and left hand sides of the profile were assigned a constant electrical potential boundary in cases 1 and 2 where the dipole dipole array was used six different current transmitter pairs a1 b1 a2 b2 a3 b3 a4 b4 a5 b5 and a6 b6 in fig 1a were employed to yield six voltage current datasets each set consists of 93 voltage difference measurements between the selected reference electrodes r1 r2 r3 r4 r5 and r6 and the other measuring electrodes in case 1 where the profile was surrounded by insulated boundary conditions one of the reference electrodes was assigned a potential value so that a unique solution can be obtained for the governing equations in case 3 where pole pole configurations were used the reference electrodes of the transmitters and receivers were assumed to be at the constant potential boundaries the current transmission locations were the locations of the six pairs of dipole source electrodes in case 1 and case 2 therefore case 3 yielded 12 voltage current datasets which included a total of 1140 electrical potential measurements the estimated conditional effective conductivity fields for the three cases were then derived from sle with the true mean and covariance functions of the reference field as prior information estimates from case 1 dipole dipole with insulated boundaries are displayed in fig 1b while the estimates from case 2 dipole dipole with three prescribed potential boundaries are illustrated in fig 1c estimates from case 3 are shown in fig 1d in comparison with the reference field and the estimated fields from the three cases we notice that in spite of different configurations using the constant potential boundaries the estimated heterogeneous structures as well as the magnitudes of the estimates in fig 1c and 1d are in agreements with the reference field however the configurations with fixed electrodes as a reference point in case 1 yields a low resolution image fig 1b likely this is attributed to the fact that at insulated boundaries the potentials are unknown and more unknowns are to be solved during the inverse modeling the scatterplots with hexbin of the reference electrical conductivity field versus the estimated for the three cases are shown in fig 2 a 2b and 2c all the data are scattering around the 45 degree line indicating that the estimates from sle are unbiased notice that the case 2 and 3 have a higher coefficient of determination r2 0 77 and 0 79 respectively another statistics norm l2 which is the mean square error of the true field against the estimated field also indicates that the surveys with the prescribed potential condition have smaller l2 norm 0 173 for dipole dipole and 0 155 for pole pole than that with insulated boundaries 0 322 for case 1 as for norm l1 it has the same trend as norm l2 for the three cases 0 425 0 312 and 0 293 for case 1 2 and 3 respectively thus the pole pole array with three potential boundary sides yielded the best image i e highest resolution contour plots of the residual variances conditional variances which represent the uncertainty of the estimate at each location for the three cases are depicted in fig 3 a b and c we notice that the estimates using survey arrays with four insulated boundaries have relatively higher residual variances especially around the boundaries indicating that higher uncertainty of estimated electrical conductivity these results are consistent with the estimated electrical conductivity fields and their scatterplots fig 2 additionally contour plots of the error in the estimate for three cases were shown in fig 4 a b and c the error was defined by the square of the difference between the estimate and true field the general behaviors between the residual variance and the error are the same small differences near observation locations and vice versa however since the residual variance is an ensemble statistical concept it does not necessarily correspond exactly the difference between the estimate and the true 4 sandbox experiments 4 1 setup to illustrate the effectiveness and merits of our new ert design in a laboratory sandbox we constructed a heterogeneous soil profile in a 180 cm long 90 cm high and 10 cm thick sandbox with 19 layers of sands of different grain sizes fig 5 a and b based on the numerical experiments we installed 96 copper electrodes at 5 cm vertical spacing and 30 cm horizontal spacing on one side of the sandbox black circles in fig 5c after the sandbox was packed with sands the grain size saturated hydraulic conductivity and porosity for five materials were listed in table 1 since thickness averaged electrical potentials were our primary interest the length of the electrode was made long enough to penetrate 90 of the thickness of the sandbox avoiding influences of the water on the other side of the sandbox wall in addition to decrease the contact resistance between the electrodes and the sands we enlarged the electrode contact surface area as much as possible hence copper electrodes were designed as 9 cm in length with 0 18 cm in diameter the front part approximately 8 cm of the electrode was in direct contact with the sands while the rest about 1 cm was wrapped with non conductive pvc heat shrink tube and fixed on the glass to avoid possible impacts of water between the sand and this side of the wall as illustrated in fig 5a and c both sides and top of the sandbox are compartments for water reservoirs transparent boundaries in fig 5a or areas bounded by the solid black lines and dotted lines in fig 5c before the experiments the sandbox was repeatedly filled with tap water by increasing the water level in the reservoirs on the two sides to completely fill the upper reservoir and then drained to ensure that the sand is fully compacted and settled the water was drained from the lower left and lower right outlets of the two side reservoirs 4 2 ert data acquisition based on the results of our numerical experiments we employed a pole pole approach with constant potential boundaries during the sandbox experiments to create a constant potential boundary along the three sides of the sandbox we inserted a continuous copper wire into the sands around the upper left and right sides of the sandbox red line in fig 5c this wire is connected to the negative pole of the current source as well as the negative pole of the receiver as such this wire serves as a constant zero electrical potential boundaries the positive pole of the source then introduced the direct current to one of the 96 electrodes and the potentials at the other 95 electrodes are monitored i e one snapshot a given current was transmitted at selected ten different locations the black solid rectangles and dashed ellipses in fig 5c a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7 and a8 for calibration a9 and a10 for validation in section 4 6 individually to scan the sandbox under drainage and fully saturated conditions all the datasets acquired for above the configurations were taken by agi supersting 8 channel resistivity meter the measurement time was about 0 4 sec which including current injection period and data recording time for each individual following each measurement the current source was shut down for 0 4 sec to reduce induced polarization effect generally 10 snapshots for pole pole array took less than 20 min 4 3 electrical potential fields at different drainage times the aforementioned data acquisition method was applied to the sandbox under a fully saturated condition t 0 and unsaturated conditions with different drainage times t 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 h this drainage experiment was conducted based on the fact that after drainage fine textured sands will retain more water and the coarse ones will retain less due to the difference in capillary forces as documented in the results of the field study by ye et al 2005 in effect stochastic analysis of unsaturated flow by yeh et al 1985b also suggested that variances of local scale pressure head moisture content and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity increase as the average moisture content of a medium decreases we thus expect that after drainage the electric conductivity of the fine textured sands should be higher than those of the coarse textured sands the contrasts in electric conductivity of different layers should increase and the general shape of different layers could be detected in fig 6 the contour maps show the electric potential fields after current injection at a location 0 75 0 7 for the fully saturated condition t 0 and the unsaturated condition at t 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 h all the potentials in mv were scaled to 1 ma current injection for the saturated condition the contour map shows concentric circles around the injection point due to the nearly homogeneous resistivity distributions after 0 5 h of drainage the potential distributions became elliptic they stretched in horizontal directions at later times suggesting anisotropic behaviors reflecting layering effects similar behaviors were observed when the sources were at other locations these observations seem to corroborate the moisture dependent anisotropy theory for unsaturated hydraulic conductivity yeh et al 1985b the theory stated that water in stratified soils tend to move horizontally as the soils become less saturated that is the electrical potential field behaves in a manner similar to the pressure head or moisture content field in flow through porous media even though the underlining physics is different nevertheless these potential maps did not clearly reveal the layer structure of the sands in the sandbox as some might expect on the other hand the smoothness of the map is indicative of the diffusive nature of the electrical potential the change in potentials due to variation in resistivity is small the smoothness of the potential field is similar to the drawdown distribution induced by a pumping test in an aquifer aquifer heterogeneity does not affect drawdown distribution significantly the results are consistent with the results of the stochastic analysis of the effects of heterogeneity on the drawdown of groundwater flow gelhar 1993 4 4 sle inversion results the raw data from the ert surveys were then inputted to sle algorithm to estimate the electric conductivity fields of the sandbox at the fully saturated condition 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 h after drainage for these inverse modeling the prior mean conductivity was 0 05 s m 1 3 2 in log scale and its variance was 0 0018 s2 m 2 0 5 in log scale they were estimates based on apparent resistivity ρ a in ohm m calculated by differential potentials δ v and injected current i 9 ρ a k δ v i where k is the geometric factor see loke et al 2013 depending on the configurations a value of 5 cm was assigned for the vertical correlation scale and 90 cm for the horizontal correlation scale these correlation scales were estimated based on the visual examination of the average thickness and length of the layers in the sandbox the estimated conductivity field under a fully saturated condition is illustrated in fig 7 a it does not reveal the layer structure likely due to the dominance of the electrical conductivity of the tap water and small contrast in the porosity of the different sands around 0 37 0 39 see table 1 according to archie s law stochastic theories of groundwater flow gelhar 1993 and unsaturated flow yeh et al 1985a b c may suggest a solution to this issue these theories stated the head variance will increase in a heterogeneous media if the hydraulic gradient increases even if the heterogeneity remains the same thus a large injected current should increase the potential variation reflecting heterogeneity such that it can be detected clearly by the sensor under this large input voltage ert may be able to detect the layer structure in the sandbox nevertheless verification of this hypothesis is out of the scope of this study as discussed earlier the drainage of the sandbox could increase the resistivity contrasts in the sandbox to support this hypothesis the estimated variances and the spatial mean of the estimated conductivity fields at the fully saturated condition 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 h after drainage are shown in fig 7b the spatial mean average over the entire sandbox of the estimated conductivity field changed from 0 1 s m at the saturation to around 0 05 s m at the end of the drainage period see the right hand side axis this decreasing trend in spatial mean agrees with the fact that less water in the sandbox the less conductive the medium is the variance of the lnσ field is 0 3 at the saturation rises rapidly and stabilizes at 2 0 with increasing of the drainage time consistent with our earlier speculation to further substantiate our speculation that increasing the resistivity contrast in the sandbox ert will be able to delineate the layering structure the estimated conductivity distribution at 2 5 h after drainage and its residual variance map are illustrated in fig 8 a and b respectively the black lines in fig 8a and b are the outlines of the 19 layers based on our visualization examining fig 8a we notice that the layer structures from ert estimate generally agree with the layer structure visually observed from the sandbox the coarse sand layers have low electrical conductivity values and the fine sands have high values the conductivities of the regions at the bottom of the sandbox i e blue layer 1 and orange layer 2 were high due to the accumulation of undrained water at the bottom 4 5 importance of prior information for sle sle was used to interpret the ert survey data this inverse or estimation problem is underdetermined or ill defined more parameters than potential measurements and cannot be solved exactly in order to overcome this difficulty sle uses the spatial covariance function r ff spatial correlation between parameters as prior information to regularize the problem the covariance function is an exponential function which extends the influences of the sensitivity of potential measurements to conductivity at different parts of the profile sun et al 2013 such influences are controlled by the horizontal and vertical correlation scales as well as the sensitivity of potential to change in electric conductivity a plot of the estimated conductivity field using a vertical correlation scale of 5 cm and a horizontal correlation scale of 10 cm smaller than the average length of the physical layers as prior information is displayed in fig 8c the estimated field exhibits several localized anomalously high conductivity blocks in comparison with the estimates in fig 8a which was obtained by using a horizontal correlation scale of 90 cm besides the layer structures near the boundaries of the sandbox are not visible these high conductivity zones and blurred boundaries suggest that the covariance function and the sensitivity do not capture the true spatial relationship between the measured potential and adjacent conductivity anomalies on the other hand based on the experiments not shown here we notice that using values greater than 90 cm as the horizontal correlation scale did not further improve the estimates in comparison with those in fig 8a another way to assess the different estimated models is by comparing the data misfits or rms i e root mean square error between the potential predictions and observations linde et al 2015 as expected the rms for the estimates in fig 8c has much larger value about 23 07 mv than that of the estimates in fig 8a around 17 65 mv although the covariance function is analogous to the regularization term in other inverse methods such as occam s inversion or bayesian approach the correlation scales in the covariance function of sle or other geostatistics based algorithms e g kitanidis 1995 were derived from visual examinations of the sandbox fig 5a or b under field situations examinations of outcrops geologic map or borehole logs could suggest some approximate correlation scales yeh et al 2015b pointed out that the correlation scales do not have to be exact but they have to be reasonably close to the average dimensions of the heterogeneity they are soft constraints to the inverse modeling efforts the effects will be overridden once measurements become abundant i e many samples within the correlation scale note that regularization approaches using covariance based solution likely reach the similar conclusion about the effect of the choice of prior covariance model e g hansen et al 2006 the prior information determines the unconstrained part of model with little measurements and is honored only when it is consistent with the observed data the correlation scales also play an important role in the design of electrode spacing during ert surveys as a rule of thumb the receiver electrode spacing should be smaller than the dimension of the dominant anomalies of our interests yeh et al 2015b and this was verified in yeh and liu 2000 for hydraulic tomography specifically the optimal distance of the monitoring network at least should be smaller than 0 5 times the correlation scale of heterogeneity of our interest for instance the estimated conductivity field using data collected from the vertical electrode spacing of 10 cm is presented in fig 8d the estimates in fig 8d are not as detailed as those in fig 8a this finding therefore could be of practical importance to the design of the ert layout 4 6 validation of the estimated parameters the true electrical conductivity distributions of a field site as well as the sandbox in this study are unknown one possible approach to quantitatively assess the accuracy of the estimates from ert is to validate the estimates using independent surveys independent surveys should be conducted at new transmitter and receiver locations which were never used in the previous inverse modeling effects that is had the conductivity field been completely characterized by the ert survey the estimated field would have predicted exact electric field induced by the independent surveys otherwise the predicted electric field will deviate from the observed as reported in hydraulic tomography by huang et al 2011 in order to carry out this validation exercise we chose to use sle to estimate a new conductivity field of the sandbox at 2 5 h after drainage using potential measurements at 18 electrodes white circles in fig 9 a this is because the aforementioned ert inversion all 96 electrodes were used as either transmitters or receivers to create the new estimated field the current transmission locations and the prior information of sle remain the same as those in fig 8a eight red rectangles in fig 9a this arrangement left us a total of 72 electrodes for validation the new estimated field is illustrated in fig 9a and the scatter plot of the calibrated vs measured potentials is shown in fig 9b as shown in the scatter plot the calibration is as good as those based on dense measurement electrodes nonetheless the newly estimated field fig 9a has a lower resolution than those in fig 8a and d because the potential measurement interval in the vertical direction is 25 cm much larger than 5 cm and 10 cm in fig 8a this newly estimated field was then used to predict the two potential fields measured at those discarded electrode rows induced by the current transmissions at locations a9 and a10 these transmission electrodes were not used as either transmission or receiver electrodes in the creation of the new estimated field the validation results scatter plots of the predicted vs the measured potentials are displayed in fig 9c and d respectively for a9 and a10 transmitters as expected the predicted potentials versus the observed are generally scattering along the 45 degree line indicating that sle yields unbiased conditional effective conductivity field but at a lower resolution i e larger scatterings in the scatter plots in fig 9c and d than those in fig 9b these large scatterings confirm that these two validation tests are independent of the tests used in the model calibration since they carry non redundant information wen et al 2019 more importantly the new estimated electrical conductivity field can predict the potential fields due to stresses at different locations unbiasedly with some discrepancies these discrepancies are the effects of unresolved conductivity heterogeneity resulting from the low density of the survey on the other hand the results also imply that these two independent tests could increase the resolution of the estimates if they were included in the inverse modeling they carry new information about the heterogeneity while a similar concept has been used in hydraulic tomography e g liu et al 2007 xiang et al 2009 and others this independent test approach has not been reported in the literature of ert surveys this is particularly of importance in hydrogeophysics since ert results have been generally compared with the estimates from borehole resistivity surveys since ert and borehole geophysics are at different scales the comparison may be limited to large scale features only for this reason we believe that this validation approach may be a new way to substantiate the ert survey estimates in the field of hydrogeophysics 5 discussions and conclusions our study suggests that the ert survey using a pole pole array with constant potential boundaries is more effective than using the dipole dipole array to implement constant potential boundaries in our sandbox experiments we embedded a continuous copper wire in the sands on three sides of the sandbox and connected it to the negative pole of the current source as well as the negative pole of the receiver such a pole pole setup facilitated a fast measurement and better conductivity estimation and lowered its uncertainties further it expedited convergence of the estimation because of the precise boundary conditions i e zero electrical potential albeit the above approach appears to be limited to the sandbox experiment it has the potential for field applications as a matter of the fact rucker et al 2010 2011 used steel casing wells connected to the current source as long electrodes near the target to electrically monitor the waste plumes in the vadose zone at the t tank farm at the hanford nuclear site which overcomes the smearing issue by the upper conductive layer and obtained better deeper subsurface information yang et al 2017 present a 3d ert modeling with long electrode sources their results showed that the arrays with long electrode sources are more sensitive to the subsurface anomalies than those with point electrode sources based on these studies it is rational to speculate that steel wells i e long electrodes or steel sheets can be used as constant potential boundary conditions by connecting to the source of the ert survey these studies and our results may lead to new research on field applications of this approach although it might be a limitation to extend the method to the field at this moment unlike most ert inversion methods which are based on tikhonov regularization the sle approach inherently uses physically meaningful correlation scales as prior information these correlation scales do not have to be exact they can be guessed based on borehole logs for example the vertical correlation scale could be easily obtained from the average thickness of layers in boreholes while the horizontal scales can be estimated from the continuity of stratifications between boreholes with this prior information sle yields the unbiased conditional effective electrical conductivity field and quantifies the uncertainties of the estimated field by the residual conditional variance the locations of large differences between the true and estimated electrical conductivity fields on the average coincide the locations where the sle predicts high conditional variance also the correlation scale concept further suggests the electrode spacing be smaller or equal to the correlation scales of dominant geologic heterogeneity of our interest this study also demonstrates that independent tests could be a viable means to validate the estimates of ert surveys this validation concept involves the issue of redundant moderately and highly non redundant datasets which are related to the change of current flow fields wen et al 2019 not just a jackknifing resampling approach validation means verifying if the estimated parameters from an inverse model can yield unbiased predictions of processes under different stresses while the concept has been used in hydraulic tomography this independent test approach has not been reported in the literature of ert surveys we further show that ert with appropriate measurement setups and sle can yield realistic images of layers of different sands in the sandbox under unsaturated conditions this is attributed to that unsaturated conditions increase the resistivity contrast due to the difference in moisture content among different sands such that the layer structures are visible to ert survey the contrast in resistivity was due to the differences in water retained in each layer after drainage which is related to the pore size distribution of the layer again such a condition is not limited to our sandbox experiment for example ye et al 2005 used neutron probes to detect 3d moisture distribution at hanford site and they found that the field site was under steady state unit gradient drainage conditions fine textured layers remain wet while coarse textured ones remain dry moisture distributions at the site were consistent with the geologic structure therefore it is likely that ert surveys could be used to map the spatial continuity of layers at the site declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this research was supported by the china scholarship council grant 201706410014 the national natural science foundation of

6363,current precipitation measurements are conducted largely by simple automatic rain gauges despite being error prone and sometimes of questionable accuracy the procedure is still widely used in recent years new possibilities have emerged which are based on different measuring principles although the application of alternative devices is increasing its use in research is limited in this study precipitation measurements by different devices were compared and systematic errors caused by individual characteristics were corrected data were collected by means of a monitoring network which included a piezoelectric precipitation sensor mounted at 2 3 m a standard tipping bucket at 1 m and a weighable gravitation lysimeter at ground level as measurements at ground level are considered as optimum the records of the lysimeter were thereby determined as a reference the results showed that precipitation measured by elevated rain gauges differed in total between 6 8 and 35 compared to rainfall measured by the lysimeter the records correlated well but the analyses indicated a strong influence of the precipitation intensity on the recorded amount of precipitation the deviations between values of the rain gauges and those of the lysimeter increased with rainfall intensity in general the tipping bucket demonstrated negative error values and indicated an underestimation of precipitation compared to records at ground level whereas the piezoelectric precipitation sensor showed an overestimation by highly positive error values a subsequent precipitation correction through the linear scaling method improved significantly the raw data of the rain gauges keywords precipitation precipitation correction bias tipping bucket rain gauge lysimeter piezoelectric precipitation sensor 1 introduction quantification of precipitation is important for many reasons information about rainfall obtained from accurate point measurements is widely used in climatology hydrology or agrometeorology however this method of precipitation measurement is associated with systematic underestimation sevruk 1982 richter 1995 førland et al 1996 goodison et al 1998 which may strongly impair the accuracy the effects of systematic errors on the quality of measurements depend on gauge design and their installation specifics the surrounding area meteorological parameters and type of precipitation sevruk 1982 legates and deliberty 1993 the well known error sources particularly caused by wind wetting and evaporation loss have affected all types of rain gauges for a long time especially the installation of rain gauges at heights between 0 5 and 1 5 m above ground level world meteorological organization wmo 2014 often result in erroneous recorded values up to 75 of single precipitation events neff 1978 according to wmo there are three types of automatic precipitation recorders which are deemed to be standard rain gauges the weighing recording type the tipping bucket type and the float type all these devices are susceptible to error sources as mentioned above wmo 2014 meanwhile there are other new automatic recording gauges that are based on the optical or acoustical detection despite the advances precipitation measurements at ground level are optimal because the conditions are identical to the surrounding area and the wind induced error is negligible mekonnen et al 2015 furthermore measurements at ground level are the true reference since they show more precipitation than any elevated rain gauge wmo 2014 lysimetry is originally a method for the investigation of soil hydrology and soil chemistry in the last few years however lysimeters will be increasingly used for precipitation measurements due to the high precision weighing system von unold and fank 2008 meissner et al 2010 schrader et al 2013 peters et al 2014 gebler et al 2015 herbrich and gerke 2016 hoffmann et al 2016 the advantage of lysimeters in rainfall recording lies in the recognition that they do not exhibit the commonly occurring errors associated with the standard rain gauges however vibrations caused by wind maintenance and fieldwork or due to animals entering the lysimeter vessel are sources of errors in this study a monitoring network enables comparable analyses of precipitation measurements by three different types of rain gauges these are an automatic tipping bucket which corresponds to the standard device according to the wmo a weighable gravitation lysimeter whose mass changes provide an estimation of precipitation and a piezoelectric precipitation sensor which is based on acoustic detection of raindrop impacts all devices were part of the monitoring network that was developed in the framework of the research project kulunda balykin et al 2016 in south western siberia the main objective of this paper is to evaluate precipitation measurements of rain gauges in comparison with lysimeter data at ground level based on the results this study also applies a bias correction method to decrease systematic errors such as in this case different gauge designs 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the study area is part

summer the longest time series without data gaps was between 9th june and 30th september 2016 which was appropriated as investigation period the two lysimeters were originally used for reference analyses between arable land and unconverted grassland thus there was an ascertained crop rotation at the arable lysimeter wheat 2013 peas 2014 wheat 2015 and fallow 2016 in contrast the pristine

comparability to the rain gauges the absence of vegetation represents the ideal condition to measure precipitation at ground level because there are no external factors that have a direct effect on the measurements although the development of ruderal vegetation was observed the percentage of the canopy was still small during the investigated period so that the interception of vegetation which is part of the precipitation term is negligible 2 4 data preparation the processing of precipitation data of prec sensor and tipping bucket rain gauge was followed the same procedure first the cumulative data were converted into absolute values per hour in step two the raw data was manually filtered and all data during system error or noticeable outliers was removed when the resulting gaps did not exceed a period of four hours the values were estimated by linear interpolation the processing of lysimeter data was done according to the principle of the adaptive window and adaptive threshold filter awat developed by peters et al 2014 the awat filter is an approach to filter and smooth noisy lysimeter data 2 5 calculating precipitation from lysimeter data meissner et al 2000 2007 2010 have shown that weighable lysimeters were able to measure water fluxes with high precision the total mass of the system m was the sum of the mass of lysimeter mlys and of drainage mdrain it is assumed that a mass increase corresponds to precipitation p and a mass decrease was actual evapotranspiration eta with this assumption p and eta cannot take place within the same time interval eta is equal to zero

mentioned above a change of mass is equal to a water storage change in millimeters 1 kg 1 l m2 1 mm therefore all changes of mass are given in millimeters henceforward 2 6 data analyses after data have been converted to hourly p values the study considered only rainfall data at least one measurement station time steps without rainfall at all three stations and data lower than 0 1 mm hour 1 were removed the latter is justified by the output resolution of the tipping bucket furthermore the impact of dewfall at the lysimeter which may misinterpret as p is thereby avoided depending on the aims of data use p can be expressed at different time scales where daily values are required the hourly values are summed up for one day starting from 0 00 utc and follows to 24 h the evaluation of data is carried out by means of statistical indices the correlation of pearson r bias eq 2 relative bias rbias eq 3 mean absolute error mae eq 4 and the root mean squared error rmse eq 5 were calculated let

show an underestimation while mae and rmse values of 0 0 show a perfect match between the measurements in order to correct bias in the rain gauge data and defining correction factors the linear scaling of p was conducted the method aims to decrease the bias between observed and raw data by calculating monthly correction factors on a daily basis and multiplying them with the raw value fang et al 2015 6 p cor m d p raw m d μ p obs m μ p raw m where pcor m d is the corrected p on the dth day of the mth month praw m d is the raw p on the dth day of the mth month and μ is the mean value of observed and raw p at given month m the observed and raw p corresponds to the lysimeter and the rain gauges respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of p measurements the cumulative p of the lysimeter lys prec sensor and tipping bucket tb was compared during 44 days of rainfall fig 2 most of p was recorded by prec sensor with a total of 229 4 mm whereas tb measured the lowest sum of 158 4 mm values of lys with a sum of 169 9 mm ranged between prec sensor and tb the cumulative p from rain gauges showed relative differences ranging from 35 prec sensor to 6 8 tb in comparison to lys results of the monthly analysis are given in table 2 in a month by month comparison the maximum and minimum of p were measured by prec sensor and by tb except for september where lys presented the lowest p value the smallest relative deviations were between lys and tb which varied in 5 5 and 5 8 in june and august whereas the deviations with 8 9 and 33 3 were increased in july and september respectively in contrast p records of prec sensor are totally unconnected with those by lys because a continuous increase in deviations up to 88 3 in september was stated daily precipitation measurements correlated well with those of the rain gauges with r varying between 0 87 and 0 91 fig 3 daily p values of lys tb and prec sensor ranged from 0 to 16 4 mm day 1 from 0 to 23 7 mm day 1 and from 0 to 25 1 mm day 1 respectively fig 4 data of prec sensor showed a median of 2 2 mm day 1 and they covered the widest range of values whereas p measured by tb yielded the lowest values and a median of 0 8 mm day 1 usually p rate decreased with increasing measuring height sevruk 1981 fank and klammler 2013 gebler et al 2015 hoffmann et al 2016 therefore the installation height of tb justified the lower p rates compared to those measured at ground level in addition the smaller receiving surface wind field deformation evaporation splashing or wetting loss at the internal wall of the collector may also have reduced the measuring results on the other hand prec sensor should show lower values than tb and lys due to the measuring height of 2 3 m according to the manufacturer prec sensor has to measure up to 30 less p than rain gauges at ground level vaisala 2012 the disagreement cannot be explained without additional investigations it is not due to systematic measurement errors of standard rain gauges the measuring principle is based on the detection of individual raindrop impacts therefore variation in the shape and velocity of raindrops caused by air movements was the major error factor a further malfunction source could be the sensitivity variations over the sensor area due to surface wetness salmi and ikonen 2005 according to the german meteorological service deutscher wetterdienst dwd rainfall intensity can be classified as light rain 2 5 mm hour 1 moderate rain 2 5 10 mm hour 1 and heavy rain 10 mm hour 1 within the studied time period the absolute frequency of occurrence i e the number of rainfall events that occur under a certain condition decreased with increased rainfall intensity precipitation with light intensity predominated with a contribution of 78 88 to the total rainfall fig 5 lys demonstrated a higher frequency of light rainfall than the rain gauges but the absolute frequency of prec sensor exceeded tb and lys at moderate rainfall overall moderate rainfall occurred with an absolute frequency of 21 and a percentage of 11 in the rain gauges events with rainfall intensity 10 mm hour 1 did not occur at lys but it was measured twice at tb and four times at prec sensor which accounted for a share of around 3 it has been observed that the differences in p between lys and rain gauges are dependent on rainfall intensity the higher the rainfall intensity the larger the errors to p measured by lys became table 3 prec sensor as well as tb demonstrated mostly similar differences at light rainfall they showed error values up to 2 9 mm hour 1 when lys recorded moderate rainfall mae and rmse increased to approximately 4 mm hour 1 as lys have measured no heavy rainfall the calculation of mae and rmse based on the rainfall events 10 mm recorded by prec sensor it should be mentioned that in the case of light or moderate rainfall detected by lys and a simultaneous heavy rainfall detected by the rain gauges the rainfall at the rain gauges should be regarded as an error of light or moderate rainfall nevertheless mae and rmse have reached a maximum of 14 9 mm hour 1 and 16 2 mm hour 1 respectively these significant deviations could possibly demonstrate an overestimation of p by prec sensor due to the high velocity of raindrops this assumption may be confirmed by the more frequent measurements of p which were classified as moderate and heavy rainfall however on 9th july 2016 a phenomenon was observed which could be the reason for higher differences the rain gauges measured up to 52 more p than lys if high p amount falls in a short time water runs off across the lys collar because the infiltration capacity of the previous dried up soil becomes exceeded this water was not recorded as p but rather as surface runoff the lysimeter recorded a daily surface runoff of 4 3 mm if this amount will be assumed as p the deviation to p measured by the rain gauges becomes lower up to 30 3 2 bias correction there are several reasons for the correction of rainfall data usually it will be used for model calibration and validation since the simulations are often far different from observations on the other hand rainfall data can also be obtained from novel gauges or remote sensing which show other systematic errors and uncertainties as rainfall data may vary considerably in their accuracy due to different measuring principles data correction is necessary to decrease bias between the measurement devices for this purpose there are a lot of methods to correct bias teutschbein and seibert 2012 fang et al 2015 sungmin et al 2018 in this study the linear scaling method was chosen due to the exclusive use of wet days p 0 1 mm and derivation of correction factors according to eq 6 correction factors and results are shown in table 4 and fig 6 the method significantly improved the raw data of the rain gauges however there were remained mismatches between lys and corrected data where the rain gauges for instance did not follow the temporal pattern of lys this state of affairs was the result of the fact that the temporal record of devices occasionally differed precipitation rates were cumulated and were provided as an absolute value at rain gauges whereas lys sometimes recorded the same rate distributed over hours thus lys showed a delayed response to rainfall this phenomenon was noticeable during the analysis of daily p rates this was peculiar with night rainfall the amount of rainfall measured by rain gauges was summed up for one day due to the delayed record of lys the p amount was distributed over two days therefore the daily p rates were lower or higher compared to measurements by rain gauges for the respective day table 5 presents bias rbias mae and rmse before and after the correction the raw data of prec sensor and tb had a total bias of 1 3 mm day 1 and 0 3 mm day 1 respectively bias and rbias of tb are negative except for september mae and rmse indicate relatively large total values with 2 and 3 4 mm day 1 for prec sensor as well as 1 and 2 1 mm day 1 for tb respectively these values can result from convective p which is accompanied by high rainfall intensity convective systems occur usually during summer in the investigated period heavy rainfall was particularly measured in july which led to higher mae and rmse after the correction the monthly rbias range from 0 01 to 0 09 mae and rmse of prec sensor decreased by 40 and 33 whereas the error values of tb increased by 1 and 9 respectively in general the corrected data are in good agreement with observed p measured by lys shrestha et al 2017 have proved that the linear scaling method delivers good results despite the simple technique recent studies are strongly in favour of the superiority of complex bias correction methods but the simple implementation and similar performance compared to complex methods are arguments for their application the big drawback is however the inability to correct the rainfall intensity as it could be observed in the data of july the approach overcorrected rbias mae and rmse of tb and underestimated those of prec sensor similar results were also found by fang et al 2015 in order to correct rainfall intensity an alternative technique such as quantile mapping is more appropriate because it modifies the p distribution in expectation of changes due to more frequent extreme rainfall events 4 conclusions this study compared rainfall data of rain gauges with lysimeter data and reduced effects of systematic errors resulting from their individual characteristics by p correction as rainfall measured at ground level is the true reference it can be assumed that the detection of rainfall by lys provides precise and reliable rainfall data however the inability to account correctly for the effects of surface runoff at high rainfall intensity can lead to an underestimation of p furthermore big drawbacks of the lysimetry and their use in p measurement are the high costs and effort for maintenance in contrast p measurements by rain gauges are convenient and inexpensive though this study demonstrated the reduced accuracy compared to measurements at ground level the application of tb is widely distributed for standard measurements but tb underestimated significantly the amount of p due to the elevated installation the application of prec sensor as a new rain gauge is effective due to the maintenance free and multi disciplinary ability but contrary to the statement made by the manufacturer prec sensor underestimate p up to 30 compared to ground level the measuring results indicated an overestimation of p it seems that the shape and velocity of raindrops have some influence on p detection based on different conditions in measuring principle a bias correction in the data of tb and prec sensor was necessary there are several p correction methods whose application is case dependent the aim was to adjust the rain gauges data to the lys data at ground level therefore the linear scaling method was an appropriate approach to define correction values which will finally be applied to the raw data after correction tb and prec sensor delivered improved rainfall data with decreased error values nevertheless the method has failed for periods with high rainfall intensity raw data of tb were overcorrected whereas the values of prec sensor were underestimated finally it is not proven whether the calibration of prec sensor is appropriate to other climate zones rainfall intensity raindrop size shape and rate of fall differ at the regional level and they potentially require different calibrations due to the lack of scientific studies of piezoelectric precipitation sensors further investigations are necessary particularly with regard to their calibration and accuracy under different rainfall conditions declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the paper was based on research studies

6363,current precipitation measurements are conducted largely by simple automatic rain gauges despite being error prone and sometimes of questionable accuracy the procedure is still widely used in recent years new possibilities have emerged which are based on different measuring principles although the application of alternative devices is increasing its use in research is limited in this study precipitation measurements by different devices were compared and systematic errors caused by individual characteristics were corrected data were collected by means of a monitoring network which included a piezoelectric precipitation sensor mounted at 2 3 m a standard tipping bucket at 1 m and a weighable gravitation lysimeter at ground level as measurements at ground level are considered as optimum the records of the lysimeter were thereby determined as a reference the results showed that precipitation measured by elevated rain gauges differed in total between 6 8 and 35 compared to rainfall measured by the lysimeter the records correlated well but the analyses indicated a strong influence of the precipitation intensity on the recorded amount of precipitation the deviations between values of the rain gauges and those of the lysimeter increased with rainfall intensity in general the tipping bucket demonstrated negative error values and indicated an underestimation of precipitation compared to records at ground level whereas the piezoelectric precipitation sensor showed an overestimation by highly positive error values a subsequent precipitation correction through the linear scaling method improved significantly the raw data of the rain gauges keywords precipitation precipitation correction bias tipping bucket rain gauge lysimeter piezoelectric precipitation sensor 1 introduction quantification of precipitation is important for many reasons information about rainfall obtained from accurate point measurements is widely used in climatology hydrology or agrometeorology however this method of precipitation measurement is associated with systematic underestimation sevruk 1982 richter 1995 førland et al 1996 goodison et al 1998 which may strongly impair the accuracy the effects of systematic errors on the quality of measurements depend on gauge design and their installation specifics the surrounding area meteorological parameters and type of precipitation sevruk 1982 legates and deliberty 1993 the well known error sources particularly caused by wind wetting and evaporation loss have affected all types of rain gauges for a long time especially the installation of rain gauges at heights between 0 5 and 1 5 m above ground level world meteorological organization wmo 2014 often result in erroneous recorded values up to 75 of single precipitation events neff 1978 according to wmo there are three types of automatic precipitation recorders which are deemed to be standard rain gauges the weighing recording type the tipping bucket type and the float type all these devices are susceptible to error sources as mentioned above wmo 2014 meanwhile there are other new automatic recording gauges that are based on the optical or acoustical detection despite the advances precipitation measurements at ground level are optimal because the conditions are identical to the surrounding area and the wind induced error is negligible mekonnen et al 2015 furthermore measurements at ground level are the true reference since they show more precipitation than any elevated rain gauge wmo 2014 lysimetry is originally a method for the investigation of soil hydrology and soil chemistry in the last few years however lysimeters will be increasingly used for precipitation measurements due to the high precision weighing system von unold and fank 2008 meissner et al 2010 schrader et al 2013 peters et al 2014 gebler et al 2015 herbrich and gerke 2016 hoffmann et al 2016 the advantage of lysimeters in rainfall recording lies in the recognition that they do not exhibit the commonly occurring errors associated with the standard rain gauges however vibrations caused by wind maintenance and fieldwork or due to animals entering the lysimeter vessel are sources of errors in this study a monitoring network enables comparable analyses of precipitation measurements by three different types of rain gauges these are an automatic tipping bucket which corresponds to the standard device according to the wmo a weighable gravitation lysimeter whose mass changes provide an estimation of precipitation and a piezoelectric precipitation sensor which is based on acoustic detection of raindrop impacts all devices were part of the monitoring network that was developed in the framework of the research project kulunda balykin et al 2016 in south western siberia the main objective of this paper is to evaluate precipitation measurements of rain gauges in comparison with lysimeter data at ground level based on the results this study also applies a bias correction method to decrease systematic errors such as in this case different gauge designs 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the study area is part

the variables xi and yi be the ith value from the particular rain gauge and the lysimeter respectively 2 b i a s i 1 n x i y i n 3 r b i a s i 1 n x i y i i 1 n y i 100 4 m a e i 1 n x i y i n 5 r m s e i 1 n x i y i 2 n the error indices indicate how well the data of the rain gauges agree with the observed data of the lysimeter positive bias and rbias indicate an overestimation and negative values show an underestimation while mae and rmse values of 0 0 show a perfect match between the measurements in order to correct bias in the rain gauge data and defining correction factors the linear scaling of p was conducted the method aims to decrease the bias between observed and raw data by calculating monthly correction factors on a daily basis and multiplying them with the raw value fang et al 2015 6 p cor m d p raw m d μ p obs m μ p raw m where pcor m d is the corrected p on the dth day of the mth month praw m d is the raw p on the dth day of the mth month and μ is the mean value of observed and raw p at given month m the observed and raw p corresponds to the lysimeter and the rain gauges respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of p measurements the cumulative p of the lysimeter lys prec sensor and tipping bucket tb was compared during 44 days of rainfall fig 2 most of p was recorded by prec sensor with a total of 229 4 mm whereas tb measured the lowest sum of 158 4 mm values of lys with a sum of 169 9 mm ranged between prec sensor and tb the cumulative p from rain gauges showed relative differences ranging from 35 prec sensor to 6 8 tb in comparison to lys results of the monthly analysis are given in table 2 in a month by month comparison the maximum and minimum of p were measured by prec sensor and by tb except for september where lys presented the lowest p value the smallest relative deviations were between lys and tb which varied in 5 5 and 5 8 in june and august whereas the deviations with 8 9 and 33 3 were increased in july and september respectively in contrast p records of prec sensor are totally unconnected with those by lys because a continuous increase in deviations up to 88 3 in september was stated daily precipitation measurements correlated well with those of the rain gauges with r varying between 0 87 and 0 91 fig 3 daily p values of lys tb and prec sensor ranged from 0 to 16 4 mm day 1 from 0 to 23 7 mm day 1 and from 0 to 25 1 mm day 1 respectively fig 4 data of prec sensor showed a median of 2 2 mm day 1 and they covered the widest range of values whereas p measured by tb yielded the lowest values and a median of 0 8 mm day 1 usually p rate decreased with increasing measuring height sevruk 1981 fank and klammler 2013 gebler et al 2015 hoffmann et al 2016 therefore the installation height of tb justified the lower p rates compared to those measured at ground level in addition the smaller receiving surface wind field deformation evaporation splashing or wetting loss at the internal wall of the collector may also have reduced the measuring results on the other hand prec sensor should show lower values than tb and lys due to the measuring height of 2 3 m according to the manufacturer prec sensor has to measure up to 30 less p than rain gauges at ground level vaisala 2012 the disagreement cannot be explained without additional investigations it is not due to systematic measurement errors of standard rain gauges the measuring principle is based on the detection of individual raindrop impacts therefore variation in the shape and velocity of raindrops caused by air movements was the major error factor a further malfunction source could be the sensitivity variations over the sensor area due to surface wetness salmi and ikonen 2005 according to the german meteorological service deutscher wetterdienst dwd rainfall intensity can be classified as light rain 2 5 mm hour 1 moderate rain 2 5 10 mm hour 1 and heavy rain 10 mm hour 1 within the studied time period the absolute frequency of occurrence i e the number of rainfall events that occur under a certain condition decreased with increased rainfall intensity precipitation with light intensity predominated with a contribution of 78 88 to the total rainfall fig 5 lys demonstrated a higher frequency of light rainfall than the rain gauges but the absolute frequency of prec sensor exceeded tb and lys at moderate rainfall overall moderate rainfall occurred with an absolute frequency of 21 and a percentage of 11 in the rain gauges events with rainfall intensity 10 mm hour 1 did not occur at lys but it was measured twice at tb and four times at prec sensor which accounted for a share of around 3 it has been observed that the differences in p between lys and rain gauges are dependent on rainfall intensity the higher the rainfall intensity the larger the errors to p measured by lys became table 3 prec sensor as well as tb demonstrated mostly similar differences at light rainfall they showed error values up to 2 9 mm hour 1 when lys recorded moderate rainfall mae and rmse increased to approximately 4 mm hour 1 as lys have measured no heavy rainfall the calculation of mae and rmse based on the rainfall events 10 mm recorded by prec sensor it should be mentioned that in the case of light or moderate rainfall detected by lys and a simultaneous heavy rainfall detected by the rain gauges the rainfall at the rain gauges should be regarded as an error of light or moderate rainfall nevertheless mae and rmse have reached a maximum of 14 9 mm hour 1 and 16 2 mm hour 1 respectively these significant deviations could possibly demonstrate an overestimation of p by prec sensor due to the high velocity of raindrops this assumption may be confirmed by the more frequent measurements of p which were classified as moderate and heavy rainfall however on 9th july 2016 a phenomenon was observed which could be the reason for higher differences the rain gauges measured up to 52 more p than lys if high p amount falls in a short time water runs off across the lys collar because the infiltration capacity of the previous dried up soil becomes exceeded this water was not recorded as p but rather as surface runoff the lysimeter recorded a daily surface runoff of 4 3 mm if this amount will be assumed as p the deviation to p measured by the rain gauges becomes lower up to 30 3 2 bias correction there are several reasons for the correction of rainfall data usually it will be used for model calibration and validation since the simulations are often far different from observations on the other hand rainfall data can also be obtained from novel gauges or remote sensing which show other systematic errors and uncertainties as rainfall data may vary considerably in their accuracy due to different measuring principles data correction is necessary to decrease bias between the measurement devices for this purpose there are a lot of methods to correct bias teutschbein and seibert 2012 fang et al 2015 sungmin et al 2018 in this study the linear scaling method was chosen due to the exclusive use of wet days p 0 1 mm and derivation of correction factors according to eq 6 correction factors and results are shown in table 4 and fig 6 the method significantly improved the raw data of the rain gauges however there were remained mismatches between lys and corrected data where the rain gauges for instance did not follow the temporal pattern of lys this state of affairs was the result of the fact that the temporal record of devices occasionally differed precipitation rates were cumulated and were provided as an absolute value at rain gauges whereas lys sometimes recorded the same rate distributed over hours thus lys showed a delayed response to rainfall this phenomenon was noticeable during the analysis of daily p rates this was peculiar with night rainfall the amount of rainfall measured by rain gauges was summed up for one day due to the delayed record of lys the p amount was distributed over two days therefore the daily p rates were lower or higher compared to measurements by rain gauges for the respective day table 5 presents bias rbias mae and rmse before and after the correction the raw data of prec sensor and tb had a total bias of 1 3 mm day 1 and 0 3 mm day 1 respectively bias and rbias of tb are negative except for september mae and rmse indicate relatively large total values with 2 and 3 4 mm day 1 for prec sensor as well as 1 and 2 1 mm day 1 for tb respectively these values can result from convective p which is accompanied by high rainfall intensity convective systems occur usually during summer in the investigated period heavy rainfall was particularly measured in july which led to higher mae and rmse after the correction the monthly rbias range from 0 01 to 0 09 mae and rmse of prec sensor decreased by 40 and 33 whereas the error values of tb increased by 1 and 9 respectively in general the corrected data are in good agreement with observed p measured by lys shrestha et al 2017 have proved that the linear scaling method delivers good results despite the simple technique recent studies are strongly in favour of the superiority of complex bias correction methods but the simple implementation and similar performance compared to complex methods are arguments for their application the big drawback is however the inability to correct the rainfall intensity as it could be observed in the data of july the approach overcorrected rbias mae and rmse of tb and underestimated those of prec sensor similar results were also found by fang et al 2015 in order to correct rainfall intensity an alternative technique such as quantile mapping is more appropriate because it modifies the p distribution in expectation of changes due to more frequent extreme rainfall events 4 conclusions this study compared rainfall data of rain gauges with lysimeter data and reduced effects of systematic errors resulting from their individual characteristics by p correction as rainfall measured at ground level is the true reference it can be assumed that the detection of rainfall by lys provides precise and reliable rainfall data however the inability to account correctly for the effects of surface runoff at high rainfall intensity can lead to an underestimation of p furthermore big drawbacks of the lysimetry and their use in p measurement are the high costs and effort for maintenance in contrast p measurements by rain gauges are convenient and inexpensive though this study demonstrated the reduced accuracy compared to measurements at ground level the application of tb is widely distributed for standard measurements but tb underestimated significantly the amount of p due to the elevated installation the application of prec sensor as a new rain gauge is effective due to the maintenance free and multi disciplinary ability but contrary to the statement made by the manufacturer prec sensor underestimate p up to 30 compared to ground level the measuring results indicated an overestimation of p it seems that the shape and velocity of raindrops have some influence on p detection based on different conditions in measuring principle a bias correction in the data of tb and prec sensor was necessary there are several p correction methods whose application is case dependent the aim was to adjust the rain gauges data to the lys data at ground level therefore the linear scaling method was an appropriate approach to define correction values which will finally be applied to the raw data after correction tb and prec sensor delivered improved rainfall data with decreased error values nevertheless the method has failed for periods with high rainfall intensity raw data of tb were overcorrected whereas the values of prec sensor were underestimated finally it is not proven whether the calibration of prec sensor is appropriate to other climate zones rainfall intensity raindrop size shape and rate of fall differ at the regional level and they potentially require different calibrations due to the lack of scientific studies of piezoelectric precipitation sensors further investigations are necessary particularly with regard to their calibration and accuracy under different rainfall conditions declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the paper was based on research studies

6364,accurate estimation of soil moisture content is necessary for optimal management of water and soil resources soil moisture is an important variable in the hydrologic cycle which plays an important role in the global water and energy balance due to its impact on hydrological ecological and meteorological processes the purpose of the present study was to explore a newly developed hybrid intelligent model for simulating soil moisture content a hybrid adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis model grey wolf optimization gwo algorithm was designed here and validated against the neural network ann support vector regression svr and standalone anfis models the models input parameters were di electric constant soil bulk density clay content and organic matter of 1155 soil samples various statistical indices were employed to evaluate the performances of the applied models for a reliable ranking of models the global performance indicator gpi was utilized which is a 5 agent index the results evidenced the feasibility of the developed hybrid anfis gwo model with superior simulation results at the testing stage the mae and si values for the anfis gwo were 1 468 and 0 098 respectively which indicated the superiority of the anfis gwo compared to the anfis fuzzy c mean mae 6 427 si 0 354 and anfis sub clustering mae 2 137 si 0 141 models based on the gpi the anfis gwo model was ranked as the best model followed by the standalone anfis and svr models while the worst accuracy was attained through ann model the anfis gwo model improved the simulation accuracy by 48 and 50 respectively compared to the standalone anfis and svr models in addition based on the gpi the anfis gwo model presented an enhancement of about 77 percent compared to the ann model the high accuracy of the anfis gwo model compared to the standalone anfis model represents the performance of the gwo algorithm for escaping local optima which makes the anfis gwo as a powerful tool for estimating soil moisture overall the explored hybrid intelligent models demonstrated a reliable pedotransfer function of soil moisture where it can contribute to several geo sciences engineering principles keywords adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system grey wolf optimization hybrid model soil moisture soil parameters 1 introduction soil moisture profile is a key dynamic state variable that plays a significant role in climate and weather estimations regional to global as it controls water and energy exchange partitioning between the atmosphere and land surface kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 accurate information on soil moisture profile is also important for strategic water resources management at both the spatial and temporal scales vereecken et al 2016 soil moisture profile considerably vary in both time and space due to the inherent changes in soil hydraulic properties topographic features precipitation rates and vegetation characteristics gaur and mohanty 2013 montzka et al 2011 rosenbaum et al 2012 schröter et al 2015 a continuous soil moisture profile estimation over time and large spatial areas often involves the use of remote sensing and modeling techniques cui et al 2016 fang and lakshmi 2014 up to date soil moisture spatial monitoring at the small catchment level 0 1 1 km2 is still a challenge despite the relevance of soil moisture profile on the derivation of hydrological pedological and ecological information schröter et al 2015 the provision of a proper explanation of this variability remains a major challenge in hydrological studies aguilera et al 2016 meanwhile in order to better understanding the soil water plant interactions expert systems are used nowadays to solve real life problems in precision agriculture seneviratne et al 2010 for maximizing returns through accurate estimation of soil spatial characteristics electronic and chemical gadgets soil sensing techniques are used to map asses and investigate the soil physics for multiple geo spatial soil applications soil moisture is an important component that must be quantified aguilera et al 2016 therefore it is necessary that agricultural system modelers develop and use current knowledge based techniques for soil moisture content modeling seneviratne et al 2010 the development of predictive models which are integrated into decision support systems can reduce operational costs and save the time expended in instrumental measurements brandhorst et al 2017 multivariate data analysis techniques such as artificial intelligence models ai are currently employed as decision support tenets in soil science and geomorphology emamgholizadeh et al 2017 kisi and yaseen 2019 pal and maity 2019 sanikhani et al 2018 taalab et al 2015 knowledge based systems that apply ai are considered as user friendly and non parametric tools kuang et al 2015 raghavendra and deka 2014 were et al 2015 as they have advantages in terms of neither requiring a pre defined conceptual relationship between the input target parameters nor requiring expensive experimental and field measurement apparatus ai models can analyze hidden data attributes for modeling a target variable when operated as a black box model consequently the validity of using ai models for soil moisture simulation has been investigated in literature brandhorst et al 2017 dai et al 2011 han et al 2018 shin et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 however all the reported literature on the soil moisture simulation have been conducted based on standalone data intelligent models without incorporating any tuning optimization integrating ai models with bio inspired nature optimization has been proven to achieve optimal model parameters in some of the recent studies that focused on the design and development of knowledge based predictive systems prasad et al 2018b shekofteh et al 2017 yaseen et al 2018 among several bio inspired nature optimization algorithms a global optimization has been recently explored to solve optimization problems namely grey wolf optimizer gwo mirjalili et al 2014 most recently the gwo algorithm coupled with ai models to improve the prediction performance and robustness of ai models amar et al 2018 behnood and golafshani 2018 dai et al 2018 hadavandi et al 2018 sweidan et al 2015 yu and lu 2018 zein et al 2019 gwo works on the basis of the natural hunting patterns and social leadership of grey wolves like the other meta heuristics the optimization process in the gwo is initiated by random generation of individual solutions set the three best individual solutions of each iteration are designated as alpha beta and delta wolves that lead the other wolves to promising areas in the solution space the remaining wolves omega wolves surround the first three best wolves alpha beta and delta with the aim of finding better solutions the gwo as a meta heuristic tool searches for the global best parameters that can optimize the predictive capability of an ai model efficiently studies around the integration of ai models with gwo are yet to be reported for numerical soil moisture modeling so far substantial mathematical and experimental models have been developed for estimating the soil moisture content using a constant di electric constant dirksen and dasberg 1993 robinson et al 1994 roth et al 1992 topp et al 1980 most of these models have been established under specific conditions so changing some parameters such as soil clay content or soil organic matter content may decrease their performance accuracy to great extent ponizovsky et al 1999 schaap et al 1997 moreover previous studies have exclusively considered the soil field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp e g shiri et al 2017a for estimating the soil moisture content in the present study however the combined intelligent models with optimization algorithms were used to estimate the soil moisture content at different moisture points not only fc and pwp and in a wide range of clay contents and soil organic matter in the proposed method gwo is integrated with anfis model to handle the identification of the optimal neuronal membership function parameter values during the optimization process the goal was to minimize the mean square error during the training phase the implementation of hybrid model is validated against several well established ai models including standalone artificial neural network ann support vector regression svr and anfis models to the best of the authors knowledge it is the first time of investigating the ability of gwo algorithm for soil moisture simulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling the number of 20 soil samples were collected from agricultural lands of dehgolan plain sanandaj northwest of iran with an area of 2581 9 km2 fig 1 shows the geographic location of this plain the dominant land use of the dehgolan plain is the irrigated and rainfed farmlands 2 2 experimental data the experimental operations of this research were carried out in the water and soil research laboratory of university of kurdistan iran the collected soil samples were chopped and after passing through the sieve of 2 mm the amount of the constituent particles were determined by hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 the organic matter were measured by walkley black s method nelson and sommers 1982 the organic matter content of all soil samples was 1 the samples were then dried in the oven at 105 c for 24 h for preparing the soil with different organic matter contents the litter fertilizer with 23 5 organic matter was used after air drying the litter fertilizer it was crushed and passed through a sieve of 2 mm in order to prepare the soil samples with different organic matter contents considering the amount of organic matter in the used soils and the organic fertilizer 23 5 the litter fertilizer was added to the soils with different weight percentages to a maximum weight percentage of 28 and mixed completely and homogeneously with the soil finally 60 soil samples were prepared with different organic matter contents the soil samples were poured into the pots with the height of 30 cm and an average diameter of 30 cm a small screen was placed at the bottom of each pot after pouring the soil into the pots they were warmed by hitter to allow air to exit the pots and to dense the soil in the pots after weighting the pots they were then placed into a water bath so that the soil inside them gradually saturated through the pores at the bottom of the pots after about 24 h from the soil saturation the soil moisture contents of the pots were measured by weighting method on a daily basis also the dielectric constant of the soils was simultaneously measured according to zegelin et al 1989 s method using the tdr device trase 6050 x1 soil moisture equipment corp santa barbara ca usa and a probe connector with a length of 20 cm the measurements were carried out for 15 25 days until the soils were air dried finally 1155 soil moisture points were measured soil bulk density was measured from the dry weight of the soils and their volume in the pots 2 3 selection and division of data soil moisture modeling was performed based on the influential parameters as recommended in literature accordingly the di electric constant pumpanen and ilvesniemi 2005 topp and davis 1985 topp et al 1980 the soil bulk density ledieu et al 1986 malicki et al 1996 roth et al 1992 shiri et al 2017b soil clay content jacobsen and schjønning 1993 shiri et al 2017a and organic matter of soil jacobsen and schjønning 1993 maroufpoor et al 2009 were selected as effective parameters on the soil moisture a regression test not presented here was additionally applied to check the relevance of the selected parameters to the target variables that confirmed their selection generally the applied patterns are divided into two independent blocks namely training and testing partitions however this is a simplification that might increase the risk of overfitting when applying heuristic data driven techniques fahimi et al 2017 on the other hand using most robust data scanning techniques e g k fold testing or at least using three blocks model training testing and validation would decrease the risk of overfitting of the models however computational costs with those modes would not be assumable here as the used data are not time dependent they are not the successive patterns of a certain time series using two blocks mode where the data from both the training and testing phases are selected randomly can also give promising conclusions as advised by literature e g pour ali baba et al 2013 shiri et al 2013 and shiri et al 2014 total available patterns 1155 samples were divided into two parts the training 70 of the available patterns 809 samples and testing 30 of the available patterns 346 samples blocks table 1 shows the statistical indices of the applied parameters that shows a significant difference between the maximum and minimum values of the clay 39 6 and soil moisture 36 4 content values in addition soil bulk density and moisture presented the highest coefficient of variation as well as the skewness coefficient values based on the standard deviation values the greatest dispersion of mean values was related to clay and soil moisture based on low kurtosis it can be concluded that all parameters follow the normal distribution 3 applied intelligent models 3 1 support vector regression svr svr is a data driven model based on supervised learning that is used in classification and regression issues on the basis of linear separation theory generally learning is done using the training of the data in the svr a function of the dependent variable is estimated which in turn is a function of several independent variables the relationship between dependent and independent variables is defined in eq 1 by the algebraic function of f x and the permissible error of ε as follows 1 y f x ε 2 f x w t φ x b where y is the dependent variable x is the independent variable wt is the weighted vector b is a characteristic constant of the regression function and φ is the kernel function the purpose of eq 1 is to find the form of the f x which is reached using the training data and this process will be accompanied by successive optimization of the error function hamel 2011 for more information on svr model one can refer to vapnik 1999 in this research three kernel functions e g linear polynomial and radial basis functions were used fig 2 illustrates the schematic of the employed svr model 3 2 artificial neural network ann is aimed at the identification of the intrinsic relationships between the data through the learning process and using processors called neurons these models can determine the relationship between the inputs and outputs of a physical system by a network of neurons that are connected to each other the model will be ultimately able to detect the rules between inputs and outputs although these rules are non linear and complex the learning ability of neural networks is done by setting the network parameters with this purpose if a small change occurs in the network the network can be efficient with brief training for the new conditions in a neural network each neuron operates independently and the overall behavior of the network is the result of numerous neurons in other words the neurons corrected each other in a collaborative process this feature increases the robustness of the system the effective parameters in modeling with the neural networks include the number of epochs in the training phase the number of network layers and the number of neurons in the hidden layer in general by increasing the number of epochs in training the network the simulation error is reduced however when the number of epochs exceeds a given experimental value the error value also increases the best number of training epochs minimizes the error in both the training and testing phases in this research three layered ann models with back propagation algorithm and tangent sigmoid transfer function were used in the hidden layer while a linear transfer function was used in the output layer different back propagation algorithms used in this study were levenberg marquardt lm gradient descent gd gradient descent with adaptive learning rate gda gradient descent with momentum and adaptive learning rate back propagation gdx and scaled conjugate gradient scg a trial and error method was used to determine the number of neurons in the hidden layer 3 3 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis jang 1993 introduced the anfis considering the fuzzy theory abilities that are based on fuzzy logic and the artificial neural network approach the structure of the anfis network consists of combination of the neural networks and the fuzzy system the proper structure is selected according to the input data the type of input and output membership functions fuzzy rules and the number of membership functions tanaka 1997 in this research two methods of subtractive clustering and fuzzy c means clustering were used to classify the data these methods are generally introduced into the training process to optimize the rules in addition despite the high ability of anfis as a black box model to map the inputs to the output there are such weaknesses as long training time to determine the parameters of the membership function and the trapping the model at a local optimum point in order to overcome these problems the optimization algorithm of the grey wolf was used 3 3 1 subtractive clustering the subtractive clustering method is based on the assumption that each data has the potential to be the center of the cluster and calculates this probability based on the adjacent data density this procedure is performed in several steps as follows i finding the data having the highest potential of the first center ii separating all the adjacent data of the first center by a specified radius in order to specify the cluster and the center of the next cluster iii repeating the previous steps until all the data fallen in the radius of the centers therefore in order to determine the number of clusters it is necessary to determine the effective radius in this study different values of the radius of influence 0 1 were investigated and the best model was selected based on the lowest root mean square error rmse 3 3 2 fuzzy c means fcm clustering fcm is a data clustering method in which each cluster with a membership value is assigned to each data this membership value is determined by the degree of membership bezdek 1973 in this method first the center of clusters is randomly assigned and a membership degree is calculated for each data by repeating the center of clusters and membership degree are corrected for each data this repetition is based on minimizing the objective function where the objective function is the distance of each data from the center of the cluster these centers are weighted by the membership degree of each data the steps of the fcm algorithm are summarized as follows i the number of the centers of the initial cluster c is defined in each epoch randomly ii the membership matrix for each data point at each cluster is determined iii the previous steps are repeated until no change occurs in the center of clusters in this research the number of clusters was investigated iteratively and the best number was selected based on the lowest rmse 3 3 3 grey wolf optimization gwo gwo is one of the newest evolutionary algorithms inspired by the structure of the hierarchy of leadership and social behavior of wolves during hunting mirjalili et al 2014 grey wolves often prefer to live in a group of 5 12 wolves and they also have harsh rules in the social hierarchy according to mirjalili et al 2014 grey wolves include 4 types i the alpha wolf α which are male and female these wolves lead the group and are responsible for deciding on hunting sleeping waking times and so on given that alpha commands should be followed by the group alpha wolf is called the dominant wolf the alpha wolf is not essentially the strongest member of the group but it is the best member in terms of group management ii beta wolf β includes wolves helping alpha wolves in decision making and other activities beta wolves can be male or female and they perform alpha commands across the group and send feedback to alpha these wolves are the best candidates for being alpha wolves iii omega wolf ω plays the role of the victim omega wolves must always surrender to other wolves and they are the last wolves to eat iv delta wolves δ should surrender the beta and alpha wolves however they dominate omega wolves scouts sentinels elders hunters and caretakers belong to this group according to muro et al 2011 the hunting process is carried out by the grey wolves in three stages of identifying and approaching encircling and attacking the prey the gwo mathematical model is defined based on hunting stages and is called the most appropriate alpha solution the second and third optimal solutions are beta and delta respectively the remaining candidate solutions are also called omega the gwo algorithm uses three solutions of alpha beta and delta for hunting guidance and omega answers follow these three solutions the surrounding stage is defined by eqs 3 and 4 mirjalili et al 2014 3 d c x p t x t 4 x t 1 x p t a d where a and c are the vector of coefficients x p and x are respectively the position of the prey and grey wolves d is the vector for determining the new position of grey wolf and t is the iteration time x t 1 represents the grey wolf position in the next iteration in addition a and c are defined as 5 a 2 a r 1 a 6 c 2 r 2 7 a 2 t 2 m a x t in which a is a vector changing linearly from 0 to 2 which increases during the iteration time eq 7 and its value will be zero when t reaches the maximum number of iterations in addition for t 0 a 2 also r 1 and r 2 are random vectors in the range of 0 1 in order to model the hunting behavior of the grey wolf the alpha beta and delta are used with the assumption that they have the best knowledge about the position of the prey therefore these three optimal results α β and δ are retained and other search factors such as omega grey wolves are forced to update their position according to optimal solutions as follows 8 x t 1 x 1 x 2 x 3 3 9 x 1 x α a 1 d α x 2 x β a 2 d β x 3 x δ a 3 d δ 10 d α c 1 x α x d β c 2 x β x d δ c 3 x δ x x 1 x 2 and x 3 are first three solutions that have been selected by the gwo algorithm at iteration t grey wolves attack the preys when the hunt is stopped the vector a has a random number between 2a and 2a in which for a 1 the wolves are attacking and when a 1 the wolves are forced to move for finding a better position 3 4 proposed hybrid method in the present study anfis model was coupled with gwo which will be referred to as anfis gwo to simulate soil moisture content in anfis gwo model the anfis parameters will be optimally determined by the gwo algorithm like the traditional anfis model anfis gwo has five layers the nodes of the first layer represent the input variables including di electric constant soil bulk density clay and organic matter of soil in the second and third layers the nodes represent the membership functions of input variables and fuzzy logic rules respectively in the fourth layer the nodes use the consequent part of the takagi sugeno kang s model the 5th layer s output is the soil moisture content in the learning part of the anfis model the gwo algorithm is used to determine the best weights between layers 4 and 5 as well as the training of membership functions based on input variables the proposed anfis gwo model begins by dividing the data into two parts of training and testing in the next step the fcm is used to determine clusters and anfis is built based on fcm outputs the parameters in the anfis are updated based on the gwo algorithm so that the gwo searches for the decision space to find optimal local values and ultimately limits the search domain to a region that has a global solution in the training step the error data is used between the measured and estimated values of soil moisture to update the parameters so that the gwo algorithm produces the initial population of the wolves and specifies the values of each wolf of alpha beta and delta then the parameters α β and δ are updated according to the objective functions in the next step the gwo algorithm updates the position of other solutions other wolves according to the values of α β and δ eqs 8 10 this step will be repeated until the stop conditions the maximum number of epochs and errors are less than the lowest value are satisfied the optimized solution is then transferred to the anfis model fig 3 illustrates the schematic of the anfis gwo hybrid model used to estimate the soil moisture content 3 5 performance evaluation of the models in this study the scatter index si the coefficient of determination r2 and the mean absolute error mae were

indicating the model deviations and t statistic test tstat stone 1993 to evaluate the significant differences between the estimated and measured soil moisture content were used finally to demonstrate the simultaneous effect of the mean bias error mbe the root mean square error rmse tstat r2 and u95 the global performance indicator gpi stone 1993 was used as 11 si rmse o 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 o 12

represent the average values of the measured and estimated soil moistures respectively oi and pi are the measured and estimated soil moisture respectively and i is the number of records sd stands for the standard deviation of the difference between the measured and estimated soil moisture values the perfect value for all indices except r2 is zero and for r2 is unity according to li et al 2013 the range of si for the accuracy of the models is as excellent when si 0 1 good if 0 1 si 0 2 fair if 0 2 si 0 3 and poor if si 0 3 4 application results and discussion 4 1 assessment of the models table 2 presents the results of the applied models in this table an ann model was used with a structure of 4 19 1 consisting 4 inputs di electric constant soil bulk density organic matter and clay content 19 hidden nodes and 1 output node the optimal number of hidden nodes was determined using a trial and error process at the interval of 1 20 neurons based on the lowest rmse the minimum and maximum amounts of weight decay in the hidden layer were 0 0001 and 0 002 respectively the number of epochs needed to train the gd gda and gdx algorithms was 50 000 while it was 100 for lm and scg algorithms three lm gdx and scg algorithms with 0 1 si 0 20 presented better performance accuracy the ann model with gd algorithm presented the worst performance with the values of si mae and r2 equal to 0 467 8 744 and 0 629 respectively fig 4 shows the scatter plots of the results of ann algorithms as can be seen the ability of lm gdx and scg algorithms to estimate the soil moisture content can be confirmed based on the scatter plots similar performance accuracy of the ann model has been approved by the previous researches too mohanty et al 2015 for the svr model among the three applied kernel functions the polynomial kernel showed the highest accuracy with the si and mae values of 0 112 and 1 758 respectively the clear improvements of polynomial kernel function with respect to the linear kernel were 74 and 78 reductions in si and mae values respectively further it reduced the si and mae of values by 33 and 29 against the rbf kernel fig 5 shows the scatter plots of the estimated and measured soil moistures for different kernels of the svr model from the figure it is clearly seen that when compared with fig 4 svr models have produced over underestimated values for soil moisture contents in both low and high magnitudes of the target variable clear deviation of the simulated values from their exact measurements is observable for higher moisture values when they were simulated with svr1 and svr3 models this might be linked to the difficulties of interpolating the extreme values that have been occurred with svr modeling in the present case however the figure depicts that the linear kernel estimates have had the lowest matching with the 1 1 line for all the moisture content ranges this would show despite the mentioned difficulties encountered by svr model the impact of defining the way the data have been mapped interpolated in the domain space by svr e g defining the kernel function in simulation accuracy this partial conclusion about the impact of kernel function on the final outcomes might be corresponded to the results presented by shiri et al 2017b where they confirmed the clear impact of svr kernels on the performance accuracy of the models developed for soil cation exchange capacity simulation in the anfis model two sc and fcm clustering methods were applied the selection of the optimal parameters in anfis was based on the number of epochs number of clusters in anfis fcm and radius value in anfis sc according to table 2 the anfis sc model with the lowest si and mae values 0 141 and 2 137 respectively and the highest r2 value 0 755 presented better performance than the anfis fcm model in this model the structure of 0 21 100 shows the radii value of 0 21 and the number of 100 epochs these values were selected iteratively taking into consideration the lowest rmse values increasing the fuzzy rules is one of the consequences of selecting a small radii value that makes the categories in the data space small therefore selecting the proper radii value in the anfis sc model is essential in the anfis fcm model the structure of 35 200 represents 35 clusters and 200 epochs which were determined by trial and error in the anfis gwo hybrid model the size of the population was 30 wolves the number of epochs was 3000 and the high and low bounds were 10 and 10 respectively which were identified through a trial and error process it was found if the population is 30 the performance will be reduced similarly for the number of epochs fig 6 clearly shows that the anfis gwo is better than the anfis1 and anfis2 models in the estimation of soil moisture 4 2 comparison of the applied models according to table 2 anfis gwo model presented the lowest si and mae values 0 098 and 1 468 respectively and the highest r2 value 0 866 based on the si value the anfis gwo model has an excellent performance li et al 2013 the closest model to the anfis gwo is the svr2 model where the anfis gwo model has an improvement of 12 5 in si and 16 5 in mae against the svr2 model in addition the anfis gwo model has the highest improvement of the results with 79 and 83 in si and mae respectively compared with the ann2 it should be however noted that as the mae comprises the same dimension unit of the studied variable here soil moisture content and shows the absolute error values of the applied models variations in target parameters values would crucially affect the magnitude of this index so the higher the target parameter values the higher the mae magnitude and vice versa in this way the higher values of this index for some models might be explained although the mae value in the anfis gwo model is even lower than the minimum observed soil moisture content see table1 moreover as mentioned before three additional indices of uncertainty u95 t statistic test and the global performance were used for better assessment of the applied models fig 7 shows the values of u95 and t statistic of the applied models from the figure it can be clearly seen that the anfis gwo model has the smallest value of the u95 index that confirms its superior performance over the other applied models this model presented 66 and 33 reductions of u95 index compared to the anfis2 and anfis1 models respectively all models were significant at 95 level in the t statistic index confirming the significant differences between the estimated and measured values of soil moisture meanwhile the anfis gwo model has higher values 45 and 19 than the anfis1 and ann1 models accordingly based on the overall error distribution for all the test data three anfis gwo anfis1 and ann1 models are listed in a boxplot fig 8 in this boxplot the error values were calculated as the differences between the measured and estimated soil moisture values so the negative and positive errors represent respectively the under and over estimations as can be seen in fig 8 the values of the lower and upper quartiles in the anfis gwo model are 0 22 and 1 63 respectively showing the better performance of this model with respect to the anfis1 model with 0 66 lower quartile and 2 48 upper quartile however the ann1 model with a lower and upper quartile of 0 2 and 2 86 showed a comparable performance with the anfis gwo model in term of the lower quartile it should be noted that the significance of the upper quartile is more than the lower because it covers more range than the errors 75 of the total errors in general a better performance can be observed for the anfis gwo model even in comparison with the ann1 model because the low box width in the anfis gwo model confirms the focus of the error around the zero fig 9 also shows the taylor s diagram for applied models the taylor diagram is a way to show how much the simulations are matched to observations taylor 2001 three statistics including correlation standard deviation and root mean square error determined the degree of compliance of soil moisture content behavior between the measured and estimated values according to fig 9 the highest and lowest proximity to the standard deviation line in the measured values are respectively the anfis gwo and ann1 models the comparison between the anfis gwo and standalone anfis models in fig 9 shows a clear superiority of anfis gwo in all three correlation standard deviation and rmse statistics which proves the ability of the gwo algorithm to improve the anfis model finally it can be seen that various statistical indices may have different results in determining the model with the highest accuracy because each index judges about the performance of the model at a unique level hence choosing the best and appropriate model on the basis of different indices cannot be a reliable solution therefore a standard statistical index is required to combine the overall effect of statistical indices for a final comparison in this study gpi was used as a 5 agent index according to eq 16 in the gpi the combination of five indices of rmse mbe tstat u95 and r2 is used therefore it is able to rank the models used to estimate the soil moisture content it is expected that the model with the first rank having a gpi value close to zero is both better in performance and accuracy than other models behar et al 2015 gueymard 2014 stone 1993 fig 10 shows the gpi values for ann1 ann4 ann5 svr1 svr2 anfis1 and anfis gwo models on the basis of the ranking other models including ann2 ann3 svr3 and anfis2 were not shown in this figure since their gpi values were higher than 1000 based on fig 10 the absolute superiority of the anfis gwo hybrid model is found in estimation of the soil moisture content although ann1 and anfis1 models showed similar performance to the anfis gwo model based on table 2 and fig 7 the gpi index showed a significant difference in terms of modeling quality and accuracy of the results in simulating soil moisture the gpi in the anfis gwo model was reduced up to 77 compared to the ann1 model and 48 compared to the anfis1 model summarizing estimating soil moisture with ai models with high accuracy levels can be useful in agricultural researches because the determination of soil moisture and total available water for crops are very important and necessary for agriculture forestry hydrology and engineering activities brady and weil 2008 also many properties of soils depend on soil moisture such as consistency ductility resistance compressibility permeability soil strength and sudden failure brady and weil 2008 ai models can be a replacement for direct measurement of soil moisture methods such as gravimetric because these methods are difficult and time consuming 4 3 proposed model validity against the literature in this research the anfis gwo presented high ability compared with standalone models many studies have implemented classical non tuned standalone modeling technique to model soil moisture e g elshorbagy and parasuraman 2008 kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 liu et al 2014 these techniques have innate limitations in terms of generalizability so the validity of their results is not reliable accordingly various optimization algorithms have been proposed in soil moisture research huang et al 2010 prasad et al 2018a xiaoxia and chengming 2016 yang 2017 but none of them has been used with the gwo the ability of the anfis to estimate soil moisture content in comparison with the ann has been proven liang et al 2018 si et al 2015 and in the present study the superiority of the anfis was evident also prasad et al 2019 estimated the soil moisture using ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd algorithm hybridized with extreme learning machines elm which increased the accuracy of the result compared to the standalone model 5 conclusion the main purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a newly proposed hybrid intelligence model for estimating the soil moisture content hence based on the efficiency of the hybridized adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system model with the grey wolf optimization algorithm anfis gwo soil moisture content was estimated 1155 measured points of the values of di electric constant soil bulk density clay organic matter of soil and soil moisture content were collected and used to construct the applied predictive model the results of the anfis gwo model were validated against several well known intelligent predictive models including ann svr anfis sc and anfis fcm the estimation results showed that the proposed anfis gwo approach was ranked as the best model in comparison with the other models the results were analyzed using a number of visual and statistical indices and confirmed the potential of the gwo algorithm as an efficient tool for generating and improving the internal parameters of the anfis model the proposed models showed a good ability to estimate the low and high soil moisture contents nevertheless it is necessary to test the model using soils of various properties to ensure the application of these models in actual conditions considering the soil moisture measurements by direct methods require the cost and time developing the data driven methods can be introduced and used in many agricultural field operations declaration of competing interest none 
6364,accurate estimation of soil moisture content is necessary for optimal management of water and soil resources soil moisture is an important variable in the hydrologic cycle which plays an important role in the global water and energy balance due to its impact on hydrological ecological and meteorological processes the purpose of the present study was to explore a newly developed hybrid intelligent model for simulating soil moisture content a hybrid adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis model grey wolf optimization gwo algorithm was designed here and validated against the neural network ann support vector regression svr and standalone anfis models the models input parameters were di electric constant soil bulk density clay content and organic matter of 1155 soil samples various statistical indices were employed to evaluate the performances of the applied models for a reliable ranking of models the global performance indicator gpi was utilized which is a 5 agent index the results evidenced the feasibility of the developed hybrid anfis gwo model with superior simulation results at the testing stage the mae and si values for the anfis gwo were 1 468 and 0 098 respectively which indicated the superiority of the anfis gwo compared to the anfis fuzzy c mean mae 6 427 si 0 354 and anfis sub clustering mae 2 137 si 0 141 models based on the gpi the anfis gwo model was ranked as the best model followed by the standalone anfis and svr models while the worst accuracy was attained through ann model the anfis gwo model improved the simulation accuracy by 48 and 50 respectively compared to the standalone anfis and svr models in addition based on the gpi the anfis gwo model presented an enhancement of about 77 percent compared to the ann model the high accuracy of the anfis gwo model compared to the standalone anfis model represents the performance of the gwo algorithm for escaping local optima which makes the anfis gwo as a powerful tool for estimating soil moisture overall the explored hybrid intelligent models demonstrated a reliable pedotransfer function of soil moisture where it can contribute to several geo sciences engineering principles keywords adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system grey wolf optimization hybrid model soil moisture soil parameters 1 introduction soil moisture profile is a key dynamic state variable that plays a significant role in climate and weather estimations regional to global as it controls water and energy exchange partitioning between the atmosphere and land surface kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 accurate information on soil moisture profile is also important for strategic water resources management at both the spatial and temporal scales vereecken et al 2016 soil moisture profile considerably vary in both time and space due to the inherent changes in soil hydraulic properties topographic features precipitation rates and vegetation characteristics gaur and mohanty 2013 montzka et al 2011 rosenbaum et al 2012 schröter et al 2015 a continuous soil moisture profile estimation over time and large spatial areas often involves the use of remote sensing and modeling techniques cui et al 2016 fang and lakshmi 2014 up to date soil moisture spatial monitoring at the small catchment level 0 1 1 km2 is still a challenge despite the relevance of soil moisture profile on the derivation of hydrological pedological and ecological information schröter et al 2015 the provision of a proper explanation of this variability remains a major challenge in hydrological studies aguilera et al 2016 meanwhile in order to better understanding the soil water plant interactions expert systems are used nowadays to solve real life problems in precision agriculture seneviratne et al 2010 for maximizing returns through accurate estimation of soil spatial characteristics electronic and chemical gadgets soil sensing techniques are used to map asses and investigate the soil physics for multiple geo spatial soil applications soil moisture is an important component that must be quantified aguilera et al 2016 therefore it is necessary that agricultural system modelers develop and use current knowledge based techniques for soil moisture content modeling seneviratne et al 2010 the development of predictive models which are integrated into decision support systems can reduce operational costs and save the time expended in instrumental measurements brandhorst et al 2017 multivariate data analysis techniques such as artificial intelligence models ai are currently employed as decision support tenets in soil science and geomorphology emamgholizadeh et al 2017 kisi and yaseen 2019 pal and maity 2019 sanikhani et al 2018 taalab et al 2015 knowledge based systems that apply ai are considered as user friendly and non parametric tools kuang et al 2015 raghavendra and deka 2014 were et al 2015 as they have advantages in terms of neither requiring a pre defined conceptual relationship between the input target parameters nor requiring expensive experimental and field measurement apparatus ai models can analyze hidden data attributes for modeling a target variable when operated as a black box model consequently the validity of using ai models for soil moisture simulation has been investigated in literature brandhorst et al 2017 dai et al 2011 han et al 2018 shin et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 however all the reported literature on the soil moisture simulation have been conducted based on standalone data intelligent models without incorporating any tuning optimization integrating ai models with bio inspired nature optimization has been proven to achieve optimal model parameters in some of the recent studies that focused on the design and development of knowledge based predictive systems prasad et al 2018b shekofteh et al 2017 yaseen et al 2018 among several bio inspired nature optimization algorithms a global optimization has been recently explored to solve optimization problems namely grey wolf optimizer gwo mirjalili et al 2014 most recently the gwo algorithm coupled with ai models to improve the prediction performance and robustness of ai models amar et al 2018 behnood and golafshani 2018 dai et al 2018 hadavandi et al 2018 sweidan et al 2015 yu and lu 2018 zein et al 2019 gwo works on the basis of the natural hunting patterns and social leadership of grey wolves like the other meta heuristics the optimization process in the gwo is initiated by random generation of individual solutions set the three best individual solutions of each iteration are designated as alpha beta and delta wolves that lead the other wolves to promising areas in the solution space the remaining wolves omega wolves surround the first three best wolves alpha beta and delta with the aim of finding better solutions the gwo as a meta heuristic tool searches for the global best parameters that can optimize the predictive capability of an ai model efficiently studies around the integration of ai models with gwo are yet to be reported for numerical soil moisture modeling so far substantial mathematical and experimental models have been developed for estimating the soil moisture content using a constant di electric constant dirksen and dasberg 1993 robinson et al 1994 roth et al 1992 topp et al 1980 most of these models have been established under specific conditions so changing some parameters such as soil clay content or soil organic matter content may decrease their performance accuracy to great extent ponizovsky et al 1999 schaap et al 1997 moreover previous studies have exclusively considered the soil field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp e g shiri et al 2017a for estimating the soil moisture content in the present study however the combined intelligent models with optimization algorithms were used to estimate the soil moisture content at different moisture points not only fc and pwp and in a wide range of clay contents and soil organic matter in the proposed method gwo is integrated with anfis model to handle the identification of the optimal neuronal membership function parameter values during the optimization process the goal was to minimize the mean square error during the training phase the implementation of hybrid model is validated against several well established ai models including standalone artificial neural network ann support vector regression svr and anfis models to the best of the authors knowledge it is the first time of investigating the ability of gwo algorithm for soil moisture simulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling the number of 20 soil samples were collected from agricultural lands of dehgolan plain sanandaj northwest of iran with an area of 2581 9 km2 fig 1 shows the geographic location of this plain the dominant land use of the dehgolan plain is the irrigated and rainfed farmlands 2 2 experimental data the experimental operations of this research were carried out in the water and soil research laboratory of university of kurdistan iran the collected soil samples were chopped and after passing through the sieve of 2 mm the amount of the constituent particles were determined by hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 the organic matter were measured by walkley black s method nelson and sommers 1982 the organic matter content of all soil samples was 1 the samples were then dried in the oven at 105 c for 24 h for preparing the soil with different organic matter contents the litter fertilizer with 23 5 organic matter was used after air drying the litter fertilizer it was crushed and passed through a sieve of 2 mm in order to prepare the soil samples with different organic matter contents considering the amount of organic matter in the used soils and the organic fertilizer 23 5 the litter fertilizer was added to the soils with different weight percentages to a maximum weight percentage of 28 and mixed completely and homogeneously with the soil finally 60 soil samples were prepared with different organic matter contents the soil samples were poured into the pots with the height of 30 cm and an average diameter of 30 cm a small screen was placed at the bottom of each pot after pouring the soil into the pots they were warmed by hitter to allow air to exit the pots and to dense the soil in the pots after weighting the pots they were then placed into a water bath so that the soil inside them gradually saturated through the pores at the bottom of the pots after about 24 h from the soil saturation the soil moisture contents of the pots were measured by weighting method on a daily basis also the dielectric constant of the soils was simultaneously measured according to zegelin et al 1989 s method using the tdr device trase 6050 x1 soil moisture equipment corp santa barbara ca usa and a probe connector with a length of 20 cm the measurements were carried out for 15 25 days until the soils were air dried finally 1155 soil moisture points were measured soil bulk density was measured from the dry weight of the soils and their volume in the pots 2 3 selection and division of data soil moisture modeling was performed based on the influential parameters as recommended in literature accordingly the di electric constant pumpanen and ilvesniemi 2005 topp and davis 1985 topp et al 1980 the soil bulk density ledieu et al 1986 malicki et al 1996 roth et al 1992 shiri et al 2017b soil clay content jacobsen and schjønning 1993 shiri et al 2017a and organic matter of soil jacobsen and schjønning 1993 maroufpoor et al 2009 were selected as effective parameters on the soil moisture a regression test not presented here was additionally applied to check the relevance of the selected parameters to the target variables that confirmed their selection generally the applied patterns are divided into two independent blocks namely training and testing partitions however this is a simplification that might increase the risk of overfitting when applying heuristic data driven techniques fahimi et al 2017 on the other hand using most robust data scanning techniques e g k fold testing or at least using three blocks model training testing and validation would decrease the risk of overfitting of the models however computational costs with those modes would not be assumable here as the used data are not time dependent they are not the successive patterns of a certain time series using two blocks mode where the data from both the training and testing phases are selected randomly can also give promising conclusions as advised by literature e g pour ali baba et al 2013 shiri et al 2013 and shiri et al 2014 total available patterns 1155 samples were divided into two parts the training 70 of the available patterns 809 samples and testing 30 of the available patterns 346 samples blocks table 1 shows the statistical indices of the applied parameters that shows a significant difference between the maximum and minimum values of the clay 39 6 and soil moisture 36 4 content values in addition soil bulk density and moisture presented the highest coefficient of variation as well as the skewness coefficient values based on the standard deviation values the greatest dispersion of mean values was related to clay and soil moisture based on low kurtosis it can be concluded that all parameters follow the normal distribution 3 applied intelligent models 3 1 support vector regression svr svr is a data driven model based on supervised learning that is used in classification and regression issues on the basis of linear separation theory generally learning is done using the training of the data in the svr a function of the dependent variable is estimated which in turn is a function of several independent variables the relationship between dependent and independent variables is defined in eq 1 by the algebraic function of f x and the permissible error of ε as follows 1 y f x ε 2 f x w t φ x b where y is the dependent variable x is the independent variable wt is the weighted vector b is a characteristic constant of the regression function and φ is the kernel function the purpose of eq 1 is to find the form of the f x which is reached using the training data and this process will be accompanied by successive optimization of the error function hamel 2011 for more information on svr model one can refer to vapnik 1999 in this research three kernel functions e g linear polynomial and radial basis functions were used fig 2 illustrates the schematic of the employed svr model 3 2 artificial neural network ann is aimed at the identification of the intrinsic relationships between the data through the learning process and using processors called neurons these models can determine the relationship between the inputs and outputs of a physical system by a network of neurons that are connected to each other the model will be ultimately able to detect the rules between inputs and outputs although these rules are non linear and complex the learning ability of neural networks is done by setting the network parameters with this purpose if a small change occurs in the network the network can be efficient with brief training for the new conditions in a neural network each neuron operates independently and the overall behavior of the network is the result of numerous neurons in other words the neurons corrected each other in a collaborative process this feature increases the robustness of the system the effective parameters in modeling with the neural networks include the number of epochs in the training phase the number of network layers and the number of neurons in the hidden layer in general by increasing the number of epochs in training the network the simulation error is reduced however when the number of epochs exceeds a given experimental value the error value also increases the best number of training epochs minimizes the error in both the training and testing phases in this research three layered ann models with back propagation algorithm and tangent sigmoid transfer function were used in the hidden layer while a linear transfer function was used in the output layer different back propagation algorithms used in this study were levenberg marquardt lm gradient descent gd gradient descent with adaptive learning rate gda gradient descent with momentum and adaptive learning rate back propagation gdx and scaled conjugate gradient scg a trial and error method was used to determine the number of neurons in the hidden layer 3 3 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis jang 1993 introduced the anfis considering the fuzzy theory abilities that are based on fuzzy logic and the artificial neural network approach the structure of the anfis network consists of combination of the neural networks and the fuzzy system the proper structure is selected according to the input data the type of input and output membership functions fuzzy rules and the number of membership functions tanaka 1997 in this research two methods of subtractive clustering and fuzzy c means clustering were used to classify the data these methods are generally introduced into the training process to optimize the rules in addition despite the high ability of anfis as a black box model to map the inputs to the output there are such weaknesses as long training time to determine the parameters of the membership function and the trapping the model at a local optimum point in order to overcome these problems the optimization algorithm of the grey wolf was used 3 3 1 subtractive clustering the subtractive clustering method is based on the assumption that each data has the potential to be the center of the cluster and calculates this probability based on the adjacent data density this procedure is performed in several steps as follows i finding the data having the highest potential of the first center ii separating all the adjacent data of the first center by a specified radius in order to specify the cluster and the center of the next cluster iii repeating the previous steps until all the data fallen in the radius of the centers therefore in order to determine the number of clusters it is necessary to determine the effective radius in this study different values of the radius of influence 0 1 were investigated and the best model was selected based on the lowest root mean square error rmse 3 3 2 fuzzy c means fcm clustering fcm is a data clustering method in which each cluster with a membership value is assigned to each data this membership value is determined by the degree of membership bezdek 1973 in this method first the center of clusters is randomly assigned and a membership degree is calculated for each data by repeating the center of clusters and membership degree are corrected for each data this repetition is based on minimizing the objective function where the objective function is the distance of each data from the center of the cluster these centers are weighted by the membership degree of each data the steps of the fcm algorithm are summarized as follows i the number of the centers of the initial cluster c is defined in each epoch randomly ii the membership matrix for each data point at each cluster is determined iii the previous steps are repeated until no change occurs in the center of clusters in this research the number of clusters was investigated iteratively and the best number was selected based on the lowest rmse 3 3 3 grey wolf optimization gwo gwo is one of the newest evolutionary algorithms inspired by the structure of the hierarchy of leadership and social behavior of wolves during hunting mirjalili et al 2014 grey wolves often prefer to live in a group of 5 12 wolves and they also have harsh rules in the social hierarchy according to mirjalili et al 2014 grey wolves include 4 types i the alpha wolf α which are male and female these wolves lead the group and are responsible for deciding on hunting sleeping waking times and so on given that alpha commands should be followed by the group alpha wolf is called the dominant wolf the alpha wolf is not essentially the strongest member of the group but it is the best member in terms of group management ii beta wolf β includes wolves helping alpha wolves in decision making and other activities beta wolves can be male or female and they perform alpha commands across the group and send feedback to alpha these wolves are the best candidates for being alpha wolves iii omega wolf ω plays the role of the victim omega wolves must always surrender to other wolves and they are the last wolves to eat iv delta wolves δ should surrender the beta and alpha wolves however they dominate omega wolves scouts sentinels elders hunters and caretakers belong to this group according to muro et al 2011 the hunting process is carried out by the grey wolves in three stages of identifying and approaching encircling and attacking the prey the gwo mathematical model is defined based on hunting stages and is called the most appropriate alpha solution the second and third optimal solutions are beta and delta respectively the remaining candidate solutions are also called omega the gwo algorithm uses three solutions of alpha beta and delta for hunting guidance and omega answers follow these three solutions the surrounding stage is defined by eqs 3 and 4 mirjalili et al 2014 3 d c x p t x t 4 x t 1 x p t a d where a and c are the vector of coefficients x p and x are respectively the position of the prey and grey wolves d is the vector for determining the new position of grey wolf and t is the iteration time x t 1 represents the grey wolf position in the next iteration in addition a and c are defined as 5 a 2 a r 1 a 6 c 2 r 2 7 a 2 t 2 m a x t in which a is a vector changing linearly from 0 to 2 which increases during the iteration time eq 7 and its value will be zero when t reaches the maximum number of iterations in addition for t 0 a 2 also r 1 and r 2 are random vectors in the range of 0 1 in order to model the hunting behavior of the grey wolf the alpha beta and delta are used with the assumption that they have the best knowledge about the position of the prey therefore these three optimal results α β and δ are retained and other search factors such as omega grey wolves are forced to update their position according to optimal solutions as follows 8 x t 1 x 1 x 2 x 3 3 9 x 1 x α a 1 d α x 2 x β a 2 d β x 3 x δ a 3 d δ 10 d α c 1 x α x d β c 2 x β x d δ c 3 x δ x x 1 x 2 and x 3 are first three solutions that have been selected by the gwo algorithm at iteration t grey wolves attack the preys when the hunt is stopped the vector a has a random number between 2a and 2a in which for a 1 the wolves are attacking and when a 1 the wolves are forced to move for finding a better position 3 4 proposed hybrid method in the present study anfis model was coupled with gwo which will be referred to as anfis gwo to simulate soil moisture content in anfis gwo model the anfis parameters will be optimally determined by the gwo algorithm like the traditional anfis model anfis gwo has five layers the nodes of the first layer represent the input variables including di electric constant soil bulk density clay and organic matter of soil in the second and third layers the nodes represent the membership functions of input variables and fuzzy logic rules respectively in the fourth layer the nodes use the consequent part of the takagi sugeno kang s model the 5th layer s output is the soil moisture content in the learning part of the anfis model the gwo algorithm is used to determine the best weights between layers 4 and 5 as well as the training of membership functions based on input variables the proposed anfis gwo model begins by dividing the data into two parts of training and testing in the next step the fcm is used to determine clusters and anfis is built based on fcm outputs the parameters in the anfis are updated based on the gwo algorithm so that the gwo searches for the decision space to find optimal local values and ultimately limits the search domain to a region that has a global solution in the training step the error data is used between the measured and estimated values of soil moisture to update the parameters so that the gwo algorithm produces the initial population of the wolves and specifies the values of each wolf of alpha beta and delta then the parameters α β and δ are updated according to the objective functions in the next step the gwo algorithm updates the position of other solutions other wolves according to the values of α β and δ eqs 8 10 this step will be repeated until the stop conditions the maximum number of epochs and errors are less than the lowest value are satisfied the optimized solution is then transferred to the anfis model fig 3 illustrates the schematic of the anfis gwo hybrid model used to estimate the soil moisture content 3 5 performance evaluation of the models in this study the scatter index si the coefficient of determination r2 and the mean absolute error mae were used to assess the model s performance in addition for more information on the effectiveness of the models performance uncertainty with 95 confidence level u95 behar et al 2015 gueymard 2014 indicating the model deviations and t statistic test tstat stone 1993 to evaluate the significant differences between the estimated and measured soil moisture content were used finally to demonstrate the simultaneous effect of the mean bias error mbe the root mean square error rmse tstat r2 and u95 the global performance indicator gpi stone 1993 was used as 11 si rmse o 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 o 12

represent the average values of the measured and estimated soil moistures respectively oi and pi are the measured and estimated soil moisture respectively and i is the number of records sd stands for the standard deviation of the difference between the measured and estimated soil moisture values the perfect value for all indices except r2 is zero and for r2 is unity according to li et al 2013 the range of si for the accuracy of the models is as excellent when si 0 1 good if 0 1 si 0 2 fair if 0 2 si 0 3 and poor if si 0 3 4 application results and discussion 4 1 assessment of the models table 2 presents the results of the applied models in this table an ann model was used with a structure of 4 19 1 consisting 4 inputs di electric constant soil bulk density organic matter and clay content 19 hidden nodes and 1 output node the optimal number of hidden nodes was determined using a trial and error process at the interval of 1 20 neurons based on the lowest rmse the minimum and maximum amounts of weight decay in the hidden layer were 0 0001 and 0 002 respectively the number of epochs needed to train the gd gda and gdx algorithms was 50 000 while it was 100 for lm and scg algorithms three lm gdx and scg algorithms with 0 1 si 0 20 presented better performance accuracy the ann model with gd algorithm presented the worst performance with the values of si mae and r2 equal to 0 467 8 744 and 0 629 respectively fig 4 shows the scatter plots of the results of ann algorithms as can be seen the ability of lm gdx and scg algorithms to estimate the soil moisture content can be confirmed based on the scatter plots similar performance accuracy of the ann model has been approved by the previous researches too mohanty et al 2015 for the svr model among the three applied kernel functions the polynomial kernel showed the highest accuracy with the si and mae values of 0 112 and 1 758 respectively the clear improvements of polynomial kernel function with respect to the linear kernel were 74 and 78 reductions in si and mae values respectively further it reduced the si and mae of values by 33 and 29 against the rbf kernel fig 5 shows the scatter plots of the estimated and measured soil moistures for different kernels of the svr model from the figure it is clearly seen that when compared with fig 4 svr models have produced over underestimated values for soil moisture contents in both low and high magnitudes of the target variable clear deviation of the simulated values from their exact measurements is observable for higher moisture values when they were simulated with svr1 and svr3 models this might be linked to the difficulties of interpolating the extreme values that have been occurred with svr modeling in the present case however the figure depicts that the linear kernel estimates have had the lowest matching with the 1 1 line for all the moisture content ranges this would show despite the mentioned difficulties encountered by svr model the impact of defining the way the data have been mapped interpolated in the domain space by svr e g defining the kernel function in simulation accuracy this partial conclusion about the impact of kernel function on the final outcomes might be corresponded to the results presented by shiri et al 2017b where they confirmed the clear impact of svr kernels on the performance accuracy of the models developed for soil cation exchange capacity simulation in the anfis model two sc and fcm clustering methods were applied the selection of the optimal parameters in anfis was based on the number of epochs number of clusters in anfis fcm and radius value in anfis sc according to table 2 the anfis sc model with the lowest si and mae values 0 141 and 2 137 respectively and the highest r2 value 0 755 presented better performance than the anfis fcm model in this model the structure of 0 21 100 shows the radii value of 0 21 and the number of 100 epochs these values were selected iteratively taking into consideration the lowest rmse values increasing the fuzzy rules is one of the consequences of selecting a small radii value that makes the categories in the data space small therefore selecting the proper radii value in the anfis sc model is essential in the anfis fcm model the structure of 35 200 represents 35 clusters and 200 epochs which were determined by trial and error in the anfis gwo hybrid model the size of the population was 30 wolves the number of epochs was 3000 and the high and low bounds were 10 and 10 respectively which were identified through a trial and error process it was found if the population is 30 the performance will be reduced similarly for the number of epochs fig 6 clearly shows that the anfis gwo is better than the anfis1 and anfis2 models in the estimation of soil moisture 4 2 comparison of the applied models according to table 2 anfis gwo model presented the lowest si and mae values 0 098 and 1 468 respectively and the highest r2 value 0 866 based on the si value the anfis gwo model has an excellent performance li et al 2013 the closest model to the anfis gwo is the svr2 model where the anfis gwo model has an improvement of 12 5 in si and 16 5 in mae against the svr2 model in addition the anfis gwo model has the highest improvement of the results with 79 and 83 in si and mae respectively compared with the ann2 it should be however noted that as the mae comprises the same dimension unit of the studied variable here soil moisture content and shows the absolute error values of the applied models variations in target parameters values would crucially affect the magnitude of this index so the higher the target parameter values the higher the mae magnitude and vice versa in this way the higher values of this index for some models might be explained although the mae value in the anfis gwo model is even lower than the minimum observed soil moisture content see table1 moreover as mentioned before three additional indices of uncertainty u95 t statistic test and the global performance were used for better assessment of the applied models fig 7 shows the values of u95 and t statistic of the applied models from the figure it can be clearly seen that the anfis gwo model has the smallest value of the u95 index that confirms its superior performance over the other applied models this model presented 66 and 33 reductions of u95 index compared to the anfis2 and anfis1 models respectively all models were significant at 95 level in the t statistic index confirming the significant differences between the estimated and measured values of soil moisture meanwhile the anfis gwo model has higher values 45 and 19 than the anfis1 and ann1 models accordingly based on the overall error distribution for all the test data three anfis gwo anfis1 and ann1 models are listed in a boxplot fig 8 in this boxplot the error values were calculated as the differences between the measured and estimated soil moisture values so the negative and positive errors represent respectively the under and over estimations as can be seen in fig 8 the values of the lower and upper quartiles in the anfis gwo model are 0 22 and 1 63 respectively showing the better performance of this model with respect to the anfis1 model with 0 66 lower quartile and 2 48 upper quartile however the ann1 model with a lower and upper quartile of 0 2 and 2 86 showed a comparable performance with the anfis gwo model in term of the lower quartile it should be noted that the significance of the upper quartile is more than the lower because it covers more range than the errors 75 of the total errors in general a better performance can be observed for the anfis gwo model even in comparison with the ann1 model because the low box width in the anfis gwo model confirms the focus of the error around the zero fig 9 also shows the taylor s diagram for applied models the taylor diagram is a way to show how much the simulations are matched to observations taylor 2001 three statistics including correlation standard deviation and root mean square error determined the degree of compliance of soil moisture content behavior between the measured and estimated values according to fig 9 the highest and lowest proximity to the standard deviation line in the measured values are respectively the anfis gwo and ann1 models the comparison between the anfis gwo and standalone anfis models in fig 9 shows a clear superiority of anfis gwo in all three correlation standard deviation and rmse statistics which proves the ability of the gwo algorithm to improve the anfis model finally it can be seen that various statistical indices may have different results in determining the model with the highest accuracy because each index judges about the performance of the model at a unique level hence choosing the best and appropriate model on the basis of different indices cannot be a reliable solution therefore a standard statistical index is required to combine the overall effect of statistical indices for a final comparison in this study gpi was used as a 5 agent index according to eq 16 in the gpi the combination of five indices of rmse mbe tstat u95 and r2 is used therefore it is able to rank the models used to estimate the soil moisture content it is expected that the model with the first rank having a gpi value close to zero is both better in performance and accuracy than other models behar et al 2015 gueymard 2014 stone 1993 fig 10 shows the gpi values for ann1 ann4 ann5 svr1 svr2 anfis1 and anfis gwo models on the basis of the ranking other models including ann2 ann3 svr3 and anfis2 were not shown in this figure since their gpi values were higher than 1000 based on fig 10 the absolute superiority of the anfis gwo hybrid model is found in estimation of the soil moisture content although ann1 and anfis1 models showed similar performance to the anfis gwo model based on table 2 and fig 7 the gpi index showed a significant difference in terms of modeling quality and accuracy of the results in simulating soil moisture the gpi in the anfis gwo model was reduced up to 77 compared to the ann1 model and 48 compared to the anfis1 model summarizing estimating soil moisture with ai models with high accuracy levels can be useful in agricultural researches because the determination of soil moisture and total available water for crops are very important and necessary for agriculture forestry hydrology and engineering activities brady and weil 2008 also many properties of soils depend on soil moisture such as consistency ductility resistance compressibility permeability soil strength and sudden failure brady and weil 2008 ai models can be a replacement for direct measurement of soil moisture methods such as gravimetric because these methods are difficult and time consuming 4 3 proposed model validity against the literature in this research the anfis gwo presented high ability compared with standalone models many studies have implemented classical non tuned standalone modeling technique to model soil moisture e g elshorbagy and parasuraman 2008 kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 liu et al 2014 these techniques have innate limitations in terms of generalizability so the validity of their results is not reliable accordingly various optimization algorithms have been proposed in soil moisture research huang et al 2010 prasad et al 2018a xiaoxia and chengming 2016 yang 2017 but none of them has been used with the gwo the ability of the anfis to estimate soil moisture content in comparison with the ann has been proven liang et al 2018 si et al 2015 and in the present study the superiority of the anfis was evident also prasad et al 2019 estimated the soil moisture using ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd algorithm hybridized with extreme learning machines elm which increased the accuracy of the result compared to the standalone model 5 conclusion the main purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a newly proposed hybrid intelligence model for estimating the soil moisture content hence based on the efficiency of the hybridized adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system model with the grey wolf optimization algorithm anfis gwo soil moisture content was estimated 1155 measured points of the values of di electric constant soil bulk density clay organic matter of soil and soil moisture content were collected and used to construct the applied predictive model the results of the anfis gwo model were validated against several well known intelligent predictive models including ann svr anfis sc and anfis fcm the estimation results showed that the proposed anfis gwo approach was ranked as the best model in comparison with the other models the results were analyzed using a number of visual and statistical indices and confirmed the potential of the gwo algorithm as an efficient tool for generating and improving the internal parameters of the anfis model the proposed models showed a good ability to estimate the low and high soil moisture contents nevertheless it is necessary to test the model using soils of various properties to ensure the application of these models in actual conditions considering the soil moisture measurements by direct methods require the cost and time developing the data driven methods can be introduced and used in many agricultural field operations
