23915,the formation and maintenance of low oxygen offshore of the changjiang river estuary have occurred with high frequency in certain regions which are defined as bottom hypoxia hotspots the two major hotspots are the southern shallow bank yangtze bank and the submarine canyon for this study a high resolution ecosystem model was used to simulate dissolved oxygen dynamics over the continental shelf and to investigate the sensitivity of bottom hypoxia extent to multiple factors scenario simulations that varied the river discharge both freshwater amount and nutrient loads riverine nutrient concentration shelf wind speed and strength of the kuroshio subsurface water intrusion and intrusion introduced oceanic nutrient concentration were examined and the extent to which these processes regulated the bottom hypoxia extent was analyzed model results indicated that the spatial extent of bottom hypoxia is markedly sensitive to riverine inputs which have larger impacts on hypoxia over the shallow bank than over the submarine canyon the simulated bottom hypoxia is more responsive to changes in river discharge than riverine nutrient concentration because discharge has a dual control on the shelf vertical stratification as well as primary production the increased wind speed enhanced vertical mixing and thus reduced the spatial extent as well as the total volume of bottom hypoxic water weakened kuroshio intrusion resulted in prolonged near bottom water residence time which can cause increase in bottom hypoxia extent increasing kuroshio introduced nutrient concentration by 30 resulted in enhanced primary production which caused larger increase in hypoxia extent over the submarine canyon and offshore regions compared to the shallow bank keywords hypoxia changjiang river stratification eutrophication residence time 1 introduction eutrophication in coastal regions can cause hypoxia dissolved oxygen do 2 mg l which can lead to detrimental effects on the structure and function of coastal ecosystems chan et al 2008 diaz and rosenberg 2008 zhang et al 2010 cai et al 2011 carstensen et al 2014 levin and breitburg 2015 breitburg et al 2018 fennel and testa 2019 regions with large riverine inputs of freshwater and nutrients are especially vulnerable to hypoxia such as the north gulf of mexico rabalais et al 2007a b zhang et al 2015 the chesapeake bay bever et al 2018 moriarty et al 2020 the baltic sea conley et al 2011 carstensen et al 2014 and the east china sea li et al 2002 wei et al 2007 zhu et al 2011 freshwater enhances stratification while riverine nutrient inputs stimulate the production of organic matter and hypoxia occurs when oxygen consumption rate during the remineralization of the organic matter exceeds the physical supply of oxygen for sufficient time thus seasonal hypoxia is often detected in these regions of large riverine inputs in summer when vertical stratification is the strongest over a year in regions that are characterized by longer near bottom water residence time than oxygen consumption time fennel and testa 2019 such as the chesapeake bay and the baltic sea where the topography is closed or semi closed the bottom hypoxia is even severe because of extremely longer time of water replacement oxygen replenishment by advection a combination of vertical stratification eutrophication induced primary production and exchange rate with ambient water controls the formation and extent of bottom hypoxia off the changjiang river estuary zhu et al 2011 li et al 2014 wang et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 qian et al 2017 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b seasonal hypoxia offshore of the changjiang river estuary has occurred with high frequency in certain regions and zhang et al 2019b defined these regions as bottom hypoxia hotspots fig 1 a variety of processes confluence off the changjiang river estuary wei et al 2015 resulting in complicated dynamics and mixture of water masses zhou et al 2018 the changjiang river discharge and wind induced freshwater redistribution are the major controlling factors of vertical stratification zhang et al 2018 organic matter decomposition a major oxygen sink is closely linked with eutrophication stimulated primary production zhu et al 2011 wang et al 2016 besides riverine nutrients the kuroshio subsurface water intrusion brings low dissolved oxygen and phosphorus rich lower nitrogen phosphorus ratio commonly 16 than the riverine nutrients usually 100 kodama et al 2015 water to the shelf qian et al 2017 the kuroshio subsurface water intrusion also influences near bottom water residence time over the shelf by regulating current velocity zhang et al 2019b anthropogenic activities have important influence on bottom hypoxia extent off the changjiang river estuary mega constructions can change the extent of the river plume wu et al 2018 resulting in variations in nutrients and vertical stratification over 30 of china s population live within the drainage basin of the changjiang river li et al 2011 changjiang introduced nutrient loads increased sharply since 1980 s li et al 2011 2014 consistent with the development history of china the increased nutrient loads especially dissolved inorganic nitrogen were shown to have resulted in obvious increases in the frequency as well as area of harmful algal blooms li et al 2014 these can potentially contribute to the increase in bottom hypoxic area in the past two decades climate change also has potential influence on bottom hypoxia extent off the changjiang river estuary bopp et al 2013 reported variable potential changes for regional scales by year 2100 using the cmip5 climate models the coupled model intercomparison project 5 taylor et al 2012 scenario rcp8 5 no mitigation strategy identified east china sea as a climate change hotspot characterized by a warming rate of 3 5 c this warming may increase the shelf vulnerability to hypoxia due to declining oxygen solubility enhancing stratification and increasing oxygen consumption by microbial respiration irby et al 2018 laurent et al 2018 breitburg et al 2018 previous studies e g yin et al 2017 wu et al 2017 consistently demonstrated that strong kuroshio current yields weak subsurface water intrusion onto the shelf of east china sea and cyclonic anticyclonic eddies play important roles during the weakening of the intrusion thus impacts of climate change potentially have non negligible consequences to the spatial extent duration and severity of bottom hypoxia off the estuary intensive investigations have been performed to advance our understandings of the seasonal hypoxia off the changjiang river estuary however hypoxic volume and vertical extent of bottom hypoxic water which were proved to be more responsive in terms of representing hypoxic situation in both the chesapeake bay and the north gulf of mexico bever et al 2013 scavia et al 2019 have not been investigated yet for this region thicker hypoxic layer indicates less optimal vertical space for fishes and other marine organisms and this important implication to marine ecosystems has been overlooked so far previous studies have focused on the role of individual processes on oxygen dynamics zhang et al 2019b and the relative importance of these different processes on oxygen dynamics offshore of the changjiang river estuary has not been quantified isolating the relative importance of different processes remains a difficult task because they interact especially in complex systems like the east china sea how those processes impact hypoxia differently and how differently the two hypoxia hotspots fig 1 respond to those processes remain unanswered a high resolution ecosystem model was therefore used in this study to simulate dissolved oxygen dynamics and investigate the spatial horizontal and vertical extent of bottom hypoxia off the changjiang river estuary under a variety of scenarios the use of a numerical model will supplement available observations which are often insufficient for analyzing spatiotemporal variations in oxygen dynamics and the processes that control them the changjiang river shelf wind and the kuroshio subsurface water intrusion are examined a series of scenario simulations table 1 were performed with variations in the magnitude of the investigated factors see section 2 for model description and scenario design 2 method 2 1 model description this study used the regional ocean modeling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 hydrodynamic model and coupled with a biological model the hydrodynamic model domain fig 1a encompasses the entire bohai sea yellow sea east china sea and part of the japan sea and deep region offshore this roms based model has 30 vertical layers with a minimum water depth of 3 m and a maximum depth of slightly greater than 7000 m the horizontal resolution ranges from 500 m in the upper estuary to 1 km in the plume near field region and to 2 km in the offshore region the model run was initiated from rest and was forced with surface momentum and heat fluxes from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf https www ecmwf int en forecasts

respectively the initial and open boundary conditions for nutrients were extracted from the climatological monthly woa the riverine nutrient concentration was taken from gao et al 2012 this ecosystem model was previously implemented for this shelf and was found to well reproduce the observed temperature salinity and bottom dissolved oxygen concentration zhang et al 2018 this model also decently reproduced the satellite derived surface chlorophyll concentration figure s1 in the supplementary material the readers are referred to zhang et al 2018 for the calculation of different oxygen budget terms and the list of biological parameters this model was initiated in january 2009 and 3 hourly model output for 2011 was analyzed to ensure sufficient spin up the year 2011 was picked for analysis because bottom hypoxia formed over both the shallow bank and submarine canyon regions in different summer months this was an optimal prototype for the investigation of bottom hypoxia hotspots to estimate residence time a passive tracer with concentration of 1 kg m 3 was released instantaneously into control volumes the two hypoxia hotspots over the shelf fig 1b water mass in the control volume was assumed to have been replaced when tracer concentrations reached values less than 5 of the initial tracer mass the integrated time that was needed for the tracer to escape the control volume is defined as the residence time of the water body 2 2 design of different scenarios the baseline in table 1 is the case with all realistic conditions mega constructions like the three gorges dam have strong ability to regulate river discharge and scenarios 30 fw riverine nutrient concentration remains unchanged are designed to examine how mega constructions can influence hypoxia evolution note that variations in river discharges cause changes in both freshwater amount and total riverine nutrient loads scenarios 30 rn are designed to investigate how the increasingly severe or mitigatory anthropogenic pollution impacts hypoxia note that the selection of 30 is a simple suggestion for mitigation typhoon hurricane tends to be more severe in the warming future with faster wind speed and higher frequency of occurrence bhatia et al 2018 thus motivated by the potential future situation scenario 30 wind is designed by increasing shelf wind speed wind direction remains unchanged for july 23rd 31st 2011 to examine the response of hypoxia to strong wind event sheer mixing can be strengthened when wind speed exceeds a certain range 8 m s xuan et al 2012 thus 30 is selected to increase shelf wind speed from an average of 6 7 m s to 8 7 m s climate change has shifted large scale ocean circulation zhang et al 2020b and intensified tropical cyclones have caused strengthening of the kuroshio current thus the portion that intrudes onto the continental shelf kuroshio subsurface water intrusion has the potential to change under climate change strengthened kuroshio current in the future indicates weakened intrusion onto the continental shelf of east china sea e g yin et al 2017 wu et al 2017 intensified eddy activities have the potential to cause resuspension of bottom nutrients and increase water column nutrient concentration scenarios 15 ks reducing current speed and 30 kn both dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dip are designed via modifying boundary conditions to deliver a conjecture that future potential variations in large scale circulation have non negligible influence on coastal regions the modification is done for the entire water column along the boundary 3 results results of the baseline model run indicated that bottom hypoxia formed in the summer of 2011 fig 2 and the geographical locations of bottom hypoxia were different between july over the shallow bank and august over the submarine canyon note that the hypoxic layer was generally thicker over the submarine canyon than that over the shallow bank fig 2e f the spread of the changjiang river plume offshore of the estuary brought both freshwater and nutrients to the shelf causing strong stratification which was primarily freshwater induced and chlorophyll concentration to be co located fig 3 the high chlorophyll concentration and strong vertical stratification both contributed to the formation of bottom hypoxia with the former producing organic carbon that facilitates oxygen consumption and the latter inhibits oxygen replenishment 3 1 river discharge both the bottom hypoxic area and the hypoxic layer thickness changed in scenarios 30 fw compared to baseline fig 4 in july the hypoxic area over the shallow bank expanded shrank by 86 8 61 2 and the hypoxic layer thickness increased decreased by 29 1 82 8 in scenario 30 fw 30 fw in august the hypoxic area over the submarine canyon expanded shrank by 39 1 17 8 and the hypoxic layer thickness increased decreased by 5 5 54 5 in scenario 30 fw 30 fw these results suggested that the horizontal and the vertical extent of bottom hypoxia over the shallow bank were more sensitive to river discharge than those over the submarine canyon and a decrease in river discharge results in dramatic reduction in vertical extent of bottom hypoxia over both regions model results suggested that the changes in river discharge regulated both physical and biological processes over the shelf fig 5 shelf stratification was strongly modulated by the river discharge such that shelf stratification degraded under decreased freshwater in scenario 30 fw fig 5a c because surface bottom salinity gradient was weakened and vice versa fig 5b d the depth integrated chlorophyll differences were very patchy because river discharge can regulate coastal currents which subsequently resulted in complex variations in nutrient distribution 3 2 riverine nutrient concentration scenarios 30 rn modified the concentration and therefore the load of river introduced nutrients and resulted in altered horizontal and vertical extent of bottom hypoxia fig 6b and c the hypoxic area over the shallow bank expanded shrank by 28 5 38 3 and the hypoxic layer thickness increased decreased by 23 6 53 in scenario 30 rn 30 rn the hypoxic area over the submarine canyon expanded shrank by 12 6 16 1 and the hypoxic layer thickness increased decreased by 11 9 30 in scenario 30 rn 30 rn results suggested that the spatial extent of bottom hypoxia over the shallow bank was more sensitive to riverine nutrient concentration than that over the submarine canyon and the vertical extent of bottom hypoxia over both regions is markedly reduced due to the decrease in riverine nutrient concentration the differences in bottom hypoxia extent were consistent with variations in chlorophyll concentrations fig 6d g the negative patches in fig 6d and f indicated that the depth integrated chlorophyll concentration decreased in scenario 30 rn compared to baseline and these patches were generally co located with the negative patches in fig 5e and g the positive patches in fig 6e and g indicated that the depth integrated chlorophyll concentration increased in scenario 30 rn relative to baseline and these positive patches were generally co located with those in fig 5f and h the differences in chlorophyll concentration caused changes in oxygen depletion during the remineralization of the organic matter and therefore bottom hypoxia extent among those scenarios 3 3 wind the baseline time series showed two patches of integrated hypoxic volume centers at 32 n the shallow bank and 31 n the submarine canyon respectively fig 7d indicating that the conditions were favorable for hypoxia formation switched from the shallow bank to the submarine canyon in time scenario 30 wind increased shelf wind speed between july 23rd 31st 2011 and the horizontal and the vertical extent of bottom hypoxia were reduced and the integrated hypoxic volume centers were dissipated fig 7 the extent of bottom hypoxia over the shallow bank decreased under the strengthened shelf wind furthermore bottom hypoxia seldom formed over the submarine canyon in august fig 7 shelf stratification in this scenario weakened significantly fig 8a and b compared to baseline the strengthened wind induced mixing which resulted in decreased surface bottom salinity gradient thus the strengthened wind broke down vertical stratification and replenished bottom oxygen fig 8c e once wind returned to realistic magnitudes on aug 1st the stratification differences difference between this scenario and the baseline began decreasing fig 8a and b because the mixing due to increased wind speed gradually vanished after shelf wind relaxed to realistic state surface salinity and shelf stratification both recovered around 10 days after shelf wind relaxed to realistic condition bottom oxygen condition also gradually became more similar to baseline although the changes occurred more slowly than surface salinity an obvious drop in bottom oxygen concentration for point 2 can be seen in august and bottom hypoxia emerged fig 8e 3 4 kuroshio subsurface water intrusion scenarios 15 ks and 30 kn altered the extent of bottom hypoxia over the shallow bank and the submarine canyon in different ways fig 9 the hypoxic area increased by 64 5 and 66 8 over the two regions respectively in scenario 15 ks the hypoxic layer thickness in this scenario shows a slight increase over the shallow bank and 35 5 decrease over the submarine canyon the hypoxic area increased by 49 1 and 78 7 over the two regions respectively in scenario 30 kn the hypoxic layer thickness increased by 35 3 and 20 1 respectively hypoxia also emerged in offshore regions in scenario 30 kn which contributed to the increase in total hypoxic area this offshore patch of bottom hypoxia can be resulted from advection of high chlorophyll concentration which consumed local oxygen and caused oxygen depletion zhou et al 2020 bottom hypoxic area over the submarine canyon and offshore regions was more sensitive to kuroshio derived oceanic nutrient concentration than that over the shallow bank fig 9 the kuroshio intrusion strength had similar effects on bottom hypoxic area over both regions although bottom hypoxic area increased in both scenarios the controlling mechanisms were different scenario 15 ks caused a decrease in oceanic nutrient supply thereby decreasing the chlorophyll concentration along the path of the intrusion compared to baseline fig 10a and c besides the decline of kuroshio subsurface water intrusion reduced supply of low oxygen water from the kuroshio however the near bottom water residence time increased fig 10e and f due to the weakened kuroshio intrusion which implied that the replacement of near bottom water masses took longer time and oxygen depletion was aggravated in scenario 30 kn chlorophyll concentration increased along the path of the intrusion due to increased load of oceanic nutrients by the kuroshio current fig 10b and d and hypoxic area consequently increased fig 9b 4 discussion oxygen dynamics offshore of the changjiang river estuary were studied using a high resolution coupled physical biogeochemical model which enabled us to investigate the roles of different physical and biogeochemical processes on oxygen dynamics and hypoxia our current biogeochemical model is a simplified nitrogen cycle model that was extended to include phosphorus dynamics laurent et al 2017 it had one phytoplankton component to represent all sizes of phytoplankton including both diatoms and flagellates previous studies reported that diatoms played an important role in hypoxia generation off the changjiang river estuary zhou et al 2020 although without explicitly representing the diatoms our current model is quite skillful in reproducing the observed hypoxia pattern zhang et al 2018 the same biogeochemical model scheme with a single phytoplankton function type has been successfully applied and shown satisfying performance in other hypoxic regions including the gulf of mexico and the chesapeake bay fennel et al 2013 feng et al 2015 future model development work could consider incorporating multiple phytoplankton species such as the diatoms however due to the complexity of ecosystem parameter space increasing the model complexity may overtune the model without improving the performance for target variables friedrichs et al 2007 xiao and friedrichs 2014 the impacts of different factors on seasonal hypoxia off the estuary have been investigated using numerical modeling method in previous studies for instance zhang et al 2019a and fabian et al 2020 with the former focusing on seasonal variability of bottom hypoxia and the latter focusing on the relative importance of riverine and oceanic nutrient loads in this study a series of sensitivity scenarios motivated by the anthropogenic activities and climate change were designed to investigate how differently the two hypoxia hotspots off the estuary respond to multiple controlling factors the analysis of the model results indicated that the sensitivities of bottom hypoxia to these factors were different instead of looking at just hypoxic area this study investigated the spatial horizontal as well as vertical extent of bottom hypoxia and hypoxic volume which serve better as ecological indicators of marine organism niche with depth this study brings the hypoxic volume off the changjiang river estuary forward and investigates its sensitivity to multiple processes the bottom oxygen minima can quantitatively represent the severity of bottom hypoxia and a decrease in bottom oxygen minima indicated worsened severity of hypoxic condition the model results suggested that worsened severity of bottom hypoxia often accompanied the spatial expansion of bottom hypoxia figs 4 6 7 9 additionally hypoxic condition in scenarios 30 fw and 15 ks initiated earlier due to earlier initiation of favorable vertical stratification and near bottom water residence time respectively on the other hand the timing of hypoxia occurrence in scenarios 30 rn had trivial variations 4 1 spatial extent of bottom hypoxia due to riverine inputs river discharge and anthropogenic activity induced nutrient loads have been proved to be important factors that impact coastal hypoxia the extent of seasonal bottom hypoxia off the texas louisiana shelf was shown based on numerical investigations to vary significantly with the magnitude of mississippi river discharge yu et al 2015a the increased riverine nutrient loads have significantly increased phytoplankton blooms and bottom hypoxia in the baltic sea carstensen et al 2014 and the east china sea li et al 2014 consistent with existing findings our model scenarios show that variations in the river discharge can have significant influence on the shelf hydrodynamics and riverine nutrient distribution which subsequently stimulate coastal ecosystem and result in variations in hypoxia extent horizontally and vertically for both the shallow bank and the submarine canyon regions figs 4 and 6 note that the depth integrated chlorophyll changes in scenarios 30 fw fig 5e h are rather patchy compared to that in scenarios 30 rn fig 6d g because variations in river discharge can regulate ambient hydrodynamics such as coastal currents which result in complex variations in nutrient distribution a 30 increase decrease in riverine nutrient concentration is equivalent to a 30 increase decrease in river discharge regarding gross amount of riverine nutrient load however the resultant hypoxia extent was different in scenarios 30 rn 30 rn and 30 fw 30 fw to further investigate oxygen dynamics across these scenarios oxygen budget for the control volume over the shallow bank fig 1b was done budget analysis for dissolved oxygen has been widely used in regions that are under the threat of seasonal hypoxia zhang et al 2019a scully 2013 li et al 2015 yu et al 2015b ni et al 2019 fig 11a shows oxygen budget that integrated over the entire water column and that primary production air sea flux sediment oxygen demand and water column respiration were the major terms that resulted in differences in oxygen change rate across scenarios air sea flux represents oxygen exchange at the air sea interface positive values indicated a net gain of oxygen from the atmosphere while negative values indicated a net loss of oxygen outgassing to the atmosphere oxygen budget indicated that primary production was more sensitive to riverine nutrient concentration than to the river discharge this is because the nutrients that these scenarios bring to the control volume is different due to the differences in nutrient concentration figure s2 in the supplementary despite the equivalent effect in changing the gross amount of nutrient load to the entire shelf scenario 30 rn 30 rn is more concentrated diluted in terms of nutrient concentration and probably brings more less nutrients to the control volume compared to scenarios with unchanged nutrient concentration oxygen budgets for the upper layer and lower layer are separately shown in fig 11b and c note that the lower layer and upper layer are separated by the vertical stratification maxima diffusion term which was trivial in fig 11a because the lower layer and upper layer diffusion balance each other during all depth integration was shown in details for both layers bottom dissolved oxygen concentration and hypoxia formation are determined by lower layer oxygen budget fig 11c in which diffusion term is the major oxygen source and f s o d and w c r are the major oxygen sinks diffusion term offsets 71 2 80 9 69 3 71 3 and 71 1 of total oxygen consumption n i t r i f f s o d w c r in the lower layer in scenarios baseline 30 fw 30 fw 30 rn and 30 rn respectively vertical stratification strongly regulated by the freshwater amount that introduced by changjiang impacts vertical oxygen supply to lower layer via diffusion thus the contribution of diffusion term to offsetting total oxygen consumption remains unchanged in scenarios 30 rn compared to baseline on the other hand the strengthened vertical stratification in scenario 30 fw reduced diffusion induced oxygen replenishment under which circumstance bottom hypoxia is prone to form the effect of vertical stratification regulating downward oxygen supply via diffusion is a major contributor to differences between scenarios 30 fw and 30 rn and 30 fw and 30 rn the comparison of diffusion terms in these scenarios isolates the effect of freshwater in hypoxia formation from biological effects the baseline shows 10 m thicker hypoxic layer thickness over the submarine canyon than that over the shallow bank fig 12b the hypoxic layer thickness is simply correlated with the bottom boundary layer thickness zhang et al 2020a the bottom boundary layer is a near bottom well mixed layer the dynamical processes in which are essential to many biogeochemical processes such as bottom hypoxia wiseman et al 1997 zhang et al 2015 the thickness of the bottom boundary layer is often defined as the distance from the bottom to the maximum height at which the vertical density difference is greater than a critical value the thicker hypoxic layer over the submarine canyon is due to thicker bottom boundary layer figure s3 in the supplementary which often requires higher oxygen demand to draw the near bottom layer hypoxic thus the areal expansion of bottom hypoxia over the submarine canyon is less severe under increased riverine inputs compared to that over the shallow bank fig 12b on the other hand higher volume of hypoxic water occupies the bottom of the submarine canyon across 5 scenarios fig 12c the hypoxic volume in scenarios 30 fw and 30 rn both dropped dramatically fig 12c by 86 4 and 55 3 over the shallow bank and by 59 6 and 40 1 over the submarine canyon respectively this is in agreement with scavia et al 2019 which discussed the impacts of hypoxic layer thickness on fish growth and found that the thickness of bottom hypoxic layer off the northern gulf of mexico is markedly sensitive to the reduction of nitrogen load thus the model in this study indicated that the reduction of riverine inputs can effectively control the hypoxic water volume over the shelf and confine hypoxic water within a much thinner layer near the bottom this can have positive implications to marine organisms for which the water column could be relatively optimal controlling the changjiang river input discharge as well as nutrient concentration could be considered as an efficient strategy for a mitigation of detrimental consequences 4 2 effects of shelf wind to hypoxia wind direction speed and duration time impacts on bottom hypoxia are rather complicated and have been amply investigated around coastal regions worldwide wilson et al 2008 scully 2010 mattern et al 2013 feng et al 2014 wilson et al 2015 yu et al 2015a ni et al 2016 scully 2016 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 on this shelf zhang et al 2019b illustrated that persistent northward wind drives through ekman transport freshwater offshore toward the shallow bank and facilitates strong vertical stratification generating favorable condition for hypoxia formation however sheer mixing can be strengthened when wind speed exceeds a certain range 8 m s xuan et al 2012 although the shelf wind direction remained unchanged model results in this study indicated that the increased shelf wind speed an average of 6 7 m s to 8 7 m s increased by 30 broke down vertical stratification thus bottom oxygen replenishment by vertical diffusion was enhanced dramatically compared to the baseline which resulted in dissipation of bottom hypoxic water fig 11c this mixing could be similar to a weather event wang et al 2017 feng et al 2012 examined summer west wind duration over 32 days and showed that long duration of west wind is negatively correlated with areal expansion of bottom hypoxia off the northern gulf of mexico since persistent west wind pushed freshwater far offshore and reduced freshwater effect on vertical stratification the discussion of wind impact on shelf oxygen dynamics should be based on the premise of time scales and local features such as ambient dynamics topography and geographical location combined with existing findings this study indicates that wind can cause long term persistent ekman transport toward certain directions feng et al 2012 zhang et al 2019b and short term strong mixing by extreme weather event such as hurricanes zhang et al 2018 topography or local morphology is also an important factor in the discussion of wind impact for instance the consequences caused by the identical persistent wind to regions like the chesapeake bay will be undoubtedly different due to its long and narrow topography feature compared to relatively open regions in east china sea 4 3 effects of large scale processes on coastal hypoxia our model shows that the hypoxic areas in scenario 30 kn fig 9d and e increased and the increase generally located at the submarine canyon and offshore regions because the oceanic nutrients was mostly consumed along the intrusion path before reaching the shallow bank figs 10b and d and s4 the near bottom water residence times in scenario 15 ks increased from 20 days in baseline to 22 days for the shallow bank fig 10e and from 65 days to 74 days for the submarine canyon fig 10f this slowed down the replacement of low oxygen water exacerbating oxygen depletion and increasing bottom hypoxic area thus the hypoxic areas increased despite a decrease in the primary production along the intrusion path fig 10a and c note that oxygen budget for the river discharge riverine nutrient concentration and wind scenarios is done for the shallow bank in fig 1 considering the differential responses of the two controlled volumes to the varying forcing scenarios oxygen budget for the kuroshio scenarios is done for the submarine canyon oxygen budget for the control volume over the submarine canyon figure s5 shows less oxygen source from advection in scenario 15 ks compared to the baseline which is consistent with the analysis of prolonged bottom residence time such that less water containing dissolved oxygen was advected from ambient in a given period of time the hypoxic volume over the submarine canyon remained unchanged 218 4 km 3 in scenario 15 ks compared to 219 5 km 3 in baseline despite increased hypoxic area due to a significant decrease in hypoxia vertical extent hypoxic layer thickness fig 12 the decline in hypoxic layer thickness could be attributed to an increase in the bottom oxygen replenishment due to vertical diffusion compared to the baseline figure s5 the increased vertical diffusion is most likely due to the decline of bottom surface density gradient that caused by reduced intrusion of low temperature high salinity kuroshio water the reduced low oxygen source water from the intrusion may also contribute to the decreased hypoxic layer thickness further investigation is needed to identify the mechanism evidence from both the pacific ocean and the atlantic ocean show that large scale circulations have been shifted under climate change zhang et al 2020b claret et al 2018 the shifts in ocean circulation impact nutrient and other material delivery moore et al 2018 the kuroshio subsurface water intrusion a portion of the kuroshio current that intrudes onto the continental shelf is considered to have modifications in properties following the shifts of the kuroshio current such as the strength the introduced oceanic nutrient concentration our model results indicate that variations in the kuroshio subsurface water intrusion had non negligible influence on coastal ecosystems this is consistent with existing findings over the east china sea fabian et al 2020 which showed variations in the bottom hypoxic area due to changes in the open boundary conditions long term analysis for instance 30 50 years based on numerical modeling and historical observations is necessary for the clarification of mechanisms controlling hypoxia on the continental shelf across a variety of time scales bottom hypoxia offshore of the changjiang river estuary is stated to have expanded in the past two decades however conclusions regarding the controlling factors and their relative importance are still controversial historical observations that focus on oxygen dynamics and relevant research have been limited especially before year 2000 motivating the use of the high resolution ecosystem model used in this study for long term analysis more qualified comprehensive ecosystem models model systems are needed to minimize modeling uncertainties and identify the controlling mechanisms overall our results provided short term to seasonal information on oxygen dynamics as well as an analysis of the relative importance of different factors on hypoxia based on sensitivity scenarios results from this study can give information on long term analyses as well as future studies on how anthropogenic activities and climate change affect hypoxia 5 conclusions this study using a high resolution ecosystem model provided an analysis of the relative importance of multiple factors based on sensitivity scenarios and investigated how different factors affect the bottom hypoxia extent off the changjiang river estuary hypoxic volume indicates both the horizontal and the vertical extent of detrimental oxygen condition and acts as a better implication to marine ecosystems than hypoxic area was investigated for the shelf off the changjing river estuary in this study our model results indicate that the spatial horizontal and vertical extent of bottom hypoxia are extremely sensitive to the reduction of river discharge and riverine nutrient concentration a 30 decrease in the river discharge and riverine nutrient concentration reduced hypoxic water volume by 86 4 and 55 3 over the shallow bank and by 59 6 and 40 1 over the submarine canyon respectively the decrease in the river discharge reduced shelf vertical stratification besides reducing nutrient loads and caused significant mitigation in hypoxia expansion because diffusion that triggers vertical oxygen supply to subsurface layer was prone to occur under weaker vertical stratification strengthened shelf winds induced mixing and broke down vertical stratification which decreased the spatial extent of hypoxia and dissipated low oxygen water over the shelf the strength of the kuroshio subsurface water intrusion regulated near bottom water residence time while the introduced oceanic nutrient concentration changes oxygen consumption over the shelf they both caused variations in shelf hypoxia extent the model results indicated that the bottom oxygen minima generally decreased with the spatial horizontal and vertical expansion of bottom hypoxia stronger vertical stratification and increased bottom water residence time also led to earlier initiation of hypoxic condition credit

23915,the formation and maintenance of low oxygen offshore of the changjiang river estuary have occurred with high frequency in certain regions which are defined as bottom hypoxia hotspots the two major hotspots are the southern shallow bank yangtze bank and the submarine canyon for this study a high resolution ecosystem model was used to simulate dissolved oxygen dynamics over the continental shelf and to investigate the sensitivity of bottom hypoxia extent to multiple factors scenario simulations that varied the river discharge both freshwater amount and nutrient loads riverine nutrient concentration shelf wind speed and strength of the kuroshio subsurface water intrusion and intrusion introduced oceanic nutrient concentration were examined and the extent to which these processes regulated the bottom hypoxia extent was analyzed model results indicated that the spatial extent of bottom hypoxia is markedly sensitive to riverine inputs which have larger impacts on hypoxia over the shallow bank than over the submarine canyon the simulated bottom hypoxia is more responsive to changes in river discharge than riverine nutrient concentration because discharge has a dual control on the shelf vertical stratification as well as primary production the increased wind speed enhanced vertical mixing and thus reduced the spatial extent as well as the total volume of bottom hypoxic water weakened kuroshio intrusion resulted in prolonged near bottom water residence time which can cause increase in bottom hypoxia extent increasing kuroshio introduced nutrient concentration by 30 resulted in enhanced primary production which caused larger increase in hypoxia extent over the submarine canyon and offshore regions compared to the shallow bank keywords hypoxia changjiang river

function of coastal ecosystems chan et al 2008 diaz and rosenberg 2008 zhang et al 2010 cai et al 2011 carstensen et al 2014 levin and breitburg 2015 breitburg et al 2018 fennel and testa 2019 regions with large riverine inputs of freshwater and nutrients are especially vulnerable to hypoxia such as the north gulf of mexico rabalais et al 2007a b zhang et al 2015 the chesapeake bay bever et al 2018 moriarty et al 2020 the baltic sea conley et al 2011 carstensen et al 2014 and the east china sea li et al 2002 wei et al 2007 zhu et al 2011 freshwater enhances stratification while riverine nutrient inputs stimulate the production of organic matter and hypoxia occurs when oxygen consumption rate during the remineralization of the organic matter exceeds the physical supply of oxygen for sufficient time thus seasonal hypoxia is often detected in these regions of large riverine inputs in summer when vertical stratification is the strongest over a year in regions that are characterized by longer near bottom water residence time than oxygen consumption time fennel and testa 2019 such as the chesapeake bay and the baltic sea where the topography is closed or semi closed the bottom hypoxia is even severe because of extremely longer time of water replacement oxygen replenishment by advection a combination of vertical stratification eutrophication induced primary production and exchange rate with ambient water controls the formation and extent of bottom hypoxia off the changjiang river estuary zhu et al 2011 li et al 2014 wang et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 qian et al 2017 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b seasonal hypoxia offshore of the changjiang river estuary has occurred with high frequency in certain regions and zhang et al 2019b defined these regions as bottom hypoxia hotspots fig 1 a variety of processes confluence off the changjiang river estuary wei et al 2015 resulting in complicated dynamics and mixture of water masses zhou et al 2018 the changjiang river discharge and wind induced freshwater redistribution are the major controlling factors of vertical stratification zhang et al 2018 organic matter decomposition a major oxygen sink is closely linked with eutrophication stimulated primary production zhu et al 2011 wang et al 2016 besides riverine nutrients the kuroshio subsurface water intrusion brings low dissolved oxygen and phosphorus rich lower nitrogen phosphorus ratio commonly 16 than the riverine nutrients usually 100 kodama et al 2015 water to the shelf qian et al 2017 the kuroshio subsurface water intrusion also influences near bottom water residence time over the shelf by regulating current velocity zhang et al 2019b anthropogenic activities have important influence on bottom hypoxia extent off the changjiang river estuary mega constructions can change the extent of the river plume wu et al 2018 resulting in variations in nutrients and vertical stratification over 30 of china s population live within the drainage basin of the changjiang river li et al 2011 changjiang introduced nutrient loads increased sharply since 1980 s li et al 2011 2014 consistent with the development history of china the increased nutrient loads especially dissolved inorganic nitrogen were shown to have resulted in obvious increases in the frequency as well as area of harmful algal blooms li et al 2014 these can potentially contribute to the increase in bottom hypoxic area in the past two decades climate change also has potential influence on bottom hypoxia extent off the changjiang river estuary bopp et al 2013 reported variable potential changes for regional scales by year 2100 using the cmip5 climate models the coupled model intercomparison project 5 taylor et al 2012 scenario rcp8 5 no mitigation strategy identified east china sea as a climate change hotspot characterized by a warming rate of 3 5 c this warming may increase the shelf vulnerability to hypoxia due to declining oxygen solubility enhancing stratification and increasing oxygen consumption by microbial respiration irby et al 2018 laurent et al 2018 breitburg et al 2018 previous studies e g yin et al 2017 wu et al 2017 consistently demonstrated that strong kuroshio current yields weak subsurface water intrusion onto the shelf of east china sea and cyclonic anticyclonic eddies play important roles during the weakening of the intrusion thus impacts of climate change potentially have non negligible consequences to the spatial extent duration and severity of bottom hypoxia off the estuary intensive investigations have been performed to advance our understandings of the seasonal hypoxia off the changjiang river estuary however hypoxic volume and vertical extent of bottom hypoxic water which were proved to be more responsive in terms of representing hypoxic situation in both the chesapeake bay and the north gulf of mexico bever et al 2013 scavia et al 2019 have not been investigated yet for this region thicker hypoxic layer indicates less optimal vertical space for fishes and other marine organisms and this important implication to marine ecosystems has been overlooked so far previous studies have focused on the role of individual processes on oxygen dynamics zhang et al 2019b and the relative importance of these different processes on oxygen dynamics offshore of the changjiang river estuary has not been quantified isolating the relative importance of different processes remains a difficult task because they interact especially in complex systems like the east china sea how those processes impact hypoxia differently and how differently the two hypoxia hotspots fig 1 respond to those processes remain unanswered a high resolution ecosystem model was therefore used in this study to simulate dissolved oxygen dynamics and investigate the spatial horizontal and vertical extent of bottom hypoxia off the changjiang river estuary under a variety of scenarios the use of a numerical model will supplement available observations which are often insufficient for analyzing spatiotemporal variations in oxygen dynamics and the processes that control them the changjiang river shelf wind and the kuroshio subsurface water intrusion are examined a series of scenario simulations table 1 were performed with variations in the magnitude of the investigated factors see section 2 for model description and scenario design 2 method 2 1 model description this study used the regional ocean modeling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 hydrodynamic model and coupled with a biological model the hydrodynamic model domain fig 1a encompasses the entire bohai sea yellow sea east china sea and part of the japan sea and deep region offshore this roms based model has 30 vertical layers with a minimum water depth of 3 m and a maximum depth of slightly greater than 7000 m the horizontal resolution ranges from 500 m in the upper estuary to 1 km in the plume near field region and to 2 km in the offshore region the model run was initiated from rest and was forced with surface momentum and heat fluxes from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf https www ecmwf int en forecasts

respectively the initial and open boundary conditions for nutrients were extracted from the climatological monthly woa the riverine nutrient concentration was taken from gao et al 2012 this ecosystem model was previously implemented for this shelf and was found to well reproduce the observed temperature salinity and bottom dissolved oxygen concentration zhang et al 2018 this model also decently reproduced the satellite derived surface chlorophyll concentration figure s1 in the supplementary material the readers are referred to zhang et al 2018 for the calculation of different oxygen budget terms and the list of biological parameters this model was initiated in january 2009 and 3 hourly model output for 2011 was analyzed to ensure sufficient spin up the year 2011 was picked for analysis because bottom hypoxia formed over both the shallow bank and submarine canyon regions in different summer months this was an optimal prototype for the investigation of bottom hypoxia hotspots to estimate residence time a passive tracer with concentration of 1 kg m 3 was released instantaneously into control volumes the two hypoxia hotspots over the shelf fig 1b water mass in the control volume was assumed to have been replaced when tracer concentrations reached values less than 5 of the initial tracer mass the integrated time that was needed for the tracer to escape the control volume is defined as the residence time of the water body 2 2 design of different scenarios the baseline in table 1 is the case with all realistic conditions mega constructions like the three gorges dam have strong ability to regulate river discharge and scenarios 30 fw riverine nutrient concentration remains unchanged are designed to examine how mega constructions can influence hypoxia evolution note that variations in river discharges cause changes in both freshwater amount and total riverine nutrient loads scenarios 30 rn are designed to investigate how the increasingly severe or mitigatory anthropogenic pollution impacts hypoxia note that the selection of 30 is a simple suggestion for mitigation typhoon hurricane tends to be more severe in the warming future with faster wind speed and higher frequency of occurrence bhatia et al 2018 thus motivated by the potential future situation scenario 30 wind is designed by increasing shelf wind speed wind direction remains unchanged for july 23rd 31st 2011 to examine the response of hypoxia to strong wind event sheer mixing can be strengthened when wind speed exceeds a certain range 8 m s xuan et al 2012 thus 30 is selected to increase shelf wind speed from an average of 6 7 m s to 8 7 m s climate change has shifted large scale ocean circulation zhang et al 2020b and intensified tropical cyclones have caused strengthening of the kuroshio current thus the portion that intrudes onto the continental shelf kuroshio subsurface water intrusion has the potential to change under climate change strengthened kuroshio current in the future indicates weakened intrusion onto the continental shelf of east china sea e g yin et al 2017 wu et al 2017 intensified eddy activities have the potential to cause resuspension of bottom nutrients and increase water column nutrient concentration scenarios 15 ks reducing current speed and 30 kn both dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dip are designed via modifying boundary conditions to deliver a conjecture that future potential variations in large scale circulation have non negligible influence on coastal regions the modification is done for the entire water column along the boundary 3 results results of the baseline model run indicated that bottom hypoxia formed in the summer of 2011 fig 2 and the geographical locations of bottom hypoxia were different between july over the shallow bank and august over the submarine canyon note that the hypoxic layer was generally thicker over the submarine canyon than that over the shallow bank fig 2e f the spread of the changjiang river plume offshore of the estuary brought both freshwater and nutrients to the shelf causing strong stratification which was primarily freshwater induced and chlorophyll concentration to be co located fig 3 the high chlorophyll concentration and strong vertical stratification both contributed to the formation of bottom hypoxia with the former producing organic carbon that facilitates oxygen consumption and the latter inhibits oxygen replenishment 3 1 river discharge both the bottom hypoxic area and the hypoxic layer thickness changed in scenarios 30 fw compared to baseline fig 4 in july the hypoxic area over the shallow bank expanded shrank by 86 8 61 2 and the hypoxic layer thickness increased decreased by 29 1 82 8 in scenario 30 fw 30 fw in august the hypoxic area over the submarine canyon expanded shrank by 39 1 17 8 and the hypoxic layer thickness increased decreased by 5 5 54 5 in scenario 30 fw 30 fw these results suggested that the horizontal and the vertical extent of bottom hypoxia over the shallow bank were more sensitive to river discharge than those over the submarine canyon and a decrease in river discharge results in dramatic reduction in vertical extent of bottom hypoxia over both regions model results suggested that the changes in river discharge regulated both physical and biological processes over the shelf fig 5 shelf stratification was strongly modulated by the river discharge such that shelf stratification degraded under decreased freshwater in scenario 30 fw fig 5a c because surface bottom salinity gradient was weakened and vice versa fig 5b d the depth integrated chlorophyll differences were very patchy because river discharge can regulate coastal currents which subsequently resulted in complex variations in nutrient distribution 3 2 riverine nutrient concentration scenarios 30 rn modified the concentration and therefore the load of river introduced nutrients and resulted in altered horizontal and vertical extent of bottom hypoxia fig 6b and c the hypoxic area over the shallow bank expanded shrank by 28 5 38 3 and the hypoxic layer thickness increased decreased by 23 6 53 in scenario 30 rn 30 rn the hypoxic area over the submarine canyon expanded shrank by 12 6 16 1 and the hypoxic layer thickness increased decreased by 11 9 30 in scenario 30 rn 30 rn results suggested that the spatial extent of bottom hypoxia over the shallow bank was more sensitive to riverine nutrient concentration than that over the submarine canyon and the vertical extent of bottom hypoxia over both regions is markedly reduced due to the decrease in riverine nutrient concentration the differences in bottom hypoxia extent were consistent with variations in chlorophyll concentrations fig 6d g the negative patches in fig 6d and f indicated that the depth integrated chlorophyll concentration decreased in scenario 30 rn compared to baseline and these patches were generally co located with the negative patches in fig 5e and g the positive patches in fig 6e and g indicated that the depth integrated chlorophyll concentration increased in scenario 30 rn relative to baseline and these positive patches were generally co located with those in fig 5f and h the differences in chlorophyll concentration caused changes in oxygen depletion during the remineralization of the organic matter and therefore bottom hypoxia extent among those scenarios 3 3 wind the baseline time series showed two patches of integrated hypoxic volume centers at 32 n the shallow bank and 31 n the submarine canyon respectively fig 7d indicating that the conditions were favorable for hypoxia formation switched from the shallow bank to the submarine canyon in time scenario 30 wind increased shelf wind speed between july 23rd 31st 2011 and the horizontal and the vertical extent of bottom hypoxia were reduced and the integrated hypoxic volume centers were dissipated fig 7 the extent of bottom hypoxia over the shallow bank decreased under the strengthened shelf wind furthermore bottom hypoxia seldom formed over the submarine canyon in august fig 7 shelf stratification in this scenario weakened significantly fig 8a and b compared to baseline the strengthened wind induced mixing which resulted in decreased surface bottom salinity gradient thus the strengthened wind broke down vertical stratification and replenished bottom oxygen fig 8c e once wind returned to realistic magnitudes on aug 1st the stratification differences difference between this scenario and the baseline began decreasing fig 8a and b because the mixing due to increased wind speed gradually vanished after shelf wind relaxed to realistic state surface salinity and shelf stratification both recovered around 10 days after shelf wind relaxed to realistic condition bottom oxygen condition also gradually became more similar to baseline although the changes occurred more slowly than surface salinity an obvious drop in bottom oxygen concentration for point 2 can be seen in august and bottom hypoxia emerged fig 8e 3 4 kuroshio subsurface water intrusion scenarios 15 ks and 30 kn altered the extent of bottom hypoxia over the shallow bank and the submarine canyon in different ways fig 9 the hypoxic area increased by 64 5 and 66 8 over the two regions respectively in scenario 15 ks the hypoxic layer thickness in this scenario shows a slight increase over the shallow bank and 35 5 decrease over the submarine canyon the hypoxic area increased by 49 1 and 78 7 over the two regions respectively in scenario 30 kn the hypoxic layer thickness increased by 35 3 and 20 1 respectively hypoxia also emerged in offshore regions in scenario 30 kn which contributed to the increase in total hypoxic area this offshore patch of bottom hypoxia can be resulted from advection of high chlorophyll concentration which consumed local oxygen and caused oxygen depletion zhou et al 2020 bottom hypoxic area over the submarine canyon and offshore regions was more sensitive to kuroshio derived oceanic nutrient concentration than that over the shallow bank fig 9 the kuroshio intrusion strength had similar effects on bottom hypoxic area over both regions although bottom hypoxic area increased in both scenarios the controlling mechanisms were different scenario 15 ks caused a decrease in oceanic nutrient supply thereby decreasing the chlorophyll concentration along the path of the intrusion compared to baseline fig 10a and c besides the decline of kuroshio subsurface water intrusion reduced supply of low oxygen water from the kuroshio however the near bottom water residence time increased fig 10e and f due to the weakened kuroshio intrusion which implied that the replacement of near bottom water masses took longer time and oxygen depletion was aggravated in scenario 30 kn chlorophyll concentration increased along the path of the intrusion due to increased load of oceanic nutrients by the kuroshio current fig 10b and d and hypoxic area consequently increased fig 9b 4 discussion oxygen dynamics offshore of the changjiang river estuary were studied using a high resolution coupled physical biogeochemical model which enabled us to investigate the roles of different physical and biogeochemical processes on oxygen dynamics and hypoxia our current biogeochemical model is a simplified nitrogen cycle model that was extended to include phosphorus dynamics laurent et al 2017 it had one phytoplankton component to represent all sizes of phytoplankton including both diatoms and flagellates previous studies reported that diatoms played an important role in hypoxia generation off the changjiang river estuary zhou et al 2020 although without explicitly representing the diatoms our current model is quite skillful in reproducing the observed hypoxia pattern zhang et al 2018 the same biogeochemical model scheme with a single phytoplankton function type has been successfully applied and shown satisfying performance in other hypoxic regions including the gulf of mexico and the chesapeake bay fennel et al 2013 feng et al 2015 future model development work could consider incorporating multiple phytoplankton species such as the diatoms however due to the complexity of ecosystem parameter space increasing the model complexity may overtune the model without improving the performance for target variables friedrichs et al 2007 xiao and friedrichs 2014 the impacts of different factors on seasonal hypoxia off the estuary have been investigated using numerical modeling method in previous studies for instance zhang et al 2019a and fabian et al 2020 with the former focusing on seasonal variability of bottom hypoxia and the latter focusing on the relative importance of riverine and oceanic nutrient loads in this study a series of sensitivity scenarios motivated by the anthropogenic activities and climate change were designed to investigate how differently the two hypoxia hotspots off the estuary respond to multiple controlling factors the analysis of the model results indicated that the sensitivities of bottom hypoxia to these factors were different instead of looking at just hypoxic area this study investigated the spatial horizontal as well as vertical extent of bottom hypoxia and hypoxic volume which serve better as ecological indicators of marine organism niche with depth this study brings the hypoxic volume off the changjiang river estuary forward and investigates its sensitivity to multiple processes the bottom oxygen minima can quantitatively represent the severity of bottom hypoxia and a decrease in bottom oxygen minima indicated worsened severity of hypoxic condition the model results suggested that worsened severity of bottom hypoxia often accompanied the spatial expansion of bottom hypoxia figs 4 6 7 9 additionally hypoxic condition in scenarios 30 fw and 15 ks initiated earlier due to earlier initiation of favorable vertical stratification and near bottom water residence time respectively on the other hand the timing of hypoxia occurrence in scenarios 30 rn had trivial variations 4 1 spatial extent of bottom hypoxia due to riverine inputs river discharge and anthropogenic activity induced nutrient loads have been proved to be important factors that impact coastal hypoxia the extent of seasonal bottom hypoxia off the texas louisiana shelf was shown based on numerical investigations to vary significantly with the magnitude of mississippi river discharge yu et al 2015a the increased riverine nutrient loads have significantly increased phytoplankton blooms and bottom hypoxia in the baltic sea carstensen et al 2014 and the east china sea li et al 2014 consistent with existing findings our model scenarios show that variations in the river discharge can have significant influence on the shelf hydrodynamics and riverine nutrient distribution which subsequently stimulate coastal ecosystem and result in variations in hypoxia extent horizontally and vertically for both the shallow bank and the submarine canyon regions figs 4 and 6 note that the depth integrated chlorophyll changes in scenarios 30 fw fig 5e h are rather patchy compared to that in scenarios 30 rn fig 6d g because variations in river discharge can regulate ambient hydrodynamics such as coastal currents which result in complex variations in nutrient distribution a 30 increase decrease in riverine nutrient concentration is equivalent to a 30 increase decrease in river discharge regarding gross amount of riverine nutrient load however the resultant hypoxia extent was different in scenarios 30 rn 30 rn and 30 fw 30 fw to further investigate oxygen dynamics across these scenarios oxygen budget for the control volume over the shallow bank fig 1b was done budget analysis for dissolved oxygen has been widely used in regions that are under the threat of seasonal hypoxia zhang et al 2019a scully 2013 li et al 2015 yu et al 2015b ni et al 2019 fig 11a shows oxygen budget that integrated over the entire water column and that primary production air sea flux sediment oxygen demand and water column respiration were the major terms that resulted in differences in oxygen change rate across scenarios air sea flux represents oxygen exchange at the air sea interface positive values indicated a net gain of oxygen from the atmosphere while negative values indicated a net loss of oxygen outgassing to the atmosphere oxygen budget indicated that primary production was more sensitive to riverine nutrient concentration than to the river discharge this is because the nutrients that these scenarios bring to the control volume is different due to the differences in nutrient concentration figure s2 in the supplementary despite the equivalent effect in changing the gross amount of nutrient load to the entire shelf scenario 30 rn 30 rn is more concentrated diluted in terms of nutrient concentration and probably brings more less nutrients to the control volume compared to scenarios with unchanged nutrient concentration oxygen budgets for the upper layer and lower layer are separately shown in fig 11b and c note that the lower layer and upper layer are separated by the vertical stratification maxima diffusion term which was trivial in fig 11a because the lower layer and upper layer diffusion balance each other during all depth integration was shown in details for both layers bottom dissolved oxygen concentration and hypoxia formation are determined by lower layer oxygen budget fig 11c in which diffusion term is the major oxygen source and f s o d and w c r are the major oxygen sinks diffusion term offsets 71 2 80 9 69 3 71 3 and 71 1 of total oxygen consumption n i t r i f f s o d w c r in the lower layer in scenarios baseline 30 fw 30 fw 30 rn and 30 rn respectively vertical stratification strongly regulated by the freshwater amount that introduced by changjiang impacts vertical oxygen supply to lower layer via diffusion thus the contribution of diffusion term to offsetting total oxygen consumption remains unchanged in scenarios 30 rn compared to baseline on the other hand the strengthened vertical stratification in scenario 30 fw reduced diffusion induced oxygen replenishment under which circumstance bottom hypoxia is prone to form the effect of vertical stratification regulating downward oxygen supply via diffusion is a major contributor to differences between scenarios 30 fw and 30 rn and 30 fw and 30 rn the comparison of diffusion terms in these scenarios isolates the effect of freshwater in hypoxia formation from biological effects the baseline shows 10 m thicker hypoxic layer thickness over the submarine canyon than that over the shallow bank fig 12b the hypoxic layer thickness is simply correlated with the bottom boundary layer thickness zhang et al 2020a the bottom boundary layer is a near bottom well mixed layer the dynamical processes in which are essential to many biogeochemical processes such as bottom hypoxia wiseman et al 1997 zhang et al 2015 the thickness of the bottom boundary layer is often defined as the distance from the bottom to the maximum height at which the vertical density difference is greater than a critical value the thicker hypoxic layer over the submarine canyon is due to thicker bottom boundary layer figure s3 in the supplementary which often requires higher oxygen demand to draw the near bottom layer hypoxic thus the areal expansion of bottom hypoxia over the submarine canyon is less severe under increased riverine inputs compared to that over the shallow bank fig 12b on the other hand higher volume of hypoxic water occupies the bottom of the submarine canyon across 5 scenarios fig 12c the hypoxic volume in scenarios 30 fw and 30 rn both dropped dramatically fig 12c by 86 4 and 55 3 over the shallow bank and by 59 6 and 40 1 over the submarine canyon respectively this is in agreement with scavia et al 2019 which discussed the impacts of hypoxic layer thickness on fish growth and found that the thickness of bottom hypoxic layer off the northern gulf of mexico is markedly sensitive to the reduction of nitrogen load thus the model in this study indicated that the reduction of riverine inputs can effectively control the hypoxic water volume over the shelf and confine hypoxic water within a much thinner layer near the bottom this can have positive implications to marine organisms for which the water column could be relatively optimal controlling the changjiang river input discharge as well as nutrient concentration could be considered as an efficient strategy for a mitigation of detrimental consequences 4 2 effects of shelf wind to hypoxia wind direction speed and duration time impacts on bottom hypoxia are rather complicated and have been amply investigated around coastal regions worldwide wilson et al 2008 scully 2010 mattern et al 2013 feng et al 2014 wilson et al 2015 yu et al 2015a ni et al 2016 scully 2016 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 on this shelf zhang et al 2019b illustrated that persistent northward wind drives through ekman transport freshwater offshore toward the shallow bank and facilitates strong vertical stratification generating favorable condition for hypoxia formation however sheer mixing can be strengthened when wind speed exceeds a certain range 8 m s xuan et al 2012 although the shelf wind direction remained unchanged model results in this study indicated that the increased shelf wind speed an average of 6 7 m s to 8 7 m s increased by 30 broke down vertical stratification thus bottom oxygen replenishment by vertical diffusion was enhanced dramatically compared to the baseline which resulted in dissipation of bottom hypoxic water fig 11c this mixing could be similar to a weather event wang et al 2017 feng et al 2012 examined summer west wind duration over 32 days and showed that long duration of west wind is negatively correlated with areal expansion of bottom hypoxia off the northern gulf of mexico since persistent west wind pushed freshwater far offshore and reduced freshwater effect on vertical stratification the discussion of wind impact on shelf oxygen dynamics should be based on the premise of time scales and local features such as ambient dynamics topography and geographical location combined with existing findings this study indicates that wind can cause long term persistent ekman transport toward certain directions feng et al 2012 zhang et al 2019b and short term strong mixing by extreme weather event such as hurricanes zhang et al 2018 topography or local morphology is also an important factor in the discussion of wind impact for instance the consequences caused by the identical persistent wind to regions like the chesapeake bay will be undoubtedly different due to its long and narrow topography feature compared to relatively open regions in east china sea 4 3 effects of large scale processes on coastal hypoxia our model shows that the hypoxic areas in scenario 30 kn fig 9d and e increased and the increase generally located at the submarine canyon and offshore regions because the oceanic nutrients was mostly consumed along the intrusion path before reaching the shallow bank figs 10b and d and s4 the near bottom water residence times in scenario 15 ks increased from 20 days in baseline to 22 days for the shallow bank fig 10e and from 65 days to 74 days for the submarine canyon fig 10f this slowed down the replacement of low oxygen water exacerbating oxygen depletion and increasing bottom hypoxic area thus the hypoxic areas increased despite a decrease in the primary production along the intrusion path fig 10a and c note that oxygen budget for the river discharge riverine nutrient concentration and wind scenarios is done for the shallow bank in fig 1 considering the differential responses of the two controlled volumes to the varying forcing scenarios oxygen budget for the kuroshio scenarios is done for the submarine canyon oxygen budget for the control volume over the submarine canyon figure s5 shows less oxygen source from advection in scenario 15 ks compared to the baseline which is consistent with the analysis of prolonged bottom residence time such that less water containing dissolved oxygen was advected from ambient in a given period of time the hypoxic volume over the submarine canyon remained unchanged 218 4 km 3 in scenario 15 ks compared to 219 5 km 3 in baseline despite increased hypoxic area due to a significant decrease in hypoxia vertical extent hypoxic layer thickness fig 12 the decline in hypoxic layer thickness could be attributed to an increase in the bottom oxygen replenishment due to vertical diffusion compared to the baseline figure s5 the increased vertical diffusion is most likely due to the decline of bottom surface density gradient that caused by reduced intrusion of low temperature high salinity kuroshio water the reduced low oxygen source water from the intrusion may also contribute to the decreased hypoxic layer thickness further investigation is needed to identify the mechanism evidence from both the pacific ocean and the atlantic ocean show that large scale circulations have been shifted under climate change zhang et al 2020b claret et al 2018 the shifts in ocean circulation impact nutrient and other material delivery moore et al 2018 the kuroshio subsurface water intrusion a portion of the kuroshio current that intrudes onto the continental shelf is considered to have modifications in properties following the shifts of the kuroshio current such as the strength the introduced oceanic nutrient concentration our model results indicate that variations in the kuroshio subsurface water intrusion had non negligible influence on coastal ecosystems this is consistent with existing findings over the east china sea fabian et al 2020 which showed variations in the bottom hypoxic area due to changes in the open boundary conditions long term analysis for instance 30 50 years based on numerical modeling and historical observations is necessary for the clarification of mechanisms controlling hypoxia on the continental shelf across a variety of time scales bottom hypoxia offshore of the changjiang river estuary is stated to have expanded in the past two decades however conclusions regarding the controlling factors and their relative importance are still controversial historical observations that focus on oxygen dynamics and relevant research have been limited especially before year 2000 motivating the use of the high resolution ecosystem model used in this study for long term analysis more qualified comprehensive ecosystem models model systems are needed to minimize modeling uncertainties and identify the controlling mechanisms overall our results provided short term to seasonal information on oxygen dynamics as well as an analysis of the relative importance of different factors on hypoxia based on sensitivity scenarios results from this study can give information on long term analyses as well as future studies on how anthropogenic activities and climate change affect hypoxia 5 conclusions this study using a high resolution ecosystem model provided an analysis of the relative importance of multiple factors based on sensitivity scenarios and investigated how different factors affect the bottom hypoxia extent off the changjiang river estuary hypoxic volume indicates both the horizontal and the vertical extent of detrimental oxygen condition and acts as a better implication to marine ecosystems than hypoxic area was investigated for the shelf off the changjing river estuary in this study our model results indicate that the spatial horizontal and vertical extent of bottom hypoxia are extremely sensitive to the reduction of river discharge and riverine nutrient concentration a 30 decrease in the river discharge and riverine nutrient concentration reduced hypoxic water volume by 86 4 and 55 3 over the shallow bank and by 59 6 and 40 1 over the submarine canyon respectively the decrease in the river discharge reduced shelf vertical stratification besides reducing nutrient loads and caused significant mitigation in hypoxia expansion because diffusion that triggers vertical oxygen supply to subsurface layer was prone to occur under weaker vertical stratification strengthened shelf winds induced mixing and broke down vertical stratification which decreased the spatial extent of hypoxia and dissipated low oxygen water over the shelf the strength of the kuroshio subsurface water intrusion regulated near bottom water residence time while the introduced oceanic nutrient concentration changes oxygen consumption over the shelf they both caused variations in shelf hypoxia extent the model results indicated that the bottom oxygen minima generally decreased with the spatial horizontal and vertical expansion of bottom hypoxia stronger vertical stratification and increased bottom water residence time also led to earlier initiation of hypoxic condition credit

23916,phytoplankton biomass indicated by chlorophyll a chl a concentration is fundamentally important for aquatic ecosystems however accurately simulating chl a is always challenging even when using state of the art numerical models we propose a data driven modeling framework that combines empirical orthogonal function eof analysis and machine learning technique to tackle this problem using chesapeake bay as an example through the dimension reduction using eof the three dimensional 3d problem can be decomposed into multiple one dimensional 1d problems the non linearity of these 1d problems will be modeled with machine learning using an artificial neural network model performance in terms of spatiotemporal chl a variations with both seasonal and interannual signals is evaluated the model performance is comparable or higher than 3d numerical models previously applied in chesapeake bay sensitivity tests reveal the necessity of forcing transformations to improve the model predictive skill instead of manually applying a transformation for each input forcing variable an auto selection procedure is adopted to choose an appropriate transformation from a variety of transformation options while it is unlikely the data approach can replace the traditional numerical models we argue that data driven approaches provide a promising way for future studies in coastal and estuarine systems considering the fast accumulation of observational data keywords eof neural network water quality chlorophyll a simulation estuaries 1 introduction water quality in aquatic environments such as estuaries and coastal seas is of great public concern despite many efforts it is still difficult to accurately predict water quality variables e g dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a chl a concentration because their spatiotemporal variations are not only subject to physical transport and mixing processes but also significantly regulated by complex biogeochemical activities inside the water column and at the water sediment interface beck 1987 arhonditsis and brett 2004 fennel et al 2006 nonlinearities of biochemical processes are usually not easy to adequately describe using simple deterministic equations with a limited number of state variables as a result simulation and prediction of water quality variables have long been challenging even with the help of the most sophisticated numerical model systems extensive efforts have been made to identify the major controlling factors by examining the linear and nonlinear relationships between kinematic processes through analysis of in situ measurements or laboratory experiments e g kemp et al 1997 dauer et al 2000 such relationships are then parameterized into numerical model systems e g hem3d park et al 1995 fvcom chen et al 2003 roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 and schism zhang et al 2016 these models have been successfully applied for water quality simulations in estuaries and coastal oceans e g fennel et al 2006 cerco and noel 2013 testa et al 2014 yang et al 2015 however the accuracy of numerical model simulations greatly depends on the parameterization of the included kinetic processes where large uncertainties always exist van straten 1983 shen 2006 jiang et al 2018 additionally the accuracy of water quality model simulations also suffers from the cascading or propagation of error originated in the hydrodynamic simulation beck 1987 errors generated during the hydrodynamic simulation will be passed to the water quality simulation introducing additional uncertainties to the model accuracy in simulating water quality state variables because fundamental processes such as nutrient transport algal growth and oxygen distribution greatly depend on residence time transport rate and vertical mixing processes nixon et al 1996 lucas et al 2009 scully 2010 to reduce the error data assimilation has been widely used in forecast or reanalysis modelling ghil and malanotte rizzoli 1991 to manage the uncertainties associated with model structure kinetic parameters and error propagation an alternative approach is to reduce error accumulation during the modeling process by relying as much as possible on a systematic observational dataset with reasonable temporal and spatial resolutions methods that rely purely on observational data are also referred to as data driven approaches todorovski and džeroski 2006 shen et al 2008 yin et al 2014 yu et al 2020 data driven approaches are not new and have been extensively used in industry e g data mining and artificial intelligence as well as in marine sciences e g anderson et al 2010 blauw et al 2010 mcgillicuddy 2010 wang and tang 2010 kong et al 2017 one data driven approach is linear regression perhaps the most widely used method in almost every research field however estuarine processes are complex and usually cannot be simply explained using linear regression analysis to resolve nonlinear relationships researchers often apply some transformations to independent variables e g log and exponential transformation and derive a variety of empirical formulas cohn et al 1992 scardi and harding 1999 attrill 2002 brush et al 2002 nevertheless the improvement is limited for specific variables such as chl a which is known to be a function of various factors including nutrients temperature solar radiation water clarity and flushing rate mccarthy et al 1977 harding et al 1986 cloern 1999 kemp et al 2005 it is still challenging to simulate its spatiotemporal variations using a traditional empirical approach in such cases alternative methods are of great interest availability of rapidly accumulated monitoring data including high frequency in situ measurements remote sensing and reanalysis numerical modeling with data assimilation have paved the road for data driven models recently advanced data analysis methods have been developed quickly along with the increasing demand for big data analysis combining these datasets and advanced methods may provide a new approach for predicting and understanding the variation of water quality conditions with advances in monitoring techniques and the increasing availability of observational data data driven approaches are likely to have great future potential one example of advanced methods is the neural network which is a major component of our proposed data driven approach neural networks are a widely used tool for empirical modeling in a complex system especially useful when addressing nonlinear processes even if the underlying mechanisms are unknown or not fully understood scardi 1996 neural network models have been applied in the fields of classification pattern recognition and signal processing specifically they have been used for remote sensing e g keiner and yan 1998 vilas et al 2011 water level prediction chang and chen 2003 bajo and umgiesser 2010 chen et al 2012 rainfall runoff processes hsu et al 1995 campolo et al 1999 marsh classification morris et al 2005 and algal bloom prediction recknagel 2001 muttil and chau 2006 neural network models were applied in chesapeake bay as early as 1996 by scardi 1996 to train an empirical model for primary phytoplankton production following a similar approach scardi and harding 1999 used in situ measurement of chl a depth light and salinity conditions to predict the primary production rate in chesapeake bay muller and muller 2015 used a wavelet based neural network model to predict hypoxia volume in chesapeake bay based on the oceanic niño index and river flow most previous estuarine studies using data driven models targeted a single time series regarding a bulk value or at a given location e g liang et al 2015 park et al 2015 kong et al 2017 which is a one dimensional 1d simulation higher dimensional modeling however is rarely reported in estuarine and coastal research theoretically a higher dimensional problem can be decomposed into a limited number of lower dimensional problems particularly for aquatic systems where materials are continuously exchanged vertically and horizontally constrained by estuarine circulations and regulated by the dilution process water quality variables e g salinity nutrient concentration and dissolved oxygen in an estuarine system typically share high covariance among different regions du et al 2018 for a simple instance salinity increases at the entrance of an estuary usually coinciding with an increase of salinity at the head of the estuary it is therefore theoretically possible to decouple spatial patterns from temporal variations through a dimension reduction analysis such as empirical orthogonal functions eof and to transform the three dimensional 3d problem into 1d or two dimensional 2d problems the purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of a data driven modeling approach by applying it to simulate the spatial and temporal variations of chl a in chesapeake bay the largest estuary in the us the chl a is one of the most fundamental state variables in determining the productivity and water quality in estuarine systems and is also one of the most challenging subjects in water quality modeling its spatial and temporal variations directly affect almost every aspect of biochemical processes for any given estuarine system as one of the well studied estuarine systems chesapeake bay has been continuously monitored over several decades with monitoring stations covering a relatively large portion of the bay since 1985 monthly or bi monthly surveys of major water quality parameters including salinity temperature total nitrogen dissolved oxygen and chl a have been carried out by the chesapeake bay program cbp https www chesapeakebay net additional monitoring data including river flow nutrient load and air temperature are also made publicly available by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and the united states geological survey usgs these long term and comprehensive datasets make chesapeake bay a perfect study site to evaluate a data driven model the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the collection of observational data introduces the proposed data driven model with focuses on its three major components section 3 presents the spatial and temporal pattern of observed chl a in chesapeake bay and shows the training and evaluation of the data driven model the necessity of including wind and forcing transformation as well as the limitations and robustness of the data driven model is discussed in section 4 followed by concluding remarks in section 5 2 methods 2 1 data collection chesapeake bay is a large partially stratified estuary that extends about 320 km from the mouth of the susquehanna river to its entrance facing the atlantic ocean its water quality has been well monitored by the cbp thirty five years 1985 2019 of the historical record of the target water quality variable specifically chl a at the 16 mainstem stations was extracted from the cbp database data available at https www chesapeakebay net what downloads cbp water quality database 1984 present the locations of the stations are shown in fig 1 despite the spatial and temporal limitations on the sampling resolution the available long term monitoring dataset provided a reliable basis for analysis in many previous studies e g hagy et al 2004 kemp et al 2005 prasad et al 2010 murphy et al 2011 as an essential part of the data driven model external forcing data were carefully collected only relevant forcings were used including nutrient loading river flow air temperature and wind speed and direction table 1 river flow and wind are believed to regulate the stratification estuarine circulation and water exchange between ocean and estuary scully 2010 while nutrient loading and air temperature are generally regarded as dominant factors controlling algal growth nevertheless the combined influence from these forcings on the chl a concentration can be complex harding 1994 these forcing inputs are nearly the same as required by a 3d numerical model e g cerco and noel 2013 forcing data were collected from a variety of reliable sources river flow and nutrient loadings of the largest tributaries susquehanna potomac james and choptank rivers were extracted from usgs https www usgs gov air temperature at chesapeake bay bridge tunnel station 8638901 was extracted from noaa https tidesandcurrents noaa gov with data gaps being replaced with measurements at a nearby noaa station cape henry 8638999 for the atmospheric data instead of depending on measurements at a limited number of gauging stations we used era5 reanalysis product provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf https www ecmwf int which cover the entire chesapeake bay with a spatial resolution of 0 25 and hourly temporal resolution 2 2 framework of the data model to model not only the temporal but also the spatial variations the chl a profile data with irregular vertical resolution was first converted into a gridded 3d data set as a function of x z t where x is the horizontal location along the major axis of the bay z is the depth and t is time considering the high covariance among mainstem stations i e water quality at one station usually changes in pace with nearby stations an eof analysis was conducted to decompose the spatial and temporal variations and thereby convert the 3d variable into several 2d maps and 1d time series fig 2 the 1d time series could then be modeled with readily available statistical and machine learning tools when provided proper input forcing variables the historical record of the target variable i e chl a concentration was first divided into two independent sub datasets namely training and testing datasets with the former being used during the training process and the latter being used to evaluate the model performance when training the model it is important to keep the assumption that neither forcings nor the target variable in the testing period is known therefore the training dataset instead of the full record was used for the eof analysis even though it is possible to train all eof modes it is essential to determine how many principal components are nontrivial and should be modeled to distinguish interpretable signals from random noise several methods have been frequently used including the kaiser guttman criterion scree plot broken stick model and total variance method jackson 1993 here we used the broken stick model proposed by frontier 1976 which suggests that components are interpretable when their eigenvalues exceed the corresponding value from a broken stick distribution the eigenvalue for the k th component under the broken stick model can be calculated as follows jackson 1993 1 b k i k n 1 i where n is the total number of eof components e g 320 in this study only components with an eigenvalue larger than b k will be selected for each selected eof mode the relationship between external forcings and temporal variations of each mode will be established with a neural network model the following sections describe in detail the three major components of the proposed data driven approach i e eof analysis artificial neural network and forcing transformation selection 2 3 eof analysis eof analysis is often used to study the principal components of a variable and how they change with time an eof uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components jolliffe 2002 depending on the covariance between time series at different locations the percentage of total variance accounted for by each mode varies before performing eof analysis the observation profile data of chl a were averaged monthly and interpolated into 20 evenly distributed vertical layers at each station and the long term mean value for each grid point was subtracted in total there were 320 sampling locations 16 stations 20 layers and 420 records over the period of 1985 2019 as a result a data matrix f 420 320 was obtained with each row representing a map for a given month and each column representing the time series of the variable for a given sampling location additionally at each sampling location the time series was normalized with its standard deviation the eof analysis in this study is based on the singular value decomposition algorithm which decomposes the normalized data matrix f into the following form 2 f svd t where s is an orthogonal matrix 420 420 of temporal vectors d is an orthogonal matrix 320 320 of spatial vectors and v is a diagonal matrix 420 320 storing the eigenvalues the advantage of the eof analysis is converting a 3d problem into multiple 1d problems instead of explaining the time series at all sampling locations we only need to focus on a limited number of primary modes the number of primary modes p to be modeled is determined using the broken stick method eq 1 modes other than the first p modes are considered as noise the noise free chl a concentration c can then be calculated as follows 3 c x t c o x i 1 p m i x t i t where c o is the long term mean m is the map calculated as v d t and is a function of the spatial location x and t is the temporal value for a given mode as a function of time t both m and t are extracted from the eof analysis for prediction in the testing period the predicted value of chl a c can be obtained similarly with the maps kept unchanged but temporal components being replaced with predicted values t 4 c x t c o x i 1 p m i x t i t it can be very challenging to model the primary modes with simple linear regressions as successes of regressions greatly depend on the linearity between forcing and responding variables considering many processes in nature are nonlinear and generally respond to a combination of multiple forcings an artificial neural network was applied to model the temporal variations of the selected primary modes 2 4 artificial neural networks artificial neural networks are computational models inspired by the functioning of the human brain scardi 1996 paliwal and kumar 2009 they are composed of numbers of neurons the basic computational unit that takes inputs x from other neurons or external sources calculates the corresponding weight w for each input sums the product of weights and input values σ wx plus bias b and finally passes this value b σ wx to an activation function the outcome of the activation function is used as input for the next layer of neurons here the levenberg marquardt backpropagation training function marquardt 1963 was used which approaches second order training speed without computing the hessian matrix directly and appears to be the fastest method for training moderate sized feedforward neural networks hagan and menhaj 1999 the matlab neural network toolbox version 10 0 was used for this study the training process will stop when any of the following conditions occurs 1 number of epochs reach the defined maximum epochs set to be 100 2 cost function mean square error is minimized to the 0 and 3 performance gradient falls below 1e 7 for details of the algorithm of the levenberg marquardt method readers are referred to the help document in matlab the algorithm is widely recognized and well implemented in the matlab toolbox it is worth noting that there are several uncertainty sources associated with the neural network and these uncertainties need to be considered when using the trained models for prediction first the neural network toolbox is set to randomly divide the input data i e forcing data and target variable data for the training period into train validate and test parts these three parts are set to account for 70 15 and 15 of the input data respectively second the weights and bias are commonly randomly initialized because of the randomness in data division and initialization of the weights and bias the model prediction in both training and testing periods varies slightly from each training to account for these uncertainties we trained the neural network model 100 times for each principal component used the ensemble mean of these models as the final prediction and used the standard deviation of these models predictions to quantify the uncertainties to improve model performance multiple hidden layers of neurons are usually used after testing the model by including different numbers of hidden layers little change in model performance was found when more than two hidden layers were used therefore two hidden layers were used in the model to obtain a balance of accuracy and computational efficiency the number of hidden neurons in each layer was automatically adjusted based on the number of input variables the total numbers of neurons in the first and second layers were set as n and rounding of n 2 respectively where n is the number of input variables 2 5 forcing transformation selections one of the difficulties is selecting relevant forcings as input variables for the neural networks because each eof mode usually relates to different underlying physical and biological processes or represents different regions the response of each eof mode to each input forcing varies for example a mode representing the upper estuary chl a variations will respond to flow and nutrient loading much faster than the mode that represents the lower estuary a time delay of response needs to be considered due to the transport processes of water and nutrients additionally forcings sometimes affect estuarine dynamics through an accumulative process for instance the growth of plankton in the bay is commonly believed to be linked to the loading over several prior months instead of a particular month scavia et al 2006 to account for this effect an accumulative moving average needs to be applied for the forcings in practice we applied different lengths of accumulative average including 30 60 90 120 and 150 days which are corresponding to different transport timescales for water moving from upstream to different regions of the bay shen and wang 2007 considering the unknown relationship between forcings and eof modes it is impractical to choose the transformations manually for each selected eof mode to this end a process called transformation auto selection is included in the method in which forcings are transformed by multiple methods e g accumulative average time delay and log transform see tables 2 and 3 and an appropriate transformation is selected automatically the procedure includes 1 transforming each input forcing variable with one of the functions listed in table 2 2 performing different moving averages for each transformed variable table 3 and 3 conducting different time shifts for each transformed and moving averaged variable table 3 there are more than 200 combinations for each forcing but only one type of transformation that improved and maximized model performance is selected the target variable is set as y n 1 and the input forcing matrix x is empty at the beginning first the coefficients of determination r2 between y and all available forcing variables in all available transformations are computed the forcing variable with a transformation that gives the maximum r2 is selected as the first input variable and stored in x 1 the second forcing variable added to x is selected from the remaining forcings based on the r2 from multiple linear regressions the new forcing variable that most increased the r2 is added this process continues until r2 does not increase by at least 0 005 this threshold is used to exclude forcings that made little contribution even though using linear regression analysis to determine the transformation is not the perfect option such auto selection gives an overall reasonable model performance shown later the selected forcing and transformation for each of the nine modes can be found in supplemental materials table s1 s9 more discussion on the necessity of transformation is presented in section 4 3 for each mode the input parameters are selected independently there is no limit of the input forcings but considering the availability of the data length and its relevance with the chl a we only chose those that are well known as influencing forcings according to previous numerical modeling studies e g cerco and noel 2013 testa et al 2014 several protocols need to be followed when choosing external forcings first no in situ measurements along the mainstem of the bay were used it is not rational to model chl a if one can measure the in situ values of other environmental parameters such as salinity water temperature and total nitrogen instead forcings that are regarded as external e g wind river discharge and air temperature were chosen table 1 second it is essential to ensure that the length of external forcings is equal or greater than the length of the target variable third specific pre processing may be needed for some input forcings for example wind hour was calculated to quantify the accumulative impact of wind blowing from a 45 window of a given direction e g easterly westerly northerly and southerly regardless of the wind speed to account for wind speed wind strength from each direction unit h m s was also computed as the product of wind hour and wind speed in addition we also calculated the wind hour when wind speed exceeded 2 or 4 m s considering that wind will be especially effective when its speed exceeds a certain value fourth to be consistent with the temporal resolution of the target variable all the forcing data were monthly averaged for flow and nutrient loadings not every river was used instead representative discharges and loadings from upstream discharge susquehanna river large tributaries e g potomac and james rivers and small tributaries choptank river were chosen 2 6 model performance index calculation in addition to the common statistical measures including root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient r model skill was also calculated following willmott 1981 5 s k i l l 1 x mod x o b s 2 x mod x o b s x o b s x o b s 2 where x o b s and x m o d are the observed and modeled variables respectively with the overbar indicating the time average the skill provides an index of model data agreement with a skill of 1 indicating perfect agreement and 0 indicating complete disagreement the skill has been widely used to evaluate the performance of numerical models e g warner et al 2005 du et al 2019 while r indicates the model s capability of capturing the seasonal or interannual trends and rmse indicates the overall bias between model and observation skill can be regarded as a synthesis index to evaluate both the trend capturing and relative bias furthermore the correlation coefficient and skill were also calculated for the anomaly to discount the influence of seasonality on the overall model performance to obtain the anomalies the seasonal cycle signal at each station and each layer based on the training dataset was subtracted for both the observed and predicted values in the testing period 2 7 sensitivity test wind plays an important role in water quality through modulating stratification vertical mixing longitudinal and lateral circulation and water renewal in an estuary scully 2010 du and shen 2015 it is unknown whether wind will affect the intensity and extent of algal bloom a sensitivity test with respect to the inclusion of wind force was conducted to answer this question by examining the difference between model performance with and without wind force additional test to illustrate the necessity of transformations was carried out by forcing the model with input variables that were not transformed even though input forcings are transformed by the activation function within the neural network some important effects associated with estuarine dynamics such as time lagging and accumulative effect are not well included inside the neural network results from the sensitivity tests were compared to the base run i e with wind and transformations and their performance differences will be illustrated by taylor diagram taylor 2001 3 results 3 1 long term mean and eof modes for chl a it is worthwhile to describe the long term mean because it provides the background condition upon which the distribution of chl a concentration varies spatially the long term mean chl a concentration ranged within 5 15 μ g l with a higher value in the upper bay and near the surface layers fig 3 the spatial pattern shares great similarities with the distribution of nitrogen concentration du and shen 2017 demonstrating the potential influence of nutrient concentration nitrogen limitation is evident in chesapeake bay particularly during the summer and the impact of nitrogen limitation increases from the upper bay to the lower bay fisher et al 1992 1988 the vertical gradient i e larger value at the surface and smaller value at the bottom suggests a light limitation for algal growth at all locations the maximum value occurred at 39 n or cb3 3c while the minimum value was observed at the bay mouth and the northernmost end of the bay the maximum value occurred just below the downstream limit of the estuarine turbidity maximum zone which is typically located above 39 13n malpezzi et al 2013 the location of the maximum chl a concentration suggests that the algal growth was likely regulated by both nutrients and light conditions at 39n where nutrient levels were high and light conditions were sufficient the accumulation of phytoplankton biomass was greatly favored keller et al 2014 roman et al 2005 through a high resolution sampling over 1995 2002 also found a persistent maximum in phytoplankton biomass occurring in the upper bay and attributed it to the physical and topographic discontinuities in this region 3 2 spatial and seasonal pattern of primary modes more interesting is the spatial pattern and temporal variations of the primary eof modes the first four primary modes account for 45 17 8 and 6 of the total variance respectively due to the orthogonal nature spatial patterns hereafter referred to as maps and time series differed from one another fig 4 the first and second modes feature the spring algal bloom but for different regions the third and fourth modes seem to highlight the summer bloom it is not the primary purpose of this study to distinguish the possible processes contributing to each mode however through an eof analysis one could identify the likely dominant processes accounting for the spatial and temporal variations which will be further discussed in section 4 1 3 3 determine the number of modes to explain using the broken stick method the number of interpretable components for the chl a in chesapeake bay was determined to be nine based on the fact that the first nine eof modes have eigenvalues greater than that under the broken stick distribution fig 5 the residual values after subtracting the summation of the first nine modes and long term mean from the original values are considered as noise and they are not correlated among different locations the first nine eof modes account for 88 of the total variance note that the number of primary components to be modeled is determined based on the training dataset and it is assumed this number also applied to the testing period 3 4 model training the long term dataset was separated into two parts a training dataset the first 80 of the dataset i e 1985 2013 and a testing dataset the last 20 of the dataset i e 2014 2019 the training dataset was used to train the model while the testing dataset was used to evaluate the prediction skill of the trained model using the neural network each of the primary modes was well trained by various input forcings with model skill exceeding 0 52 for all the modes fig 6 we acknowledge that the model is not perfect for every mode as there are still variations not explained by the input forcings for several following reasons first some nutrient sources were not included in the input forcings such as the atmospheric deposition point sources along the shoreline and coastal ocean input these sources could contribute to 30 40 of the total nitrogen load boynton et al 1995 however there are limited available data regarding these nutrient sources and therefore they were not included in the model application another reason is the temporal limitation of the observation the monthly or bi monthly measurement might not be able to represent the monthly mean condition particularly for regions with large temporal variabilities bever et al 2013 3 5 model performance in testing period the model predicts well the variability in different regions i e larger variability in the upper bay and smaller variability in the lower bay fig 7 for the subsurface chl a the rmse range is 7 12 μ g l with a larger rmse in the upper bay correlation coefficient 0 8 and model skill 0 8 are both high in the middle and upper bay stations with exception of the upper most station cb2 2 the model skill at the lower bay stations is relatively lower 0 14 0 72 partly because the chl a in the lower bay is also controlled by coastal ocean conditions which were not included in the model due to lack of observations recent studies e g du and shen 2017 da et al 2018 suggest the nutrient conditions in the open ocean can be influential especially for the lower bay as large bottom inflow can efficiently move the oceanic water into the bay as nutrient concentration in the lower bay is relatively small changes in nutrient level in the coastal ocean can thus have more impact in this region than the middle upper bay where riverine nutrients dominate the lower performance in the lower bay can be also attributed to the decreasing variability of chl a when moving from the upper bay to the lower bay for example at the bay mouth station cb7 3 the concentration of chl a was typically below 10 μ g l which was about one order less than the value in the middle and upper bay the seasonal patterns of the chl a are also well predicted and the pattern varies greatly among different seasons in terms of the magnitude and vertical gradient the chl a was much greater during winter and spring compared to summer and fall fig 8 interestingly the vertical gradient followed an upward direction i e decrease upward during winter weaker in spring and downward in summer and fall the upward gradient in winter and spring is unique in chesapeake bay particularly during winter whereas the vertical gradient during spring is weak except in the upper bay 39 n the exact underlying mechanism for such vertical distribution during winter is not well known it could be caused by the combination of several processes including settling of algae landward bottom inflow and or lateral circulations not only does the model predict well the seasonal cycle of the chl a it also reasonably predicts the interannual variability fig 9 of the five years 2014 2018 in the testing period the observed spring chl a was characterized with a maximum value in the bottom of the upper bay for three years 2014 2016 suggesting effective bottom trapping near the turbidity maximum zone the chl a in the spring of 2016 2017 was much smaller and showed no marked bloom likely caused by a lower nutrient level or a more dispersive hydrodynamic condition there were significant interannual variabilities and the model is able to capture this interannual signal overall the model predictions are satisfactory for both spatial and temporal variations of chl a in chesapeake bay the performance is comparable or better than the sophisticated 3d numerical models that have been applied for chesapeake bay e g cerco and meyers 2000 li et al 2009 cerco and noel 2013 testa et al 2014 yang et al 2015 using a physical biogeochemical coupling model testa et al 2014 simulated the chl a with a mean correlation coefficient of 0 6 between model and observation in another numerical modeling study feng et al 2015 the correlation coefficient for chl a had a mean value of 0 3 when averaged over the mainstem monitoring stations irby et al 2016 compared the performance of eight numerical models all applied for chesapeake bay in simulating salinity temperature dissolved oxygen and chl a they showed that all the numerical models had a low skill in predicting chl a compared to other water quality variables for the bottom chl a the correlation coefficient from different models ranged within 0 1 0 6 in comparison our data driven model had a correlation coefficient of about 0 75 when averaged over all 16 stations fig 10 furthermore it seems all the numerical models greatly underestimate the variability of the bottom chl a with the standard deviation about less than half of the true value testa et al 2014 feng et al 2015 irby et al 2016 even though most of these numerical models were designed for simulating the dissolved oxygen there is no doubt that chl a simulation is extremely challenging even using the most advanced numerical model systems 4 discussion 4 1 possible mechanisms revealed by eof analysis it is of interest to understand the dominant processes that regulate the temporal and spatial distribution of a given water quality variable and eof analysis can serve as a useful tool for such a purpose this strategy has been extensively used in many studies for example scully 2016 performed an eof analysis for the dissolved oxygen in chesapeake bay and attributed the second mode to the bathymetry discontinuity induced convergence du et al 2018 used eof to identify the key external parameters including water temperature and chl a concentration for the first primary mode of dissolved oxygen in chesapeake bay our analysis shows that the first and second modes together contributed to 64 of the total variance of chl a the temporal values of both first and second eof modes show clear seasonality with peaks in april and march respectively fig 4b d the first mode is characterized with positive spatial value throughout the entire bay meaning changes in chl a in this mode are in phase over the entire bay differently the second mode highlights a strong variability in the subsurface water of the upper bay it is conceivable that the first and second modes account for the major seasonal bloom particularly the spring bloom the second mode leads the first one by about one month suggesting that the spring bloom occurrs first in the upper bay with maximum bloom in march and then the algal bloom extends to the entire bay reaching its maximum in april although the spring bloom has been commonly recognized in previous studies e g harding 1994 keller et al 2014 it is interesting to find the different timing of algal bloom in different regions it is worth pointing out the noticeable vertical difference in the spatial pattern of the first two eof modes both of which are characterized with a higher value at the bottom and a smaller value at the surface indicating a larger variability or more sensitive response at the bottom than at the surface particularly in the second mode chl a concentration varies greatly at the bottom of the upper bay compared to any other region such a spatial pattern is partially attributable to the sensitivity of sediment resuspension and accumulation at the water sediment interface near the turbidity maximum zone keller et al 2014 suggested that an efficient entrapment of phytoplankton and phytoplankton derived organic matter occurs near the turbidity maximum zone contrary to our common understanding that algae generally concentrate in the upper column due to light attenuation it is the subsurface layer that has a larger variability and this applies to the entire bay even after including the long term mean value the subsurface concentrations of chl a are generally larger than the surface concentration fig 9 4 2 necessity to include wind the sensitivity test without including the wind forcings shows that the model s performance is weakened without wind forcings the overall performance is reduced for both the training and testing figs 11 and 12 surface stress posed by the wind field can alter not only barotropic but also baroclinic processes it affects the chl a through several processes first wind could change the estuarine circulations including both longitudinal and lateral circulations chen and sanford 2009 scully 2010 li and li 2011 change of circulation affects the along bay and cross bay water and nutrient exchange dispersion of the phytoplankton patches follows the water movement and circulations a stronger downstream flow moves the surface water faster toward downstream and enhances the compensated bottom inflow resulting in a smaller residence time and thus faster flushing shen and wang 2007 du and shen 2016 a smaller residence time can inhibit algal blooms lucas et al 2009 qin and shen 2019 second wind forcing introduces external energy for vertical mixing stronger wind tends to enlarge the vertical mixing layer whose thickness is known to affect the accumulation rate of biomass due to light attenuation and plankton biomass loss e g due to predation or respiration roman et al 2005 third wind forcing can replenish the upper water column with the supply of nutrients from bottom layers after destratification miller et al 2006 such nutrient sources can be very important during summer during which euphoric water is usually nutrient limited after spring blooms fisher et al 1992 finally wind induced resuspension of plankton previously settled at the water sediment interface can also directly affect the chl a concentration in the water column schelske et al 1995 based on observations in lake apopka florida showed that chl a concentrations 100 μ g l were highly correlated with wind speed primarily due to the resuspension of meroplankton linear relationships between wind forcing and key hydrodynamic processes have been identified in previous studies e g scully 2010 in practice researchers usually decompose the wind into different directions one of the most commonly used strategies is to respectively calculate wind hour wind speed and wind strength for southerly northerly westerly and easterly components this strategy wasadopted in the wind data preprocessing for our chesapeake bay chl a application 4 3 necessity to apply transformations for the input forcings transformations are usually needed to obtain a better model performance which applies to not only wind forcing but also other input forcings shen et al 2019 scardi and harding 1999 showed that their neural network based model has performance enhancement when applying a log transformation to the input variables however performance enhancement does not necessarily occur for every case of applying a log transformation for example maher and eyre 2011 showed that a log transformation does not improve their model performance a sensitivity run without applying any transformation of the input forcings give the poorest model performance compared to the base run and sensitivity run without wind figs 11 and 12 one noticeable change in the model performance is that the standard deviation is much larger than the other two runs fig 11f several processes warrant the necessity of including the transformation first it is known that nutrients from the primary diffusive source i e susquehanna river take months to be transported to the middle and lower portions of the bay shen and wang 2007 even for the source from major ambient tributaries e g potomac james and choptank rivers it also takes tens of days for nutrients released from the headwaters to merge into the mainstem bay it is therefore essential to apply a time shifting transformation for nutrient and freshwater loading not only the nutrients and freshwater loading but any forcings influencing the transport processes might also need a time shifting transformation for example a northeasterly wind in the winter is related to the summer hypoxia and the underlying mechanism is believed to lie in the accumulation of organic matter in the lower bay due to the enhanced estuarine circulation under a northeasterly wind le et al 2013 second many input forcings change the physical biological condition through an accumulation process multiple month accumulative amounts of nutrients or freshwater load are generally considered to be more related with the spring algal bloom and summer hypoxic volume in chesapeake bay scavia et al 2006 however it will be challenging and not practically sound to manually set transforming for each forcing and each mode as there are too many forcings to be included and many modes to be explained the effectiveness of any transformation depends on the input forcings and the relationship between the dependent and independent variables providing a series of transformation options and making the model select the best relevant one seems to be a good way to circumvent such obstacles therefore we used an auto selection procedure for the transformation step 4 4 robustness and limitation of the data driven approach the accuracy of the prediction and the success of the model rely greatly on the record length of both the forcing data and the measurement of target parameters high integrity of the data in chesapeake bay is one of the reasons for the success of the model application as the monitoring program continues the length of records will increase steadily in the future which will lead to more accurate model predictions the increasing data volume in the future will make the data driven approach more promising nevertheless it does not mean this approach is not suitable for a coastal system with measurements of limited duration the limitation of time span can be compensated by a higher measurement frequency daily hourly or even minute by minute data can now be easily obtained through in situ measurements remote sensing or hindcast numerical results for example the chl a concentration data from remote sensing e g modis and viirs is available daily even considering the cloud induced lousy signal a weekly average will give reasonable coverages for each year it is possible to get 52 weekly measurements per year leading to data accumulation at a much faster pace and therefore a shorter time span requirement when applying a data driven approach in coastal waters the seasonal cycle usually plays an important role in physical and biological dynamics and therefore it is recommended to have data with length at least longer than a year it is noteworthy that the model performance is likely hampered by the temporal resolution of the chl a measurements in chesapeake bay as well as the missing forcing data regarding the point source loading coastal ocean input and atmospheric deposition such types of limitations not only exist in our model but also for other 3d numerical models the limited temporal resolution of chl a in situ measurement may cause the proposed model to have difficulty in predicting the anomaly i e the residual after subtracting the seasonal mean of chl a in chesapeake bay for the nine stations shown in fig 7 the anomaly correlation coefficient ranges within 0 2 0 6 the relatively low anomaly correlations do not necessarily indicate that the model is useless considering that chl a is extremely difficult to model in estuarine and coastal waters because chl a is affected by not only the fluid dynamics but also complex biogeochemical processes testa et al 2014 for which uncertainties are relatively large using similar inputs including river discharge nutrient loading and atmospheric forcing as required for a hydrodynamic ecosystem model the data based model has a much better computational efficiency the neural network itself does not consume too much time but the filtering of the input forcings to obtain a set of relevant forcings and appropriate transformations does the time consumed depends greatly on the number of input forcings and the number of transformations as well as the length of records the influence of the input forcings is usually nonlinear and thus numerous transformations are recommended including exponential log square inverse and time shifting transformations table 2 perhaps the most crucial advantage of the data driven approach is that it has less error accumulation for numerical model systems the success of the water quality model greatly depends on the reliability of hydrodynamic model and the parameterization of various processes to obtain a numerical solution with discrete resolution in space and time inevitably these errors tend to accumulate over time and from the hydrodynamic level to the upper ecosystem level the data driven approach proposed in this study could be an alternative and efficient tool circumventing this type of error the same concept can also be applied to some similar fields such as dissolved oxygen dissolved organic matter and turbidity considering the high similarities in their controlling mechanisms in an estuary 5 conclusion this study introduces a data driven approach for water quality modeling by combining eof analysis and neural network and converting the 3d problem into multiple 1d problems the overall performance of this data driven approach in modeling the spatial temporal variations of chl a in chesapeake bay is comparable or even better than sophisticated 3d numerical models all of which have difficulty in accurately modeling the chl a the approach could be useful as a tool to predict the response of an estuarine ecosystem to changes in environmental conditions we are not suggesting that the data approach is better than the numerical models however we argue that data driven approaches provide a promising way for future studies in coastal and estuarine systems considering the fast accumulation of data from a variety of monitoring programs this study demonstrates that the dynamics of chl a which is highly variable temporally and spatially and extremely challenging to simulate can be reasonably predicted by a data driven approach because of the nonlinear nature of ecosystem processes modeling of water quality is always challenging even with the help of sophisticated 3d numerical model systems the approach presented here provides an alternative way to circumvent the error cascading in a numerical model and uncertainties induced by the not well parameterized biogeochemical processes by combining eof analysis and the neural network this study highlights the potential of developing data driven models for complex 3d problems in estuaries and coasts with high frequency monitoring data and rapidly advancing machine learning techniques the data driven approaches are likely to be more frequently used in future estuarine studies credit authorship contribution

23916,phytoplankton biomass indicated by chlorophyll a chl a concentration is fundamentally important for aquatic ecosystems however accurately simulating chl a is always challenging even when using state of the art numerical models we propose a data driven modeling framework that combines empirical orthogonal function eof analysis and machine learning technique to tackle this problem using chesapeake bay as an example through the dimension reduction using eof the three dimensional 3d problem can be decomposed into multiple one dimensional 1d problems the non linearity of these 1d problems will be modeled with machine learning using an artificial neural network model performance in terms of spatiotemporal chl a variations with both seasonal and interannual signals is evaluated the model performance is comparable or higher than 3d numerical models previously applied in chesapeake bay sensitivity tests reveal the necessity of forcing transformations to improve the model predictive skill instead of manually applying a transformation for each input forcing variable an auto selection procedure is adopted to choose an appropriate transformation from a variety of transformation options while it is unlikely the data approach can replace the traditional numerical models we argue that data driven approaches provide a promising way for future studies in coastal and estuarine systems considering the fast accumulation of observational data keywords eof neural network water quality chlorophyll a simulation estuaries 1 introduction water quality in aquatic environments such as estuaries and coastal seas is of great public concern despite many efforts it is still difficult to accurately predict water quality variables e g dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a chl a concentration because their spatiotemporal variations are not only subject to physical transport and mixing processes but also significantly regulated by complex biogeochemical activities inside the water column and at the water sediment interface beck 1987 arhonditsis and brett 2004 fennel et al 2006 nonlinearities of biochemical processes are usually not easy to adequately describe using simple deterministic equations with a limited number of state variables as a result simulation and prediction of water quality variables have long been challenging even with the help of the most sophisticated numerical model systems extensive efforts have been made to identify the major controlling factors by examining the linear and nonlinear relationships between kinematic processes through analysis of in situ measurements or laboratory experiments e g kemp et al 1997 dauer et al 2000 such relationships are then parameterized into numerical model systems e g hem3d park et al 1995 fvcom chen et al 2003 roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 and schism zhang et al 2016 these models have been successfully applied for water quality simulations in estuaries and coastal oceans e g fennel et al 2006 cerco and noel 2013 testa et al 2014 yang et al 2015 however the accuracy of numerical model simulations greatly depends on the parameterization of the included kinetic processes where large uncertainties always exist van straten 1983 shen 2006 jiang et al 2018 additionally the accuracy of water quality model simulations also suffers from the cascading or propagation of error originated in the hydrodynamic simulation beck 1987 errors generated during the hydrodynamic simulation will be passed to the water quality simulation introducing additional uncertainties to the model accuracy in simulating water quality state variables because fundamental processes such as nutrient transport algal growth and oxygen distribution greatly depend on residence time transport rate and vertical mixing processes nixon et al 1996 lucas et al 2009 scully 2010 to reduce the error data assimilation has been widely used in forecast or reanalysis modelling ghil and malanotte rizzoli 1991 to manage the uncertainties associated with model structure kinetic parameters and error propagation an alternative approach is to reduce error accumulation during the modeling process by relying as much as possible on a systematic observational dataset with reasonable temporal and spatial resolutions methods that rely purely on observational data are also referred to as data driven approaches todorovski and džeroski 2006 shen et al 2008 yin et al 2014 yu et al 2020 data driven approaches are not new and have been extensively used in industry e g data mining and artificial intelligence as well as in marine sciences e g anderson et al 2010 blauw et al 2010 mcgillicuddy 2010 wang and tang 2010 kong et al 2017 one data driven approach is linear regression perhaps the most widely used method in almost every research field however estuarine processes are complex and usually cannot be simply explained using linear regression analysis to resolve nonlinear relationships researchers often apply some transformations to independent variables e g log and exponential transformation and derive a variety of empirical formulas cohn et al 1992 scardi and harding 1999 attrill 2002 brush et al 2002 nevertheless the improvement is limited for specific variables such as chl a which is known to be a function of various factors including nutrients temperature solar radiation water clarity and flushing rate mccarthy et al 1977 harding et al 1986 cloern 1999 kemp et al 2005 it is still challenging to simulate its spatiotemporal variations using a traditional empirical approach in such cases alternative methods are of great interest availability of rapidly accumulated monitoring data including high frequency in situ measurements remote sensing and reanalysis numerical modeling with data assimilation have paved the road for data driven models recently advanced data analysis methods have been developed quickly along with the increasing demand for big data analysis combining these datasets and advanced methods may provide a new approach for predicting and understanding the variation of water quality conditions with advances in monitoring techniques and the increasing availability of observational data data driven approaches are likely to have great future potential one example of advanced methods is the neural network which is a major component of our proposed data driven approach neural networks are a widely used tool for empirical modeling in a complex system especially useful when addressing nonlinear processes even if the underlying mechanisms are unknown or not fully understood scardi 1996 neural network models have been applied in the fields of classification pattern recognition and signal processing specifically they have been used for remote sensing e g keiner and yan 1998 vilas et al 2011 water level prediction chang and chen 2003 bajo and umgiesser 2010 chen et al 2012 rainfall runoff processes hsu et al 1995 campolo et al 1999 marsh classification morris et al 2005 and algal bloom prediction recknagel 2001 muttil and chau 2006 neural network models were applied in chesapeake bay as early as 1996 by scardi 1996 to train an empirical model for primary phytoplankton production following a similar approach scardi and harding 1999 used in situ measurement of chl a depth light and salinity conditions to predict the primary production rate in chesapeake bay muller and muller 2015 used a wavelet based neural network model to predict hypoxia volume in chesapeake bay based on the oceanic niño index and river flow most previous estuarine studies using data driven models targeted a single time series regarding a bulk value or at a given location e g liang et al 2015 park et al 2015 kong et al 2017 which is a one dimensional 1d simulation higher dimensional modeling however is rarely reported in estuarine and coastal research theoretically a higher dimensional problem can be decomposed into a limited number of lower dimensional problems particularly for aquatic systems where materials are continuously exchanged vertically and horizontally constrained by estuarine circulations and regulated by the dilution process water quality variables e g salinity nutrient concentration and dissolved oxygen in an estuarine system typically share high covariance among different regions du et al 2018 for a simple instance salinity increases at the entrance of an estuary usually coinciding with an increase of salinity at the head of the estuary it is therefore theoretically possible to decouple spatial patterns from temporal variations through a dimension reduction analysis such as empirical orthogonal functions eof and to transform the three dimensional 3d problem into 1d or two dimensional 2d problems the purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of a data driven modeling approach by applying it to simulate the spatial and temporal variations of chl a in chesapeake bay the largest estuary in the us the chl a is one of the most fundamental state variables in determining the productivity and water quality in estuarine systems and is also one of the most challenging subjects in water quality modeling its spatial and temporal variations directly affect almost every aspect of biochemical processes for any given estuarine system as one of the well studied estuarine systems chesapeake bay has been continuously monitored over several decades with monitoring stations covering a relatively large portion of the bay since 1985 monthly or bi monthly surveys of major water quality parameters including salinity temperature total nitrogen dissolved oxygen and chl a have been carried out by the chesapeake bay program cbp https www chesapeakebay net additional monitoring data including river flow nutrient load and air temperature are also made publicly available by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and the united states geological survey usgs these long term and comprehensive datasets make chesapeake bay a perfect study site to evaluate a data driven model the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the collection of observational data introduces the proposed data driven model with focuses on its three major components section 3 presents the spatial and temporal pattern of observed chl a in chesapeake bay and shows the training and evaluation of the data driven model the necessity of including wind and forcing transformation as well as the limitations and robustness of the data driven model is discussed in section 4 followed by concluding remarks in section 5 2 methods 2 1 data collection chesapeake bay is a large partially stratified estuary that extends about 320 km from the mouth of the susquehanna river to its entrance facing the atlantic ocean its water quality has been well monitored by the cbp thirty five years 1985 2019 of the historical record of the target water quality variable specifically chl a at the 16 mainstem stations was extracted from the cbp database data available at https www chesapeakebay net what downloads cbp water quality database 1984 present the locations of the stations are shown in fig 1 despite the spatial and temporal limitations on the sampling resolution the available long term monitoring dataset provided a reliable basis for analysis in many previous studies e g hagy et al 2004 kemp et al 2005 prasad et al 2010 murphy et al 2011 as an essential part of the data driven model external forcing data were carefully collected only relevant forcings were used including nutrient loading river flow air temperature and wind speed and direction table 1 river flow and wind are believed to regulate the stratification estuarine circulation and water exchange between ocean and estuary scully 2010 while nutrient loading and air temperature are generally regarded as dominant factors controlling algal growth nevertheless the combined influence from these forcings on the chl a concentration can be complex harding 1994 these forcing inputs are nearly the same as required by a 3d numerical model e g cerco and noel 2013 forcing data were collected from a variety of reliable sources river flow and nutrient loadings of the largest tributaries susquehanna potomac james and choptank rivers were extracted from usgs https www usgs gov air temperature at chesapeake bay bridge tunnel station 8638901 was extracted from noaa https tidesandcurrents noaa gov with data gaps being replaced with measurements at a nearby noaa station cape henry 8638999 for the atmospheric data instead of depending on measurements at a limited number of gauging stations we used era5 reanalysis product provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf https www ecmwf int which cover the entire chesapeake bay with a spatial resolution of 0 25 and hourly temporal resolution 2 2 framework of the data model to model not only the temporal but also the spatial variations the chl a profile data with irregular vertical resolution was first converted into a gridded 3d data set as a function of x z t where x is the horizontal location along the major axis of the bay z is the depth and t is time considering the high covariance among mainstem stations i e water quality at one station usually changes in pace with nearby stations an eof analysis was conducted to decompose the spatial and temporal variations and thereby convert the 3d variable into several 2d maps and 1d time series fig 2 the 1d time series could then be modeled with readily available statistical and machine learning tools when provided proper input forcing variables the historical record of the target variable i e chl a concentration was first divided into two independent sub datasets namely training and testing datasets with the former being used during the training process and the latter being used to evaluate the model performance when training the model it is important to keep the assumption that neither forcings nor the target variable in the testing period is known therefore the training dataset instead of the full record was used for the eof analysis even though it is possible to train all eof modes it is essential to determine how many principal components are nontrivial and should be modeled to distinguish interpretable signals from random noise several methods have been frequently used including the kaiser guttman criterion scree plot broken stick model and total variance method jackson 1993 here we used the broken stick model proposed by frontier 1976 which suggests that components are interpretable when their eigenvalues exceed the corresponding value from a broken stick distribution the eigenvalue for the k th component under the broken stick model can be calculated as follows jackson 1993 1 b k i k n 1 i where n is the total number of eof components e g 320 in this study only components with an eigenvalue larger than b k will be selected for each selected eof mode the relationship between external forcings and temporal variations of each mode will be established with a neural network model the following sections describe in detail the three major components of the proposed data driven approach i e eof analysis artificial neural network and forcing transformation selection 2 3 eof analysis eof analysis is often used to study the principal components of a variable and how they change with time an eof uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components jolliffe 2002 depending on the covariance between time series at different locations the percentage of total variance accounted for by each mode varies before performing eof analysis the observation profile data of chl a were averaged monthly and interpolated into 20 evenly distributed vertical layers at each station and the long term mean value for each grid point was subtracted in total there were 320 sampling locations 16 stations 20 layers and 420 records over the period of 1985 2019 as a result a data matrix f 420 320 was obtained with each row representing a map for a given month and each column representing the time series of the variable for a given sampling location additionally at each sampling location the time series was normalized with its standard deviation the eof analysis in this study is based on the singular value decomposition algorithm which decomposes the normalized data matrix f into the following form 2 f svd t where s is an orthogonal matrix 420 420 of temporal vectors d is an orthogonal matrix 320 320 of spatial vectors and v is a diagonal matrix 420 320 storing the eigenvalues the advantage of the eof analysis is converting a 3d problem into multiple 1d problems instead of explaining the time series at all sampling locations we only need to focus on a limited number of primary modes the number of primary modes p to be modeled is determined using the broken stick method eq 1 modes other than the first p modes are considered as noise the noise free chl a concentration c can then be calculated as follows 3 c x t c o x i 1 p m i x t i t where c o is the long term mean m is the map calculated as v d t and is a function of the spatial location x and t is the temporal value for a given mode as a function of time t both m and t are extracted from the eof analysis for prediction in the testing period the predicted value of chl a c can be obtained similarly with the maps kept unchanged but temporal components being replaced with predicted values t 4 c x t c o x i 1 p m i x t i t it can be very challenging to model the primary modes with simple linear regressions as successes of regressions greatly depend on the linearity between forcing and responding variables considering many processes in nature are nonlinear and generally respond to a combination of multiple forcings an artificial neural network was applied to model the temporal variations of the selected primary modes 2 4 artificial neural networks artificial neural networks are computational models inspired by the functioning of the human brain scardi 1996 paliwal and kumar 2009 they are composed of numbers of neurons the basic computational unit that takes inputs x from other neurons or external sources calculates the corresponding weight w for each input sums the product of weights and input values σ wx plus bias b and finally passes this value b σ wx to an activation function the outcome of the activation function is used as input for the next layer of neurons here the levenberg marquardt backpropagation training function marquardt 1963 was used which approaches second order training speed without computing the hessian matrix directly and appears to be the fastest method for training moderate sized feedforward neural networks hagan and menhaj 1999 the matlab neural network toolbox version 10 0 was used for this study the training process will stop when any of the following conditions occurs 1 number of epochs reach the defined maximum epochs set to be 100 2 cost function mean square error is minimized to the 0 and 3 performance gradient falls below 1e 7 for details of the algorithm of the levenberg marquardt method readers are referred to the help document in matlab the algorithm is widely recognized and well implemented in the matlab toolbox it is worth noting that there are several uncertainty sources associated with the neural network and these uncertainties need to be considered when using the trained models for prediction first the neural network toolbox is set to randomly divide the input data i e forcing data and target variable data for the training period into train validate and test parts these three parts are set to account for 70 15 and 15 of the input data respectively second the weights and bias are commonly randomly initialized because of the randomness in data division and initialization of the weights and bias the model prediction in both training and testing periods varies slightly from each training to account for these uncertainties we trained the neural network model 100 times for each principal component used the ensemble mean of these models as the final prediction and used the standard deviation of these models predictions to quantify the uncertainties to improve model performance multiple hidden layers of neurons are usually used after testing the model by including different numbers of hidden layers little change in model performance was found when more than two hidden layers were used therefore two hidden layers were used in the model to obtain a balance of accuracy and computational efficiency the number of hidden neurons in each layer was automatically adjusted based on the number of input variables the total numbers of neurons in the first and second layers were set as n and rounding of n 2 respectively where n is the number of input variables 2 5 forcing transformation selections one of the difficulties is selecting relevant forcings as input variables for the neural networks because each eof mode usually relates to different underlying physical and biological processes or represents different regions the response of each eof mode to each input forcing varies for example a mode representing the upper estuary chl a variations will respond to flow and nutrient loading much faster than the mode that represents the lower estuary a time delay of response needs to be considered due to the transport processes of water and nutrients additionally forcings sometimes affect estuarine dynamics through an accumulative process for instance the growth of plankton in the bay is commonly believed to be linked to the loading over several prior months instead of a particular month scavia et al 2006 to account for this effect an accumulative moving average needs to be applied for the forcings in practice we applied different lengths of accumulative average including 30 60 90 120 and 150 days which are corresponding to different transport timescales for water moving from upstream to different regions of the bay shen and wang 2007 considering the unknown relationship between forcings and eof modes it is impractical to choose the transformations manually for each selected eof mode to this end a process called transformation auto selection is included in the method in which forcings are transformed by multiple methods e g accumulative average time delay and log transform see tables 2 and 3 and an appropriate transformation is selected automatically the procedure includes 1 transforming each input forcing variable with one of the functions listed in table 2 2 performing different moving averages for each transformed variable table 3 and 3 conducting different time shifts for each transformed and moving averaged variable table 3 there are more than 200 combinations for each forcing but only one type of transformation that improved and maximized model performance is selected the target variable is set as y n 1 and the input forcing matrix x is empty at the beginning first the coefficients of determination r2 between y and all available forcing variables in all available transformations are computed the forcing variable with a transformation that gives the maximum r2 is selected as the first input variable and stored in x 1 the second forcing variable added to x is selected from the remaining forcings based on the r2 from multiple linear regressions the new forcing variable that most increased the r2 is added this process continues until r2 does not increase by at least 0 005 this threshold is used to exclude forcings that made little contribution even though using linear regression analysis to determine the transformation is not the perfect option such auto selection gives an overall reasonable model performance shown later the selected forcing and transformation for each of the nine modes can be found in supplemental materials table s1 s9 more discussion on the necessity of transformation is presented in section 4 3 for each mode the input parameters are selected independently there is no limit of the input forcings but considering the availability of the data length and its relevance with the chl a we only chose those that are well known as influencing forcings according to previous numerical modeling studies e g cerco and noel 2013 testa et al 2014 several protocols need to be followed when choosing external forcings first no in situ measurements along the mainstem of the bay were used it is not rational to model chl a if one can measure the in situ values of other environmental parameters such as salinity water temperature and total nitrogen instead forcings that are regarded as external e g wind river discharge and air temperature were chosen table 1 second it is essential to ensure that the length of external forcings is equal or greater than the length of the target variable third specific pre processing may be needed for some input forcings for example wind hour was calculated to quantify the accumulative impact of wind blowing from a 45 window of a given direction e g easterly westerly northerly and southerly regardless of the wind speed to account for wind speed wind strength from each direction unit h m s was also computed as the product of wind hour and wind speed in addition we also calculated the wind hour when wind speed exceeded 2 or 4 m s considering that wind will be especially effective when its speed exceeds a certain value fourth to be consistent with the temporal resolution of the target variable all the forcing data were monthly averaged for flow and nutrient loadings not every river was used instead representative discharges and loadings from upstream discharge susquehanna river large tributaries e g potomac and james rivers and small tributaries choptank river were chosen 2 6 model performance index calculation in addition to the common statistical measures including root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient r model skill was also calculated following willmott 1981 5 s k i l l 1 x mod x o b s 2 x mod x o b s x o b s x o b s 2 where x o b s and x m o d are the observed and modeled variables respectively with the overbar indicating the time average the skill provides an index of model data agreement with a skill of 1 indicating perfect agreement and 0 indicating complete disagreement the skill has been widely used to evaluate the performance of numerical models e g warner et al 2005 du et al 2019 while r indicates the model s capability of capturing the seasonal or interannual trends and rmse indicates the overall bias between model and observation skill can be regarded as a synthesis index to evaluate both the trend capturing and relative bias furthermore the correlation coefficient and skill were also calculated for the anomaly to discount the influence of seasonality on the overall model performance to obtain the anomalies the seasonal cycle signal at each station and each layer based on the training dataset was subtracted for both the observed and predicted values in the testing period 2 7 sensitivity test wind plays an important role in water quality through modulating stratification vertical mixing longitudinal and lateral circulation and water renewal in an estuary scully 2010 du and shen 2015 it is unknown whether wind will affect the intensity and extent of algal bloom a sensitivity test with respect to the inclusion of wind force was conducted to answer this question by examining the difference between model performance with and without wind force additional test to illustrate the necessity of transformations was carried out by forcing the model with input variables that were not transformed even though input forcings are transformed by the activation function within the neural network some important effects associated with estuarine dynamics such as time lagging and accumulative effect are not well included inside the neural network results from the sensitivity tests were compared to the base run i e with wind and transformations and their performance differences will be illustrated by taylor diagram taylor 2001 3 results 3 1 long term mean and eof modes for chl a it is worthwhile to describe the long term mean because it provides the background condition upon which the distribution of chl a concentration varies spatially the long term mean chl a concentration ranged within 5 15 μ g l with a higher value in the upper bay and near the surface layers fig 3 the spatial pattern shares great similarities with the distribution of nitrogen concentration du and shen 2017 demonstrating the potential influence of nutrient concentration nitrogen limitation is evident in chesapeake bay particularly during the summer and the impact of nitrogen limitation increases from the upper bay to the lower bay fisher et al 1992 1988 the vertical gradient i e larger value at the surface and smaller value at the bottom suggests a light limitation for algal growth at all locations the maximum value occurred at 39 n or cb3 3c while the minimum value was observed at the bay mouth and the northernmost end of the bay the maximum value occurred just below the downstream limit of the estuarine turbidity maximum zone which is typically located above 39 13n malpezzi et al 2013 the location of the maximum chl a concentration suggests that the algal growth was likely regulated by both nutrients and light conditions at 39n where nutrient levels were high and light conditions were sufficient the accumulation of phytoplankton biomass was greatly favored keller et al 2014 roman et al 2005 through a high resolution sampling over 1995 2002 also found a persistent maximum in phytoplankton biomass occurring in the upper bay and attributed it to the physical and topographic discontinuities in this region 3 2 spatial and seasonal pattern of primary modes more interesting is the spatial pattern and temporal variations of the primary eof modes the first four primary modes account for 45 17 8 and 6 of the total variance respectively due to the orthogonal nature spatial patterns hereafter referred to as maps and time series differed from one another fig 4 the first and second modes feature the spring algal bloom but for different regions the third and fourth modes seem to highlight the summer bloom it is not the primary purpose of this study to distinguish the possible processes contributing to each mode however through an eof analysis one could identify the likely dominant processes accounting for the spatial and temporal variations which will be further discussed in section 4 1 3 3 determine the number of modes to explain using the broken stick method the number of interpretable components for the chl a in chesapeake bay was determined to be nine based on the fact that the first nine eof modes have eigenvalues greater than that under the broken stick distribution fig 5 the residual values after subtracting the summation of the first nine modes and long term mean from the original values are considered as noise and they are not correlated among different locations the first nine eof modes account for 88 of the total variance note that the number of primary components to be modeled is determined based on the training dataset and it is assumed this number also applied to the testing period 3 4 model training the long term dataset was separated into two parts a training dataset the first 80 of the dataset i e 1985 2013 and a testing dataset the last 20 of the dataset i e 2014 2019 the training dataset was used to train the model while the testing dataset was used to evaluate the prediction skill of the trained model using the neural network each of the primary modes was well trained by various input forcings with model skill exceeding 0 52 for all the modes fig 6 we acknowledge that the model is not perfect for every mode as there are still variations not explained by the input forcings for several following reasons first some nutrient sources were not included in the input forcings such as the atmospheric deposition point sources along the shoreline and coastal ocean input these sources could contribute to 30 40 of the total nitrogen load boynton et al 1995 however there are limited available data regarding these nutrient sources and therefore they were not included in the model application another reason is the temporal limitation of the observation the monthly or bi monthly measurement might not be able to represent the monthly mean condition particularly for regions with large temporal variabilities bever et al 2013 3 5 model performance in testing period the model predicts well the variability in different regions i e larger variability in the upper bay and smaller variability in the lower bay fig 7 for the subsurface chl a the rmse range is 7 12 μ g l with a larger rmse in the upper bay correlation coefficient 0 8 and model skill 0 8 are both high in the middle and upper bay stations with exception of the upper most station cb2 2 the model skill at the lower bay stations is relatively lower 0 14 0 72 partly because the chl a in the lower bay is also controlled by coastal ocean conditions which were not included in the model due to lack of observations recent studies e g du and shen 2017 da et al 2018 suggest the nutrient conditions in the open ocean can be influential especially for the lower bay as large bottom inflow can efficiently move the oceanic water into the bay as nutrient concentration in the lower bay is relatively small changes in nutrient level in the coastal ocean can thus have more impact in this region than the middle upper bay where riverine nutrients dominate the lower performance in the lower bay can be also attributed to the decreasing variability of chl a when moving from the upper bay to the lower bay for example at the bay mouth station cb7 3 the concentration of chl a was typically below 10 μ g l which was about one order less than the value in the middle and upper bay the seasonal patterns of the chl a are also well predicted and the pattern varies greatly among different seasons in terms of the magnitude and vertical gradient the chl a was much greater during winter and spring compared to summer and fall fig 8 interestingly the vertical gradient followed an upward direction i e decrease upward during winter weaker in spring and downward in summer and fall the upward gradient in winter and spring is unique in chesapeake bay particularly during winter whereas the vertical gradient during spring is weak except in the upper bay 39 n the exact underlying mechanism for such vertical distribution during winter is not well known it could be caused by the combination of several processes including settling of algae landward bottom inflow and or lateral circulations not only does the model predict well the seasonal cycle of the chl a it also reasonably predicts the interannual variability fig 9 of the five years 2014 2018 in the testing period the observed spring chl a was characterized with a maximum value in the bottom of the upper bay for three years 2014 2016 suggesting effective bottom trapping near the turbidity maximum zone the chl a in the spring of 2016 2017 was much smaller and showed no marked bloom likely caused by a lower nutrient level or a more dispersive hydrodynamic condition there were significant interannual variabilities and the model is able to capture this interannual signal overall the model predictions are satisfactory for both spatial and temporal variations of chl a in chesapeake bay the performance is comparable or better than the sophisticated 3d numerical models that have been applied for chesapeake bay e g cerco and meyers 2000 li et al 2009 cerco and noel 2013 testa et al 2014 yang et al 2015 using a physical biogeochemical coupling model testa et al 2014 simulated the chl a with a mean correlation coefficient of 0 6 between model and observation in another numerical modeling study feng et al 2015 the correlation coefficient for chl a had a mean value of 0 3 when averaged over the mainstem monitoring stations irby et al 2016 compared the performance of eight numerical models all applied for chesapeake bay in simulating salinity temperature dissolved oxygen and chl a they showed that all the numerical models had a low skill in predicting chl a compared to other water quality variables for the bottom chl a the correlation coefficient from different models ranged within 0 1 0 6 in comparison our data driven model had a correlation coefficient of about 0 75 when averaged over all 16 stations fig 10 furthermore it seems all the numerical models greatly underestimate the variability of the bottom chl a with the standard deviation about less than half of the true value testa et al 2014 feng et al 2015 irby et al 2016 even though most of these numerical models were designed for simulating the dissolved oxygen there is no doubt that chl a simulation is extremely challenging even using the most advanced numerical model systems 4 discussion 4 1 possible mechanisms revealed by eof analysis it is of interest to understand the dominant processes that regulate the temporal and spatial distribution of a given water quality variable and eof analysis can serve as a useful tool for such a purpose this strategy has been extensively used in many studies for example scully 2016 performed an eof analysis for the dissolved oxygen in chesapeake bay and attributed the second mode to the bathymetry discontinuity induced convergence du et al 2018 used eof to identify the key external parameters including water temperature and chl a concentration for the first primary mode of dissolved oxygen in chesapeake bay our analysis shows that the first and second modes together contributed to 64 of the total variance of chl a the temporal values of both first and second eof modes show clear seasonality with peaks in april and march respectively fig 4b d the first mode is characterized with positive spatial value throughout the entire bay meaning changes in chl a in this mode are in phase over the entire bay differently the second mode highlights a strong variability in the subsurface water of the upper bay it is conceivable that the first and second modes account for the major seasonal bloom particularly the spring bloom the second mode leads the first one by about one month suggesting that the spring bloom occurrs first in the upper bay with maximum bloom in march and then the algal bloom extends to the entire bay reaching its maximum in april although the spring bloom has been commonly recognized in previous studies e g harding 1994 keller et al 2014 it is interesting to find the different timing of algal bloom in different regions it is worth pointing out the noticeable vertical difference in the spatial pattern of the first two eof modes both of which are characterized with a higher value at the bottom and a smaller value at the surface indicating a larger variability or more sensitive response at the bottom than at the surface particularly in the second mode chl a concentration varies greatly at the bottom of the upper bay compared to any other region such a spatial pattern is partially attributable to the sensitivity of sediment resuspension and accumulation at the water sediment interface near the turbidity maximum zone keller et al 2014 suggested that an efficient entrapment of phytoplankton and phytoplankton derived organic matter occurs near the turbidity maximum zone contrary to our common understanding that algae generally concentrate in the upper column due to light attenuation it is the subsurface layer that has a larger variability and this applies to the entire bay even after including the long term mean value the subsurface concentrations of chl a are generally larger than the surface concentration fig 9 4 2 necessity to include wind the sensitivity test without including the wind forcings shows that the model s performance is weakened without wind forcings the overall performance is reduced for both the training and testing figs 11 and 12 surface stress posed by the wind field can alter not only barotropic but also baroclinic processes it affects the chl a through several processes first wind could change the estuarine circulations including both longitudinal and lateral circulations chen and sanford 2009 scully 2010 li and li 2011 change of circulation affects the along bay and cross bay water and nutrient exchange dispersion of the phytoplankton patches follows the water movement and circulations a stronger downstream flow moves the surface water faster toward downstream and enhances the compensated bottom inflow resulting in a smaller residence time and thus faster flushing shen and wang 2007 du and shen 2016 a smaller residence time can inhibit algal blooms lucas et al 2009 qin and shen 2019 second wind forcing introduces external energy for vertical mixing stronger wind tends to enlarge the vertical mixing layer whose thickness is known to affect the accumulation rate of biomass due to light attenuation and plankton biomass loss e g due to predation or respiration roman et al 2005 third wind forcing can replenish the upper water column with the supply of nutrients from bottom layers after destratification miller et al 2006 such nutrient sources can be very important during summer during which euphoric water is usually nutrient limited after spring blooms fisher et al 1992 finally wind induced resuspension of plankton previously settled at the water sediment interface can also directly affect the chl a concentration in the water column schelske et al 1995 based on observations in lake apopka florida showed that chl a concentrations 100 μ g l were highly correlated with wind speed primarily due to the resuspension of meroplankton linear relationships between wind forcing and key hydrodynamic processes have been identified in previous studies e g scully 2010 in practice researchers usually decompose the wind into different directions one of the most commonly used strategies is to respectively calculate wind hour wind speed and wind strength for southerly northerly westerly and easterly components this strategy wasadopted in the wind data preprocessing for our chesapeake bay chl a application 4 3 necessity to apply transformations for the input forcings transformations are usually needed to obtain a better model performance which applies to not only wind forcing but also other input forcings shen et al 2019 scardi and harding 1999 showed that their neural network based model has performance enhancement when applying a log transformation to the input variables however performance enhancement does not necessarily occur for every case of applying a log transformation for example maher and eyre 2011 showed that a log transformation does not improve their model performance a sensitivity run without applying any transformation of the input forcings give the poorest model performance compared to the base run and sensitivity run without wind figs 11 and 12 one noticeable change in the model performance is that the standard deviation is much larger than the other two runs fig 11f several processes warrant the necessity of including the transformation first it is known that nutrients from the primary diffusive source i e susquehanna river take months to be transported to the middle and lower portions of the bay shen and wang 2007 even for the source from major ambient tributaries e g potomac james and choptank rivers it also takes tens of days for nutrients released from the headwaters to merge into the mainstem bay it is therefore essential to apply a time shifting transformation for nutrient and freshwater loading not only the nutrients and freshwater loading but any forcings influencing the transport processes might also need a time shifting transformation for example a northeasterly wind in the winter is related to the summer hypoxia and the underlying mechanism is believed to lie in the accumulation of organic matter in the lower bay due to the enhanced estuarine circulation under a northeasterly wind le et al 2013 second many input forcings change the physical biological condition through an accumulation process multiple month accumulative amounts of nutrients or freshwater load are generally considered to be more related with the spring algal bloom and summer hypoxic volume in chesapeake bay scavia et al 2006 however it will be challenging and not practically sound to manually set transforming for each forcing and each mode as there are too many forcings to be included and many modes to be explained the effectiveness of any transformation depends on the input forcings and the relationship between the dependent and independent variables providing a series of transformation options and making the model select the best relevant one seems to be a good way to circumvent such obstacles therefore we used an auto selection procedure for the transformation step 4 4 robustness and limitation of the data driven approach the accuracy of the prediction and the success of the model rely greatly on the record length of both the forcing data and the measurement of target parameters high integrity of the data in chesapeake bay is one of the reasons for the success of the model application as the monitoring program continues the length of records will increase steadily in the future which will lead to more accurate model predictions the increasing data volume in the future will make the data driven approach more promising nevertheless it does not mean this approach is not suitable for a coastal system with measurements of limited duration the limitation of time span can be compensated by a higher measurement frequency daily hourly or even minute by minute data can now be easily obtained through in situ measurements remote sensing or hindcast numerical results for example the chl a concentration data from remote sensing e g modis and viirs is available daily even considering the cloud induced lousy signal a weekly average will give reasonable coverages for each year it is possible to get 52 weekly measurements per year leading to data accumulation at a much faster pace and therefore a shorter time span requirement when applying a data driven approach in coastal waters the seasonal cycle usually plays an important role in physical and biological dynamics and therefore it is recommended to have data with length at least longer than a year it is noteworthy that the model performance is likely hampered by the temporal resolution of the chl a measurements in chesapeake bay as well as the missing forcing data regarding the point source loading coastal ocean input and atmospheric deposition such types of limitations not only exist in our model but also for other 3d numerical models the limited temporal resolution of chl a in situ measurement may cause the proposed model to have difficulty in predicting the anomaly i e the residual after subtracting the seasonal mean of chl a in chesapeake bay for the nine stations shown in fig 7 the anomaly correlation coefficient ranges within 0 2 0 6 the relatively low anomaly correlations do not necessarily indicate that the model is useless considering that chl a is extremely difficult to model in estuarine and coastal waters because chl a is affected by not only the fluid dynamics but also complex biogeochemical processes testa et al 2014 for which uncertainties are relatively large using similar inputs including river discharge nutrient loading and atmospheric forcing as required for a hydrodynamic ecosystem model the data based model has a much better computational efficiency the neural network itself does not consume too much time but the filtering of the input forcings to obtain a set of relevant forcings and appropriate transformations does the time consumed depends greatly on the number of input forcings and the number of transformations as well as the length of records the influence of the input forcings is usually nonlinear and thus numerous transformations are recommended including exponential log square inverse and time shifting transformations table 2 perhaps the most crucial advantage of the data driven approach is that it has less error accumulation for numerical model systems the success of the water quality model greatly depends on the reliability of hydrodynamic model and the parameterization of various processes to obtain a numerical solution with discrete resolution in space and time inevitably these errors tend to accumulate over time and from the hydrodynamic level to the upper ecosystem level the data driven approach proposed in this study could be an alternative and efficient tool circumventing this type of error the same concept can also be applied to some similar fields such as dissolved oxygen dissolved organic matter and turbidity considering the high similarities in their controlling mechanisms in an estuary 5 conclusion this study introduces a data driven approach for water quality modeling by combining eof analysis and neural network and converting the 3d problem into multiple 1d problems the overall performance of this data driven approach in modeling the spatial temporal variations of chl a in chesapeake bay is comparable or even better than sophisticated 3d numerical models all of which have difficulty in accurately modeling the chl a the approach could be useful as a tool to predict the response of an estuarine ecosystem to changes in environmental conditions we are not suggesting that the data approach is better than the numerical models however we argue that data driven approaches provide a promising way for future studies in coastal and estuarine systems considering the fast accumulation of data from a variety of monitoring programs this study demonstrates that the dynamics of chl a which is highly variable temporally and spatially and extremely challenging to simulate can be reasonably predicted by a data driven approach because of the nonlinear nature of ecosystem processes modeling of water quality is always challenging even with the help of sophisticated 3d numerical model systems the approach presented here provides an alternative way to circumvent the error cascading in a numerical model and uncertainties induced by the not well parameterized biogeochemical processes by combining eof analysis and the neural network this study highlights the potential of developing data driven models for complex 3d problems in estuaries and coasts with high frequency monitoring data and rapidly advancing machine learning techniques the data driven approaches are likely to be more frequently used in future estuarine studies credit authorship contribution

23917,we describe a two layer coupled model for landslide motion over irregular bathymetry and resulting water column motion and tsunami generation the three dimensional non hydrostatic wave model nhwave ma et al 2012 is applied as the upper layer model to simulate landslide generated tsunami waves here we focus on the derivation of governing equations for the lower layer model where the landslide is described as either a viscous mud flow or a saturated granular debris flow the governing equations are depth integrated in a cartesian coordinate system referenced to the still water surface vertical acceleration of the slide is taken into account by including non hydrostatic pressure effects within the slide the model is validated in comparison to analytic results of mangeney et al 2000 and the slope oriented numerical approach of ma et al 2015 the numerical approach and further examples are described in the companion paper zhang et al 2021 keywords submarine landslide two layer non hydrostatic model tsunami propagation rheology closures 1 introduction prior to the devastating 1998 papua new guinea png tsunami most tsunami research and modeling was devoted to co seismic tsunamis triggered by large earthquakes the png event was triggered by a large submarine mass failure smf and resulted in up to 16 m runup on local shorelines causing up to 2500 fatalities tappin et al 2001 synolakis et al 2002 additional smf triggered events such as the 1929 grand banks tsunami piper et al 1988 fine et al 2005 lovholt et al 2018 a series of smf tsunamis during the 1964 alaska earthquake nicolsky et al 2013 parsons et al 2014 and the recent smf tsunami in 2018 sulawesi island earthquake takagi et al 2019 have also caused human fatalities and infrastructural losses smf events may also result from the entry of subaerial slides into water bodies fritz et al 2009 or by events impacting submarine and subaerial regions simultaneously grilli et al 2019 1 1 approaches for describing slide rheologies because the png smf was thought to be a rigid rotational slide many early laboratory experiments and modeling studies of landslide tsunamis focused on rigid slide motion watts et al 2000 grilli and watts 2005 liu et al 2005 enet and grilli 2007 predictions based on this approach are presently thought to be overly conservative for tsunami generation by deformable slide motions grilli and watts 2005 schambach et al 2019 2020 leading to the need for detailed models of deformable slide motions coussot and meunier 1996 and yavari ramshe and ataie ashtiani 2016 have proposed classification systems for deformable smfs in their schemes smfs of interest to us may be divided into granular flows treated as a mixture of solid and fluid phases and mud flows treated as a single fluid usually with a newtonian stress rate of strain relation the distinction of these two types of flow highly depends on sediment size and solid concentration of flow granular flow models have been widely developed iverson and denlinger 2001 fernández nieto et al 2008 ma et al 2015 following on the coulomb friction model of savage and hutter 1989 with extensions to incorporate pore pressure effects in saturated media iverson and denlinger 2001 models for viscous fluid slides are also widely developed jiang and leblond 1992 fine et al 1998 kirby et al 2016 models using more complex rheologies including yield stress or plastic behavior bingham 1916 coussot 1994 velocity dependent coulomb friction voellmy 1955 or rate dependent viscosity models such as the μ i rheology model midi 2004 have been developed but have not been shown to provide distinct advantages over the simpler viscous and granular rheologies considered here 1 2 choice of coordinate system and effect of vertical acceleration the majority of numerical models for predicting tsunami waves generated by deformable landslides are based on either of two approaches yavari ramshe and ataie ashtiani 2016 the first and more comprehensive approach involves treating the full 3d problem as a mixture or multiphase flow with rapidly varying spatial properties combining the simulation of slide and water column into a single framework assier rzadkiewicz et al 1997 abadie et al 2012 ma et al 2013 horrillo et al 2013 most models of this type directly solve the 3d navier stokes equations and can reproduce complex processes of fluid behavior however full 3d navier stokes solvers are still computationally demanding a second approach referred to here as the two layer approach considers the landslide and overlying water column as two separate layers where each layer has its own density and rheology in this approach the lower layer slide mass has been described using a number of candidate rheologies compared to the one layer method the two layer method can only consider a sharp interface between the two layers although mixing and entrainment across interfaces can be modeled as an additional process iverson and george 2014 george and iverson 2014 the majority of these models derive their governing equations either in regular cartesian coordinates oriented to a level surface with an assumption of mildly sloping bathymetry referred to as class 1 jiang and leblond 1992 fine et al 1998 or in slope oriented coordinates referred to as class 2 iverson and denlinger 2001 heinrich et al 2001 iverson and george 2014 ma et al 2015 the models in class 1 while simpler to couple to the upper layer wave model typically do not account for strong vertical acceleration effects occurring on steep slopes the models in class 2 are more readily capable of dealing with strong vertical motion since these motions arise from forcing in the along slope direction but they can be difficult to couple to the overlying wave model and may be difficult to apply to irregular bathymetries having no obvious reference slope examples of work addressing this coupling problem directly include the studies of fernández nieto et al 2008 and delgado sánchez et al 2020 in general deriving the governing equations in standard cartesian coordinates gives simpler expressions but a closure for strong vertical motion of the mass is needed if we want a model applicable to irregular bathymetry denlinger and iverson 2004 utilized a modified gravity which incorporates an estimate of the total vertical acceleration to account for the vertical motion where the effect of acceleration either amplifies or reduces the gravity when the flow is vertically accelerated or decelerated this approach essentially yields a boussinesq type model for debris flow though the basic features of the flow dispersion were not revealed explicitly in the paper the first attempt to apply the basic boussinesq type theory to a depth averaged model for granular flow was made by castro orgaz et al 2015 but they did not propose a practical model for general cases recently single layer depth averaged non hydrostatic models have been developed to simulate weakly dispersive nonlinear surface wave properties yamazaki et al 2009 escalante et al 2018 models of this type typically still employ an assumption of a mildly sloping bed and thus do not provide a full generalization of the problem discussed here the existing models also often employ an inconsistent treatment of the relationship between vertical acceleration and non hydrostatic pressure and thus do not correspond to boussinesq theory in a consistent manner jeschke et al 2017 1 3 the present study in this paper we propose a two layer non hydrostatic model to investigate the motion of smfs and tsunami generation and propagation over irregular bathymetry the model consists of an upper layer non hydrostatic wave model nhwave developed by ma et al 2012 and a lower layer non hydrostatic landslide model which can simulate smfs using either a newtonian viscous rheology for mud flows or a coulomb friction rheology for granular flows the lower layer landslide model solves a non hydrostatic extension of a shallow water type system in standard cartesian coordinates new formulations to construct the basal stresses in newtonian viscous model and granular flow model are introduced the granular flow model is based on the anisotropic stress model of hutter et al 1993 extended to consideration of pore fluid stresses iverson and denlinger 2001 the paper is organized as follows in section 2 physical principles are described including 3d conservation laws depth integrated equations for the lower layer and treatment of the non hydrostatic pressure correction section 3 describes the derivation of rheology closures for viscous and granular flows section 4 demonstrates the importance of including the non hydrostatic pressure dispersion correction and vertical advective acceleration conclusions and ideas for future model improvements are discussed in section 5 numerical treatment of the models and further computational examples are provided in zhang et al 2021 2 governing equations the model developed here consists of a depth integrated model for slide motion in cartesian coordinates x y z referenced to a level plane perpendicular to the direction of gravity and having either a free surface in contact with air for subaerial slides or an interface in contact with an overlying water layer for submarine slides the water and slide volumes are referred to as the upper and lower layers respectively free surface motions in the water layer are simulated using the non hydrostatic model nhwave ma et al 2012 a similar coupled system using a slope oriented model for the lower layer may be found in ma et al 2015 the primary goal of the present work is to develop a model for the lower layer in the cartesian coordinates of the upper layer with the slide model having an adequate representation of vertical acceleration effects needed to accurately model slide motion the lower layer model is formulated using either a newtonian viscous rheology referred to as mud flow or a rheology based on granular flow rheology savage and hutter 1989 hutter et al 1993 the granular model follows the initial ideas of iverson and denlinger 2001 but with an extensively different procedure for resolving stress components 2 1 conservation laws in 3d the granular and mud flows described here will each be treated as deformation of a single material using the navier stokes equations 2 1 ρ t ρ u 0 2 2 ρ u t ρ u u t p ρ g where u denotes velocity in three dimensions is the gradient operator is the dot product is the dyadic product ρ represents material density g is the gravitational vector oriented in the z direction p is the total pressure t is the deviatoric stress tensor and subscripted commas denote partial derivatives for the case of a newtonian viscous rheology the deviatoric stress tensor t is given in terms of the rate of deformation tensor or in tensor notation t i j μ u i j u j i for the case of a granular rheology we first consider the laws of motion for liquid and solid phases separately given by gidaspow 1994 and iverson and denlinger 2001 2 3 ρ s ϕ t ρ s ϕ u s 0 2 4 ρ s ϕ u s

solid and fluid phases respectively and ϕ is the solid concentration here t s represents the tensor of deviatoric solid stress t f represents the tensor of deviatoric pore fluid stress as in the newtonian model above and f is the interaction force between the two phases summing the mass conservation eqs 2 3 and 2 5 and the momentum conservation eqs 2 4 and 2 6 leads to equations for the fluid

interaction force terms in 2 4 and 2 6 are canceled in the mixture equation we define the elevations of a substrate underlying the slide or the water column in the absence of the slide by z h s x t and the position of the upper surface of the slide by z h x t fig 1 the slide layers considered here are typically fairly thin relative to the horizontal length scales of the slide and thus it is possible to make use of a depth integrated form of the equations for the lower layer subsequently we employ tensor notation and make a distinction between horizontal velocity components u α and vertical component w where α β are indices for a two dimensional tensor notation in horizontal coordinates x y the 3d equations 2 1 and 2 2 written in this form are 2 7 ρ t ρ u β β ρ w z 0 2 8 ρ u α t ρ u α u β β ρ u α w z τ β α β τ z α z p α 2 9 ρ w t ρ w u β β ρ w 2 z τ β z β τ z z z p z ρ g where τ denotes the deviatoric stress component kinematic boundary conditions kbcs on each surface are given by 2 10 h t u β h β w 0 z h 2 11 h s t u β h s β w 0 z h s where we neglect the possibility of erosion or deposition on the lower boundary as well as entrainment of water on the upper boundary dynamic boundary conditions for the slide layer at interface are given by 2 12 t i p 1 n t t i p 0 n t z h where i is identity matrix the superscript 0 and 1 represent water and slide phase respectively and n t h x h y 1 1 h x 2 h y 2 is the upward normal vector at the slide surface 2 2 depth integrated equations for the lower slide layer the statistics of past smfs events yavari ramshe and ataie ashtiani 2016 show that 85 percent of historical landslides have slide lengths on the order of 10 times larger than their thicknesses thus for most landslide flows the ratio d l fig 2 is small when viewed in slope oriented coordinates in our cartesian frame the apparent slide thickness d 0 and projected length l 0 are increased and decreased respectively by a factor of 1 cos θ 0 leading to a global estimate of the ratio d 0 l 0 d l cos 2 θ 0 the ratio is thus increased by a factor of 2 for a slope θ 0 π 4 for example extremely steep slopes can make application of shallow flow regime in cartesian coordinates problematic in the following we will assume that the slopes are small enough that the assumptions needed for shallow depth integrated flows are still valid equations for the slide layer are obtained by integrating 2 7 2 9 over the interval h s z h the resulting local slide thickness d h s h represents the thickness in the vertical direction and differs from

the mixture density ρ is constant this neglects the spatial and temporal changes in average density resulting from mass exchanges with the substrate and water column as well as possible vertical

z n h q t q b where the subscripts t represents variables evaluated at the slide top and b represents variables evaluated at the slide bottom in the momentum equations the vertical distributions of velocity components are accounted for by the momentum distribution coefficients γ the vertical velocity and stresses are assumed to be distributed linearly in z leading to the relations 2 21 w 1 2 w t w b 2 22 t 1 2 t b t t here we impose a traction free boundary condition t t 0 at the slide water interface instead of using 2 12 2 3 non hydrostatic pressure correction the contributions of non hydrostatic effect on a slide can be revealed by applying a scaling analysis to z momentum equation 2 9 after canceling the hydrostatic term and gravity term in the equation and defining the stresses in a viscous stress form the equation can be rewritten as 2 23 q z ρ w t u β w β w w z ρ ν e w β β w z z where ν e is effective kinematic viscosity of the slide in the equation we define normalized variables as β β l 0 z z d 0 t t l 0 c 0 u β u β ϵ 1 c 0 w w ϵ 1 c 0 ϵ 2 and q q r h o g a 0 where l 0 and d 0 are characteristic length in horizontal and vertical as shown in fig 2 respectively and a 0 is the characteristic length of the vertical variation of slide surface two non dimensional parameters are introduced here where ϵ 1 a 0 d 0 and ϵ 2 d 0 l 0 substituting of the normalized variables into 2 23 and dividing all terms by ρ g ϵ 1 yields a normalized z momentum equation 2 24 q z w t ϵ 1 u β w β ϵ 1 ϵ 2 2 w w z 1 ϵ 2 r e ϵ 2 2 w β β w z z where r e c 0 d 0 ν e is reynolds number this equation indicates that the ratio of vertical acceleration first three terms in rhs to viscous stresses last two terms in rhs is of order o ϵ 2 r e the reynolds numbers of the laboratory cases we investigated in zhang et al 2021 are in the order of o 1 0 2 to o 1 0 3 while the parameter ϵ 2 is in the order of o 1 0 1 this reveals a fact that acceleration contribution overwhelms the viscous contribution in the non hydrostatic effect the non hydrostatic effect is expressed in the depth integrated equations as a source term in 2 19 we derive a relation between q q b and q t by imposing a quadratic vertical profile for the non hydrostatic pressure which is consistent with the assumption of a depth uniform horizontal velocity and linear variation of vertical velocity in a high reynold number flow jeschke et al 2017 the acceleration is a kinematic effect and we follow arguments based on a perfect fluid justified by the scaling analysis neglecting rheological aspects of the problem

2 3 q b 1 3 q t 1 6 ρ d a 1 a 2 we further assume that the bed is not moving and the total derivative of depth averaged horizontal velocity in a 2 can be approximated by the hydrostatic pressure

the first two terms in 2 42 give a dispersion relation consistent with boussinesq theory based on the depth averaged velocity u jeschke et al 2017 the third term is referred to below as the dispersion correction term related to the bed slope and is usually neglected in models for surface waves the importance of this term for slide motion over steep slopes is demonstrated in section 4 the fourth term is a low order approximation to the correction for curved beds due to dressler 1978 see also castro orgaz and hager 2016 which could also be large in field cases however this term causes numerical instability issues when local curvatures are large george and iverson 2014 in the present study we assume that the basal surface is smooth with small local curvatures following gray et al 1999 and george and iverson 2014 and leave the term for future study 3 rheology closures in the present work we consider two types of slide rheology and basal stress a newtonian viscous flow model described in section 3 1 and a granular flow model based on coulomb friction described in section 3 2 the numerical implementation and validation of both closures are presented in the companion paper zhang et al 2021 3 1 newtonian viscous flow mud flow with more than 50 percent of water by volume behaves more like a newtonian fluid pierson and e c osta 1987 and can generally be characterized as low reynolds number laminar flow in the flow if the solid particle size is small and solid concentration is low the particle velocity is expected to be very close to the carrier fluid and the interactions between solid and fluid are negligible compared to fluid viscosity under this circumstance the solid stress is approximately zero and the contribution from solid phase is embodied as an increased effective viscosity and mixture density in this rheology model the vertical distributions of the horizontal velocity components are assumed to be parabolic this choice is inconsistent with the assumption of nearly depth uniform flow used in developing the dispersive correction nevertheless it is strongly embedded in the literature for the viscous flow case and was retained here since previously calibrated values of effective viscosity are seen to provide accurate reproduction of laboratory observations jiang and leblond 1993 fine et al 1998 for a high reynolds number flow a form of quadratic bottom friction at a simplest level could be better to describe the slide stress however the bottom friction coefficient in the quadratic bottom friction method is quite empirical the geophysical connection with the effective viscosity used in our model is more solid to the real slide properties we leave this inconsistency in viscous stress and non hydrostatic effect in our future study following the approach of fine et al 1998 we introduce a local coordinate σ z h s d where σ 0 represents the seabed and σ 1 represents slide surface the horizontal velocity is then written as 3

particle diameter shows no particular stress strain rate relation and the intergranular stresses satisfy the coulomb rule savage and hutter 1989 iverson and denlinger 2001 here we use a modified coulomb friction approach following the ideas of hutter et al 1993 and iverson and denlinger 2001 the formulation of the granular flow model is characterized by two treatments first strong vertical motion of the slide is considered in estimating the basal normal stress using the z momentum equation 2 15 with non hydrostatic pressure and d w d t retained second the model is developed in a horizontal cartesian coordinate system oriented with the still water level based on expressions for stress components established in local coordinates as shown in fig 3 the local coordinate system is defined with x aligned with the local flow direction making the flow locally unidirectional aside from vertical motions in the z direction transformations between the local and cartesian system are described in appendix b after defining the coordinates the solid stress components can be expressed by the momentum equation 2 4 where the solid stresses are deviatoric with positive values corresponding to tensile forces the relation between different stress components is defined in terms of a solid effective stress defined by 3 17 t e t s i p s where p s ϕ ρ s g d q s is the total pressure contributed by the solid phase and q s q b q t is non hydrostatic pressure contributed by the solid phase here for simplicity we assume that the non hydrostatic pressure from the fluid phase is negligible to the non hydrostatic pressure from the solid phase in conventional savage hutter type coulomb friction models following the method introduced by savage and hutter 1989 the horizontal normal stresses are isotropic in x y plane referred to as 2d isotropy hypothesis in this model the constitutive relations for the coulomb law in the local coordinate system are developed following the 2d anisotropy approach of hutter et al 1993 where the horizontal normal stress in the x direction differs from the normal stress in y direction referred to as 2d anisotropy hypothesis the dominant shear stresses are then τ e x z and τ e z x the remaining shear stress components τ e y z τ e z y τ e x y and τ e y x still arise but are comparatively small pirulli et al 2007 gave a detailed description of the mohr circle law for such an element and the derivation of corresponding rankine s coefficients of earth pressure hutter et al 1993 stated that this hypothesis is only valid when the motion is chiefly to x direction and the sidewise motion is small this restriction prohibits the popularization of this theory because the flow direction can be arbitrary on a fixed underlying grid however the local coordinates constructed in the present model can satisfy this requirement well since the local coordinate system is designed to have the x direction coincide with the flow direction appendix d shows how the different hypotheses affect the slide motion and final deposit by simulating an experiment conducted by gray et al 1999 where a dry granular slide moves on a parabolic cross slope topography obviously the 2d anisotropy hypothesis produced a better results compared to the laboratory observations there are two sets of information in cartesian coordinate system and local coordinate system in cartesian coordinates we have a function of stress components τ e z z τ e x z and τ e y z obtained by vertical momentum equation 2 15 i e 3 18 τ e β z d β τ e b β z h s β τ e b z

contacting the bed the coefficient k x a c t p a s is determined using elementary geometrical arguments and k y a c t p a s x a c t p a s is determined by mohr circle law in the element pirulli et al 2007 when the slide is moving they can be expressed as 3 23 k x a c t p a s 2 sec 2 ϕ i n t 1 1 cos 2 ϕ i n t sec 2 ϕ b e d 1 ϕ i n t ϕ b e d 1 sin 2 ϕ i n t 1 sin 2 ϕ i n t ϕ i n t ϕ b e d and 3 24 k

h s in 3 18 we have an equation only for τ e z z h s after solving it for τ e z z h s and using the relations 3 29 and 3 30 we can obtain expressions for all solid effective stress components in cartesian coordinates these stress components include vertical acceleration terms of non hydrostatic pressure and local and advective term of w the solid deviatoric stress components at bottom are given by 3 31 t s b t e b i p s b the depth averaged deviatoric stress components are estimated by assuming that the stress is distributed linearly in the vertical i e 3 32 t s 1 2 t s b to complete the closure we further need a model for fluid stress t f in 2 6 which is part of the mixture stresses in 2 8 and 2 9 in this model only laminar pore flow is assumed and the formulae 3 12 3 16 for the newtonian viscous flow model in section 3 1 are employed as the formulae for pore fluid stresses by using clear water viscosity 4 importance of the non hydrostatic contributions in this section we illustrate the contributions of non hydrostatic pressure dispersion correction and vertical advection in cases with steep slopes by reproducing a dam break debris flow over a frictional or non frictional dry surface we compare results to an analytical solution for dam break flow of granular material down a slope mangeney et al 2000 given by 4 1 d 1 9 g cos α x t 2 c 0 1 2 m t 2 where α is the angle of the bed slope t is time and x is the direction parallel to the uniform slope with x 0 being the vertical front position of the slide at t 0 additional parameters are given by the initial slide thickness d 0 c 0 g d 0 cos α and m g sin α g cos α tan ϕ b e d the solution is valid in the region x l x x r where x l c 0 t 1 2 m t 2 and x r 2 c 0 t 1 2 m t 2 the solution is based on a hydrostatic formulation in slope oriented coordinates and thus expresses the full contribution of down slope gravity forcing but does not consider dispersive effects arising from distortion of the layer depth and accompanying accelerations in the slope normal direction we would expect that results of the model of ma et al 2015 would agree with the analytic solution here while the full form of the present model could deviate from the analytic solution due to the inclusion of dispersive contributions to the down slope motion the model is first tested on a non frictional surface for cases including a horizontal or flat bottom and a bed with a slope of α 30 the simulation results demonstrate the importance of non hydrostatic pressure and the dispersion correction in the cartesian coordinate model for the flat bottom case fig 4 top panel hydrostatic model results which in this case would represent either the model of ma et al 2015 or the present model without non hydrostatic corrections agree closely with the solution of mangeney et al 2000 except at the surface slope discontinuity near the retreating upstream front of the motion where the numerical scheme introduces a smoothing effect this smoothing of the solution is increased to a minor degree by the inclusion of the non hydrostatic correction the results of the model with and without the slope dependent dispersion correction term in 2 42 are identical since the bed slope h s x 0 for the bed slope of α 30 lower panel of fig 4 the slide is affected by a significant down slope component of gravity forcing which would not be expressed in a hydrostatic approximation in horizontally oriented cartesian coordinates for this case the slide motion for the hydrostatic model in horizontal orientation blue line deviates significantly from the analytic solution showing a more rapid advance in the down slope direction the non hydrostatic model results show markedly better agreement with the analytic solution with the discrepancy in down slope slide motion eliminated the previous model of ma et al 2015 see their fig 2 also reproduces the analytic solution here as would be expected dispersive effects are seen to cause a smoothing at the upper limit of the collapsing front as in the zero slope case results without red line or with black line the dispersion correction term differ by only a minor amount with the solution retaining the effect producing a better shape of the front this improvement becomes more significant as the slope increases the vertical advective acceleration contribution to non hydrostatic pressure which is typically ignored in one layer non hydrostatic models for surface waves yamazaki et al 2009 escalante et al 2018 for example is also significant in non hydrostatic simulations with steep slopes to illustrate this we run a test over a non frictional surface with a slope of α 20 the results are compared with the analytical solution in fig 5 numerical simulations with vertical advective accelerations neglected generate an unrealistic solitary wave like front at the leading edge of the granular flow the importance of the advective terms in the overall momentum balance may be investigated using 1d horizontal versions of 2 14 and 2 15 given by 4 2 ρ u d t ρ u u d x ρ g d h x 2 3 q b d x q b h s x ρ g 6 d 2 h x h s x x 0 4 3 ρ w d t ρ w u d x q b 0 where the first terms in 4 2 and 4 3 represent local acceleration the second terms represent advective acceleration the third term in 4 2 is the hydrostatic pressure forcing the fourth term in 4 2 and third term in 4 3 are the non hydrostatic pressure forcing terms and the fifth term in 4 2 is the dispersion correction term these two equations can be normalized by scale factors similar to the ones we define in section 2 3 x x l 0 t t l 0 c 0 d x d 0 u u ϵ 1 c 0 w u ϵ 1 c 0 ϵ 2 h s x h s x h 0 l 0 and q b q b ρ g a 0 where h 0 is a characteristic length of bathymetry as shown in fig 2 and the new non dimensional parameter ϵ 3 h 0 l 0 represents the bed slope inserting the normalized variables and dividing all terms by ρ g d 0 ϵ 1 the normalized equations of 4 2 and 4 3 are 4 4 ϵ 2 u d t ϵ 1 ϵ 2 u u d x ϵ 2 ϵ 1 d d x ϵ 3 ϵ 2 d h s x ϵ 2 2 3 q b d x ϵ 3 ϵ 2 q b h s x ϵ 2 2 ϵ 3 2 6 ϵ 1 d 2 h s x h s x x 1 ϵ 3 d 2 d x h s x x 0 4 5 w d t ϵ 1 w u d x q b 0 the contributions to the momentum balance in the x and z directions for the case of bed slope α 30 without friction are shown in fig 6 in the x momentum equation 4 2 fig 6a local solid blue line and advective dashed blue line horizontal accelerations are seen to approximately balance each other with a net positive downslope total acceleration this total acceleration is vanished at the tip of the front and it is consistent to our scaling analysis in 4 4 where the ratio of horizontal advection to local acceleration ϵ 1 raise to o 1 since the slide surface elevation varies most at the front the hydrostatic solid red line and non hydrostatic dashed red line pressure forcings are of opposite sign but with the hydrostatic forcing being about four times larger and thus dominant the partial cancellation provided by the non hydrostatic component accounts for the slower down slope motion of the slide shown in fig 4 both hydrostatic pressure and non hydrostatic pressure drop to zero at the front tip but the hydrostatic pressure drops faster because the ratio of non hydrostatic pressure to hydrostatic pressure ϵ 1 rises in the slide front region the dispersion correction term in 4 2 as shown in fig 6c is small and does not contribute significantly to the motion of the slide front as a second order term of the bed slope when slope becomes steeper this term will be more important contributions to the vertical momentum balance including local acceleration blue line advective acceleration dashed blue line and resulting value of q b dashed red line are shown in fig 6b as was seen in the horizontal direction the two components of the acceleration nearly balance at the leading edge of the slide the advective component drops to zero at a distance behind the slide front leading to a non hydrostatic pressure q b that is determined completely by the local acceleration as is typically assumed in most depth integrated non hydrostatic models our scaling analysis in 4 5 indicates that the vertical advective acceleration is first order term of ϵ 1 representing vertical variation of slide surface to the slide depth close to front where ϵ 1 is of o 1 the neglect of the advective term would lead to a pronounced over estimate of the non hydrostatic pressure contribution this effect accounts for the evolution of the pronounced bulge shown if fig 5 it is also important to include local and advective acceleration terms and non hydrostatic pressure when using 3 18 to compute the solid effective stress τ e z z in the granular flow model to illustrate this two numerical tests were carried out for a debris flow over a bed with the slope α 30 and bottom friction ϕ b e d 10 with τ e z z computed from 3 18 with or without vertical acceleration effects retained the results of two simulations at t 20 s are compared in fig 7 without the vertical acceleration effect in the determination of solid stresses the slide front moves more slowly than predicted by the analytic solution of mangeney et al 2000 the vertical acceleration reduces the apparent weight of the granular mass and thus the corresponding basal frictional resistance the numerical result from a landslide model based on a slope oriented coordinate ma et al 2015 is included for comparison and agrees well with the present results 5 discussion and conclusions in this paper we proposed a two layer non hydrostatic tsunami wave generation model specified entirely in a cartesian frame referenced to a level surface usually referenced to the still water level the physical principles and governing equations of the lower layer landslide model were discussed the model is derived in cartesian coordinates using either newtonian viscous fluid or granular coulomb friction rheology details of the model numerical implementation together with numerical validation for landslide tsunami cases are presented in the companion paper zhang et al 2021 here we tested the landslide model for dam break cases with steep slopes and the simulation results illustrated some facts in the development of a landslide model on a cartesian coordinate first non hydrostatic pressure plays a key role in the landslide motion on irregular bathymetry with steep slopes because the non hydrostatic pressure in the depth integrated model accounted for the effects of the vertical acceleration second imposing a quadratic profile for non hydrostatic pressure can correct the dispersion property of model and thus the shape of slide front third including vertical advective acceleration is important for the simulation involving steep slopes in bathymetry finally the effect of the total derivative of w and non hydrostatic pressure on solid stresses in the granular model either amplifies or reduces the apparent weight of the landslide mass when the flow is vertically accelerated or decelerated by varying bathymetry the model described here can be further improved in a number of ways sediment erosion and deposition and water entrainment effects are not considered in the model and thus variations of mixture density are not considered closures for erosion rate entrainment rate and varying density will be incorporated in future work at the slide water interface a traction free boundary condition is assumed the effects of interfacial tangential stresses on slide motion will be investigated although these stresses are ignored in many other two layer landslide models jiang and leblond 1992 heinrich et al 2001 ma et al 2015 in addition more slide rheologies should be investigated including non newtonian fluid rheologies such as the bingham and herschel bulkley models the voellmy model that can account for the partial velocity dependent influence on the pore fluid turbulence or the rate dependent friction law μ i rheology model credit

is again symmetric appendix d 2d anisotropy hypothesis vs 2d isotropy hypothesis to show the advantage of using the 2d anisotropy hypothesis in the granular model we carry out a simulation of the dry granular landslide experiment conducted by gray et al 1999 the numerical implementations of the model are presented in the companion paper zhang et al 2021 this experiment has frequently been used as a benchmark for granular flow modeling over irregular topography gray et al 1999 pirulli et al 2007 chen et al 2006 in the experiment a semi elliptical granular slide was released from rest and rushed down a slope with a parabolic bed topography in the cross slope direction as shown in fig d 1 here the computed edge of the slide is compared to the observed avalanche boundary in the experiment the slide tail moved much slower than the front and the mass elongated into a thin and long shape before final deposition on a horizontal surface at the base of the slope in the simulations the slide properties were set based on the experimental measurements of gray et al 1999 with solid density ρ s 2500 kg m 3 sediment concentration ϕ 60 0 internal angle of friction ϕ i n t 40 and basal angle of friction ϕ b e d 30 the left panel of fig d 2 shows the simulated landslide thickness from the non hydrostatic granular flow model based on the 2d anisotropy hypothesis it can be seen that both the front and tail moved slightly slower than in observations this lag of motion in time also appeared in other model simulations run based on slope oriented or curvilinear coordinates gray et al 1999 pirulli et al 2007 the cause of this problem is very likely that a simple coulomb friction law with a constant bed friction angle is inadequate for representing the more complicated basal friction process gray et al 1999 the landslide motions from the non hydrostatic granular flow model with 2d isotropy hypothesis are shown in right panel of fig d 2 which illustrates a wider spread out of the front in the cross slope direction than for the earlier simulations shown in the left panel as a result the slide deposit on the flat run out zone is thinner and covers a larger area comparing the computed edge of slide to the experimental observations the 2d anisotropy hypothesis produced a better deposit shape 
23917,we describe a two layer coupled model for landslide motion over irregular bathymetry and resulting water column motion and tsunami generation the three dimensional non hydrostatic wave model nhwave ma et al 2012 is applied as the upper layer model to simulate landslide generated tsunami waves here we focus on the derivation of governing equations for the lower layer model where the landslide is described as either a viscous mud flow or a saturated granular debris flow the governing equations are depth integrated in a cartesian coordinate system referenced to the still water surface vertical acceleration of the slide is taken into account by including non hydrostatic pressure effects within the slide the model is validated in comparison to analytic results of mangeney et al 2000 and the slope oriented numerical approach of ma et al 2015 the numerical approach and further examples are described in the companion paper zhang et al 2021 keywords submarine landslide two layer non hydrostatic model tsunami propagation rheology closures 1 introduction prior to the devastating 1998 papua new guinea png tsunami most tsunami research and modeling was devoted to co seismic tsunamis triggered by large earthquakes the png event was triggered by a large submarine mass failure smf and resulted in up to 16 m runup on local shorelines causing up to 2500 fatalities tappin et al 2001 synolakis et al 2002 additional smf triggered events such as the 1929 grand banks tsunami piper et al 1988 fine et al 2005 lovholt et al 2018 a series of smf tsunamis during the 1964 alaska earthquake nicolsky et al 2013 parsons et al 2014 and the recent smf tsunami in 2018 sulawesi island earthquake takagi et al 2019 have also caused human fatalities and infrastructural losses smf events may also result from the entry of subaerial slides into water bodies fritz et al 2009 or by events impacting submarine and subaerial regions simultaneously grilli et al 2019 1 1 approaches for describing slide rheologies because the png smf was thought to be a rigid rotational slide many early laboratory experiments and modeling studies of landslide tsunamis focused on rigid slide motion watts et al 2000 grilli and watts 2005 liu et al 2005 enet and grilli 2007 predictions based on this approach are presently thought to be overly conservative for tsunami generation by deformable slide motions grilli and watts 2005 schambach et al 2019 2020 leading to the need for detailed models of deformable slide motions coussot and meunier 1996 and yavari ramshe and ataie ashtiani 2016 have proposed classification systems for deformable smfs in their schemes smfs of interest to us may be divided into granular flows treated as a mixture of solid and fluid phases and mud flows treated as a single fluid usually with a newtonian stress rate of strain relation the distinction of these two types of flow highly depends on sediment size and solid concentration of flow granular flow models have been widely developed iverson and denlinger 2001 fernández nieto et al 2008 ma et al 2015 following on the coulomb friction model of savage and hutter 1989 with extensions to incorporate pore pressure effects in saturated media iverson and denlinger 2001 models for viscous fluid slides are also widely developed jiang and leblond 1992 fine et al 1998 kirby et al 2016 models using more complex rheologies including yield stress or plastic behavior bingham 1916 coussot 1994 velocity dependent coulomb friction voellmy 1955 or rate dependent viscosity models such as the μ i rheology model midi 2004 have been developed but have not been shown to provide distinct advantages over the simpler viscous and granular rheologies considered here 1 2 choice of coordinate system and effect of vertical acceleration the majority of numerical models for predicting tsunami waves generated by deformable landslides are based on either of two approaches yavari ramshe and ataie ashtiani 2016 the first and more comprehensive approach involves treating the full 3d problem as a mixture or multiphase flow with rapidly varying spatial properties combining the simulation of slide and water column into a single framework assier rzadkiewicz et al 1997 abadie et al 2012 ma et al 2013 horrillo et al 2013 most models of this type directly solve the 3d navier stokes equations and can reproduce complex processes of fluid behavior however full 3d navier stokes solvers are still computationally demanding a second approach referred to here as the two layer approach considers the landslide and overlying water column as two separate layers where each layer has its own density and rheology in this approach the lower layer slide mass has been described using a number of candidate rheologies compared to the one layer method the two layer method can only consider a sharp interface between the two layers although mixing and entrainment across interfaces can be modeled as an additional process iverson and george 2014 george and iverson 2014 the majority of these models derive their governing equations either in regular cartesian coordinates oriented to a level surface with an assumption of mildly sloping bathymetry referred to as class 1 jiang and leblond 1992 fine et al 1998 or in slope oriented coordinates referred to as class 2 iverson and denlinger 2001 heinrich et al 2001 iverson and george 2014 ma et al 2015 the models in class 1 while simpler to couple to the upper layer wave model typically do not account for strong vertical acceleration effects occurring on steep slopes the models in class 2 are more readily capable of dealing with strong vertical motion since these motions arise from forcing in the along slope direction but they can be difficult to couple to the overlying wave model and may be difficult to apply to irregular bathymetries having no obvious reference slope examples of work addressing this coupling problem directly include the studies of fernández nieto et al 2008 and delgado sánchez et al 2020 in general deriving the governing equations in standard cartesian coordinates gives simpler expressions but a closure for strong vertical motion of the mass is needed if we want a model applicable to irregular bathymetry denlinger and iverson 2004 utilized a modified gravity which incorporates an estimate of the total vertical acceleration to account for the vertical motion where the effect of acceleration either amplifies or reduces the gravity when the flow is vertically accelerated or decelerated this approach essentially yields a boussinesq type model for debris flow though the basic features of the flow dispersion were not revealed explicitly in the paper the first attempt to apply the basic boussinesq type theory to a depth averaged model for granular flow was made by castro orgaz et al 2015 but they did not propose a practical model for general cases recently single layer depth averaged non hydrostatic models have been developed to simulate weakly dispersive nonlinear surface wave properties yamazaki et al 2009 escalante et al 2018 models of this type typically still employ an assumption of a mildly sloping bed and thus do not provide a full generalization of the problem discussed here the existing models also often employ an inconsistent treatment of the relationship between vertical acceleration and non hydrostatic pressure and thus do not correspond to boussinesq theory in a consistent manner jeschke et al 2017 1 3 the present study in this paper we propose a two layer non hydrostatic model to investigate the motion of smfs and tsunami generation and propagation over irregular bathymetry the model consists of an upper layer non hydrostatic wave model nhwave developed by ma et al 2012 and a lower layer non hydrostatic landslide model which can simulate smfs using either a newtonian viscous rheology for mud flows or a coulomb friction rheology for granular flows the lower layer landslide model solves a non hydrostatic extension of a shallow water type system in standard cartesian coordinates new formulations to construct the basal stresses in newtonian viscous model and granular flow model are introduced the granular flow model is based on the anisotropic stress model of hutter et al 1993 extended to consideration of pore fluid stresses iverson and denlinger 2001 the paper is organized as follows in section 2 physical principles are described including 3d conservation laws depth integrated equations for the lower layer and treatment of the non hydrostatic pressure correction section 3 describes the derivation of rheology closures for viscous and granular flows section 4 demonstrates the importance of including the non hydrostatic pressure dispersion correction and vertical advective acceleration conclusions and ideas for future model improvements are discussed in section 5 numerical treatment of the models and further computational examples are provided in zhang et al 2021 2 governing equations the model developed here consists of a depth integrated model for slide motion in cartesian coordinates x y z referenced to a level plane perpendicular to the direction of gravity and having either a free surface in contact with air for subaerial slides or an interface in contact with an overlying water layer for submarine slides the water and slide volumes are referred to as the upper and lower layers respectively free surface motions in the water layer are simulated using the non hydrostatic model nhwave ma et al 2012 a similar coupled system using a slope oriented model for the lower layer may be found in ma et al 2015 the primary goal of the present work is to develop a model for the lower layer in the cartesian coordinates of the upper layer with the slide model having an adequate representation of vertical acceleration effects needed to accurately model slide motion the lower layer model is formulated using either a newtonian viscous rheology referred to as mud flow or a rheology based on granular flow rheology savage and hutter 1989 hutter et al 1993 the granular model follows the initial ideas of iverson and denlinger 2001 but with an extensively different procedure for resolving stress components 2 1 conservation laws in 3d the granular and mud flows described here will each be treated as deformation of a single material using the navier stokes equations 2 1 ρ t ρ u 0 2 2 ρ u t ρ u u t p ρ g where u denotes velocity in three dimensions is the gradient operator is the dot product is the dyadic product ρ represents material density g is the gravitational vector oriented in the z direction p is the total pressure t is the deviatoric stress tensor and subscripted commas denote partial derivatives for the case of a newtonian viscous rheology the deviatoric stress tensor t is given in terms of the rate of deformation tensor or in tensor notation t i j μ u i j u j i for the case of a granular rheology we first consider the laws of motion for liquid and solid phases separately given by gidaspow 1994 and iverson and denlinger 2001 2 3 ρ s ϕ t ρ s ϕ u s 0 2 4 ρ s ϕ u s

solid and fluid phases respectively and ϕ is the solid concentration here t s represents the tensor of deviatoric solid stress t f represents the tensor of deviatoric pore fluid stress as in the newtonian model above and f is the interaction force between the two phases summing the mass conservation eqs 2 3 and 2 5 and the momentum conservation eqs 2 4 and 2 6 leads to equations for the fluid solid mixture in the form of 2 1 and 2 2 with mixture density ρ ρ s ϕ ρ f 1 ϕ mixture velocity u ρ s ϕ u s ρ f 1 ϕ u f ρ mixture stress tensor t t s t f and total pressure p p s p f the internal interaction force terms in 2 4 and 2 6 are canceled in the mixture equation we define the elevations of a substrate underlying the slide or the water column in the absence of the slide by z h s x t and the position of the upper surface of the slide by z h x t fig 1 the slide layers considered here are typically fairly thin relative to the horizontal length scales of the slide and thus it is possible to make use of a depth integrated form of the equations for the lower layer subsequently we employ tensor notation and make a distinction between horizontal velocity components u α and vertical component w where α β are indices for a two dimensional tensor notation in horizontal coordinates x y the 3d equations 2 1 and 2 2 written in this form are 2 7 ρ t ρ u β β ρ w z 0 2 8 ρ u α t ρ u α u β β ρ u α w z τ β α β τ z α z p α 2 9 ρ w t ρ w u β β ρ w 2 z τ β z β τ z z z p z ρ g where τ denotes the deviatoric stress component kinematic boundary conditions kbcs on each surface are given by 2 10 h t u β h β w 0 z h 2 11 h s t u β h s β w 0 z h s where we neglect the possibility of erosion or deposition on the lower boundary as well as entrainment of water on the upper boundary dynamic boundary conditions for the slide layer at interface are given by 2 12 t i p 1 n t t i p 0 n t z h where i is identity matrix the superscript 0 and 1 represent water and slide phase respectively and n t h x h y 1 1 h x 2 h y 2 is the upward normal vector at the slide surface 2 2 depth integrated equations for the lower slide layer the statistics of past smfs events yavari ramshe and ataie ashtiani 2016 show that 85 percent of historical landslides have slide lengths on the order of 10 times larger than their thicknesses thus for most landslide flows the ratio d l fig 2 is small when viewed in slope oriented coordinates in our cartesian frame the apparent slide thickness d 0 and projected length l 0 are increased and decreased respectively by a factor of 1 cos θ 0 leading to a global estimate of the ratio d 0 l 0 d l cos 2 θ 0 the ratio is thus increased by a factor of 2 for a slope θ 0 π 4 for example extremely steep slopes can make application of shallow flow regime in cartesian coordinates problematic in the following we will assume that the slopes are small enough that the assumptions needed for shallow depth integrated flows are still valid equations for the slide layer are obtained by integrating 2 7 2 9 over the interval h s z h the resulting local slide thickness d h s h represents the thickness in the vertical direction and differs from thickness measured in the direction perpendicular to the slope the derivation is outlined in appendix a with the resulting equations given by 2 13 ρ d t ρ u β d β 0 2 14 ρ u α d t γ α β ρ u α u β d β s α τ s α h s α n h 2 15 ρ w d t γ z β ρ w u β d β s z τ s z n h where the overbar is a notation for the depth integrated mean values and γ is momentum distribution coefficient we further assume that the mixture density ρ is constant this neglects the spatial and temporal changes in average density resulting from mass exchanges with the substrate and water column as well as possible vertical variations resulting from stratification of water and solid phases sources representing solid stresses hydrostatic pressure and non hydrostatic pressure contributions are given by 2 16 s α τ τ β α d β

z n h q t q b where the subscripts t represents variables evaluated at the slide top and b represents variables evaluated at the slide bottom in the momentum equations the vertical distributions of velocity components are accounted for by the momentum distribution coefficients γ the vertical velocity and stresses are assumed to be distributed linearly in z leading to the relations 2 21 w 1 2 w t w b 2 22 t 1 2 t b t t here we impose a traction free boundary condition t t 0 at the slide water interface instead of using 2 12 2 3 non hydrostatic pressure correction the contributions of non hydrostatic effect on a slide can be revealed by applying a scaling analysis to z momentum equation 2 9 after canceling the hydrostatic term and gravity term in the equation and defining the stresses in a viscous stress form the equation can be rewritten as 2 23 q z ρ w t u β w β w w z ρ ν e w β β w z z where ν e is effective kinematic viscosity of the slide in the equation we define normalized variables as β β l 0 z z d 0 t t l 0 c 0 u β u β ϵ 1 c 0 w w ϵ 1 c 0 ϵ 2 and q q r h o g a 0 where l 0 and d 0 are characteristic length in horizontal and vertical as shown in fig 2 respectively and a 0 is the characteristic length of the vertical variation of slide surface two non dimensional parameters are introduced here where ϵ 1 a 0 d 0 and ϵ 2 d 0 l 0 substituting of the normalized variables into 2 23 and dividing all terms by ρ g ϵ 1 yields a normalized z momentum equation 2 24 q z w t ϵ 1 u β w β ϵ 1 ϵ 2 2 w w z 1 ϵ 2 r e ϵ 2 2 w β β w z z where r e c 0 d 0 ν e is reynolds number this equation indicates that the ratio of vertical acceleration first three terms in rhs to viscous stresses last two terms in rhs is of order o ϵ 2 r e the reynolds numbers of the laboratory cases we investigated in zhang et al 2021 are in the order of o 1 0 2 to o 1 0 3 while the parameter ϵ 2 is in the order of o 1 0 1 this reveals a fact that acceleration contribution overwhelms the viscous contribution in the non hydrostatic effect the non hydrostatic effect is expressed in the depth integrated equations as a source term in 2 19 we derive a relation between q q b and q t by imposing a quadratic vertical profile for the non hydrostatic pressure which is consistent with the assumption of a depth uniform horizontal velocity and linear variation of vertical velocity in a high reynold number flow jeschke et al 2017 the acceleration is a kinematic effect and we follow arguments based on a perfect fluid justified by the scaling analysis neglecting rheological aspects of the problem the euler equations in the cartesian coordinate system are given by 2 25 u β β w z 0 2 26 u α t u β u α β w u α z 1 ρ p α 2 27 w t u β w β w w z 1 ρ p z g with kbcs given by 2 10 and 2 11 integrating

2 3 q b 1 3 q t 1 6 ρ d a 1 a 2 we further assume that the bed is not moving and the total derivative of depth averaged horizontal velocity in a 2 can be approximated by the hydrostatic pressure gradient then a 1 is zero and a 2 becomes 2 41 a 2 g h β h s β u α u β h s β α eq 2 40 becomes 2 42 q 2 3 q b 1 3 q t 1 6 ρ g d h β h s β 1 6 ρ d u α u β h s β α in the context of free surface waves the first two terms in 2 42 give a dispersion relation consistent with boussinesq theory based on the depth averaged velocity u jeschke et al 2017 the third term is referred to below as the dispersion correction term related to the bed slope and is usually neglected in models for surface waves the importance of this term for slide motion over steep slopes is demonstrated in section 4 the fourth term is a low order approximation to the correction for curved beds due to dressler 1978 see also castro orgaz and hager 2016 which could also be large in field cases however this term causes numerical instability issues when local curvatures are large george and iverson 2014 in the present study we assume that the basal surface is smooth with small local curvatures following gray et al 1999 and george and iverson 2014 and leave the term for future study 3 rheology closures in the present work we consider two types of slide rheology and basal stress a newtonian viscous flow model described in section 3 1 and a granular flow model based on coulomb friction described in section 3 2 the numerical implementation and validation of both closures are presented in the companion paper zhang et al 2021 3 1 newtonian viscous flow mud flow with more than 50 percent of water by volume behaves more like a newtonian fluid pierson and e c osta 1987 and can generally be characterized as low reynolds number laminar flow in the flow if the solid particle size is small and solid concentration is low the particle velocity is expected to be very close to the carrier fluid and the interactions between solid and fluid are negligible compared to fluid viscosity under this circumstance the solid stress is approximately zero and the contribution from solid phase is embodied as an increased effective viscosity and mixture density in this rheology model the vertical distributions of the horizontal velocity components are assumed to be parabolic this choice is inconsistent with the assumption of nearly depth uniform flow used in developing the dispersive correction nevertheless it is strongly embedded in the literature for the viscous flow case and was retained here since previously calibrated values of effective viscosity are seen to provide accurate reproduction of laboratory observations jiang and leblond 1993 fine et al 1998 for a high reynolds number flow a form of quadratic bottom friction at a simplest level could be better to describe the slide stress however the bottom friction coefficient in the quadratic bottom friction method is quite empirical the geophysical connection with the effective viscosity used in our model is more solid to the real slide properties we leave this inconsistency in viscous stress and non hydrostatic effect in our future study following the approach of fine et al 1998 we introduce a local coordinate σ z h s d where σ 0 represents the seabed and σ 1 represents slide surface the horizontal velocity is then written as 3

particle diameter shows no particular stress strain rate relation and the intergranular stresses satisfy the coulomb rule savage and hutter 1989 iverson and denlinger 2001 here we use a modified coulomb friction approach following the ideas of hutter et al 1993 and iverson and denlinger 2001 the formulation of the granular flow model is characterized by two treatments first strong vertical motion of the slide is considered in estimating the basal normal stress using the z momentum equation 2 15 with non hydrostatic pressure and d w d t retained second the model is developed in a horizontal cartesian coordinate system oriented with the still water level based on expressions for stress components established in local coordinates as shown in fig 3 the local coordinate system is defined with x aligned with the local flow direction making the flow locally unidirectional aside from vertical motions in the z direction transformations between the local and cartesian system are described in appendix b after defining the coordinates the solid stress components can be expressed by the momentum equation 2 4 where the solid stresses are deviatoric with positive values corresponding to tensile forces the relation between different stress components is defined in terms of a solid effective stress defined by 3 17 t e t s i p s where p s ϕ ρ s g d q s is the total pressure contributed by the solid phase and q s q b q t is non hydrostatic pressure contributed by the solid phase here for simplicity we assume that the non hydrostatic pressure from the fluid phase is negligible to the non hydrostatic pressure from the solid phase in conventional savage hutter type coulomb friction models following the method introduced by savage and hutter 1989 the horizontal normal stresses are isotropic in x y plane referred to as 2d isotropy hypothesis in this model the constitutive relations for the coulomb law in the local coordinate system are developed following the 2d anisotropy approach of hutter et al 1993 where the horizontal normal stress in the x direction differs from the normal stress in y direction referred to as 2d anisotropy hypothesis the dominant shear stresses are then τ e x z and τ e z x the remaining shear stress components τ e y z τ e z y τ e x y and τ e y x still arise but are comparatively small pirulli et al 2007 gave a detailed description of the mohr circle law for such an element and the derivation of corresponding rankine s coefficients of earth pressure hutter et al 1993 stated that this hypothesis is only valid when the motion is chiefly to x direction and the sidewise motion is small this restriction prohibits the popularization of this theory because the flow direction can be arbitrary on a fixed underlying grid however the local coordinates constructed in the present model can satisfy this requirement well since the local coordinate system is designed to have the x direction coincide with the flow direction appendix d shows how the different hypotheses affect the slide motion and final deposit by simulating an experiment conducted by gray et al 1999 where a dry granular slide moves on a parabolic cross slope topography obviously the 2d anisotropy hypothesis produced a better results compared to the laboratory observations there are two sets of information in cartesian coordinate system and local coordinate system in cartesian coordinates we have a function of stress components τ e z z τ e x z and τ e y z obtained by vertical momentum equation 2 15 i e 3 18 τ e β z d β τ e b β z h s β τ e b z

contacting the bed the coefficient k x a c t p a s is determined using elementary geometrical arguments and k y a c t p a s x a c t p a s is determined by mohr circle law in the element pirulli et al

h s in 3 18 we have an equation only for τ e z z h s after solving it for τ e z z h s and using the relations 3 29 and 3 30 we can obtain expressions for all solid effective stress components in cartesian coordinates these stress components include vertical acceleration terms of non hydrostatic pressure and local and advective term of w the solid deviatoric stress components at bottom are given by 3 31 t s b t e b i p s b the depth averaged deviatoric stress components are estimated by assuming that the stress is distributed linearly in the vertical i e 3 32 t s 1 2 t s b to complete the closure we further need a model for fluid stress t f in 2 6 which is part of the mixture stresses in 2 8 and 2 9 in this model only laminar pore flow is assumed and the formulae 3 12 3 16 for the newtonian viscous flow model in section 3 1 are employed as the formulae for pore fluid stresses by using clear water viscosity 4 importance of the non hydrostatic contributions in this section we illustrate the contributions of non hydrostatic pressure dispersion correction and vertical advection in cases with steep slopes by reproducing a dam break debris flow over a frictional or non frictional dry surface we compare results to an analytical solution for dam break flow of granular material down a slope mangeney et al 2000 given by 4 1 d 1 9 g cos α x t 2 c 0 1 2 m t 2 where α is the angle of the bed slope t is time and x is the direction parallel to the uniform slope with x 0 being the vertical front position of the slide at t 0 additional parameters are given by the initial slide thickness d 0 c 0 g d 0 cos α and m g sin α g cos α tan ϕ b e d the solution is valid in the region x l x x r where x l c 0 t 1 2 m t 2 and x r 2 c 0 t 1 2 m t 2 the solution is based on a hydrostatic formulation in slope oriented coordinates and thus expresses the full contribution of down slope gravity forcing but does not consider dispersive effects arising from distortion of the layer depth and accompanying accelerations in the slope normal direction we would expect that results of the model of ma et al 2015 would agree with the analytic solution here while the full form of the present model could deviate from the analytic solution due to the inclusion of dispersive contributions to the down slope motion the model is first tested on a non frictional surface for cases including a horizontal or flat bottom and a bed with a slope of α 30 the simulation results demonstrate the importance of non hydrostatic pressure and the dispersion correction in the cartesian coordinate model for the flat bottom case fig 4 top panel hydrostatic model results which in this case would represent either the model of ma et al 2015 or the present model without non hydrostatic corrections agree closely with the solution of mangeney et al 2000 except at the surface slope discontinuity near the retreating upstream front of the motion where the numerical scheme introduces a smoothing effect this smoothing of the solution is increased to a minor degree by the inclusion of the non hydrostatic correction the results of the model with and without the slope dependent dispersion correction term in 2 42 are identical since the bed slope h s x 0 for the bed slope of α 30 lower panel of fig 4 the slide is affected by a significant down slope component of gravity forcing which would not be expressed in a hydrostatic approximation in horizontally oriented cartesian coordinates for this case the slide motion for the hydrostatic model in horizontal orientation blue line deviates significantly from the analytic solution showing a more rapid advance in the down slope direction the non hydrostatic model results show markedly better agreement with the analytic solution with the discrepancy in down slope slide motion eliminated the previous model of ma et al 2015 see their fig 2 also reproduces the analytic solution here as would be expected dispersive effects are seen to cause a smoothing at the upper limit of the collapsing front as in the zero slope case results without red line or with black line the dispersion correction term differ by only a minor amount with the solution retaining the effect producing a better shape of the front this improvement becomes more significant as the slope increases the vertical advective acceleration contribution to non hydrostatic pressure which is typically ignored in one layer non hydrostatic models for surface waves yamazaki et al 2009 escalante et al 2018 for example is also significant in non hydrostatic simulations with steep slopes to illustrate this we run a test over a non frictional surface with a slope of α 20 the results are compared with the analytical solution in fig 5 numerical simulations with vertical advective accelerations neglected generate an unrealistic solitary wave like front at the leading edge of the granular flow the importance of the advective terms in the overall momentum balance may be investigated using 1d horizontal versions of 2 14 and 2 15 given by 4 2 ρ u d t ρ u u d x ρ g d h x 2 3 q b d x q b h s x ρ g 6 d 2 h x h s x x 0 4 3 ρ w d t ρ w u d x q b 0 where the first terms in 4 2 and 4 3 represent local acceleration the second terms represent advective acceleration the third term in 4 2 is the hydrostatic pressure forcing the fourth term in 4 2 and third term in 4 3 are the non hydrostatic pressure forcing terms and the fifth term in 4 2 is the dispersion correction term these two equations can be normalized by scale factors similar to the ones we define in section 2 3 x x l 0 t t l 0 c 0 d x d 0 u u ϵ 1 c 0 w u ϵ 1 c 0 ϵ 2 h s x h s x h 0 l 0 and q b q b ρ g a 0 where h 0 is a characteristic length of bathymetry as shown in fig 2 and the new non dimensional parameter ϵ 3 h 0 l 0 represents the bed slope inserting the normalized variables and dividing all terms by ρ g d 0 ϵ 1 the normalized equations of 4 2 and 4 3 are 4 4 ϵ 2 u d t ϵ 1 ϵ 2 u u d x ϵ 2 ϵ 1 d d x ϵ 3 ϵ 2 d h s x ϵ 2 2 3 q b d x ϵ 3 ϵ 2 q b h s x ϵ 2 2 ϵ 3 2 6 ϵ 1 d 2 h s x h s x x 1 ϵ 3 d 2 d x h s x x 0 4 5 w d t ϵ 1 w u d x q b 0 the contributions to the momentum balance in the x and z directions for the case of bed slope α 30 without friction are shown in fig 6 in the x momentum equation 4 2 fig 6a local solid blue line and advective dashed blue line horizontal accelerations are seen to approximately balance each other with a net positive downslope total acceleration this total acceleration is vanished at the tip of the front and it is consistent to our scaling analysis in 4 4 where the ratio of horizontal advection to local acceleration ϵ 1 raise to o 1 since the slide surface elevation varies most at the front the hydrostatic solid red line and non hydrostatic dashed red line pressure forcings are of opposite sign but with the hydrostatic forcing being about four times larger and thus dominant the partial cancellation provided by the non hydrostatic component accounts for the slower down slope motion of the slide shown in fig 4 both hydrostatic pressure and non hydrostatic pressure drop to zero at the front tip but the hydrostatic pressure drops faster because the ratio of non hydrostatic pressure to hydrostatic pressure ϵ 1 rises in the slide front region the dispersion correction term in 4 2 as shown in fig 6c is small and does not contribute significantly to the motion of the slide front as a second order term of the bed slope when slope becomes steeper this term will be more important contributions to the vertical momentum balance including local acceleration blue line advective acceleration dashed blue line and resulting value of q b dashed red line are shown in fig 6b as was seen in the horizontal direction the two components of the acceleration nearly balance at the leading edge of the slide the advective component drops to zero at a distance behind the slide front leading to a non hydrostatic pressure q b that is determined completely by the local acceleration as is typically assumed in most depth integrated non hydrostatic models our scaling analysis in 4 5 indicates that the vertical advective acceleration is first order term of ϵ 1 representing vertical variation of slide surface to the slide depth close to front where ϵ 1 is of o 1 the neglect of the advective term would lead to a pronounced over estimate of the non hydrostatic pressure contribution this effect accounts for the evolution of the pronounced bulge shown if fig 5 it is also important to include local and advective acceleration terms and non hydrostatic pressure when using 3 18 to compute the solid effective stress τ e z z in the granular flow model to illustrate this two numerical tests were carried out for a debris flow over a bed with the slope α 30 and bottom friction ϕ b e d 10 with τ e z z computed from 3 18 with or without vertical acceleration effects retained the results of two simulations at t 20 s are compared in fig 7 without the vertical acceleration effect in the determination of solid stresses the slide front moves more slowly than predicted by the analytic solution of mangeney et al 2000 the vertical acceleration reduces the apparent weight of the granular mass and thus the corresponding basal frictional resistance the numerical result from a landslide model based on a slope oriented coordinate ma et al 2015 is included for comparison and agrees well with the present results 5 discussion and conclusions in this paper we proposed a two layer non hydrostatic tsunami wave generation model specified entirely in a cartesian frame referenced to a level surface usually referenced to the still water level the physical principles and governing equations of the lower layer landslide model were discussed the model is derived in cartesian coordinates using either newtonian viscous fluid or granular coulomb friction rheology details of the model numerical implementation together with numerical validation for landslide tsunami cases are presented in the companion paper zhang et al 2021 here we tested the landslide model for dam break cases with steep slopes and the simulation results illustrated some facts in the development of a landslide model on a cartesian coordinate first non hydrostatic pressure plays a key role in the landslide motion on irregular bathymetry with steep slopes because the non hydrostatic pressure in the depth integrated model accounted for the effects of the vertical acceleration second imposing a quadratic profile for non hydrostatic pressure can correct the dispersion property of model and thus the shape of slide front third including vertical advective acceleration is important for the simulation involving steep slopes in bathymetry finally the effect of the total derivative of w and non hydrostatic pressure on solid stresses in the granular model either amplifies or reduces the apparent weight of the landslide mass when the flow is vertically accelerated or decelerated by varying bathymetry the model described here can be further improved in a number of ways sediment erosion and deposition and water entrainment effects are not considered in the model and thus variations of mixture density are not considered closures for erosion rate entrainment rate and varying density will be incorporated in future work at the slide water interface a traction free boundary condition is assumed the effects of interfacial tangential stresses on slide motion will be investigated although these stresses are ignored in many other two layer landslide models jiang and leblond 1992 heinrich et al 2001 ma et al 2015 in addition more slide rheologies should be investigated including non newtonian fluid rheologies such as the bingham and herschel bulkley models the voellmy model that can account for the partial velocity dependent influence on the pore fluid turbulence or the rate dependent friction law μ i rheology model credit

coordinate system x y z as a basis for deriving the solid stress components where x y defines the local tangent plane x is aligned with the local flow direction and z is in the direction of the upward normal vector n relative to the solid substrate a sketch of the coordinates is shown in fig b 1 we define a function f s x y z z h s x y and take the level f s 0 to represent the solid substrate underlying the slide the upward normal n is then given by n f s f s evaluated on f s 0 the unit vectors in the system are given by e 1 u u n b 1 b u u n h s x ξ b v u n h s y ξ b w u n 1 ξ b b 2 e 2 n

c e 1 e 2 e 3 since c is an orthogonal matrix its transpose is equal to its inverse the transformation matrix from local to cartesian coordinates is given by c c 1 c t in the limit of a locally horizontal bottom the coordinate system reverts to the original system with z pointed upwards but with the x y coordinates rotated to align with the local flow in the special case where velocity is

where b 6 b ξ b h h s the transformation matrix c is constructed as in b 4 in the extreme case when both velocity and local bed slope are zero the local coordinate system coincides with the global cartesian system and the transformation matrix in either direction is the unit matrix appendix c transformation of stresses between local and global coordinates appendix b gives the transformation matrix c from a global cartesian coordinate system to local slope and flow oriented coordinates along with the inverse transformation matrix c then we can obtain variables on cartesian local

is again symmetric appendix d 2d anisotropy hypothesis vs 2d isotropy hypothesis to show the advantage of using the 2d anisotropy hypothesis in the granular model we carry out a simulation of the dry granular landslide experiment conducted by gray et al 1999 the numerical implementations of the model are presented in the companion paper zhang et al 2021 this experiment has frequently been used as a benchmark for granular flow modeling over irregular topography gray et al 1999 pirulli et al 2007 chen et al 2006 in the experiment a semi elliptical granular slide was released from rest and rushed down a slope with a parabolic bed topography in the cross slope direction as shown in fig d 1 here the computed edge of the slide is compared to the observed avalanche boundary in the experiment the slide tail moved much slower than the front and the mass elongated into a thin and long shape before final deposition on a horizontal surface at the base of the slope in the simulations the slide properties were set based on the experimental measurements of gray et al 1999 with solid density ρ s 2500 kg m 3 sediment concentration ϕ 60 0 internal angle of friction ϕ i n t 40 and basal angle of friction ϕ b e d 30 the left panel of fig d 2 shows the simulated landslide thickness from the non hydrostatic granular flow model based on the 2d anisotropy hypothesis it can be seen that both the front and tail moved slightly slower than in observations this lag of motion in time also appeared in other model simulations run based on slope oriented or curvilinear coordinates gray et al 1999 pirulli et al 2007 the cause of this problem is very likely that a simple coulomb friction law with a constant bed friction angle is inadequate for representing the more complicated basal friction process gray et al 1999 the landslide motions from the non hydrostatic granular flow model with 2d isotropy hypothesis are shown in right panel of fig d 2 which illustrates a wider spread out of the front in the cross slope direction than for the earlier simulations shown in the left panel as a result the slide deposit on the flat run out zone is thinner and covers a larger area comparing the computed edge of slide to the experimental observations the 2d anisotropy hypothesis produced a better deposit shape 
23918,in situ ocean wave observations are critical to improve model skill and validate remote sensing wave measurements historically such observations are extremely sparse due to the large costs and complexity of traditional wave buoys and sensors in this work we present a recently deployed network of free drifting satellite connected surface weather buoys that provide long dwell coverage of surface weather in the northern pacific ocean basin to evaluate the leading order improvements to model forecast skill using this distributed sensor network we implement a widely used data assimilation technique and compare forecast skill to the same model without data assimilation even with a basic assimilation strategy as used here we find remarkable improvements to forecast accuracy from the incorporation of wave buoy observations with a 27 reduction in root mean square error in significant waveheights overall for an extreme event where forecast accuracy is particularly relevant we observe considerable improvements in both arrival time and magnitude of the swell on the order of 6 h and 1 m respectively our results show that distributed ocean networks can meaningfully improve model skill at extremely low cost refinements to the assimilation strategy are straightforward to achieve and will result in immediate further modelling gains keywords distributed sensor network ocean

moreover the ability to accurately forecast ocean waves is critical for safety at sea coastal protection and recreation and planning of offshore operations consequently the societal and economical

data assimilation da is widely deployed in operational atmospheric weather forecasting systems through variational techniques bannister 2017 the success of da systems in atmospheric modelling is made possible by the considerable amount of daily observational data from land based weather stations weather balloons satellite remote sensing and other observations data assimilation in atmospheric forecasts indirectly also improves ocean models through improved estimates of surface stresses and fluxes for wave models specifically improvements in the surface wind and pressure field will generally also result in higher skill in the wave forecasts if the model is suitably tuned to the wind field this effect can be strong due to the duality of the wave forecasting problem direct improvement of wave forecasts with da is also readily possible but requires an extensive distributed sensor network that provides long dwell and high fidelity wave data to be effective sparsity of high fidelity real time wave data is a core issue for wave assimilation systems buoy networks provide highly accurate estimates of wave field statistics but these networks are sparse due to the costs

forcing field to match the wave field will rapidly return to the state dictated by the forcing on time scales of 1 2 days lionello et al 1992 wittman and cummings 2005 undoing the corrections provided by da in contrast for wave components decoupled from the wind i e swell components the modelling problem is mostly an initial value problem and da corrections to these components retain their memory much longer to overcome some of these difficulties advanced ocean wave da systems have been developed which use partitioning of sea and swell components hanson and phillips 2001 portilla yandún and cavaleri 2016 feedback to atmospheric forcing voorrips et al 1997 aouf et al 2006 and various variational adjoint and adjoint free systems veeramony et al 2010 orzech et al 2013 2016 panteleev et al 2015 the variational approaches such as 3dvar and 4dvar bannister 2017 assume the modelling error is primarily driven by errors in model input e g initial conditions or forcing and attempt to optimize these fields such that the resulting model evolution minimizes some cost function typically a weighted error of the model with regard to the observations the advantage is that the resulting model predictions obey the model dynamics and forecasts tend to be smooth within the 6 hourly variational interval although discontinuities still occur in the transition between forecasts however variational techniques require an iterative solver with the computational effort of each iteration comparable to the complete forward model computational effort further for nonlinear wave models with complex non local operators in spectral space the effort in developing and maintaining an adjoint model is non trivial orzech et al 2013 although these approaches are promising and illustrate the potential of da strategies for ocean waves many have been ineffective or restricted by low computational efficiency as a result to date operational wave models either do not assimilate any data or use a lower cost sequential method in contrast to variational methods sequential methods adapt the model state at a given time to better fit the observed data and subsequently use the updated field as the starting point for a new forecast period lionello et al 1992 voorrips et al 1997 wittman and cummings 2005 sequential methods do not constrain the modified field to ensure the solution fits model physics and consequently smoothness in time of the forecast is not guaranteed in the current work we present results from a large network of open ocean wave sensors deployed in the pacific ocean and evaluate our ability to improve forecast skill for short range forecasts 1 2 days rather than focus on advanced assimilation strategies this work aims to assess the first order forecasting improvements possible when sufficient data is available to that end we drive a simple sequential optimized interpolation assimilation strategy lionello et al 1992 voorrips et al 1997 wittman and cummings 2005 with the distributed wave buoy network we show that by creating a step function improvement in data density in open ocean regions data assimilation can give immediate improvement in operational wave forecast systems in section 2 we describe the dynamic sensor array in the pacific the wave model is then discussed in section 3 data assimilation strategies are detailed in section 4 and the models and observations compared are described in section 5 after presenting core results in section 6 we highlight the implications of this study in section 7 and discuss how the availability of large distributed networks combined with advances in da strategies can effectively enable considerable improvements to operational wave forecasting 2 distributed sensor network in the northern pacific for increased wave data availability in the northern pacific approximately 129 free drifting directional wave buoys were deployed in the pacific ocean as of january 1 2020 deployments were primarily focused on the northern hemisphere of the basin where approximately 96 units were deployed initial deployments started in december 2018 and continued throughout 2019 with an average of 10 units coming online each month leading to approximately 60 units in july the beginning of our study period ongoing deployments typically focus on filling gaps in the coverage coverage gaps develop mostly as a consequence of the free drifting nature of the buoys which results in a dynamic topology of the network fig 1 all deployed units are sofar spotters an ocean wave wind current sensor that integrates a fast sampling 2 5hz high fidelity motion sensing package onboard analysis and processing for directional wave spectra and surface drift the spotter buoy is compact 38 cm diameter lightweight 5 4 kg and completely solar powered which enables sustained operation without battery replacement units are ballasted with a 60 cm 2 1kg stainless steel ballast chain to enhance drag and reduce wind induced drift spotter reproduces surface motions accurately within a frequency band from 0 03hz up to approximately 1 0hz accuracy in recording displacements is within 2 cm under controlled conditions and validation tests show similar data quality as industry standard wave buoys raghukumar et al 2019 the buoy samples three dimensional displacements and estimates the vertical and horizontal displacement cross spectra over an approximately 1800s period based on windowed fourier estimates window length 102 4s with 50 overlap resulting in 33 ensemble members from the wave spectra standard wave bulk parameters including significant waveheight mean spectral period and mean direction are calculated based on conventional definitions see e g holthuijsen 2007 for descriptions additionally the high frequency tail of the wave spectrum is used to estimate local wind magnitude and direction based on equilibrium theory voermans et al 2020 we consider the period between july 1 st 2019 and december 31 st 2019 while spotters can report complete displacement spectra we only consider available bulk parameters during this period the majority of the units reported data on an hourly interval where each communication packet contained bulk parameters for two half hour windows 3 operational wave model the evolution of wave properties on the ocean is governed by the action balance equation augmented with source terms for generation dissipation and nonlinear distribution of wave energy e g komen et al 1994 holthuijsen 2007 mature operational systems based on this framework are typically based on either the wavewatch 3 model ww3 hereafter tolman 1991 the wavewatch iii development group 2016 as used by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa or the wam model the wamdi group 1988 as used by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf though numerical differences exist both models implement similar physics approximations and both have proven track records in global operational forecasting settings as such either model provides a suitable candidate modelling framework in the present context here we choose to base our wave forecasts on the latest ww3 version version 6 at the time of writing motivated by the community driven open source development of the model 3 1 model configuration wave model performance is dominated by the physics approximations of the various source terms with source term approximations being interdependent calibration is typically performed on the entire set of approximations state of the art source term configurations are typically based on ardhuin et al 2010 and zieger et al 2015 colloquially referred to as st4 and st6 respectively bulk parameters waveheight mean period etc perform similarly between configurations e g stopa et al 2016 liu et al 2019 though spectral shape is improved in st6 liu et al 2019 however st4 has been used operationally over an extensive period providing a robust framework which we can easily inter compare with present operational global noaa forecasts therefore we choose st4 t471 combined with the discrete interaction approximation dia for nonlinear interactions as our baseline system the model is forced with operational wind and ice fields from the national center for environmental prediction ncep global data assimilation system gdas when available i e up to and including a nowcast gdas winds incorporate observations available at forecast time by means of a three dimensional data assimilation system kleist et al 2009 forecasted winds past the nowcast time and ice fields are obtained from the ncep global forecast system gfs bathymetry is derived from the etopo2 database national geophysical data center 2006 the present model does not include effects of meso scale surface currents on the waves model resolution is set to half of a degree for a global domain covering ocean basins between approximately 77 5 and 77 5 degrees latitude time stepping occurs with a global time step of 30 min with sub steps in the fractional step integration sufficiently small to ensure model stability and accuracy specifically 450s for spatial advection 900s for intraspectral propagation and a minimum dynamic source time step of 10s further sub grid features e g small island chains atolls are included as in tolman 2003 frequency direction space is discretized over the full circle with 36 directions and 36 frequencies the directional grid has a constant spacing of 10 whereas the frequency grid is logarithmically distributed with growfactor 1 1 to ensure compatibility with the dia starting from f 1 0 035 hz and ending at f 3 0 98 hz we differ from default st4 configuration values for the wind source proportionality factor β max setting it to β max 1 32 which has been found to improve performance with gfs based surface winds pers comm with pa wittmann otherwise calibration coefficients are kept at default values for physics parameterizations 4 data assimilation in order to focus on evaluation of the impact of a large distributed set of sensors on model forecasts we implement a sequential technique referred to as optimal or statistical interpolation to note optimal interpolation oi corresponds to the analysis step of the kalman filter making an oi based method a natural step prior to an ensemble kalman data assimilation framework in the current framework the gdas wind forecast is used along with the da scheme described below to advance the last known wave state to the zero time model nowcast this produces an analysis field that is used as the initial condition for the forecast runs driven by the gfs wind fields 4 1 optimal interpolation let y obs t y 1 obs y n obs t denote the vector containing n observations of a wave variable from the spotter network at time t located in the pacific at x obs t x 1 obs x n obs t further let y mod t y 1 mod y m mod denote model estimates or prior within model cells centred at x mod finally let y obs and y mod denote the true physical state at observed and modelled locations respectively the expected model error ϵ mod and observation error ϵ obs are assumed zero mean and given by 1 ϵ mod y mod y mod ϵ obs y obs y obs further the difference between model and observation at observed locations often referred to as the innovation in the literature is given by 2 ϵ y obs h y mod ϵ o b s h ϵ mod ϵ int here h is the interpolation matrix that estimates model values at observed locations through bi linear interpolation and the interpolation error ϵ int h y mod y obs is assumed to be small we can then use the innovation to obtain an improved analysis estimate of the target observable on the model grid through the analysis equation 3 y an y mod k ϵ with k the kalman gain matrix and the analysis error as ϵ an y an y mod the kalman gain matrix represents the linear weights that minimize the expected value of the squared sum of the mean analysis error assuming errors are uncorrelated and is given by 4 k c mod h t h c mod h t c obs 1 here c mod and c obs are the background error covariance matrices 5 c mod ϵ mod ϵ mod t c obs ϵ obs ϵ obs t with denoting the expected value 4 2 model state update the analysis field is ideally used directly to correct the model state which in the context of third generation wave models is the frequency direction energy or more specifically action density spectrum e mod f θ x t with f frequency and θ direction however for the period considered here the buoy network only transmitted bulk parameters and as such no spectral shape information was available only mean waveheights period direction and directional width were available to assimilate with model predictions for a sea state comprised only of waves originating from the same storm it is reasonable to retain the local spectral shape and solely scale energy adjust peak location and rotate mean direction to fit local observations and obtain the analysis spectrum portilla yandún and cavaleri 2016 lionello et al 1992 voorrips et al 1997 wittman and cummings 2005 as 6 e an f θ α e mod β f θ δ with 7 α 1 β h s an h s mod 2 β t p an t p mod δ θ mean mod θ mean an and δ as the minimum directional difference on the circle with model winds remaining uncorrected as they are in this scheme any correction to the local spectrum will quickly relax to the forced state for the wind sea for swell corrections are more likely to persist and the largest impact of assimilation is expected for swell just correcting mean energy likely encompasses the largest improvement for mixed seas the bulk parameters alone do not provide sufficient information to correct the individual component systems because we focus primarily on waveheight and we are mostly interested in the potential impact of data assimilation of a large fleet of drifters and not necessarily the best scheme we choose the simplest possible correction correcting the total energy but otherwise setting β 1 and δ 0 wittman and cummings 2005 4 3 background error estimates given the possibly time dependent background error covariance matrices c obs and c mod the kalman gain k represents the weights that minimize the average analysis error in practice however knowledge of the background errors is unavailable and the error covariances have to be estimated to this end we decompose the covariance in terms of error correlation and standard deviation according to 8 c m n mod σ m mod ρ x m x n σ n mod where ρ x m x n is the spatial cross correlation function that effectively prescribes the spatial memory of the system and σ mod is the model error standard deviation the spatial cross correlation depends on local climatology and topography greenslade and young 2004 portilla yandún and cavaleri 2016 and estimating the statistical footprint for the entire pacific basin is non trivial here we assume that ρ is isotropic and homogeneous with stationary statistics such that ρ x m x n ρ x m x n we then parameterize the correlation matrix ρ as 9 ρ m n exp d x m x n λ p following lionello et al 1992 voorrips et al 1997 and greenslade and young 2004 here d x m x n is the great circle distance between points the length scale λ determines the decorrelation scale and the power p determines the peakedness here we set λ 300 km and p 3 2 see appendix a further we assume a constant error variance and set σ m mod σ mod based on comparison between buoys and model nowcasts without data assimilation we set σ mod 0 3 m the homogeneous isotropic and stationary estimate of ρ is a simplification that ignores for instance that higher latitudes tend to experience more severe weather and as a consequence have larger model errors however with the principal aim of gauging the first order effect of data assimilation from a vastly increased supply of data on model fidelity further improved parameter estimates are not pursued in the present work observational error is composed of instrument noise and errors in the statistical estimators of mean wave parameters for well separated observers distances of 10 km or more these errors are unlikely to be correlated between spotters and it is reasonable to assume that c obs is diagonal similar to lionello et al 1992 greenslade and young 2004 and 10 c m n obs σ m obs σ n obs δ m n while instrument noise is constant and small on the order of centimetres for a spotter the statistical sampling error of mean conditions grows with increased sea state energy consequently depending on local conditions regardless we again approximate σ m obs σ obs observational error due to statistical sampling is estimated as the variance between half hourly observations and the corresponding lowpass filtered result i e the 2 h running mean indicating σ obs 0 1 m with these estimates in place we find that the kalman gain k reduces to 11 k ρ h t h ρ h t σ obs σ mod 2 i 1 as a consequence only the relative trust we have in model and observations matters because both observational and model error variances are proportional to the energy in the field we approximate the ratio as a constant σ obs σ mod 0 3 if σ mod changes on a slow scale compared with λ eq 11 approximates the full form of eq 8 and eq 11 applies even if error variances change while this is currently a heuristic approach future development will estimate background errors directly based on observations 4 4 implementation to optimize performance of the oi algorithm we make use of the rapid drop off in correlation with increasing distance between points first ρ is only calculated if x m x n λ 1 3 otherwise ρ 0 is assumed secondly we partition the northern pacific basin into tiles of 30 by 30 degrees resulting in a 4 by 6 grid of tiles to each tile we add a region of 5 degrees on all sides that overlaps with neighbouring tiles to ensure observational data across the boundary can influence the oi result within the tile only the state within the tile boundaries proper is updated under the assumption that observations outside of the 5 degree border do not influence the state within the tile the tiling reduces the number of observation points per tile thus reducing the size of the matrix to be inverted and allows for efficient parallel processing further the size of the covariance matrices which scale with the number of model points squared reduces considerably with these approximations the algorithm is efficient can be applied without significant overhead in an operational setting and is expected to scale well with increased buoy density as the network scales once the analysis waveheight or energy field is estimated model energies are corrected according to eq 6 specifically the model state at analysis time is written to storage and then modified to fit the analysis estimates of significant waveheight subsequently this estimated new model state serves as the starting state for the next analysis period or forecast 5 models and observations considered to compare model performance with and without data assimilation we consider an analysis of the period from july 1 st 2019 to january 20 th 2020 the analysis is performed using hourly assimilation of data and is forced with gdas wind and ice fields to spin up the global wave model the model simulations are started 14 days prior to july 1 st initialized from a quiescent ocean the 14 days of spinup time are otherwise not used effectively this analysis produces the exact same results as the operational analysis would have if it were operational at the time for verification purposes 13 semi randomly 1 1 buoys were manually selected from an overview map to ensure a verification buoy was present in most sectors of the northern pacific however no effort was made to otherwise influence performance at selected sites selected spotter buoys were excluded from the optimal interpolation fig 1 in parallel with the analysis model a hindcast was performed with the same model setup but excluding data assimilation this allowed for evaluation of differences between a model with and without data assimilation secondarily the hindcast provided a comparison of results from the operational setup and those produced by the wavewatch 3 global model of ncep ncep ww3 hereafter with comparable setup and the same forecast winds results from both models should be similar allowing for minor discrepancies e g nested grids were not considered this comparison indicated that differences between our hindcast and those produced by ncep ww3 are indeed minute therefore differences between the analysis and ncep ww3 are primarily due to data assimilation rather than our ww3 implementation we compare results from the analysis model to ncep ww3 an entirely independent data source in addition to the analysis which evaluates improvements to the nowcast we also investigate the influence on model forecasts to this end we use results from operational forecasts initialized with operational analysis nowcasts that have been running in real time since november 2019 for these forecasts all network buoys are used in the analysis again a model without data assimilation was run in parallel to this forecast model to gauge the impact of the data assimilation forecasts from this model are again interchangeable with ncep ww3 results and we principally compare with ncep ww3 6 results the model predictive accuracy of significant waveheight was improved by assimilation of sensor network data improvements in forecast accuracy were observed for both current sea state estimates and future forecasts with lead times up to four days to estimate model improvement the spotter observations excluded from the data assimilation were compared with model predictions evaluated at that subset of spotter locations compared to the model without data assimilation ncep ww3 the data assimilation model reduced the root mean square error rmse by 27 0 33 m to 0 24 m for all sea states fig 2a b for both models the waveheight error scaled with the waveheight magnitude such that larger waves led to larger errors however the increase in error with waveheight was smaller for the data assimilation model than the model without data assimilation fig 3 that is in energetic sea states with large waves the data assimilation model accuracy exhibited even larger improvements with an rmse reduction of 35 0 77 m to 0 50 m for sea states with waveheights above 5 m similarly the model with data assimilation frequently outperformed the model without data assimilation for forecasts with lead times of 12 24 and 48 h fig 4 the model with data assimilation had a smaller rmse than the model without data assimilation with the largest improvements for shorter lead times fig 5 the accuracy improvement from data assimilation diminished with increasing lead time converging to negligible improvements beyond a four day lead time similar to the nowcast error improvement was even larger for larger waveheights in future forecasts with an error reduction for a lead time of 12 h of 0 14 m for all waves and 0 27 m for waves over 5 m with regard to other wave parameters mean direction mean period directional spread no significant differences are found for either nowcasted or forecasted predictions not shown to note even though only mean energy and not distribution is corrected predicted spectral distributions down wave of buoys can be affected the energy in components originating down wave of assimilation points is modified whereas spectral components originating elsewhere remain unchanged thus affecting the relative contribution of each however this does not appear to significantly alter forecast skill 6 1 december 2019 storm swell in addition to improvements on the majority of point measurements data assimilation exhibited increased accuracy for local waveheight time series prediction where both timing and magnitude is relevant for example on december 25th 2019 an energetic storm system developed in the northwestern pacific about 1000 km off the coast of japan surface winds associated with the storm generated waves up to 30 m in height that subsequently radiated outward across the northern pacific basin fig 6 the model without data assimilation incorrectly predicted the radiation of the swell across the pacific with arrival time errors on the order of 12 h and waveheight errors of 1 2 m fig 7a at early times before the storm swell had propagated substantially outward the model with data assimilation matched the model without data assimilation however several spotters were in the vicinity of the storm with varying radial distance from the primary wave disturbance as the most proximate spotters experienced the storm swell and measured waveheights disparate from model predictions the model with data assimilation was corrected this led to unique and improved forecasts at spotter locations further radially outward from the storm particularly when the forecast lead time allowed for sufficient spotter data to be taken into account this was most notable for spotter 464 fig 7c where the one two and three day forecasts were all consistent and accurate and approximately 0 75 m different from the model without data assimilation for spotter 323 about 2000 km closer to the storm than spotter 464 the initial three day lead time forecast at that location matched the model without data assimilation however as the swell approached the later forecasts with shorter lead times were able to incorporate new data from other spotters and adjust such that the one day lead time forecast was approximately 1 m closer in height and 6 h closer in arrival time to the observed swell than the model without assimilation fig 7 7 discussion in this work we demonstrate how a large distributed sensor network can immediately provide improvements in our wave forecasting systems even with a relatively simple assimilation strategy refinements in the assimilation scheme will immediately result in further improvements this could include improved estimates of the background errors and improved distribution of the innovation over the wave spectrum for example estimates of the background error could account for spatial and seasonal variability and potentially use the partitioned spectrum as the state variable the latter would allow for more elegant distribution of wave energy according to the likelihood of different wave systems e g portilla yandún and cavaleri 2016 further this immediately allows for assimilation of other bulk parameters such as directions and periods the static nature of prescribed error statistics based on long term averages precludes knowledge of uncertainties for a given forecast since short event specific uncertainty contributes strongly to forecasting errors estimating error statistics directly through ensemble forecasts would capture the error of the day statistics more accurately in addition such an ensemble kalman based system would retain memory of uncertainty as the errors are propagated away from the initial storm allowing for more effective correction of swell systems away from the source in the data assimilation schemes discussed the wave field but not the wind field is updated however the wave field is directly influenced by the wind field and therefore errors in the wave field likely signal similar errors in the wind field as a consequence these schemes can improve swell forecasts once the swell is generated initial value problem but are less effective in improving wind sea forecasts specifically if only the initial conditions are modified but the potentially errant driving forces remain the same the corrected initial conditions relax quickly back to the inaccurate state consequently improvements in the wave field dissipate with increasing lead time refining the assimilation to include correction to the wind field such that it is in balance with the local waves at analysis time may improve performance but ultimately improved predictions of sea state will require improved wind forecasts 8 conclusions to demonstrate the value of large and pervasive ocean weather sensors we assimilated a large network of drifting buoys in an operational wave forecast system based on the wavewatchiii model our results show that an efficient sequential assimilation strategy optimized interpolation for bulk wave heights can meaningfully improve wave forecasts while refinements to the assimilation strategy will likely improve model skill considerably this first demonstration illustrates the effectiveness of large distributed sensor networks in constraining the now state and improving model forecast skill comparison of errors across all measurements as well as for a specific storm event in december of 2019 indicated clear improvements resulting from the data assimilation these overall improvements in both waveheight magnitude and swell arrival time particularly for more energetic sea states are invaluable for accurately assessing ocean state with important societal implications safety at sea offshore operations coastal risks the marked improvement in forecasting from the inclusion of ocean observations shows the considerable value of greater ocean data density and the potential of low cost distributed sensor networks

scale sensitivity a gaussian like 2d correlation function ρ of the form ρ m n exp d x m x n λ p has been considered previously lionello et al 1992 breivik and reistad 1994 voorrips et al 1997 greenslade and young 2004 with 1 p 2 and λ o 100 km the power p mostly affects the peakedness whereas λ influences the spatial extent of the gaussian like 2d correlation function sensitivity to p is low not shown and it was therefore set to p 3 2 similar to voorrips et al 1997 to investigate sensitivity to the length scale parameter λ the performance of the optimal interpolation model was evaluated for varying values of λ using a leave one out evaluation metric this evaluation calculates the accuracy of the significant waveheight prediction made for each spotter observer when that observer is excluded from the model s input data for this evaluation nowcast results from the unassimilated ww3 model were used to produce oi results at the excluded spotter locations this metric was calculated for λ values ranging from 100 km to 800 km in 100 km steps fig a 8 shows the mean squared error for the leave one out metric for spotter observations from july 2019 through december 2019 based on the evaluation results the minimum error occurs for λ 500 km this agrees with results of greenslade and young 2004 who found λ 500 km based on satellite altimeter data however this evaluation considers data without sequential updating of the base model results i e assimilation from previous time steps does not influence the result for sequential updates changes are advected downwave of the region of influence likely favouring smaller values of λ for that reason we set λ somewhat conservatively to 300 km a value after the largest decrease in error but before the error function flattens appendix b satellite altimeter comparison satellite altimeter measurements saral https podaac jpl nasa gov were used as an independent data source to validate improvements due to data assimilation utilizing altimeter measurements in the northern pacific in early 2020 significant wave height measured by the altimeter was compared to the wave model with and without data assimilation despite notable noise in altimeter measurements several altimeter points were clearly erroneous further validated by triple collocation with the models and spotter measurements not shown overwhelming the statistics for model error comparisons fig b 9 however with altimeter outliers reporting greater than 3 m difference from both models removed and only considering points where assimilation modified the model field by greater than 0 15 m data assimilation proved to reduce error in the wave model this is indicated in fig b 10 with the root mean square error reduced from 0 45 m to 0 35 m with the utilization of data assimilation 
23918,in situ ocean wave observations are critical to improve model skill and validate remote sensing wave measurements historically such observations are extremely sparse due to the large costs and complexity of traditional wave buoys and sensors in this work we present a recently deployed network of free drifting satellite connected surface weather buoys that provide long dwell coverage of surface weather in the northern pacific ocean basin to evaluate the leading order improvements to model forecast skill using this distributed sensor network we implement a widely used data assimilation technique and compare forecast skill to the same model without data assimilation even with a basic assimilation strategy as used here we find remarkable improvements to forecast accuracy from the incorporation of wave buoy observations with a 27 reduction in root mean square error in significant waveheights overall for an extreme event where forecast accuracy is particularly relevant we observe considerable improvements in both arrival time and magnitude of the swell on the order of 6 h and 1 m respectively our results show that distributed ocean networks can meaningfully improve model skill at extremely low cost refinements to the assimilation strategy are straightforward to achieve and will result in immediate further modelling gains keywords distributed sensor network ocean

moreover the ability to accurately forecast ocean waves is critical for safety at sea coastal protection and recreation and planning of offshore operations consequently the societal and economical impacts of accurate ocean wave prediction is of similar importance to our ability to predict wind over the ocean however the sparsity of open ocean long dwell observation periods much longer than a satellite pass e g sensor networks remains a critical bottleneck on the improvement of current operational wave models either for model validation calibration or augmentation through data assimilation data assimilation da is widely deployed in operational atmospheric weather forecasting systems through variational techniques bannister 2017 the success of da systems in atmospheric modelling is made possible by the considerable amount of daily observational data from land based weather stations weather balloons satellite remote sensing and other observations data assimilation in atmospheric forecasts indirectly also improves ocean models through improved estimates of surface stresses and fluxes for wave models specifically improvements in the surface wind and pressure field will generally also result in higher skill in the wave forecasts if the model is suitably tuned to the wind field this effect can be strong due to the duality of the wave forecasting problem direct improvement of wave forecasts with da is also readily possible but requires an extensive distributed sensor network that provides long dwell and high fidelity wave data to be effective sparsity of high fidelity real time wave data is a core issue for wave assimilation systems buoy networks provide highly accurate estimates of wave field statistics but these networks are sparse due to the costs of deployment and maintenance additionally buoys are usually deployed near the coast on the continental shelf where they have limited value for da forecast systems satellite remote sensing of surface waves has been available increasingly since the 1980s altimeter sar see e g vesecky et al 1981 ribal and young 2019 hasselmann et al 2013 but these estimates carry considerable uncertainty and their spatio temporal sampling characteristics short dwell limit their effectiveness for operational da systems lionello et al 1992 voorrips et al 1997 breivik and reistad 1994 wittman and cummings 2005 more fundamentally a considerable part of the ocean wave field is directly forced by surface winds and near surface pressure fluctuations in the atmosphere i e sea components komen et al 1994 as a result the forecasting problem for wind forced conditions is mostly a forced problem rather than an initial value problem in turn if the wave field is corrected without also correcting the atmospheric

2015 the variational approaches such as 3dvar and 4dvar bannister 2017 assume the modelling error is primarily driven by errors in model input e g initial conditions or forcing and attempt to optimize these fields such that the resulting model evolution minimizes some cost function typically a weighted error of the model with regard to the observations the advantage is that the resulting model predictions obey the model dynamics and forecasts tend to be smooth within the 6 hourly variational interval although discontinuities still occur in the transition between forecasts however variational techniques require an iterative solver with the computational effort of each iteration comparable to the complete forward model computational effort further for nonlinear wave models with complex non local operators in spectral space the effort in developing and maintaining an adjoint model is non trivial orzech et al 2013 although these approaches are promising and illustrate the potential of da strategies for ocean waves many have been ineffective or restricted by low computational efficiency as a result to date operational wave models either do not assimilate any data or use a lower cost sequential method in contrast to variational methods sequential methods adapt the model state at a given time to better fit the observed data and subsequently use the updated field as the starting point for a new forecast period lionello et al 1992 voorrips et al 1997 wittman and cummings 2005 sequential methods do not constrain the modified field to ensure the solution fits model physics and consequently smoothness in time of the forecast is not guaranteed in the current work we present results from a large network of open ocean wave sensors deployed in the pacific ocean and evaluate our ability to improve forecast skill for short range forecasts 1 2 days rather than focus on advanced assimilation strategies this work aims to assess the first order forecasting improvements possible when sufficient data is available to that end we drive a simple sequential optimized interpolation assimilation strategy lionello et al 1992 voorrips et al 1997 wittman and cummings 2005 with the distributed wave buoy network we show that by creating a step function improvement in data density in open ocean regions data assimilation can give immediate improvement in operational wave forecast systems in section 2 we describe the dynamic sensor array in the pacific the wave model is then discussed in section 3 data assimilation strategies are detailed in section 4 and the models and observations compared are described in section 5 after presenting core results in section 6 we highlight the implications of this study in section 7 and discuss how the availability of large distributed networks combined with advances in da strategies can effectively enable considerable improvements to operational wave forecasting 2 distributed sensor network in the northern pacific for increased wave data availability in the northern pacific approximately 129 free drifting directional wave buoys were deployed in the pacific ocean as of january 1 2020 deployments were primarily focused on the northern hemisphere of the basin where approximately 96 units were deployed initial deployments started in december 2018 and continued throughout 2019 with an average of 10 units coming online each month leading to approximately 60 units in july the beginning of our study period ongoing deployments typically focus on filling gaps in the coverage coverage gaps develop mostly as a consequence of the free drifting nature of the buoys which results in a dynamic topology of the network fig 1 all deployed units are sofar spotters an ocean wave wind current sensor that integrates a fast sampling 2 5hz high fidelity motion sensing package onboard analysis and processing for directional wave spectra and surface drift the spotter buoy is compact 38 cm diameter lightweight 5 4 kg and completely solar powered which enables sustained operation without battery replacement units are ballasted with a 60 cm 2 1kg stainless steel ballast chain to enhance drag and reduce wind induced drift spotter reproduces surface motions accurately within a frequency band from 0 03hz up to approximately 1 0hz accuracy in recording displacements is within 2 cm under controlled conditions and validation tests show similar data quality as industry standard wave buoys raghukumar et al 2019 the buoy samples three dimensional displacements and estimates the vertical and horizontal displacement cross spectra over an approximately 1800s period based on windowed fourier estimates window length 102 4s with 50 overlap resulting in 33 ensemble members from the wave spectra standard wave bulk parameters including significant waveheight mean spectral period and mean direction are calculated based on conventional definitions see e g holthuijsen 2007 for descriptions additionally the high frequency tail of the wave spectrum is used to estimate local wind magnitude and direction based on equilibrium theory voermans et al 2020 we consider the period between july 1 st 2019 and december 31 st 2019 while spotters can report complete displacement spectra we only consider available bulk parameters during this period the majority of the units reported data on an hourly interval where each communication packet contained bulk parameters for two half hour windows 3 operational wave model the evolution of wave properties on the ocean is governed by the action balance equation augmented with source terms for generation dissipation and nonlinear distribution of wave energy e g komen et al 1994 holthuijsen 2007 mature operational systems based on this framework are typically based on either the wavewatch 3 model ww3 hereafter tolman 1991 the wavewatch iii development group 2016 as used by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa or the wam model the wamdi group 1988 as used by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf though numerical differences exist both models implement similar physics approximations and both have proven track records in global operational forecasting settings as such either model provides a suitable candidate modelling framework in the present context here we choose to base our wave forecasts on the latest ww3 version version 6 at the time of writing motivated by the community driven open source development of the model 3 1 model configuration wave model performance is dominated by the physics approximations of the various source terms with source term approximations being interdependent calibration is typically performed on the entire set of approximations state of the art source term configurations are typically based on ardhuin et al 2010 and zieger et al 2015 colloquially referred to as st4 and st6 respectively bulk parameters waveheight mean period etc perform similarly between configurations e g stopa et al 2016 liu et al 2019 though spectral shape is improved in st6 liu et al 2019 however st4 has been used operationally over an extensive period providing a robust framework which we can easily inter compare with present operational global noaa forecasts therefore we choose st4 t471 combined with the discrete interaction approximation dia for nonlinear interactions as our baseline system the model is forced with operational wind and ice fields from the national center for environmental prediction ncep global data assimilation system gdas when available i e up to and including a nowcast gdas winds incorporate observations available at forecast time by means of a three dimensional data assimilation system kleist et al 2009 forecasted winds past the nowcast time and ice fields are obtained from the ncep global forecast system gfs bathymetry is derived from the etopo2 database national geophysical data center 2006 the present model does not include effects of meso scale surface currents on the waves model resolution is set to half of a degree for a global domain covering ocean basins between approximately 77 5 and 77 5 degrees latitude time stepping occurs with a global time step of 30 min with sub steps in the fractional step integration sufficiently small to ensure model stability and accuracy specifically 450s for spatial advection 900s for intraspectral propagation and a minimum dynamic source time step of 10s further sub grid features e g small island chains atolls are included as in tolman 2003 frequency direction space is discretized over the full circle with 36 directions and 36 frequencies the directional grid has a constant spacing of 10 whereas the frequency grid is logarithmically distributed with growfactor 1 1 to ensure compatibility with the dia starting from f 1 0 035 hz and ending at f 3 0 98 hz we differ from default st4 configuration values for the wind source proportionality factor β max setting it to β max 1 32 which has been found to improve performance with gfs based surface winds pers comm with pa wittmann otherwise calibration coefficients are kept at default values for physics parameterizations 4 data assimilation in order to focus on evaluation of the impact of a large distributed set of sensors on model forecasts we implement a sequential technique referred to as optimal or statistical interpolation to note optimal interpolation oi corresponds to the analysis step of the kalman filter making an oi based method a natural step prior to an ensemble kalman data assimilation framework in the current framework the gdas wind forecast is used along with the da scheme described below to advance the last known wave state to the zero time model nowcast this produces an analysis field that is used as the initial condition for the forecast runs driven by the gfs wind fields 4 1 optimal interpolation let y obs t y 1 obs y n obs t denote the vector containing n observations of a wave variable from the spotter network at time t located in the pacific at x obs t x 1 obs x n obs t further let y mod t y 1 mod y m mod denote model estimates or prior within model cells centred at x mod finally let y obs and y mod denote the true physical state at observed and modelled locations respectively the expected model error ϵ mod and observation error ϵ obs are assumed zero mean and given by 1 ϵ mod y mod y mod ϵ obs y obs y obs further the difference between model and observation at observed locations often referred to as the innovation in the literature is given by 2 ϵ y obs h y mod ϵ o b s h ϵ mod ϵ int here h is the interpolation matrix that estimates model values at observed locations through bi linear interpolation and the interpolation error ϵ int h y mod y obs is assumed to be small we can then use the innovation to obtain an improved analysis estimate of the target observable on the model grid through the analysis equation 3 y an y mod k ϵ with k the kalman gain matrix and the analysis error as ϵ an y an y mod the kalman gain matrix represents the linear weights that minimize the expected value of the squared sum of the mean analysis error assuming errors are uncorrelated and is given by 4 k c mod h t h c mod h t c obs 1 here c mod and c obs are the background error covariance matrices 5 c mod ϵ mod ϵ mod t c obs ϵ obs ϵ obs t with denoting the expected value 4 2 model state update the analysis field is ideally used directly to correct the model state which in the context of third generation wave models is the frequency direction energy or more specifically action density spectrum e mod f θ x t with f frequency and θ direction however for the period considered here the buoy network only transmitted bulk parameters and as such no spectral shape information was available only mean waveheights period direction and directional width were available to assimilate with model predictions for a sea state comprised only of waves originating from the same storm it is reasonable to retain the local spectral shape and solely scale energy adjust peak location and rotate mean direction to fit local observations and obtain the analysis spectrum portilla yandún and cavaleri 2016 lionello et al 1992 voorrips et al 1997 wittman and cummings 2005 as 6 e an f θ α e mod β f θ δ with 7 α 1 β h s an h s mod 2 β t p an t p mod δ θ mean mod θ mean an and δ as the minimum directional difference on the circle with model winds remaining uncorrected as they are in this scheme any correction to the local spectrum will quickly relax to the forced state for the wind sea for swell corrections are more likely to persist and the largest impact of assimilation is expected for swell just correcting mean energy likely encompasses the largest improvement for mixed seas the bulk parameters alone do not provide sufficient information to correct the individual component systems because we focus primarily on waveheight and we are mostly interested in the potential impact of data assimilation of a large fleet of drifters and not necessarily the best scheme we choose the simplest possible correction correcting the total energy but otherwise setting β 1 and δ 0 wittman and cummings 2005 4 3 background error estimates given the possibly time dependent background error covariance matrices c obs and c mod the kalman gain k represents the weights that minimize the average analysis error in practice however knowledge of the background errors is unavailable and the error covariances have to be estimated to this end we decompose the covariance in terms of error correlation and standard deviation according to 8 c m n mod σ m mod ρ x m x n σ n mod where ρ x m x n is the spatial cross correlation function that effectively prescribes the spatial memory of the system and σ mod is the model error standard deviation the spatial cross correlation depends on local climatology and topography greenslade and young 2004 portilla yandún and cavaleri 2016 and estimating the statistical footprint for the entire pacific basin is non trivial here we assume that ρ is isotropic and homogeneous with stationary statistics such that ρ x m x n ρ x m x n we then parameterize the correlation matrix ρ as 9 ρ m n exp d x m x n λ p following lionello et al 1992 voorrips et al 1997 and greenslade and young 2004 here d x m x n is the great circle distance between points the length scale λ determines the decorrelation scale and the power p determines the peakedness here we set λ 300 km and p 3 2 see appendix a further we assume a constant error variance and set σ m mod σ mod based on comparison between buoys and model nowcasts without data assimilation we set σ mod 0 3 m the homogeneous isotropic and stationary estimate of ρ is a simplification that ignores for instance that higher latitudes tend to experience more severe weather and as a consequence have larger model errors however with the principal aim of gauging the first order effect of data assimilation from a vastly increased supply of data on model fidelity further improved parameter estimates are not pursued in the present work observational error is composed of instrument noise and errors in the statistical estimators of mean wave parameters for well separated observers distances of 10 km or more these errors are unlikely to be correlated between spotters and it is reasonable to assume that c obs is diagonal similar to lionello et al 1992 greenslade and young 2004 and 10 c m n obs σ m obs σ n obs δ m n while instrument noise is constant and small on the order of centimetres for a spotter the statistical sampling error of mean conditions grows with increased sea state energy consequently depending on local conditions regardless we again approximate σ m obs σ obs observational error due to statistical sampling is estimated as the variance between half hourly observations and the corresponding lowpass filtered result i e the 2 h running mean indicating σ obs 0 1 m with these estimates in place we find that the kalman gain k reduces to 11 k ρ h t h ρ h t σ obs σ mod 2 i 1 as a consequence only the relative trust we have in model and observations matters because both observational and model error variances are proportional to the energy in the field we approximate the ratio as a constant σ obs σ mod 0 3 if σ mod changes on a slow scale compared with λ eq 11 approximates the full form of eq 8 and eq 11 applies even if error variances change while this is currently a heuristic approach future development will estimate background errors directly based on observations 4 4 implementation to optimize performance of the oi algorithm we make use of the rapid drop off in correlation with increasing distance between points first ρ is only calculated if x m x n λ 1 3 otherwise ρ 0 is assumed secondly we partition the northern pacific basin into tiles of 30 by 30 degrees resulting in a 4 by 6 grid of tiles to each tile we add a region of 5 degrees on all sides that overlaps with neighbouring tiles to ensure observational data across the boundary can influence the oi result within the tile only the state within the tile boundaries proper is updated under the assumption that observations outside of the 5 degree border do not influence the state within the tile the tiling reduces the number of observation points per tile thus reducing the size of the matrix to be inverted and allows for efficient parallel processing further the size of the covariance matrices which scale with the number of model points squared reduces considerably with these approximations the algorithm is efficient can be applied without significant overhead in an operational setting and is expected to scale well with increased buoy density as the network scales once the analysis waveheight or energy field is estimated model energies are corrected according to eq 6 specifically the model state at analysis time is written to storage and then modified to fit the analysis estimates of significant waveheight subsequently this estimated new model state serves as the starting state for the next analysis period or forecast 5 models and observations considered to compare model performance with and without data assimilation we consider an analysis of the period from july 1 st 2019 to january 20 th 2020 the analysis is performed using hourly assimilation of data and is forced with gdas wind and ice fields to spin up the global wave model the model simulations are started 14 days prior to july 1 st initialized from a quiescent ocean the 14 days of spinup time are otherwise not used effectively this analysis produces the exact same results as the operational analysis would have if it were operational at the time for verification purposes 13 semi randomly 1 1 buoys were manually selected from an overview map to ensure a verification buoy was present in most sectors of the northern pacific however no effort was made to otherwise influence performance at selected sites selected spotter buoys were excluded from the optimal interpolation fig 1 in parallel with the analysis model a hindcast was performed with the same model setup but excluding data assimilation this allowed for evaluation of differences between a model with and without data assimilation secondarily the hindcast provided a comparison of results from the operational setup and those produced by the wavewatch 3 global model of ncep ncep ww3 hereafter with comparable setup and the same forecast winds results from both models should be similar allowing for minor discrepancies e g nested grids were not considered this comparison indicated that differences between our hindcast and those produced by ncep ww3 are indeed minute therefore differences between the analysis and ncep ww3 are primarily due to data assimilation rather than our ww3 implementation we compare results from the analysis model to ncep ww3 an entirely independent data source in addition to the analysis which evaluates improvements to the nowcast we also investigate the influence on model forecasts to this end we use results from operational forecasts initialized with operational analysis nowcasts that have been running in real time since november 2019 for these forecasts all network buoys are used in the analysis again a model without data assimilation was run in parallel to this forecast model to gauge the impact of the data assimilation forecasts from this model are again interchangeable with ncep ww3 results and we principally compare with ncep ww3 6 results the model predictive accuracy of significant waveheight was improved by assimilation of sensor network data improvements in forecast accuracy were observed for both current sea state estimates and future forecasts with lead times up to four days to estimate model improvement the spotter observations excluded from the data assimilation were compared with model predictions evaluated at that subset of spotter locations compared to the model without data assimilation ncep ww3 the data assimilation model reduced the root mean square error rmse by 27 0 33 m to 0 24 m for all sea states fig 2a b for both models the waveheight error scaled with the waveheight magnitude such that larger waves led to larger errors however the increase in error with waveheight was smaller for the data assimilation model than the model without data assimilation fig 3 that is in energetic sea states with large waves the data assimilation model accuracy exhibited even larger improvements with an rmse reduction of 35 0 77 m to 0 50 m for sea states with waveheights above 5 m similarly the model with data assimilation frequently outperformed the model without data assimilation for forecasts with lead times of 12 24 and 48 h fig 4 the model with data assimilation had a smaller rmse than the model without data assimilation with the largest improvements for shorter lead times fig 5 the accuracy improvement from data assimilation diminished with increasing lead time converging to negligible improvements beyond a four day lead time similar to the nowcast error improvement was even larger for larger waveheights in future forecasts with an error reduction for a lead time of 12 h of 0 14 m for all waves and 0 27 m for waves over 5 m with regard to other wave parameters mean direction mean period directional spread no significant differences are found for either nowcasted or forecasted predictions not shown to note even though only mean energy and not distribution is corrected predicted spectral distributions down wave of buoys can be affected the energy in components originating down wave of assimilation points is modified whereas spectral components originating elsewhere remain unchanged thus affecting the relative contribution of each however this does not appear to significantly alter forecast skill 6 1 december 2019 storm swell in addition to improvements on the majority of point measurements data assimilation exhibited increased accuracy for local waveheight time series prediction where both timing and magnitude is relevant for example on december 25th 2019 an energetic storm system developed in the northwestern pacific about 1000 km off the coast of japan surface winds associated with the storm generated waves up to 30 m in height that subsequently radiated outward across the northern pacific basin fig 6 the model without data assimilation incorrectly predicted the radiation of the swell across the pacific with arrival time errors on the order of 12 h and waveheight errors of 1 2 m fig 7a at early times before the storm swell had propagated substantially outward the model with data assimilation matched the model without data assimilation however several spotters were in the vicinity of the storm with varying radial distance from the primary wave disturbance as the most proximate spotters experienced the storm swell and measured waveheights disparate from model predictions the model with data assimilation was corrected this led to unique and improved forecasts at spotter locations further radially outward from the storm particularly when the forecast lead time allowed for sufficient spotter data to be taken into account this was most notable for spotter 464 fig 7c where the one two and three day forecasts were all consistent and accurate and approximately 0 75 m different from the model without data assimilation for spotter 323 about 2000 km closer to the storm than spotter 464 the initial three day lead time forecast at that location matched the model without data assimilation however as the swell approached the later forecasts with shorter lead times were able to incorporate new data from other spotters and adjust such that the one day lead time forecast was approximately 1 m closer in height and 6 h closer in arrival time to the observed swell than the model without assimilation fig 7 7 discussion in this work we demonstrate how a large distributed sensor network can immediately provide improvements in our wave forecasting systems even with a relatively simple assimilation strategy refinements in the assimilation scheme will immediately result in further improvements this could include improved estimates of the background errors and improved distribution of the innovation over the wave spectrum for example estimates of the background error could account for spatial and seasonal variability and potentially use the partitioned spectrum as the state variable the latter would allow for more elegant distribution of wave energy according to the likelihood of different wave systems e g portilla yandún and cavaleri 2016 further this immediately allows for assimilation of other bulk parameters such as directions and periods the static nature of prescribed error statistics based on long term averages precludes knowledge of uncertainties for a given forecast since short event specific uncertainty contributes strongly to forecasting errors estimating error statistics directly through ensemble forecasts would capture the error of the day statistics more accurately in addition such an ensemble kalman based system would retain memory of uncertainty as the errors are propagated away from the initial storm allowing for more effective correction of swell systems away from the source in the data assimilation schemes discussed the wave field but not the wind field is updated however the wave field is directly influenced by the wind field and therefore errors in the wave field likely signal similar errors in the wind field as a consequence these schemes can improve swell forecasts once the swell is generated initial value problem but are less effective in improving wind sea forecasts specifically if only the initial conditions are modified but the potentially errant driving forces remain the same the corrected initial conditions relax quickly back to the inaccurate state consequently improvements in the wave field dissipate with increasing lead time refining the assimilation to include correction to the wind field such that it is in balance with the local waves at analysis time may improve performance but ultimately improved predictions of sea state will require improved wind forecasts 8 conclusions to demonstrate the value of large and pervasive ocean weather sensors we assimilated a large network of drifting buoys in an operational wave forecast system based on the wavewatchiii model our results show that an efficient sequential assimilation strategy optimized interpolation for bulk wave heights can meaningfully improve wave forecasts while refinements to the assimilation strategy will likely improve model skill considerably this first demonstration illustrates the effectiveness of large distributed sensor networks in constraining the now state and improving model forecast skill comparison of errors across all measurements as well as for a specific storm event in december of 2019 indicated clear improvements resulting from the data assimilation these overall improvements in both waveheight magnitude and swell arrival time particularly for more energetic sea states are invaluable for accurately assessing ocean state with important societal implications safety at sea offshore operations coastal risks the marked improvement in forecasting from the inclusion of ocean observations shows the considerable value of greater ocean data density and the potential of low cost distributed sensor networks

scale sensitivity a gaussian like 2d correlation function ρ of the form ρ m n exp d x m x n λ p has been considered previously lionello et al 1992 breivik and reistad 1994 voorrips et al 1997 greenslade and young 2004 with 1 p 2 and λ o 100 km the power p mostly affects the peakedness whereas λ influences the spatial extent of the gaussian like 2d correlation function sensitivity to p is low not shown and it was therefore set to p 3 2 similar to voorrips et al 1997 to investigate sensitivity to the length scale parameter λ the performance of the optimal interpolation model was evaluated for varying values of λ using a leave one out evaluation metric this evaluation calculates the accuracy of the significant waveheight prediction made for each spotter observer when that observer is excluded from the model s input data for this evaluation nowcast results from the unassimilated ww3 model were used to produce oi results at the excluded spotter locations this metric was calculated for λ values ranging from 100 km to 800 km in 100 km steps fig a 8 shows the mean squared error for the leave one out metric for spotter observations from july 2019 through december 2019 based on the evaluation results the minimum error occurs for λ 500 km this agrees with results of greenslade and young 2004 who found λ 500 km based on satellite altimeter data however this evaluation considers data without sequential updating of the base model results i e assimilation from previous time steps does not influence the result for sequential updates changes are advected downwave of the region of influence likely favouring smaller values of λ for that reason we set λ somewhat conservatively to 300 km a value after the largest decrease in error but before the error function flattens appendix b satellite altimeter comparison satellite altimeter measurements saral https podaac jpl nasa gov were used as an independent data source to validate improvements due to data assimilation utilizing altimeter measurements in the northern pacific in early 2020 significant wave height measured by the altimeter was compared to the wave model with and without data assimilation despite notable noise in altimeter measurements several altimeter points were clearly erroneous further validated by triple collocation with the models and spotter measurements not shown overwhelming the statistics for model error comparisons fig b 9 however with altimeter outliers reporting greater than 3 m difference from both models removed and only considering points where assimilation modified the model field by greater than 0 15 m data assimilation proved to reduce error in the wave model this is indicated in fig b 10 with the root mean square error reduced from 0 45 m to 0 35 m with the utilization of data assimilation 
23919,basin scale wind curl anomalies in the north pacific associated with el niño increase westward kuroshio transport in the luzon strait whereas those associated with la niña reduce it however the kuroshio current in the luzon strait is further affected by mesoscale eddies and local wind stress numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the anomalous low level circulation over the philippine sea during el niño weakens the northeasterly monsoon and favors the development of mesoscale eddies at the same time this is caused by the increased baroclinic instability in the subtropical countercurrent stcc north equatorial current region our results are supported by the long term observational data consequently the kuroshio pattern in the luzon strait during el niño tends to be more unsteady during la niña the kuroshio loop is enhanced in response to strengthened northeasterly winds furthermore vorticity stretching caused by local wind stress and associated curl anomalies during la niña contributes to the formation of a cyclonic eddy off the southeastern taiwan keywords kuroshio luzon strait enso mesoscale eddies 1 introduction situated to the south of taiwan the kuroshio forms a loop in the luzon strait accompanying this current the pacific waters intrude into the south china sea scs this is important for the momentum heat and salt budgets of the scs basin kuo and tseng 2020 show that the enhanced kuroshio intrusion during el niño can modulate the upper and middle layer circulation of the northern scs through changes of the planetary vorticity flux input from the luzon strait an enhanced kuroshio intrusion results in stronger eddy activity and more saline water in the northern scs nan et al 2015 similar to the loop current in the gulf of mexico multiple states of the kuroshio have been demonstrated such as penetration into the scs shedding eddies or leaping the gap sheremet and kuehl 2007 kuehl and sheremet 2009 flow pattern dynamics in the luzon strait have been extensively studied assuming a steady state under pv conservation the intruding flow path can be determined by the upstream flow condition flow speed and direction at the entrance of the strait hurlburt and thompson 1980 xue et al 2004 the vorticity balance is dominated by the advection and β terms when the upstream kuroshio speed is small enough allowing β effect to dominate flow motions the kuroshio intrudes westward into the northern scs when the flow inertia is strong enough it leaps across the luzon strait sheremet and kuehl 2007 kuehl and sheremet 2009 the seasonal and intraseasonal variability of the kuroshio intrusion is attributed mainly to monsoon winds westward migrating mesoscale eddies and variation in the north equatorial current nec sun et al 2019 a close relationship has been observed between the east asian monsoon and luzon strait transport into the scs metzger and hurlburt 2001 however wind driven ekman transport is small accounting for less than 10 of all luzon strait transport qu et al 2004 the monsoon winds are believed to alter kuroshio intrusion by changing kuroshio inflow angle or speed kuehl and sheremet 2009 the mesoscale eddies that propagate westward have a substantial influence on kuroshio transport these are generated in the subtropical countercurrent stcc region of the western pacific as a result of baroclinic instability qiu 1999 an anticyclonic cyclonic eddy can considerably increase decrease kuroshio transport east of taiwan chang et al 2018 a cyclonic mesoscale eddy can increase the westward intrusion of the kuroshio loop by reducing the upstream to the west of luzon island flow velocity zheng et al 2011 suggest that eddies with a radius greater than 150 km are strong enough to substantially alter the kuroshio and modify the local circulation pattern because the intruding path of the kuroshio in the luzon strait is strongly correlated with its upstream flow 16 n its interactions with eddies to the east of luzon island have more influence on flow path than interactions in downstream regions chang et al 2015 kuo et al 2017 moreover the seasonal cycle of kuroshio transport in the luzon strait is related to mesoscale eddies lien et al 2014 in terms of interannual timescales the variation in luzon strait transport has been connected with el niño southern oscillation enso in many studies using sverdrup dynamics without considering friction the transport around an island can be estimated from the integration of basin wind stress island rule godfrey 1989 on the basis of this island rule assumption basin scale enso related wind stress anomalies may regulate the interannual variability of luzon strait transport wang et al 2006 suggest that the westerly wind burst in the equatorial pacific greatly influences luzon strait transport during el niño events the kuroshio speed is strongly correlated with the meridional shift of nec bifurcation which is the origin of the kuroshio and mindanao current mc the complicated nec kuroshio and mc system shows strong interannual variation dominated by the enso dynamic kim et al 2004 during el niño the northward shift of the nec bifurcation results in a stronger mindanao dome and weaker kuroshio transport tozuka et al 2002 whereas the situation is reversed during la niña yaremchuk and qu 2004 qu et al 2004 kim et al 2004 suggest that this is mainly due to the westward propagation of upwelling downwelling rossby waves generated by winds in the central equatorial pacific and by an anomalous anticyclone cyclone located in the western north pacific when a warm cold event matures previous studies have primarily focused on the effects of basin scale wind anomalies and remote effects from the tropics however dynamics of the flow pattern in the luzon strait are more complicated than these speculations in addition to the basin scale forcing the enso can substantially influence the regional wind pattern which may further affect the kuroshio in the luzon strait during el niño an anomalous cyclonic gyre in the low level atmosphere is formed north of the equator this is an atmospheric rossby wave response to the heating anomaly in the central equatorial pacific the anomalous northerly to the west of the rossby gyre advects low background moist enthalpy southward creating an anomalous subsidence that further induces this anomalous low level anticyclone over the philippine sea wang et al 2000 li et al 2017 anticyclonic wind anomalies in the western north pacific typically develop rapidly during late autumn and then reach their mature phases in winter december to february the anomalous winds tend to reverse their signs during la niña using a high resolution regional coupled model kuo and tseng 2020 suggest that the anomalous low level anticyclone cyclone during el niño la niña can induce the mesoscale anomalies in the upper scs which can further feedback to the atmosphere through the energy exchange at the air sea interface in the northern scs see their fig 9 the influence of this anomalous low level anticyclone cyclone on the kuroshio loop in the luzon strait has however rarely been investigated using sensitivity experiments we explored the modulation of these enso related wind anomalies on the flow pattern in the luzon strait this is the first high resolution coupled model used to investigate upper ocean variation in this region during enso events as detailed in the result section the influence of the basin scale wind anomaly on kuroshio transport across the luzon strait was initially investigated using the long term observational data i e island rule then the impact of regional wind anomalies on the flow pattern variation of the luzon strait was further examined through sensitivity experiments 2 model and reanalysis data 2 1 model description and numerical experiments the coupled ocean atmosphere wave sediment transport modeling system warner et al 2010 was used in this study this is based on the weather research and forecasting wrf model the regional ocean modeling system roms and the swan simulating waves nearshore model to emphasize the interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere we only coupled ocean and atmosphere components and did not consider wave effects both wrf and roms use two two way nested domains fig 1 the horizontal resolutions for the first outer domain were 36 and 24 km for the wrf model and roms respectively whereas those for the second inner domain were 12 and 9 km respectively a third of the first domain vertically 36 and 25

boundary conditions updated every 10 days since our model grids topography and the atmospheric forcing are different from those used in the hycom gravity waves may be generated during the adjustment process the coupled model effectively reaches its quasi equilibrium state within a few days because of the small region and the low frequency update of the lateral boundary condition this is confirmed by the time series of volume averaged kinetic energy within the 9km inner domain figure not shown we chose two strongest enso events in the decaying phases in recent years i e 2015 16 el niño and 2011

conducted to examine the different impacts of enso on the kuroshio intrusion into the luzon strait table 1 exp 1a used 2011 12 wrf atmospheric forcing to drive 2015 16 ocean conditions exp 1b used 2015 16 wrf atmosphere forcing to drive 2011 12 ocean conditions to avoid the ocean feedback that would further modify the atmospheric conditions the wrf model is forced by the same reference sst 6 hourly ncep fnl data in exp 0 and exp 1 and therefore the atmospheric forcing used to force the roms are essentially identical between exp 0 and exp 1 2 2 observation and reanalysis data to characterize the effects of basin scale wind anomalies on the kuroshio intrusion in the luzon strait 0 25 global monthly 10 m winds were retrieved from vector wind analyses using the cross calibrated

zonal and meridional geostrophic velocities respectively as estimated from the coriolis f and pressure balance of ssh anomalies hwang et al 2004 3 results 3 1 basin scale forcing associated with enso metzger and hurlburt 1996 suggest that the mean kuroshio intrusion in the luzon strait is primarily a function of pacific basin scale forcing and model geometry in the sulu sea the luzon strait mindoro strait and sibutu strait in the sulu sea in the vicinity of the philippines make it a geometrically isolated island in the pacific qu et al 2000 godfrey 1989 calculated the alongshore pressure gradient that drives model geostrophic western boundary currents against friction using sverdrup theory i e the island rule the island rule is derived from the momentum balance between vorticity input by wind curl the flux of planetary vorticity and frictional dissipation along the western boundary using the continuity equation the island rule expresses the circulation around an island in terms of wind stress 1 t 0 1 f d f a a b c d τ l ρ 0 d l monthly 10 m winds ccmp version 2 0 and eq 1 are used to estimate luzon strait transport based on sverdrup dynamics with negligible friction godfrey

large and pond 1981 the locations of a to d are shown in fig 2a ab and cd are located along 4 75 n and 18 75 n respectively the interannual changes of t 0 relate more closely to the wind variation along ab and cd than along bc and da wang et al 2006 when el niño is developing westerly and easterly anomalies in the central and eastern region along ab and easterly anomalies along cd considerably modify t 0 in eq 1 wang et al 2006 found that these basin scale wind anomalies modify the kuroshio transport lead the nino3 4 index by 6 months suggesting the role of summer t 0 on the mature of enso

months of november february during the el niño warm phase an anticyclone and a cyclone are formed in the western and central tropical northern pacific respectively these are the typical el niño matured features tseng et al 2017 fig 2b further shows the winter variation of t 0 from 1989 to 2016 mean water transport is approximately 10 3 sv with a standard deviation of 2 7 sv the simultaneous

insignificant approximately 0 23 however the correlation was significantly increased after 2000 correlation 0 55 significant at 95 confidence hu et al 2017 suggested that a northwestward shift of air sea coupling is associated with bjerknes feedback bjerknes 1969 after 2000 which results from enhanced ocean atmosphere coupling in the northern hemisphere ding et al 2017 hu and fedorov 2018 bjerknes feedback is a positive feedback from large scale oceanic and atmospheric circulations over the tropical pacific these consistencies confirm that the northward shift of zonal wind anomalies associated with sst coupling caused most of the enso warm events after 2000 and enhanced the relationship between enso and luzon strait transport estimated by the island rule which is based on the region abcd we note that the island rule assumes a steady state and idealized ocean however in reality kuroshio intrusion is unsteady metzger and hurlburt 2001 and fully nonlinear which means that other dynamic effects such as mesoscale eddies are far from negligible 3 2 numerical model results 3 2 1 difference in low level atmospheric condition between el niño and la niña fig 3a shows the modeled low level winds black vectors and sea level pressure shading during the 2015 16 el niño winter november february superimposed by the ncep reanalysis the modeled pattern is similar to the ncep reanalysis except that in this case the modeled sea level pressure is slightly higher in the northern region 22 n fig 3b shows the average winter difference between the 2015 16 el niño and the 2011 12 la niña anomalous high pressure associated with an anticyclonic circulation occurs around the scs and east of the philippines in the luzon strait the anomalous southwesterly weakens the typical northeasterly monsoon this is a general feature in all enso years the composite difference in sea level pressure from six recent enso years el niño 2006 2009 2015 la niña 2007 2010 2011 is also superimposed in fig 3c blue contours and shows similarly anomalous high pressure sverdrup dynamics suggest that anomalous winds in the northwestern pacific can modify the western boundary current speed and change the kuroshio state in the luzon strait accordingly the wind vector time series at the center of the luzon strait is presented in fig 3e these confirm that the northeasterly monsoon is larger during la niña than el niño especially during december to february moreover the northeasterly wind is relatively steady during la niña whereas the wind direction changes rapidly during el niño this large variation suggests an increase in the occurrence of inertial motions in the ocean 3 2 2 the ocean responses fig 4 compares the 0 50 m monthly mean current pattern in the luzon strait in november the current speed shaded in fig 4 is weaker and the westward kuroshio intrusion is more considerably during el niño exp 0a this intrusion is then enhanced until january regardless of enso phase exp 0a and exp 0b during la niña exp 0b the current off southeastern taiwan exhibits a cyclonic circulation that is commonly observed in winter hsin et al 2010 and driven by the northeast monsoon in exp 1a the 2011 12 atmospheric condition i e la niña atmospheric condition was used to drive the 2015 16 ocean initial and boundary conditions used in exp compared with exp 0a exp 1a shows a stronger kuroshio current speed and enhanced intrusion into the scs see fig 4a this results directly from stronger monsoon wind forcing i e fig 3c that enhances the kuroshio loop kuehl and sheremet 2009 under both the influence of mesoscale eddy and strong wind forcing the loop current severely deformed and an anticyclonic eddy was shed from the kuroshio current fig 4k l on the other hand in exp 1b the 2015 16 atmospheric condition was used el niño atmospheric condition to drive the 2011 12 ocean initial and boundary conditions the cyclonic circulation off the southeastern coast of taiwan shown in fig 4g h is now absent this cyclonic circulation is discussed further in the next section additionally a leaping current replaces the loop current in the luzon strait during february associated with an enhanced anticyclonic eddy will be shown in the following accompanying a stronger upstream kuroshio off the eastern and northeastern coast of luzon island the 0 50 m current speed monthly variance in exp 0 is further compared in fig 5 current speed monthly variance s u 2 v 2 u u u v v v u u and v v are the daily and monthly mean velocity respectively as expected the monthly variance in the luzon strait is much weaker during la niña the locations of monthly maximum velocity variance also differ in these enso years during el niño the upstream kuroshio variation is prominent in december as a result of which the loop current becomes unsteady in the ensuing months during la niña the current state off southeastern taiwan significantly changes from january to february fig 5b as the cyclonic circulation forms to further investigate the relevant flow dynamics in the luzon strait fig 6 compares the zonal momentum budget at 10 m depth in the strait 20 n 120 5 e during january to february both exp 0a and exp 0b show an enhanced kuroshio loop and unsteady features the zonal momentum equation is as follows 2 u t t e n d e n c y u u a d v e c t i o n f v c o r i o l i s 1 ρ 0 p x p g f z k m v u z v e r t i c a l d i f f u s i o n where k m v is the vertical viscosity coefficient the horizontal diffusion is negligible the ageostrophic velocity component is represented by the summation of the coriolis and pressure gradient force pgf terms our analysis suggests that the advection term dominates the variation in zonal ageostrophic velocity more frequently in exp 0a fig 6a whereas the diffusion term dominates the momentum variation in exp 0b fig 6b this infers that upstream kuroshio variation or eddy activities dominate momentum change during el niño exp 0a whereas wind stress forcing dominates during la niña exp 0b this is consistent with the local wind difference shown in fig 3e the local wind during la niña is much stronger and steadier in exp 1a fig 6c the diffusion term shows a more dominant role comparing to exp 0a due to a stronger and steadier local wind during the la niña in exp 1b fig 6d the advection term is enhanced especially during jan feb implying a more unsteady condition due to the nonlinear interactions between the mean flow and perturbations to show upstream kuroshio variation and the zonally propagating features that play an important role in the luzon strait flow pattern we present a hovmöller diagram of meridional velocity and relative vorticity averaged between 16 and 20 n in fig 7 the kuroshio is located around 122 e to 123 e in the case of an el niño event exp 0a the upstream kuroshio speed greatly increases during december due to propagating eddies rossby waves the westward propagating features mesoscale eddies are stronger during el niño than la niña kuroshio speed is significantly modulated by these propagating features in exp 1a the westward propagating signals become weaker under la niña local atmosphere forcing comparing fig 7c with fig 7a and stronger under el niño atmosphere forcing comparing fig 7d with fig 7b to further illustrate the spatial structures of these differences fig 8 compares the 10 day averaged flow field 0 10 m between 2011 12 22 and 2012 1 20 in exp0b and exp1b an anticyclonic circulation appears to the east of luzon in both runs it grows through january and became a stronger eddy during 1 11 1 20 comparing these two runs the circulation speed of the anticyclonic eddies in exp 1b is stronger note that the wind curl difference between exp 1b and exp 0b during this period is positive indicating the vorticity input from wind forcing cannot well explain the enhancement of the anticyclonic eddy we quantify the variations of mesoscale eddies energy using eke in these experiments as expect the upper 50 m mean eke for the region of 16 20 n and 124 e 128 e table 1 in exp0a 502 cm2 s2 is much larger than that in exp 0b 352 cm2 s2 the mean eke in the same region is 465 and 394 cm2 s2 in exp 1a and exp 1b respectively compared to the control runs exp0 when the 2015 16 el niño atmosphere forcing is replaced by the 2011 12 la niña forcing the eke is decreased reversely when the 2011 12 la niña atmosphere forcing is replaced by the 2015 16 el niño forcing the eke is increased these results suggest that anomalous winds in the western north pacific might be responsible for the stronger westward propagating eddy activities to the east of the kuroshio since internal variability commonly exists in the ocean model arising from its nonlinearity penduff et al 2011 particularly in the regions with vigorous mesoscale eddy activities we further perform 8 additional ensemble simulations 2 for each experiment to confirm the model consistency we perturb the initial temperature field at the first model level by a gaussian distributed random number generator mean of zero and standard deviation of 0 5 c table 1 as the independent random noise for the ensembles similar to turner et al 2008 and yin et al 2011 this value of standard deviation is chosen because the remote sensing systems www remss com suggested that the accuracy for the amsr e the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for eos ocean products is approximately 0 5 c and the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr nonlinear sst algorithm nlsst error characteristics is also 0 5 c nalli and smith 1998 these additional ensembles show consistent decrease increase relation discussed earlier table 1 while the internal variability arising from the nonlinearity in ocean is relatively small compared to the difference between exp1 and exp0 figs 4 8 confirm that the flow monthly variance during the el niño is stronger and primarily caused by the oceanic advection associated with mesoscale eddies during the la niña flow monthly variance is mostly caused by local wind stress fig 6 qiu and chen 2010 analyzed long term satellite altimeter data and found that the generation of mesoscale eddies on the stcc region is associated with wind induced convergence that modifies the temperature gradient as well as the vertical shear of the upper ocean current in the frontal region thus the anomalous negative wind curl may enhance mesoscale eddies propagating westward to the east of kuroshio we further explored the impacts of different enso related atmospheric forcing on the upper ocean in two additional experiments long term observation data were also analyzed in the present study to support our conclusions qiu and chen 2010 explained interannual variation in the kinetic energy level of eddies in the stcc band 18 n 25 n based on varying surface ekman temperature gradient convergence g t v e k g y where g is the meridional temperature gradient t y and v e k τ x ρ f h is the meridional ekman velocity according to 2011 12 initial ocean and boundary conditions el niño related anomalous winds i e atmospheric low level anticyclonic high pressure anomalies in the philippine sea exp 1b alter the thermocline slope leading to increased baroclinic instability in the stcc nec region hence the eddies in exp1b are stronger than those caused by the 2011 12 la niña atmospheric forcing in exp 0b this is supported by fig 9 a which shows that isotherms in the front zone 16 n 22 n zonally averaged between 124 e and 126 e become steeper in exp 1b compared with exp 0b the temperature difference between exp 0b and exp 1b is also shaded cooling occurred at the cold side of the front with a larger change from 0 to 100 m this caused the isotherms between 17 n and 20 n to tilt upward 0 to 200 m similar characteristics to figs 7 9 can be found in the additional ensemble mean see the appendix to further support the thermocline change in the front region shown in fig 9 a the heat budget eq 3 difference between exp 1b and exp 0b is plotted in fig 9 b this is averaged between 0 and 200 m in the front zone region where cooling occurs with the tilted isotherms shown in fig 10 a 3 t t u t x v t y w t z z k t z a h t 0 the budget is primarily dominated by the horizontal advection which is caused by the anomalous ekman transport associated with easterly wind anomalies the vertical diffusion is mostly positive the reduced wind speed in exp 1b compared with exp 0b associated with anticyclonic circulation anomalies fig 3b causes smaller upward latent heat flux in the ocean surface and weaker subsurface turbulent mixing in summary the above heat budget analysis shows that the anomalous winds rather than the surface heat fluxes dominate the isotherm tilting process in the upper ocean chow et al 2017 the wind anomalies associated with el niño induce ekman convergence which enhances the horizontal temperature gradient in this region strengthening velocity shear and baroclinic instability on the basis of the simple linear theory of baroclinic instability phillips 1954 the stable condition for a two layer model is δ u 2 β 0 g h f 0 2 where δ u is the velocity shear between the two layers f 0 and β 0 are the coriolis and beta parameters in the beta plane approximation h is the total water depth and g is the reduced gravity the upward tilting of the isotherms in the front region 17 5 21 n in exp 1b compared with exp 0b indicate a stronger current shear moreover greater cooling occurred in the upper layers 0 to 100 m than in the lower layers 100 to 200 m fig 10 a this suggests a weaker density difference between the upper and lower layers and thus a smaller rossby deformation radius in exp1b these differences can lower the baroclinic unstable condition criteria and effectively enhance baroclinic instability to generate more mesoscale eddies chow et al 2017 fig 10 a shows the composite of isotherm averaged between 124 e and 126 e during 8 enso events el niño 1997 98 2002 03 2009 10 2015 16 la niña 1999 00 2007 08 2010 11 2011 12 using the hycom reanalysis data gofs 3 1 the results confirm that the meridional temperature gradient is larger during el niño our model results suggest that the anomalous local wind stress may contribute to this difference however it requires further study for possible remote effects and is beyond the scope of this work fig 10b shows the differences in meridional gradient of v e k between exp 0a and exp 0b exp 0a exp 0b in the western pacific positive values to the south of 17 n and negative between 17 n 20 n respectively this implies the spatially varying impacts of the anomalous wind forcing on the ocean thermal structure consistent with previous studies in terms of different enso effects on the stcc 3 2 3 analysis of observational data and other indices white et al 1978 found that interannual variation of the subtropical front associated with the stcc is linked to enso signals however qiu and chen 2010 found that rather than the niño 3 4 index the negative west pacific teleconnection wp index correlated better with ekman forcing over the stcc during the negative phase of the wp pattern anomalous low pressure increases ekman transport convergence in the stcc band which causes an enhanced thermocline tilt of the stcc variation of kuroshio in the luzon strait due to mesoscale eddies greatly depends on location of interaction between the kuroshio and eddies when this occurs in the upstream region i e to the east of luzon island the kuroshio state can change drastically from leaping to looping or eddy shedding however when the eddy kuroshio interaction occurs in the northern half of the luzon strait or to the east of taiwan the kuroshio state in the luzon strait is less influential kuo et al 2017 therefore an enso related anomalous low level anticyclone cyclone located in the philippine sea or eastern scs region may play an important role in kuroshio variation in the luzon strait due to the impingement of westward migration mesoscale eddies to confirm these modeled features fig 11 shows long term mean surface eke november to february based on the hycom ncoda global 1 12 reanalysis niño3 4 index was significantly correlated with the mean surface eke anomalies in the region to the east of luzon 14 20 n 125 140 e correlation coefficient 0 48

data fig 12 the correlation coefficient is significantly higher to the east of luzon island 0 55 significant at the 95 confidence than east of taiwan correlation coefficient 0 32 in the aviso data on the other hand the pto index chang and oey 2012 directly associated with the wind stress curl changes in the western north pacific seems to correlate better with the eke east of taiwan correlation coefficient 0 45 significant at the 95 confidence than to the east of luzon island correlation coefficient 0 31 insignificant at approximately 6 9 months lead time fig 11 march to june average is superimposed this is also confirmed in fig 12 but the correlation is lower chang and oey 2012 showed that positive pto connects well with the larger eke in the region of 123 140 e and 18 25 n correlation coefficient 0 76 their fig 1a northern displacement of nec and the larger kuroshio intrusion into the scs the inconsistent relationship of the eke with pto and enso is unclear but may be due to the different active regions of the wind stress anomalies the winds associated with pto are around 140 180 e while the enso related anomalous low level anticyclone locates further southwestward and is closer to the luzon and the south china sea region 3 2 4 cyclonic circulation off the southeastern taiwan coast fig 13 shows the wind curl difference contours and 0 50 m averaged vorticity difference shading between el niño exp 0a and la niña exp 0b except for the southwest coast of taiwan the wind stress curl during winter in the vicinity of taiwan is generally positive jan et al 2015 the wind curl difference shows a different spatial distribution from the typical winter pattern suggesting a reduced vorticity input from wind stress forcing during el niño in the vicinity of the southwestern coast of taiwan the sign for wind curl difference is the same as that for upper ocean vorticity difference confirming the contribution of vorticity input from the atmospheric winds to the ocean in the case of la niña cyclonic circulation to the southeast of taiwan appears in january the generation or maintenance of which is assisted by concurrent negative wind curl anomalies this cyclonic circulation is absent in exp 1b fig 8 but present in exp 0b fig 5 the atmospheric wind differences are responsible for this absence fig 14 shows the upper 50 m vorticity budget eq 1 during january in exp 0b the dominant terms are stretching and advection the meridional and zonal advection terms almost balance each other consequently the wind induced local flow convergence increases the stretching term and development of cyclonic circulation in addition to the local wind effect an enhanced and steady kuroshio loop associated with the la niña wind anomaly results in stronger eastward current off the southern tip of taiwan that can strengthens the horizontal convergence the stretching term 4 ζ t t e n d e n c y u ζ x z o n a l a d v v ζ x m e r i d i o n a l a d v ζ f u s t r e t c

occur in the equatorial pacific wang et al 2006 suggested that these basin scale wind anomalies modify the kuroshio transport through the sverdrup dynamic and the basin scale winds driven luzon strait transport anomaly is found leading the niño3 4 index by 6 months using the island rule godfrey 1989 we confirmed that the simultaneous connection between winter matured enso index and the winter kuroshio intrusion was significantly increased after 2000 possibly explained by the northwestward shift of air sea coupling after 2000 which results mainly from the enhanced ocean atmosphere coupling in the northern hemisphere in addition an anomalous anticyclone over the south china sea and philippine sea rapidly develops in late autumn and then matures in winter during enso events these regional wind anomalies further modulate the kuroshio in the luzon strait on the top of the basin scale wind background effects model sensitivity experiments show that during el niño westward propagating mesoscale eddies to the east of kuroshio are enhanced due to increased baroclinic instability caused by the ekman convergence in the front zone and a weaker density difference vertically that lowers the baroclinic unstable condition criteria in the meantime the anomalous southwesterly in the luzon strait weakens the typical northeasterly monsoon consequently the kuroshio pattern in the luzon strait during el niño tends to be more unsteady during la niña the kuroshio loop is enhanced in response to the strengthened northeasterly winds these enhanced wind stresses and the associated wind stress curl favor the development of a cyclonic eddy off the southeastern taiwan overall the basin scale wind anomalies induce the oceanic responses mainly sverdrup dynamics resulting in the change of luzon strait transport associated with rossby waves generated during the adjustment process the regional anticyclonic wind anomalies produce horizontal convergence in the frontal region which further enhances baroclinic instability the former process i e basin scale wind anomalies is barotropic and can be approximately as the steady state however the latter process regional anticyclonic wind anomalies is baroclinic which includes strong nonlinearity that can only be resolved in the high resolution model simulation in the present study we focus on the direct ocean response to different atmospheric forcing associated with enso events in our sensitivity experiments the local air sea interaction is simplified to a one way process that excludes the influence of ocean feedback the feedback to the atmosphere resulting from the oceanic response may introduce complexity kuo and tseng 2020 specifically the strong nonlinearity associated with the ocean mesoscale feature may force the above atmosphere through the air sea heat exchange process consequently the resulting modulation of the low level atmosphere may not be negligible further study to assess the contribution of this ocean feedback is required in the follow up study credit authorship contribution statement yi chun kuo formal analysis methodology writing original draft yu heng tseng conceptualization methodology

experiments varied from 9cm2 s2 to 34 cm2 s2 table 1 with an averaged difference of 16 6 cm2 s2 these values are smaller than the deviations from the unperturbed experiment for exp0b and exp1b both having the same 2011 12 roms i c 2011 12 showing the intrinsic internal variability associated with the initial perturbation is smaller than the forced dynamics as expected figs a 1 a 3 show very similar results to the corresponding figs 7 9 based on the perturbed initial condition experiments note that the intensity difference of the westward propagating signals between exp0a and exp1a is not clear this suggests the initial perturbation may interact with the wind forcing effects with similar magnitudes however the larger mean eke and vertical thermal profile changes between exp0a and exp1a confirm the stronger baroclinic instability under the wind forcing change 
23919,basin scale wind curl anomalies in the north pacific associated with el niño increase westward kuroshio transport in the luzon strait whereas those associated with la niña reduce it however the kuroshio current in the luzon strait is further affected by mesoscale eddies and local wind stress numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the anomalous low level circulation over the philippine sea during el niño weakens the northeasterly monsoon and favors the development of mesoscale eddies at the same time this is caused by the increased baroclinic instability in the subtropical countercurrent stcc north equatorial current region our results are supported by the long term observational data consequently the kuroshio pattern in the luzon strait during el niño tends to be more unsteady during la niña the kuroshio loop is enhanced in response to strengthened northeasterly winds furthermore vorticity stretching caused by local wind stress and associated curl anomalies during la niña contributes to the formation of a cyclonic eddy off the southeastern taiwan keywords kuroshio luzon strait enso mesoscale eddies 1 introduction situated to the south of taiwan the kuroshio forms a loop in the luzon strait accompanying this current the pacific waters intrude into the south china sea scs this is important for the momentum heat and salt budgets of the scs basin kuo and tseng 2020 show that the enhanced kuroshio intrusion during el niño can modulate the upper and middle layer circulation of the northern scs through changes of the planetary vorticity flux input from the luzon strait an enhanced kuroshio intrusion results in stronger eddy activity and more saline water in the northern scs nan et al 2015 similar to the loop current in the gulf of mexico multiple states of the kuroshio have been demonstrated such as penetration into the scs shedding eddies or leaping the gap sheremet and kuehl 2007 kuehl and sheremet 2009 flow pattern dynamics in the luzon strait have been extensively studied assuming a steady state under pv conservation the intruding flow path can be determined by the upstream flow condition flow speed and direction at the entrance of the strait hurlburt and thompson 1980 xue et al 2004 the vorticity balance is dominated by the advection and β terms when the upstream kuroshio speed is small enough allowing β effect to dominate flow motions the kuroshio intrudes westward into the northern scs when the flow inertia is strong enough it leaps across the luzon strait sheremet and kuehl 2007 kuehl and sheremet 2009 the seasonal and intraseasonal variability of the kuroshio intrusion is attributed mainly to monsoon winds westward migrating mesoscale eddies and variation in the north equatorial current nec sun et al 2019 a close relationship has been observed between the east asian monsoon and luzon strait transport into the scs metzger and hurlburt 2001 however wind driven ekman transport is small accounting for less than 10 of all luzon strait transport qu et al 2004 the monsoon winds are believed to alter kuroshio intrusion by changing kuroshio inflow angle or speed kuehl and sheremet 2009 the mesoscale eddies that propagate westward have a substantial influence on kuroshio transport these are generated in the subtropical countercurrent stcc region of the western pacific as a result of baroclinic instability qiu 1999 an anticyclonic cyclonic eddy can considerably increase decrease kuroshio transport east of taiwan chang et al 2018 a cyclonic mesoscale eddy can increase the westward intrusion of the kuroshio loop by reducing the upstream to the west of luzon island flow velocity zheng et al 2011 suggest that eddies with a radius greater than 150 km are strong enough to substantially alter the kuroshio and modify the local circulation pattern because the intruding path of the kuroshio in the luzon strait is strongly correlated with its upstream flow 16 n its interactions with eddies to the east of luzon island have more influence on flow path than interactions in downstream regions chang et al 2015 kuo et al 2017 moreover the seasonal cycle of kuroshio transport in the luzon strait is related to mesoscale eddies lien et al 2014 in terms of interannual timescales the variation in luzon strait transport has been connected with el niño southern oscillation enso in many studies using sverdrup dynamics without considering friction the transport around an island can be estimated from the integration of basin wind stress island rule godfrey 1989 on the basis of this island rule assumption basin scale enso related wind stress anomalies may regulate the interannual variability of luzon strait transport wang et al 2006 suggest that the westerly wind burst in the equatorial pacific greatly influences luzon strait transport during el niño events the kuroshio speed is strongly correlated with the meridional shift of nec bifurcation which is the origin of the kuroshio and mindanao current mc the complicated nec kuroshio and mc system shows strong interannual variation dominated by the enso dynamic kim et al 2004 during el niño the northward shift of the nec bifurcation results in a stronger mindanao dome and weaker kuroshio transport tozuka et al 2002 whereas the situation is reversed during la niña yaremchuk and qu 2004 qu et al 2004 kim et al 2004 suggest that this is mainly due to the westward propagation of upwelling downwelling rossby waves generated by winds in the central equatorial pacific and by an anomalous anticyclone cyclone located in the western north pacific when a warm cold event matures previous studies have primarily focused on the effects of basin scale wind anomalies and remote effects from the tropics however dynamics of the flow pattern in the luzon strait are more complicated than these speculations in addition to the basin scale forcing the enso can substantially influence the regional wind pattern which may further affect the kuroshio in the luzon strait during el niño an anomalous cyclonic gyre in the low level atmosphere is formed north of the equator this is an atmospheric rossby wave response to the heating anomaly in the central equatorial pacific the anomalous northerly to the west of the rossby gyre advects low background moist enthalpy southward creating an anomalous subsidence that further induces this anomalous low level anticyclone over the philippine sea wang et al 2000 li et al 2017 anticyclonic wind anomalies in the western north pacific typically develop rapidly during late autumn and then reach their mature phases in winter december to february the anomalous winds tend to reverse their signs during la niña using a high resolution regional coupled model kuo and tseng 2020 suggest that the anomalous low level anticyclone cyclone during el niño la niña can induce the mesoscale anomalies in the upper scs which can further feedback to the atmosphere through the energy exchange at the air sea interface in the northern scs see their fig 9 the influence of this anomalous low level anticyclone cyclone on the kuroshio loop in the luzon strait has however rarely been investigated using sensitivity experiments we explored the modulation of these enso related wind anomalies on the flow pattern in the luzon strait this is the first high resolution coupled model used to investigate upper ocean variation in this region during enso events as detailed in the result section the influence of the basin scale wind anomaly on kuroshio transport across the luzon strait was initially investigated using the long term observational data i e island rule then the impact of regional wind anomalies on the flow pattern variation of the luzon strait was further examined through sensitivity experiments 2 model and reanalysis data 2 1 model description and numerical experiments the coupled ocean atmosphere wave sediment transport modeling system warner et al 2010 was used in this study this is based on the weather research and forecasting wrf model the regional ocean modeling system roms and the swan simulating waves nearshore model to emphasize the interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere we only coupled ocean and atmosphere components and did not consider wave effects both wrf and roms use two two way nested domains fig 1 the horizontal resolutions for the first outer domain were 36 and 24 km for the wrf model and roms respectively whereas those for the second inner domain were 12 and 9 km respectively a third of the first domain vertically 36 and 25 levels were used in the wrf model and roms respectively national centers for environmental prediction ncep final fnl operational model global tropospheric analyses data were used to determine the initial and lateral boundary conditions updated every 6 h for the wrf model the roms uses realistic topography from the etopo2 us department of commerce national oceanic and atmospheric administration national geophysical data center 2006 global 1 12 ocean predictions with the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom or navy coupled ocean data assimilation analysis data were used as initial and lateral boundary conditions updated every 10 days since our model grids topography and the atmospheric forcing are different from those used in the hycom gravity waves may be generated during the adjustment process the coupled model effectively reaches its quasi equilibrium state within a few days because of the small region and the low frequency update of the lateral boundary condition this is confirmed by the time series of volume averaged kinetic energy within the 9km inner domain figure not shown we chose two strongest enso events in the decaying phases in recent years i e 2015 16 el niño and 2011 12 la niña the el niño simulation lasted from november 1 2015 to june 30 2016 exp 0a whereas the la niña simulation lasted from november 1 2011 to june 30 2012 exp 0b two more experiments were conducted to examine the different impacts of enso on the kuroshio intrusion into the luzon strait table 1 exp 1a used 2011 12 wrf atmospheric forcing to drive 2015 16 ocean conditions exp 1b used 2015 16 wrf atmosphere forcing to drive 2011 12 ocean conditions to avoid the ocean feedback that would further modify the atmospheric conditions the wrf model is forced by the same reference sst 6 hourly ncep fnl data in exp 0 and exp 1 and therefore the atmospheric forcing used to force the roms are essentially identical between exp 0 and exp 1 2 2 observation and reanalysis data to characterize the effects of basin scale wind anomalies on the kuroshio intrusion in the luzon strait 0 25 global monthly 10 m winds were retrieved from vector wind analyses using the cross calibrated multi platform ccmp version 2 0 the data are available at www remss com the data period spans from november 1989 to february 2016 in addition the 10 m wind of 0 25 ecmwf era5 reanalysis is used to

ocean shallow coastal areas and the mixed layer chassignet et al 2009 we also used gridded 1 4 1 4 monthly sea level anomalies slas to calculate surface eke the sla data based on the 1993 2012 mean the annual cycle is not removed comes from ssalto duacs multimission altimeter products http www aviso altimetry fr the observed eke was defined as u g 2 v g 2 2 where u g and v g are the anomalies of zonal and meridional geostrophic velocities respectively as estimated from the coriolis f and pressure balance of ssh anomalies hwang et al 2004 3 results 3 1 basin scale forcing associated with enso metzger and hurlburt 1996 suggest that the mean kuroshio intrusion in the luzon strait is primarily a function of pacific basin scale forcing and model geometry in the sulu sea the luzon strait mindoro strait and sibutu strait in the sulu sea in the vicinity of the philippines make it a geometrically isolated island in the pacific qu et al 2000 godfrey 1989 calculated the alongshore pressure gradient that drives model geostrophic western boundary currents against friction using sverdrup theory i e the island rule the island rule is derived from the momentum balance between vorticity input by wind curl the flux of planetary vorticity and frictional dissipation along the western boundary using the continuity equation the island rule expresses the circulation around an island in terms of wind stress 1 t 0 1 f d f a a b c d τ l ρ 0 d l monthly 10 m winds ccmp version 2 0 and eq 1 are used to estimate luzon strait transport based on sverdrup dynamics with negligible friction godfrey 1989 the surface wind stress vector t is calculated using the bulk formula t ρ a c d u 10 u 10 where ρ a is air density u 10 is 10 m height wind speed and c d is the drag coefficient determined by large and pond 1981 the locations of a to d are shown in fig 2a ab and cd are located along 4 75 n and 18 75 n respectively the interannual changes of t 0 relate more closely to the wind variation along ab and cd than along bc and da wang et al 2006 when el niño is developing westerly and easterly anomalies in the central and eastern region along ab and easterly anomalies along cd considerably modify t 0 in eq 1 wang et al 2006 found that these basin scale wind anomalies modify the kuroshio transport lead the nino3 4 index by 6 months suggesting the role of summer t 0 on the mature of enso fig 2a shows winter november february composite zonal wind anomalies in recent six warm and cold enso phases el niño 2006 2009 2015 la niña 2007 2010 2011 hereafter winter is represented based on the months of november february during the el niño warm phase an anticyclone and a cyclone are formed in the western and central tropical northern pacific respectively these are the typical el niño matured features tseng et al 2017 fig 2b further shows the winter variation of t 0 from 1989 to 2016 mean water transport is approximately 10 3 sv with a standard deviation of 2 7 sv the simultaneous winter niño3 4 anomalies 1981 2010 climatology removed are superimposed in fig 2b source https psl noaa gov gcos wgsp timeseries nino34 their simultaneous correlation over the entire period is insignificant approximately 0 23 however the correlation was significantly increased after 2000 correlation 0 55 significant at 95 confidence hu et al 2017 suggested that a northwestward shift of air sea coupling is associated with bjerknes feedback bjerknes 1969 after 2000 which results from enhanced ocean atmosphere coupling in the northern hemisphere ding et al 2017 hu and fedorov 2018 bjerknes feedback is a positive feedback from large scale oceanic and atmospheric circulations over the tropical pacific these consistencies confirm that the northward shift of zonal wind anomalies associated with sst coupling caused most of the enso warm events after 2000 and enhanced the relationship between enso and luzon strait transport estimated by the island rule which is based on the region abcd we note that the island rule assumes a steady state and idealized ocean however in reality kuroshio intrusion is unsteady metzger and hurlburt 2001 and fully nonlinear which means that other dynamic effects such as mesoscale eddies are far from negligible 3 2 numerical model results 3 2 1 difference in low level atmospheric condition between el niño and la niña fig 3a shows the modeled low level winds black vectors and sea level pressure shading during the 2015 16 el niño winter november february superimposed by the ncep reanalysis the modeled pattern is similar to the ncep reanalysis except that in this case the modeled sea level pressure is slightly higher in the northern region 22 n fig 3b shows the average winter difference between the 2015 16 el niño and the 2011 12 la niña anomalous high pressure associated with an anticyclonic circulation occurs around the scs and east of the philippines in the luzon strait the anomalous southwesterly weakens the typical northeasterly monsoon this is a general feature in all enso years the composite difference in sea level pressure from six recent enso years el niño 2006 2009 2015 la niña 2007 2010 2011 is also superimposed in fig 3c blue contours and shows similarly anomalous high pressure sverdrup dynamics suggest that anomalous winds in the northwestern pacific can modify the western boundary current speed and change the kuroshio state in the luzon strait accordingly the wind vector time series at the center of the luzon strait is presented in fig 3e these confirm that the northeasterly monsoon is larger during la niña than el niño especially during december to february moreover the northeasterly wind is relatively steady during la niña whereas the wind direction changes rapidly during el niño this large variation suggests an increase in the occurrence of inertial motions in the ocean 3 2 2 the ocean responses fig 4 compares the 0 50 m monthly mean current pattern in the luzon strait in november the current speed shaded in fig 4 is weaker and the westward kuroshio intrusion is more considerably during el niño exp 0a this intrusion is then enhanced until january regardless of enso phase exp 0a and exp 0b during la niña exp 0b the current off southeastern taiwan exhibits a cyclonic circulation that is commonly observed in winter hsin et al 2010 and driven by the northeast monsoon in exp 1a the 2011 12 atmospheric condition i e la niña atmospheric condition was used to drive the 2015 16 ocean initial and boundary conditions used in exp compared with exp 0a exp 1a shows a stronger kuroshio current speed and enhanced intrusion into the scs see fig 4a this results directly from stronger monsoon wind forcing i e fig 3c that enhances the kuroshio loop kuehl and sheremet 2009 under both the influence of mesoscale eddy and strong wind forcing the loop current severely deformed and an anticyclonic eddy was shed from the kuroshio current fig 4k l on the other hand in exp 1b the 2015 16 atmospheric condition was used el niño atmospheric condition to drive the 2011 12 ocean initial and boundary conditions the cyclonic circulation off the southeastern coast of taiwan shown in fig 4g h is now absent this cyclonic circulation is discussed further in the next section additionally a leaping current replaces the loop current in the luzon strait during february associated with an enhanced anticyclonic eddy will be shown in the following accompanying a stronger upstream kuroshio off the eastern and northeastern coast of luzon island the 0 50 m current speed monthly variance in exp 0 is further compared in fig 5 current speed monthly variance s u 2 v 2 u u u v v v u u and v v are the daily and monthly mean velocity respectively as expected the monthly variance in the luzon strait is much weaker during la niña the locations of monthly maximum velocity variance also differ in these enso years during el niño the upstream kuroshio variation is prominent in december as a result of which the loop current becomes unsteady in the ensuing months during la niña the current state off southeastern taiwan significantly changes from january to february fig 5b as the cyclonic circulation forms to further investigate the relevant flow dynamics in the luzon strait fig 6 compares the zonal momentum budget at 10 m depth in the strait 20 n 120 5 e during january to february both exp 0a and exp 0b show an enhanced kuroshio loop and unsteady features the zonal momentum equation is as follows 2 u t t e n d e n c y u u a d v e c t i o n f v c o r i o l i s 1 ρ 0 p x p g f z k m v u z v e r t i c a l d i f f u s i o n where k m v is the vertical viscosity coefficient the horizontal diffusion is negligible the ageostrophic velocity component is represented by the summation of the coriolis and pressure gradient force pgf terms our analysis suggests that the advection term dominates the variation in zonal ageostrophic velocity more frequently in exp 0a fig 6a whereas the diffusion term dominates the momentum variation in exp 0b fig 6b this infers that upstream kuroshio variation or eddy activities dominate momentum change during el niño exp 0a whereas wind stress forcing dominates during la niña exp 0b this is consistent with the local wind difference shown in fig 3e the local wind during la niña is much stronger and steadier in exp 1a fig 6c the diffusion term shows a more dominant role comparing to exp 0a due to a stronger and steadier local wind during the la niña in exp 1b fig 6d the advection term is enhanced especially during jan feb implying a more unsteady condition due to the nonlinear interactions between the mean flow and perturbations to show upstream kuroshio variation and the zonally propagating features that play an important role in the luzon strait flow pattern we present a hovmöller diagram of meridional velocity and relative vorticity averaged between 16 and 20 n in fig 7 the kuroshio is located around 122 e to 123 e in the case of an el niño event exp 0a the upstream kuroshio speed greatly increases during december due to propagating eddies rossby waves the westward propagating features mesoscale eddies are stronger during el niño than la niña kuroshio speed is significantly modulated by these propagating features in exp 1a the westward propagating signals become weaker under la niña local atmosphere forcing comparing fig 7c with fig 7a and stronger under el niño atmosphere forcing comparing fig 7d with fig 7b to further illustrate the spatial structures of these differences fig 8 compares the 10 day averaged flow field 0 10 m between 2011 12 22 and 2012 1 20 in exp0b and exp1b an anticyclonic circulation appears to the east of luzon in both runs it grows through january and became a stronger eddy during 1 11 1 20 comparing these two runs the circulation speed of the anticyclonic eddies in exp 1b is stronger note that the wind curl difference between exp 1b and exp 0b during this period is positive indicating the vorticity input from wind forcing cannot well explain the enhancement of the anticyclonic eddy we quantify the variations of mesoscale eddies energy using eke in these experiments as expect the upper 50 m mean eke for the region of 16 20 n and 124 e 128 e table 1 in exp0a 502 cm2 s2 is much larger than that in exp 0b 352 cm2 s2 the mean eke in the same region is 465 and 394 cm2 s2 in exp 1a and exp 1b respectively compared to the control runs exp0 when the 2015 16 el niño atmosphere forcing is replaced by the 2011 12 la niña forcing the eke is decreased reversely when the 2011 12 la niña atmosphere forcing is replaced by the 2015 16 el niño forcing the eke is increased these results suggest that anomalous winds in the western north pacific might be responsible for the stronger westward propagating eddy activities to the east of the kuroshio since internal variability commonly exists in the ocean model arising from its nonlinearity penduff et al 2011 particularly in the regions with vigorous mesoscale eddy activities we further perform 8 additional ensemble simulations 2 for each experiment to confirm the model consistency we perturb the initial temperature field at the first model level by a gaussian distributed random number generator mean of zero and standard deviation of 0 5 c table 1 as the independent random noise for the ensembles similar to turner et al 2008 and yin et al 2011 this value of standard deviation is chosen because the remote sensing systems www remss com suggested that the accuracy for the amsr e the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for eos ocean products is approximately 0 5 c and the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr nonlinear sst algorithm nlsst error characteristics is also 0 5 c nalli and smith 1998 these additional ensembles show consistent decrease increase relation discussed earlier table 1 while the internal variability arising from the nonlinearity in ocean is relatively small compared to the difference between exp1 and exp0 figs 4 8 confirm that the flow monthly variance during the el niño is stronger and primarily caused by the oceanic advection associated with mesoscale eddies during the la niña flow monthly variance is mostly caused by local wind stress fig 6 qiu and chen 2010 analyzed long term satellite altimeter data and found that the generation of mesoscale eddies on the stcc region is associated with wind induced convergence that modifies the temperature gradient as well as the vertical shear of the upper ocean current in the frontal region thus the anomalous negative wind curl may enhance mesoscale eddies propagating westward to the east of kuroshio we further explored the impacts of different enso related atmospheric forcing on the upper ocean in two additional experiments long term observation data were also analyzed in the present study to support our conclusions qiu and chen 2010 explained interannual variation in the kinetic energy level of eddies in the stcc band 18 n 25 n based on varying surface ekman temperature gradient convergence g t v e k g y where g is the meridional temperature gradient t y and v e k τ x ρ f h is the meridional ekman velocity according to 2011 12 initial ocean and boundary conditions el niño related anomalous winds i e atmospheric low level anticyclonic high pressure anomalies in the philippine sea exp 1b alter the thermocline slope leading to increased baroclinic instability in the stcc nec region hence the eddies in exp1b are stronger than those caused by the 2011 12 la niña atmospheric forcing in exp 0b this is supported by fig 9 a which shows that isotherms in the front zone 16 n 22 n zonally averaged between 124 e and 126 e become steeper in exp 1b compared with exp 0b the temperature difference between exp 0b and exp 1b is also shaded cooling occurred at the cold side of the front with a larger change from 0 to 100 m this caused the isotherms between 17 n and 20 n to tilt upward 0 to 200 m similar characteristics to figs 7 9 can be found in the additional ensemble mean see the appendix to further support the thermocline change in the front region shown in fig 9 a the heat budget eq 3 difference between exp 1b and exp 0b is plotted in fig 9 b this is averaged between 0 and 200 m in the front zone region where cooling occurs with the tilted isotherms shown in fig 10 a 3 t t u t x v t y w t z z k t z a h t 0 the budget is primarily dominated by the horizontal advection which is caused by the anomalous ekman transport associated with easterly wind anomalies the vertical diffusion is mostly positive the reduced wind speed in exp 1b compared with exp 0b associated with anticyclonic circulation anomalies fig 3b causes smaller upward latent heat flux in the ocean surface and weaker subsurface turbulent mixing in summary the above heat budget analysis shows that the anomalous winds rather than the surface heat fluxes dominate the isotherm tilting process in the upper ocean chow et al 2017 the wind anomalies associated with el niño induce ekman convergence which enhances the horizontal temperature gradient in this region strengthening velocity shear and baroclinic instability on the basis of the simple linear theory of baroclinic instability phillips 1954 the stable condition for a two layer model is δ u 2 β 0 g h f 0 2 where δ u is the velocity shear between the two layers f 0 and β 0 are the coriolis and beta parameters in the beta plane approximation h is the total water depth and g is the reduced gravity the upward tilting of the isotherms in the front region 17 5 21 n in exp 1b compared with exp 0b indicate a stronger current shear moreover greater cooling occurred in the upper layers 0 to 100 m than in the lower layers 100 to 200 m fig 10 a this suggests a weaker density difference between the upper and lower layers and thus a smaller rossby deformation radius in exp1b these differences can lower the baroclinic unstable condition criteria and effectively enhance baroclinic instability to generate more mesoscale eddies chow et al 2017 fig 10 a shows the composite of isotherm averaged between 124 e and 126 e during 8 enso events el niño 1997 98 2002 03 2009 10 2015 16 la niña 1999 00 2007 08 2010 11 2011 12 using the hycom reanalysis data gofs 3 1 the results confirm that the meridional temperature gradient is larger during el niño our model results suggest that the anomalous local wind stress may contribute to this difference however it requires further study for possible remote effects and is beyond the scope of this work fig 10b shows the differences in meridional gradient of v e k between exp 0a and exp 0b exp 0a exp 0b in the western pacific positive values to the south of 17 n and negative between 17 n 20 n respectively this implies the spatially varying impacts of the anomalous wind forcing on the ocean thermal structure consistent with previous studies in terms of different enso effects on the stcc 3 2 3 analysis of observational data and other indices white et al 1978 found that interannual variation of the subtropical front associated with the stcc is linked to enso signals however qiu and chen 2010 found that rather than the niño 3 4 index the negative west pacific teleconnection wp index correlated better with ekman forcing over the stcc during the negative phase of the wp pattern anomalous low pressure increases ekman transport convergence in the stcc band which causes an enhanced thermocline tilt of the stcc variation of kuroshio in the luzon strait due to mesoscale eddies greatly depends on location of interaction between the kuroshio and eddies when this occurs in the upstream region i e to the east of luzon island the kuroshio state can change drastically from leaping to looping or eddy shedding however when the eddy kuroshio interaction occurs in the northern half of the luzon strait or to the east of taiwan the kuroshio state in the luzon strait is less influential kuo et al 2017 therefore an enso related anomalous low level anticyclone cyclone located in the philippine sea or eastern scs region may play an important role in kuroshio variation in the luzon strait due to the impingement of westward migration mesoscale eddies to confirm these modeled features fig 11 shows long term mean surface eke november to february based on the hycom ncoda global 1 12 reanalysis niño3 4 index was significantly correlated with the mean surface eke anomalies in the region to the east of luzon 14 20 n 125 140 e correlation coefficient 0 48

the other hand the pto index chang and oey 2012 directly associated with the wind stress curl changes in the western north pacific seems to correlate better with the eke east of taiwan correlation coefficient 0 45 significant at the 95 confidence than to the east of luzon island correlation coefficient 0 31 insignificant at approximately 6 9 months lead time fig 11 march to june average is superimposed this is also confirmed in fig 12 but the correlation is lower chang and oey 2012 showed that positive pto connects well with the larger eke in the region of 123 140 e and 18 25 n correlation coefficient 0 76 their fig 1a northern displacement of nec and the larger kuroshio intrusion into the scs the inconsistent relationship of the eke with pto and enso is unclear but may be due to the different active regions of the wind stress anomalies the winds associated with pto are around 140 180 e while the enso related anomalous low level anticyclone locates further southwestward and is closer to the luzon and the south china sea region 3 2 4 cyclonic circulation off the southeastern taiwan coast fig 13 shows the wind curl difference contours and 0 50 m averaged vorticity difference shading between el niño exp 0a and la niña exp 0b except for the southwest coast of taiwan the wind stress curl during winter in the vicinity of taiwan is generally positive jan et al 2015 the wind curl difference shows a different spatial distribution from the typical winter pattern suggesting a reduced vorticity input from wind stress forcing during el niño in the vicinity of the southwestern coast of taiwan the sign for wind curl difference is the same as that for upper ocean vorticity difference confirming the contribution of vorticity input from the atmospheric winds to the ocean in the case of la niña cyclonic circulation to the southeast of taiwan appears in january the generation or maintenance of which is assisted by concurrent negative wind curl anomalies this cyclonic circulation is absent in exp 1b fig 8 but present in exp 0b fig 5 the atmospheric wind differences are responsible for this absence fig 14 shows the upper 50 m vorticity budget eq 1 during january in exp 0b the dominant terms are stretching and advection the meridional and zonal advection terms almost balance each other consequently the wind induced local flow convergence increases the stretching term and development of cyclonic circulation in addition to the local wind effect an enhanced and steady kuroshio loop associated with the la niña wind anomaly results in stronger eastward current off the southern tip of taiwan that can strengthens the horizontal convergence the stretching term 4 ζ t t e n d e n c y u ζ x z o n a l a d v v ζ x m e r i d i o n a l a d v ζ f u s t r e t c

occur in the equatorial pacific wang et al 2006 suggested that these basin scale wind anomalies modify the kuroshio transport through the sverdrup dynamic and the basin scale winds driven luzon strait transport anomaly is found leading the niño3 4 index by 6 months using the island rule godfrey 1989 we confirmed that the simultaneous connection between winter matured enso index and the winter kuroshio intrusion was significantly increased after 2000 possibly explained by the northwestward shift of air sea coupling after 2000 which results mainly from the enhanced ocean atmosphere coupling in the northern hemisphere in addition an anomalous anticyclone over the south china sea and philippine sea rapidly develops in late autumn and then matures in winter during enso events these regional wind anomalies further modulate the kuroshio in the luzon strait on the top of the basin scale wind background effects model sensitivity experiments show that during el niño westward propagating mesoscale eddies to the east of kuroshio are enhanced due to increased baroclinic instability caused by the ekman convergence in the front zone and a weaker density difference vertically that lowers the baroclinic unstable condition criteria in the meantime the anomalous southwesterly in the luzon strait weakens the typical northeasterly monsoon consequently the kuroshio pattern in the luzon strait during el niño tends to be more unsteady during la niña the kuroshio loop is enhanced in response to the strengthened northeasterly winds these enhanced wind stresses and the associated wind stress curl favor the development of a cyclonic eddy off the southeastern taiwan overall the basin scale wind anomalies induce the oceanic responses mainly sverdrup dynamics resulting in the change of luzon strait transport associated with rossby waves generated during the adjustment process the regional anticyclonic wind anomalies produce horizontal convergence in the frontal region which further enhances baroclinic instability the former process i e basin scale wind anomalies is barotropic and can be approximately as the steady state however the latter process regional anticyclonic wind anomalies is baroclinic which includes strong nonlinearity that can only be resolved in the high resolution model simulation in the present study we focus on the direct ocean response to different atmospheric forcing associated with enso events in our sensitivity experiments the local air sea interaction is simplified to a one way process that excludes the influence of ocean feedback the feedback to the atmosphere resulting from the oceanic response may introduce complexity kuo and tseng 2020 specifically the strong nonlinearity associated with the ocean mesoscale feature may force the above atmosphere through the air sea heat exchange process consequently the resulting modulation of the low level atmosphere may not be negligible further study to assess the contribution of this ocean feedback is required in the follow up study credit authorship contribution statement yi chun kuo formal analysis methodology writing original draft yu heng tseng conceptualization methodology

experiments varied from 9cm2 s2 to 34 cm2 s2 table 1 with an averaged difference of 16 6 cm2 s2 these values are smaller than the deviations from the unperturbed experiment for exp0b and exp1b both having the same 2011 12 roms i c 2011 12 showing the intrinsic internal variability associated with the initial perturbation is smaller than the forced dynamics as expected figs a 1 a 3 show very similar results to the corresponding figs 7 9 based on the perturbed initial condition experiments note that the intensity difference of the westward propagating signals between exp0a and exp1a is not clear this suggests the initial perturbation may interact with the wind forcing effects with similar magnitudes however the larger mean eke and vertical thermal profile changes between exp0a and exp1a confirm the stronger baroclinic instability under the wind forcing change
