23535,side by side offloading is becoming a more and more important offshore operation where one vessel is moored alongside another one forming a narrow gap between them using different types of incident waves i e white noise waves transient wave groups and regular waves we investigated both the transient and steady state resonant responses of the fluid in narrow gaps at model scale the nonlinearity and uncertainties in obtaining the response amplitude operators raos of resonant fluid motions in narrow gaps are addressed it appears that transient wave group testing is a promising approach for the investigation of gap resonance problem because it avoids unwanted wave reflection induced by the limitation in the size of wave basins to predict the gap resonant raos numerically artificial damping is introduced into three different potential flow solvers to damp the otherwise over estimated free surface motions in narrow gaps the predicted raos which are based on the

potential flow solvers in predicting gap resonant response at model scale for narrow gap widths that are relevant to engineering practice keywords hydrodynamics gap resonance transient wave group flng 1 introduction floating liquefied natural gas flng facilities are a new type of offshore structure these are being developed as a game changer in offshore hydrocarbon development to unlock stranded gas reserves zhao et al 2011 one of the key challenges is the product offloading operation which may proceed with vessels in a side by side configuration reliable offloading is essential for successful flng implementation in the side by side scenarios one of the floating bodies is moored alongside the other one forming a gap that is very narrow relative to the principal dimensions of the flng and carrier the fluid inside the narrow gap may experience significant resonant response when excited at particular wave frequencies the practical importance of the gap resonance is unclear at the moment due to the difficulties in predicting the magnitude of the gap resonance this leads on to difficulties in accurate prediction of the second order forces when conducting the waterline integral part of that force calculation investigations into the steady state response of the gap resonance phenomenon have been done both in 2d e g faltinsen et al 2007 lu et al 2011 and 3d e g pauw et al 2007 molin et al 2009 dinoi et al 2014 while many research efforts into the gap resonant response have been undertaken the majority concentrated on analysis of the maximum gap resonant amplitude at steady state in regular waves however real ocean waves are never regular and reaching steady state is not straightforward in tank experiments due to the long time for the gap resonance to build up to its maximum amplitude by which time reflected waves from the edges of the tank may affect the experiments actually the time required for the gap resonance to build up to steady state is also a challenge for time domain simulations as demonstrated by watai et al 2015 this is associated with the main characteristic of the gap resonance as a very low damped phenomenon to overcome the challenges of achieving a steady state response there is interest in the behaviour of the fluid in the gap in transient wave groups as considered by eatock taylor et al 2008 who numerically simulated the gap resonant response under focused wave groups based on linear potential flow theory the frequencies and mode shapes of the gap resonances can be well predicted using the approach given by molin et al 2002 whose solution is an extension of that for the moon pool problem molin 2001 a comprehensive numerical study of the frequencies mode shapes and response amplitudes for the gap resonances in between two fixed boxes was made by sun et al 2010 using potential flow theory it is well known that potential flow theory predicts significantly larger responses than are observed in physical experiments e g faltinsen et al 2007 pauw et al 2007 much work suggests that the viscosity is the main source of the discrepancy between linear potential flow theory and experimental data molin et al 2009 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 feng and bai 2015 carried out fully nonlinear numerical simulations without including viscosity and reported that nonlinearity may induce slight shifts in the resonant frequency similar to the well known resonant frequency shift observed for a nonlinear spring though with rather limited effect on the amplitude many methods have been proposed to improve the level of agreement between potential flow calculations and physical model test results for instance huijsmans et al 2001 suppressed vertical motion in the gap completely by introducing a rigid lid newman 2001 split the gap motion into generalized modes allowing different damping rates for each motion and chen 2005 introduced a dissipative damping term in the free surface condition by introducing an additional damping term all methods seem to be able to achieve good agreement with experimental data but the selection of the additional damping coefficient is generally empirical a robust method of estimating this damping is of significant importance for practical applications because it would allow for estimates of gap resonance efficiently using the linear potential flow theory the majority of the existing studies focused on the resonant response of the fluid in gaps which were not sufficiently narrow to be representative of practical flng offloading operations for instance fournier et al 2006 investigated the gap resonance surface elevations based on gap widths of 20 m and 30 m at full scale however a typical side by side offloading may have a mean gap width of 4 m between vessels exceeding 200 m in length thus there is an emerging need to investigate the characteristics of the resonant response of the fluid in such narrow gaps as mentioned above gap resonant performance under transient wave group excitations is also of interest which avoids the challenge of achieving a steady state response both in numerical simulations and experiments in light of this we carried out an extensive set of experiments to investigate the gap resonant response under excitations of regular waves white noise waves and focused transient wave groups the so called newwave zhao et al 2017 the response amplitude operators rao of the gap resonance are obtained from the three different types of wave excitation these raos are then used to validate the numerical predictions using three different potential flow solvers i e wadam hydrostar and waveload fd each uses a different method to introduce artificial damping in the narrow gaps 2 experimental set up model tests were carried out in the deepwater wave basin at shanghai jiao tong university china at the scale of 1 60 to focus on the gap resonance and simplify the study we selected two identical rectangular boxes to represent a side by side moored two body system at model scale each model is 3 333 m long 0 425 m high 0 767 m wide and the gap width is set as 0 033 m 0 066 m and 0 132 m respectively at full scale it represents a vessel of 200 m long 25 5 m high and 46 m wide and the gap width is 2 m 4 m and 8 m respectively it should be noted that the geometry of the vessel models in this study has been simplified so are not directly applicable to any engineering project however the results here should provide a database for the validation of numerical models and the simplicity of the geometry allows a fundamental understanding of gap resonance to be developed at the same time this study will demonstrate the advantage of using transient focused wave groups for gap resonance which is a very slightly damped phenomenon during the model tests the two identical boxes were fixed to a gantry which provided enough stiffness to hold them rigidly in place the experimental set up is illustrated in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 the vessel models have round corners at both bilges each with a radius of 0 083 m running along the full length the two boxes are fixed together and immersed to a draft of 0 185 m alongside each other a more detailed description of the experimental set up was reported in a previous study zhao et al 2017 prior to the experiments all the waves including white noise waves regular waves and transient focused wave groups were calibrated as the latter two types of wave test results will be discussed in detail in the following sections we just provide the calibrated spectra of the white noise waves here in fig 2 two white noise wave records were generated in the wave basin one with the significant wave height of 42 mm and the other 84 mm it should be noted in fig 2 that the larger white noise wave has a narrower spectral bandwidth than the smaller one this is because it is very hard to achieve the high wave energy distribution at high frequency the white noise waves were generated for 25 min which after removing an incident transient phase corresponded to 23 24 min at model scale is equivalent to 3 h at full scale the white noise waves may not be realistic of ocean wave spectra but they are an efficient way to obtain the raos and the broad bandwidth of the spectrum is able to trigger several gap resonant modes in the same test 3 artificial damping to potential flow solvers within the scope of potential flow theory the velocity potential φ must satisfy both the laplace equation and a series of boundary conditions to avoid repeating the basic theory which can be found in many textbooks on hydrodynamics we focus on the discussion of the linearized free surface boundary conditions where viscous damping effects are commonly introduced in industry standard potential flow solvers the kinematic free surface condition requires that the fluid particles should remain on the free surface the linearized form of this boundary condition is given by 1 η t φ z where η refers to the water surface the linearized dynamic free surface condition from the bernoulli equation is given by 2 φ t 1 ρ p ρ g η c t where p is the pressure acting on the free surface and the constant term c t is independent of the space coordinates but may depend on time the pressure term has been used in the study of oscillating water column wave energy devices wang and falzarano 2013 by assuming that the viscous forces acting in the gap have an uniform damping effect on the piston like fluid response additional viscous damping effect can be taken into account markeng 2015 this may be true for a piston like resonant response but the fluid resonant motions in a 3 d gap is a superposition of a series of resonant modes which destroys the uniform pressure assumption the constant term c t can be absorbed into the velocity potential φ φ 0 t c t d t introducing a difference between φ and φ depending on time but the spatial gradients are not affected thus the value of c t is related to a corresponding constant in the velocity potential which has no effect on the velocity vector and thus it can be chosen arbitrarily newman 1977 we can therefore simply set c t p 0 ρ where p 0 is the atmosphere pressure on the free surface therefore eq 2 can be simplified into the form 3 φ t g η 0 the combination of the kinematic and dynamic free surface condition gives the following form 4 φ t t g φ z z 0 3 1 artificial damping in wadam a viscous damping effect as in the newtonian cooling method israeli and orszag 1981 kim 2003 can be introduced into the linear kinematic free surface condition with the dynamic condition retained as in eq 3 in this case eq 1 will be re written as 5 η t φ z μ 1 η μ 2 g φ where the two terms μ 1 and μ 2 are the introduced artificial damping as a result of the form of eq 5 it is clear that the extra viscous damping introduced has a linear form eq 3 can be further modified as 6 1 g φ t t φ z μ 1 g φ t μ 2 g φ 0 by re writing φ into the form of φ ϕ e i ω t we obtain φ t t ω 2 φ φ t i ω φ and φ z k φ where k is the wavenumber eq 6 can then be re written as 7 ω 2 g k i μ 1 ω μ 2 0 the solution of which can be given as 8 ω g k 1 μ 2 g k μ 1 2 4 g k i μ 1 2 to retain the linear dispersion relation for the real part of the frequency we set 4 μ 2 μ 1 2 0 in such a scenario μ 2 should be a negative value marked here as μ 2 ε 1 2 as a result eq 5 can be written as 9 η t φ z 2 ε 1 η ε 1 2 g φ where the first damping term is used to damp the free surface elevations in the gap and the second damping term is much smaller and is included to keep the linear dispersion relation unchanged as shown in eq 8 submitting eq 3 dynamic into eq 9 kinematic the free surface condition can be re written in the time independent form 10 ϕ z ϕ g ω 2 i 2 ε 1 ω ε 1 2 which is further written as follows 11 ϕ z k ϕ 1 i 2 μ μ 2 where μ ε 1 ω and k ω 2 g of course eq 11 is only adopted for the free surface in the gap to show the relationship of the damping coefficients used in different solvers we define d 2 μ where μ is a tuneable input parameter implemented in wadam 2016 and d is the non dimensional coefficient applied to the damping term 3 2 artificial damping in hydrostar in hydrostar damping is introduced by assuming an additional small internal force is applied to every fluid particle in addition to the effect of gravity which is given as 12 f ε 2 φ where ε 2 is assumed to be positive and small although f is introduced to dissipate energy to account for fluid viscosity it does not introduce any vorticity so that the assumption of irrotational flow and the existence of a velocity potential is not affected the inviscid and irrotational fluid with the dissipative force f can be described as a fairly perfect fluid chen 2004 incorporating the additional force the momentum equation in the fairly perfect fluid is written as 13 t 1 2 φ φ p ρ g z ε 2 φ the linearized dynamic free surface condition is thus written as 14 g η φ t ε 2 φ 0 this modified dynamic free surface condition eq 14 combined with the kinematic free surface condition in eq 1 give 15 φ z 1 g φ t t ε 2 φ t 0 using the assumption of φ ϕ e i ω t we can obtain the following equation which is similar to eq 7 16 ω 2 g k i ε 2 ω 0 from eq 16 one can see that the introduced artificial damping term does not affect the linear dispersion relation submitting eq 14 dynamic into eq 1 kinematic the free surface condition can be re written in the time independent form 17 ϕ z ϕ g ω 2 i ε 2 ω ω 2 g ϕ 1 i ε 2 ω where the damping coefficient ε 2 should be divided by ω so as to be a non dimensional parameter again eq 17 is only adopted for the part of the free surface in the gap in hydrostar finally it is worth noting that the damping coefficient ε 2 ς 2 ς where ς is the input parameter in hydrostar to facilitate comparisons later we denote d ε 2 ω ς 2 ς ω where d is the non dimensional coefficient applied to the damping term in hydrostar 3 3 artificial damping in waveload fd the method of introducing artificial damping in waveload fd 2017 is rather similar to but still slightly different from those in wadam and hydrostar the combined free surface condition in eq 4 has the following form in the frequency domain 18 g ϕ z ω 2 ϕ 0 a small positive artificial damping ε 3 is introduced in the free surface condition in waveload fd for the velocity potential boundary value problem the linearized free surface condition with artificial damping for the velocity potential is the same as that in eq 15 as a result the free surface condition with artificial damping used in waveload fd is the same with that used in hydrostar eq 17 eq 17 is further re organized in the following form so as to adopt a non dimensional coefficient in calculations 19 ϕ z k ϕ 1 i ξ where ξ ε 3 ω and k ω 2 g one can see that ξ is a non dimensional coefficient the definition of which is similar to that in wadam ξ is the input parameter implemented in waveload fd similarly we can see that the actual non dimensional damping coefficient applied to the damping term is d ξ 3 4 summary of these artificial damping methods three damping methods are used in the three standard industry potential flow solvers wadam introduced the artificial damping through the kinematic free surface condition to keep the linear dispersion relation the two artificial damping parameters introduced are required to meet a certain relationship and thus finally merged into only one coefficient hydrostar introduced the artificial damping through the dynamic free surface condition while waveload fd used very similar method as in hydrostar it is worthwhile clarifying that the artificial damping coefficients used in wadam and waveload fd have been normalized e g eq 11 and eq 19 while it is not in hydrostar although the methods introducing artificial damping are slightly different the damped free surface condition provides similar forms e g eq 11 eq 17 and eq 19 as a result the damping parameters required to achieve good agreement with the experimental data should be consistent for the three different linear potential flow solvers so the non dimensional damping coefficient d of each should be similar one can see that introducing a damping coefficient into each of the potential flow solvers is only a mathematically convenient representation of the consequences of physical viscosity and the value of the damping coefficient introduced in this way does not have any direct physical meaning so it is different from the non dimensional damping coefficient a coefficient of total damping that is deduced usually by analysing a decaying free surface elevation however this way of introducing the damping coefficient used in the three potential flow solvers is the best engineering practice and thus a better understanding or discussion on the damping coefficient is valuable it should be noted that there are other ways of introducing the viscous effect such as introducing a damping coefficient into the complex response function as in eatock taylor and meylan 2007 and zhao et al 2018 4 results and discussion in the experiment tests the gap resonant response was investigated for three different gap widths 132 mm 66 mm and 33 mm at model scale which are of practical importance corresponding to 2 m 4 m and 8 m at full scale for the 66 mm gap width which corresponds a typical width 4 m at full scale of two floating vessels in side by side offloading operations the gap resonances were triggered by three different types of waves in the laboratory white noise irregular waves focused transient wave groups and regular waves for the 33 mm and 132 mm gap widths the gap resonances were excited by the white noise waves only yielding the corresponding raos for comparison to the calculated results 4 1 time history of the gap resonance at the centre of the gap during the model tests the same wave paddle signal records as measured in the calibration stage were used to generate white noise waves the surface elevations at the centre of the gap were measured at a sampling frequency of 25 hz fig 3 shows representative time histories of the surface elevations measured at the centre of the gap with and without the vessel models in place to investigate the transient gap resonant response we also generated a series of focused transient wave groups fig 4 shows the corresponding time histories where the underlying amplitude spectrum of the target focused transient wave group is gaussian and given by 22 s f h s 2 16 1 δ 2 π exp f f p 2 2 δ 2 where h s refers to an assumed significant wave height f p the peak frequency of the spectrum and δ 0 0775 hz the gap width for this case is 66 mm and the frequency of the first mode gap resonance is 1 02 hz the peak frequency of the incident wave spectrum is set as f p 1 02 hz in order to trigger the resonant response as shown in fig 4 the incident wave transient wave group only last about 6 s after the focal time while the gap resonance lasts for much longer and shows a strong beating pattern the beating pattern of the gap resonance time history is a result of the interference of the different modes set up in the gap each of which simply decays exponentially in time once the incident wave group has passed by a comprehensive decomposition of the transient gap resonant performance has been reported in our previous study zhao et al 2017 instead of focusing on the transient resonant behaviour in time in this study we use the transient wave group test results to estimate the raos to investigate the steady state gap resonant response several regular wave tests were also performed with the incident wave frequency fixed at f 1 02 hz and the input wave amplitude varied from η a 16 mm 32 mm 40 mm fig 5 shows the incident waves and the corresponding gap resonance normalized by the maximum incident wave amplitudes the regular wave results show clearly the long time required for the gap resonance to build up i e about 30 cycles for the small incident wave amplitude case as a consequence it is necessary to carry out regular wave tests for gap resonance problem in a wave basin with large size and with adequate wave damping so as to avoid the effects of reflected waves from the paddles or side and end walls contaminating steady state response the amplification factor reduced from 4 5 in the small incident wave case η a 16 mm 3 5 in the η a 32 mm case to 2 9 in the η a 40 mm case this may be a result of the nonlinearity in the damping of the gap resonance or could be due to the large size of the local free surface motion relative to the hull geometry the vertical flat part of the gap is 102 mm below calm water while the minimum surface elevation is 90 mm below calm water in η a 16 mm case 130 mm in η a 32 mm case and 150 mm in η a 40 mm case with a local amplification of 2 9 for the largest regular waves tested the minimum free surface level is roughly halfway down the curved region of the hull towards the bottom of the hull so significant local geometry changes will modify the local motion for this extreme surface displacement however it should be noted that the such large incident wave heights may not be of direct practical interest for side by side offloading operations for instance the η a 32 mm case corresponds to a wave height of 4 m at field scale while the operational limit on significant wave height for side by side offloading is likely to be less than 2 5 m one can always reduce the regular wave heights to the range of interest in a laboratory however measurement error may play a role as the wave height will be very small at model scale 1 60 to avoid such measurement errors the scaling factor could be decreased and thus a larger wave basin would be needed though the one we used is one of the largest wave basin in the world so one can see the disadvantage of using regular wave tests to investigate the gap resonance which is very slightly damped though regular waves have been widely and successfully applied for many other hydrodynamic problems to overcome this challenge the use of transient focused wave groups appears to be promising 4 2 raos obtained from the wave tests the raos are obtained from the three different types of incident waves as discussed above the raos are compared in fig 6 for the random wave tests one can see slight differences between the small significant wave height case h s 42 mm ω 2 10 r a d s and the larger significant wave height case h s 84 mm ω 2 7 r a d s the difference of the response peaks may be partially due to nonlinearity or it may be due to uncertainty underlining the spectral analysis e g the incident wave spectral density at the peak frequency happen to be much smaller than expected in one of the two cases when we generated waves in the wave basin the white noise spectrum was divided into 500 wave components thus the frequency intervals for the two cases δ ω 0 016 r a d s and δ ω 0 01 r a d s are pretty small the slight difference may also just be a result of the averaging process we found that the agreement could be improved when we changed the averaging parameters for the spectra obtained through fast fourier transforms fft however we used exactly the same parameters for the white noise wave test results obtained from the two wave height cases the white noise wave signals of 1400 s sampled at frequency of 25 hz were divided into a few 8 for white noise waves segments with 4096 data points in each the obtained spectra based on the each segment were then averaged to reduce the noise level in addition the averaged spectrum was then smoothed using a 5 point method one can see the slight shift of the peak frequency from the white noise wave test to the transient wave group test this may be due to the slight difference between the drafts of the vessel models we removed the vessel models from the wave basin after the white noise wave tests and then put it back for the transient wave group tests and regular wave tests the draft of the model might have a discrepancy of 1 mm over 185 mm due to the re installation of the model in the wave basin this small change is large enough to change the resonant frequencies slightly as discussed in zhao et al 2018 the gap resonance frequencies are very sensitive to the draft as shown in fig 6 the gap resonance raos decrease as the incident regular wave height increases as discussed above this is because the incident wave amplitudes are very large so nonlinearity and extra dissipation play a role but such large responses are out of the range of interest for side by side offloading operations as noted previously to provide clear information we mark the response amplitude cases with their incident wave amplitudes in fig 7 all for a frequency of 1 02 hz in this figure one can see that the amplitudes of the incident wave components and responses for the white noise wave tests and transient wave group tests are small and are located on the line representing a linear relationship the regular wave tests are far off from and well below a linear relationship 4 3 numerical prediction versus experimental data the gap resonance raos are numerically simulated in this section using linear potential flow theory based on three different potential solvers with artificial damping introduced to match the experimental data the theory describing each of the damping methods is discussed in section 3 the panel models adopted in the three different potential flow solvers are shown in fig 8 all the three potential flow solvers apply a low order formulation to obtain the solutions based on the boundary element method numerical simulations are carried out for the three different gap widths i e 33 mm 2 m at full scale 66 mm 4 m at full scale and 132 mm 8 m at full scale these numerically predicted results are then compared with the experimental data as has been reported previously chen 2005 eatock taylor et al 2008 standard linear potential flow theory over predicts the gap resonant response amplitudes as experimentally determined to avoid duplication and to provide a clear demonstration we only provide one set of the undamped gap resonance results in figs 9 11 extra damping is introduced to damp the unphysical gap resonance using standard linear potential theory the methods for which have been described in section 3 the predicted gap resonance raos at the centre of the gap are compared with the measured data for three gap widths in figs 9 11 it should be noted that when ignoring the extra viscous damping contributions the only damping is due to waves radiated to infinity so the calculated gap resonance amplitudes tend to infinity as the gap width decreases to zero however the experimental data strongly indicate that there is a gap width which gives the maximum gap resonance amplitude zhao et al 2018 as given in fig 9 μ and ξ are non dimensional independent input parameters while ς is an input parameter associated with frequencies ω therefore if one wants to provide the same net damping d ς 2 ς ω in section 3 2 in hydrostar for calculations at different scales the value of ς should be varied according to the scaling factor for instance ς 0 0818 obtained based on the numerical simulations at model scale say 1 60 will be equivalent to 0 0110 in simulations run at full scale while the parameters for μ and ξ will be unchanged it is worth noting that the three input parameters are actually consistent if they are transferred into the non dimensional damping coefficient d as shown in table 1 the blue dashed line in fig 9 is obtained from linear potential calculations without any extra viscous damping contribution the solid lines with extra linear damping and the black dots are experimental data points one can see that the predicted results agree extremely well with the experimental data for the 132 mm 8 m at full scale and 66 m 4 m at full scale gap widths the agreement for the narrowest gap width of 33 mm 2 m at full scale is less satisfactory at the higher gap resonant modes it is expected in the boundary element method that 5 panels over a wavelength should be fine enough to provide reasonable results and panel density larger than 12 per wavelength should be sufficient to guarantee convergence we checked the numerical computations and the results converged for the narrowest gap the match to experiment is less satisfactory possibly because viscous damping becomes more important than potential flow radiation damping as the gap width gets extremely small i e the smallest gap width of 33 mm it should also be noted that we adopted uniform damping coefficients for each of the different gap resonant modes in this study while they may be noticeably different in reality we assume that the agreement will be improved when applying suitable damping coefficients at different gap resonant modes however the agreements for the 66 mm and 132 mm gap width cases are very good in general suggesting that introducing a uniform damping coefficient into the potential flow model is able to provide satisfactory numerical predictions of the resonant response for gap widths of practical interest as discussed earlier the extra damping introduced into the linear potential solver is linear it works well for the cases in this study because viscous damping of the gap resonance for these cases may be a result of stokes laminar boundary layers zhao et al 2017 2018 where the damping is actually linear however it may not be applicable to any cases with substantial vortex shedding at field scale the viscous boundary layer characteristics may be in a different regime turbulent rather than laminar but the analysis here is likely to provide at least upper estimates on the gap resonant responses when scaled up to practical cases one may note from figs 9 11 that the input parameters at different solvers are different to each other though they have achieved similar agreement with the same experimental data as discussed in the previous section they are actually consistent when these input parameters are transferred into the form of the non dimensional damping term d as illustrated in table 1 the data in table 1 suggest that the maximum difference of d between the three potential flow solvers is 0 0074 0 0050 0 0074 32 0 0117 0 0093 0 0117 20 and 0 0152 0 0136 0 0152 11 for the gap width of 132 mm 66 mm and 33 mm respectively through the comparison of the d values in the different solvers one can see that the raos are less sensitive or show more tolerance to the values of the imposed damping coefficients for wider gaps 5 conclusion the resonant responses of the fluid in narrow gaps are investigated both numerically and experimentally for cases where the two identical vessel models forming the narrow gaps are fixed the main conclusions are as follows for narrow gaps it takes many periods for the gap resonance to build up to reach a steady state response correspondingly there is a very long decay time for the gap resonance once excited the spectral shape of the gap resonance modes is very spiky hence a very small shift in the frequency of the incident wave from the resonant peak will lead to a significant reduction of the response due to mis tuning artificial damping is introduced to 3 potential flow solvers to account for the viscous damping effect using three industry standard potential flow solvers with artificial damping the calculated raos of the free surface elevations in the gap agree very well with the experimental at least for the cases of interest i e gap widths of 4 m and 8 m for the extremely narrow gap case 2 m in full scale more damping is needed to preferentially dampen the higher modes of the gap resonance for the resonant motion of fluid in narrow gaps which are of practical interests testing with transient focused wave groups appears to be promising this avoids the contamination from reflected waves in the existing wave basin facilities and thus the measured signal is more reliable furthermore short duration experiments are ideal for serving as benchmark cases for cfd simulations saving much computational time both the transient and steady state resonant performance of the fluid in narrow gaps are investigated based on the large scale model test results the gap widths in this study are of practical importance because they correspond to realistic 2 m 4 m and 8 m gap widths at full scale the agreement between the numerical simulations and the experimental data indicates the feasibility of the new version of the potential flow solver wadam which introduced an artificial term to take into account of the linear viscous damping and the adequacy of the damping approaches in waveload fd and hydrostar although the details of the implementations of damping in the three solvers are different the net effect of these damping models are very similar it should be noted that the two vessel models are fixed during the model tests and hence we have tackled a pure diffraction problem in the numerical simulations we applied the same damping coefficients for the different gap resonance modes for simplicity providing satisfactory agreement with the experimental data for the cases of interest acknowledgement this work was funded by the research and development grant from the university of western australia uwa and the arc industrial

23535,side by side offloading is becoming a more and more important offshore operation where one vessel is moored alongside another one forming a narrow gap between them using different types of incident waves i e white noise waves transient wave groups and regular waves we investigated both the transient and steady state resonant responses of the fluid in narrow gaps at model scale the nonlinearity and uncertainties in obtaining the response amplitude operators raos of resonant fluid motions in narrow gaps are addressed it appears that transient wave group testing is a promising approach for the investigation of gap resonance problem because it avoids unwanted wave reflection induced by the limitation in the size of wave basins to predict the gap resonant raos numerically artificial damping is introduced into three different potential flow solvers to damp the otherwise over estimated free surface motions in narrow gaps the predicted raos which are based on the potential flow solvers with the addition of calibrated damping then show satisfactory agreement with the experimental data for a series of narrow gaps this result confirms the reliability of the potential flow solvers in predicting gap resonant response at model scale for narrow gap widths that are relevant to engineering practice keywords hydrodynamics gap resonance transient wave group flng 1 introduction floating liquefied natural gas flng facilities are a new type of offshore structure these are being developed as a game changer in offshore hydrocarbon development to unlock stranded gas reserves zhao et al 2011 one of the key challenges is the product offloading operation which may proceed with vessels in a side by side configuration reliable offloading is essential for successful flng implementation in the side by side scenarios one of the floating bodies is moored alongside the other one forming a gap that is very narrow relative to the principal dimensions of the flng and carrier the fluid inside the narrow gap may experience significant resonant response when excited at particular wave frequencies the practical importance of the gap resonance is unclear at the moment due to the difficulties in predicting the magnitude of the gap resonance this leads on to difficulties in accurate prediction of the second order forces when conducting the waterline integral part of that force calculation investigations into the steady state response of the gap resonance phenomenon have been done both in 2d e g faltinsen et al 2007 lu et al 2011 and 3d e g pauw et al 2007 molin et al 2009 dinoi et al 2014 while many research efforts into the gap resonant response have been undertaken the majority concentrated on analysis of the maximum gap resonant amplitude at steady state in regular waves however real ocean waves are never regular and reaching steady state is not straightforward in tank experiments due to the long time for the gap resonance to build up to its maximum amplitude by which time reflected waves from the edges of the tank may affect the experiments actually the time required for the gap resonance to build up to steady state is also a challenge for time domain simulations as demonstrated by watai et al 2015 this is associated with the main characteristic of the gap resonance as a very low damped phenomenon to overcome the challenges of achieving a steady state response there is interest in the behaviour of the fluid in the gap in transient wave groups as considered by eatock taylor et al 2008 who numerically simulated the gap resonant response under focused wave groups based on linear potential flow theory the frequencies and mode shapes of the gap resonances can be well predicted using the approach given by molin et al 2002 whose solution is an extension of that for the moon pool problem molin 2001 a comprehensive numerical study of the frequencies mode shapes and response amplitudes for the gap resonances in between two fixed boxes was made by sun et al 2010 using potential flow theory it is well known that potential flow theory predicts significantly larger responses than are observed in physical experiments e g faltinsen et al 2007 pauw et al 2007 much work suggests that the viscosity is the main source of the discrepancy between linear potential flow theory and experimental data molin et al 2009 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 feng and bai 2015 carried out fully nonlinear numerical simulations without including viscosity and reported that nonlinearity may induce slight shifts in the resonant frequency similar to the well known resonant frequency shift observed for a nonlinear spring though with rather limited effect on the amplitude many methods have been proposed to improve the level of agreement between potential flow calculations and physical model test results for instance huijsmans et al 2001 suppressed vertical motion in the gap completely by introducing a rigid lid newman 2001 split the gap motion into generalized modes allowing different damping rates for each motion and chen 2005 introduced a dissipative damping term in the free surface condition by introducing an additional damping term all methods seem to be able to achieve good agreement with experimental data but the selection of the additional damping coefficient is generally empirical a robust method of estimating this damping is of significant importance for practical applications because it would allow for estimates of gap resonance efficiently using the linear potential flow theory the majority of the existing studies focused on the resonant response of the fluid in gaps which were not sufficiently narrow to be representative of practical flng offloading operations for instance fournier et al 2006 investigated the gap resonance surface elevations based on gap widths of 20 m and 30 m at full scale however a typical side by side offloading may have a mean gap width of 4 m between vessels exceeding 200 m in length thus there is an emerging need to investigate the characteristics of the resonant response of the fluid in such narrow gaps as mentioned above gap resonant performance under transient wave group excitations is also of interest which avoids the challenge of achieving a steady state response both in numerical simulations and experiments in light of this we carried out an extensive set of experiments to investigate the gap resonant response under excitations of regular waves white noise waves and focused transient wave groups the so called newwave zhao et al 2017 the response amplitude operators rao of the gap resonance are obtained from the three different types of wave excitation these raos are then used to validate the numerical predictions using three different potential flow solvers i e wadam hydrostar and waveload fd each uses a different method to introduce artificial damping in the narrow gaps 2 experimental set up model tests were carried out in the deepwater wave basin at shanghai jiao tong university china at the scale of 1 60 to focus on the gap resonance and simplify the study we selected two identical rectangular boxes to represent a side by side moored two body system at model scale each model is 3 333 m long 0 425 m high 0 767 m wide and the gap width is set as 0 033 m 0 066 m and 0 132 m respectively at full scale it represents a vessel of 200 m long 25 5 m high and 46 m wide and the gap width is 2 m 4 m and 8 m respectively it should be noted that the geometry of the vessel models in this study has been simplified so are not directly applicable to any engineering project however the results here should provide a database for the validation of numerical models and the simplicity of the geometry allows a fundamental understanding of gap resonance to be developed at the same time this study will demonstrate the advantage of using transient focused wave groups for gap resonance which is a very slightly damped phenomenon during the model tests the two identical boxes were fixed to a gantry which provided enough stiffness to hold them rigidly in place the experimental set up is illustrated in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 the vessel models have round corners at both bilges each with a radius of 0 083 m running along the full length the two boxes are fixed together and immersed to a draft of 0 185 m alongside each other a more detailed description of the experimental set up was reported in a previous study zhao et al 2017 prior to the experiments all the waves including white noise waves regular waves and transient focused wave groups were calibrated as the latter two types of wave test results will be discussed in detail in the following sections we just provide the calibrated spectra of the white noise waves here in fig 2 two white noise wave records were generated in the wave basin one with the significant wave height of 42 mm and the other 84 mm it should be noted in fig 2 that the larger white noise wave has a narrower spectral bandwidth than the smaller one this is because it is very hard to achieve the high wave energy distribution at high frequency the white noise waves were generated for 25 min which after removing an incident transient phase corresponded to 23 24 min at model scale is equivalent to 3 h at full scale the white noise waves may not be realistic of ocean wave spectra but they are an efficient way to obtain the raos and the broad bandwidth of the spectrum is able to trigger several gap resonant modes in the same test 3 artificial damping to potential flow solvers within the scope of potential flow theory the velocity potential φ must satisfy both the laplace equation and a series of boundary conditions to avoid repeating the basic theory which can be found in many textbooks on hydrodynamics we focus on the discussion of the linearized free surface boundary conditions where viscous damping effects are commonly introduced in industry standard potential flow solvers the kinematic free surface condition requires that the fluid particles should remain on the free surface the linearized form of this boundary condition is given by 1 η t φ z where η refers to the water surface the linearized dynamic free surface condition from the bernoulli equation is given by 2 φ t 1 ρ p ρ g η c t where p is the pressure acting on the free surface and the constant term c t is independent of the space coordinates but may depend on time the pressure term has been used in the study of oscillating water column wave energy devices wang and falzarano 2013 by assuming that the viscous forces acting in the gap have an uniform damping effect on the piston like fluid response additional viscous damping effect can be taken into account markeng 2015 this may be true for a piston like resonant response but the fluid resonant motions in a 3 d gap is a superposition of a series of resonant modes which destroys the uniform pressure assumption the constant term c t can be absorbed into the velocity potential φ φ 0 t c t d t introducing a difference between φ and φ depending on time but the spatial gradients are not affected thus the value of c t is related to a corresponding constant in the velocity potential which has no effect on the velocity vector and thus it can be chosen arbitrarily newman 1977 we can therefore simply set c t p 0 ρ where p 0 is the atmosphere pressure on the free surface therefore eq 2 can be simplified into the form 3 φ t g η 0 the combination of the kinematic and dynamic free surface condition gives the following form 4 φ t t g φ z z 0 3 1 artificial damping in wadam a viscous damping effect as in the newtonian cooling method israeli and orszag 1981 kim 2003 can be introduced into the linear kinematic free surface condition with the dynamic condition retained as in eq 3 in this case eq 1 will be re written as 5 η t φ z μ 1 η μ 2 g φ where the two terms μ 1 and μ 2 are the introduced artificial damping as a result of the form of eq 5 it is clear that the extra viscous damping introduced has a linear form eq 3 can be further modified as 6 1 g φ t t φ z μ 1 g φ t μ 2 g φ 0 by re writing φ into the form of φ ϕ e i ω t we obtain φ t t ω 2 φ φ t i ω φ and φ z k φ where k is the wavenumber eq 6 can then be re written as 7 ω 2 g k i μ 1 ω μ 2 0 the solution of which can be given as 8 ω g k 1 μ 2 g k μ 1 2 4 g k i μ 1 2 to retain the linear dispersion relation for the real part of the frequency we set 4 μ 2 μ 1 2 0 in such a scenario μ 2 should be a negative value marked here as μ 2 ε 1 2 as a result eq 5 can be written as 9 η t φ z 2 ε 1 η ε 1 2 g φ where the first damping term is used to damp the free surface elevations in the gap and the second damping term is much smaller and is included to keep the linear dispersion relation unchanged as shown in eq 8 submitting eq 3 dynamic into eq 9 kinematic the free surface condition can be re written in the time independent form 10 ϕ z ϕ g ω 2 i 2 ε 1 ω ε 1 2 which is further written as follows 11 ϕ z k ϕ 1 i 2 μ μ 2 where μ ε 1 ω and k ω 2 g of course eq 11 is only adopted for the free surface in the gap to show the relationship of the damping coefficients used in different solvers we define d 2 μ where μ is a tuneable input parameter implemented in wadam 2016 and d is the non dimensional coefficient applied to the damping term 3 2 artificial damping in hydrostar in hydrostar damping is introduced by assuming an additional small internal force is applied to every fluid particle in addition to the effect of gravity which is given as 12 f ε 2 φ where ε 2 is assumed to be positive and small although f is introduced to dissipate energy to account for fluid viscosity it does not introduce any vorticity so that the assumption of irrotational flow and the existence of a velocity potential is not affected the inviscid and irrotational fluid with the dissipative force f can be described as a fairly perfect fluid chen 2004 incorporating the additional force the momentum equation in the fairly perfect fluid is written as 13 t 1 2 φ φ p ρ g z ε 2 φ the linearized dynamic free surface condition is thus written as 14 g η φ t ε 2 φ 0 this modified dynamic free surface condition eq 14 combined with the kinematic free surface condition in eq 1 give 15 φ z 1 g φ t t ε 2 φ t 0 using the assumption of φ ϕ e i ω t we can obtain the following equation which is similar to eq 7 16 ω 2 g k i ε 2 ω 0 from eq 16 one can see that the introduced artificial damping term does not affect the linear dispersion relation submitting eq 14 dynamic into eq 1 kinematic the free surface condition can be re written in the time independent form 17 ϕ z ϕ g ω 2 i ε 2 ω ω 2 g ϕ 1 i ε 2 ω where the damping coefficient ε 2 should be divided by ω so as to be a non dimensional parameter again eq 17 is only adopted for the part of the free surface in the gap in hydrostar finally it is worth noting that the damping coefficient ε 2 ς 2 ς where ς is the input parameter in hydrostar to facilitate comparisons later we denote d ε 2 ω ς 2 ς ω where d is the non dimensional coefficient applied to the damping term in hydrostar 3 3 artificial damping in waveload fd the method of introducing artificial damping in waveload fd 2017 is rather similar to but still slightly different from those in wadam and hydrostar the combined free surface condition in eq 4 has the following form in the frequency domain 18 g ϕ z ω 2 ϕ 0 a small positive artificial damping ε 3 is introduced in the free surface condition in waveload fd for the velocity potential boundary value problem the linearized free surface condition with artificial damping for the velocity potential is the same as that in eq 15 as a result the free surface condition with artificial damping used in waveload fd is the same with that used in hydrostar eq 17 eq 17 is further re organized in the following form so as to adopt a non dimensional coefficient in calculations 19 ϕ z k ϕ 1 i ξ where ξ ε 3 ω and k ω 2 g one can see that ξ is a non dimensional coefficient the definition of which is similar to that in wadam ξ is the input parameter implemented in waveload fd similarly we can see that the actual non dimensional damping coefficient applied to the damping term is d ξ 3 4 summary of these artificial damping methods three damping methods are used in the three standard industry potential flow solvers wadam introduced the artificial damping through the kinematic free surface condition to keep the linear dispersion relation the two artificial damping parameters introduced are required to meet a certain relationship and thus finally merged into only one coefficient hydrostar introduced the artificial damping through the dynamic free surface condition while waveload fd used very similar method as in hydrostar it is worthwhile clarifying that the artificial damping coefficients used in wadam and waveload fd have been normalized e g eq 11 and eq 19 while it is not in hydrostar although the methods introducing artificial damping are slightly different the damped free surface condition provides similar forms e g eq 11 eq 17 and eq 19 as a result the damping parameters required to achieve good agreement with the experimental data should be consistent for the three different linear potential flow solvers so the non dimensional damping coefficient d of each should be similar one can see that introducing a damping coefficient into each of the potential flow solvers is only a mathematically convenient representation of the consequences of physical viscosity and the value of the damping coefficient introduced in this way does not have any direct physical meaning so it is different from the non dimensional damping coefficient a coefficient of total damping that is deduced usually by analysing a decaying free surface elevation however this way of introducing the damping coefficient used in the three potential flow solvers is the best engineering practice and thus a better understanding or discussion on the damping coefficient is valuable it should be noted that there are other ways of introducing the viscous effect such as introducing a damping coefficient into the complex response function as in eatock taylor and meylan 2007 and zhao et al 2018 4 results and discussion in the experiment tests the gap resonant response was investigated for three different gap widths 132 mm 66 mm and 33 mm at model scale which are of practical importance corresponding to 2 m 4 m and 8 m at full scale for the 66 mm gap width which corresponds a typical width 4 m at full scale of two floating vessels in side by side offloading operations the gap resonances were triggered by three different types of waves in the laboratory white noise irregular waves focused transient wave groups and regular waves for the 33 mm and 132 mm gap widths the gap resonances were excited by the white noise waves only yielding the corresponding raos for comparison to the calculated results 4 1 time history of the gap resonance at the centre of the gap during the model tests the same wave paddle signal records as measured in the calibration stage were used to generate white noise waves the surface elevations at the centre of the gap were measured at a sampling frequency of 25 hz fig 3 shows representative time histories of the surface elevations measured at the centre of the gap with and without the vessel models in place to investigate the transient gap resonant response we also generated a series of focused transient wave groups fig 4 shows the corresponding time histories where the underlying amplitude spectrum of the target focused transient wave group is gaussian and given by 22 s f h s 2 16 1 δ 2 π exp f f p 2 2 δ 2 where h s refers to an assumed significant wave height f p the peak frequency of the spectrum and δ 0 0775 hz the gap width for this case is 66 mm and the frequency of the first mode gap resonance is 1 02 hz the peak frequency of the incident wave spectrum is set as f p 1 02 hz in order to trigger the resonant response as shown in fig 4 the incident wave transient wave group only last about 6 s after the focal time while the gap resonance lasts for much longer and shows a strong beating pattern the beating pattern of the gap resonance time history is a result of the interference of the different modes set up in the gap each of which simply decays exponentially in time once the incident wave group has passed by a comprehensive decomposition of the transient gap resonant performance has been reported in our previous study zhao et al 2017 instead of focusing on the transient resonant behaviour in time in this study we use the transient wave group test results to estimate the raos to investigate the steady state gap resonant response several regular wave tests were also performed with the incident wave frequency fixed at f 1 02 hz and the input wave amplitude varied from η a 16 mm 32 mm 40 mm fig 5 shows the incident waves and the corresponding gap resonance normalized by the maximum incident wave amplitudes the regular wave results show clearly the long time required for the gap resonance to build up i e about 30 cycles for the small incident wave amplitude case as a consequence it is necessary to carry out regular wave tests for gap resonance problem in a wave basin with large size and with adequate wave damping so as to avoid the effects of reflected waves from the paddles or side and end walls contaminating steady state response the amplification factor reduced from 4 5 in the small incident wave case η a 16 mm 3 5 in the η a 32 mm case to 2 9 in the η a 40 mm case this may be a result of the nonlinearity in the damping of the gap resonance or could be due to the large size of the local free surface motion relative to the hull geometry the vertical flat part of the gap is 102 mm below calm water while the minimum surface elevation is 90 mm below calm water in η a 16 mm case 130 mm in η a 32 mm case and 150 mm in η a 40 mm case with a local amplification of 2 9 for the largest regular waves tested the minimum free surface level is roughly halfway down the curved region of the hull towards the bottom of the hull so significant local geometry changes will modify the local motion for this extreme surface displacement however it should be noted that the such large incident wave heights may not be of direct practical interest for side by side offloading operations for instance the η a 32 mm case corresponds to a wave height of 4 m at field scale while the operational limit on significant wave height for side by side offloading is likely to be less than 2 5 m one can always reduce the regular wave heights to the range of interest in a laboratory however measurement error may play a role as the wave height will be very small at model scale 1 60 to avoid such measurement errors the scaling factor could be decreased and thus a larger wave basin would be needed though the one we used is one of the largest wave basin in the world so one can see the disadvantage of using regular wave tests to investigate the gap resonance which is very slightly damped though regular waves have been widely and successfully applied for many other hydrodynamic problems to overcome this challenge the use of transient focused wave groups appears to be promising 4 2 raos obtained from the wave tests the raos are obtained from the three different types of incident waves as discussed above the raos are compared in fig 6 for the random wave tests one can see slight differences between the small significant wave height case h s 42 mm ω 2 10 r a d s and the larger significant wave height case h s 84 mm ω 2 7 r a d s the difference of the response peaks may be partially due to nonlinearity or it may be due to uncertainty underlining the spectral analysis e g the incident wave spectral density at the peak frequency happen to be much smaller than expected in one of the two cases when we generated waves in the wave basin the white noise spectrum was divided into 500 wave components thus the frequency intervals for the two cases δ ω 0 016 r a d s and δ ω 0 01 r a d s are pretty small the slight difference may also just be a result of the averaging process we found that the agreement could be improved when we changed the averaging parameters for the spectra obtained through fast fourier transforms fft however we used exactly the same parameters for the white noise wave test results obtained from the two wave height cases the white noise wave signals of 1400 s sampled at frequency of 25 hz were divided into a few 8 for white noise waves segments with 4096 data points in each the obtained spectra based on the each segment were then averaged to reduce the noise level in addition the averaged spectrum was then smoothed using a 5 point method one can see the slight shift of the peak frequency from the white noise wave test to the transient wave group test this may be due to the slight difference between the drafts of the vessel models we removed the vessel models from the wave basin after the white noise wave tests and then put it back for the transient wave group tests and regular wave tests the draft of the model might have a discrepancy of 1 mm over 185 mm due to the re installation of the model in the wave basin this small change is large enough to change the resonant frequencies slightly as discussed in zhao et al 2018 the gap resonance frequencies are very sensitive to the draft as shown in fig 6 the gap resonance raos decrease as the incident regular wave height increases as discussed above this is because the incident wave amplitudes are very large so nonlinearity and extra dissipation play a role but such large responses are out of the range of interest for side by side offloading operations as noted previously to provide clear information we mark the response amplitude cases with their incident wave amplitudes in fig 7 all for a frequency of 1 02 hz in this figure one can see that the amplitudes of the incident wave components and responses for the white noise wave tests and transient wave group tests are small and are located on the line representing a linear relationship the regular wave tests are far off from and well below a linear relationship 4 3 numerical prediction versus experimental data the gap resonance raos are numerically simulated in this section using linear potential flow theory based on three different potential solvers with artificial damping introduced to match the experimental data the theory describing each of the damping methods is discussed in section 3 the panel models adopted in the three different potential flow solvers are shown in fig 8 all the three potential flow solvers apply a low order formulation to obtain the solutions based on the boundary element method numerical simulations are carried out for the three different gap widths i e 33 mm 2 m at full scale 66 mm 4 m at full scale and 132 mm 8 m at full scale these numerically predicted results are then compared with the experimental data as has been reported previously chen 2005 eatock taylor et al 2008 standard linear potential flow theory over predicts the gap resonant response amplitudes as experimentally determined to avoid duplication and to provide a clear demonstration we only provide one set of the undamped gap resonance results in figs 9 11 extra damping is introduced to damp the unphysical gap resonance using standard linear potential theory the methods for which have been described in section 3 the predicted gap resonance raos at the centre of the gap are compared with the measured data for three gap widths in figs 9 11 it should be noted that when ignoring the extra viscous damping contributions the only damping is due to waves radiated to infinity so the calculated gap resonance amplitudes tend to infinity as the gap width decreases to zero however the experimental data strongly indicate that there is a gap width which gives the maximum gap resonance amplitude zhao et al 2018 as given in fig 9 μ and ξ are non dimensional independent input parameters while ς is an input parameter associated with frequencies ω therefore if one wants to provide the same net damping d ς 2 ς ω in section 3 2 in hydrostar for calculations at different scales the value of ς should be varied according to the scaling factor for instance ς 0 0818 obtained based on the numerical simulations at model scale say 1 60 will be equivalent to 0 0110 in simulations run at full scale while the parameters for μ and ξ will be unchanged it is worth noting that the three input parameters are actually consistent if they are transferred into the non dimensional damping coefficient d as shown in table 1 the blue dashed line in fig 9 is obtained from linear potential calculations without any extra viscous damping contribution the solid lines with extra linear damping and the black dots are experimental data points one can see that the predicted results agree extremely well with the experimental data for the 132 mm 8 m at full scale and 66 m 4 m at full scale gap widths the agreement for the narrowest gap width of 33 mm 2 m at full scale is less satisfactory at the higher gap resonant modes it is expected in the boundary element method that 5 panels over a wavelength should be fine enough to provide reasonable results and panel density larger than 12 per wavelength should be sufficient to guarantee convergence we checked the numerical computations and the results converged for the narrowest gap the match to experiment is less satisfactory possibly because viscous damping becomes more important than potential flow radiation damping as the gap width gets extremely small i e the smallest gap width of 33 mm it should also be noted that we adopted uniform damping coefficients for each of the different gap resonant modes in this study while they may be noticeably different in reality we assume that the agreement will be improved when applying suitable damping coefficients at different gap resonant modes however the agreements for the 66 mm and 132 mm gap width cases are very good in general suggesting that introducing a uniform damping coefficient into the potential flow model is able to provide satisfactory numerical predictions of the resonant response for gap widths of practical interest as discussed earlier the extra damping introduced into the linear potential solver is linear it works well for the cases in this study because viscous damping of the gap resonance for these cases may be a result of stokes laminar boundary layers zhao et al 2017 2018 where the damping is actually linear however it may not be applicable to any cases with substantial vortex shedding at field scale the viscous boundary layer characteristics may be in a different regime turbulent rather than laminar but the analysis here is likely to provide at least upper estimates on the gap resonant responses when scaled up to practical cases one may note from figs 9 11 that the input parameters at different solvers are different to each other though they have achieved similar agreement with the same experimental data as discussed in the previous section they are actually consistent when these input parameters are transferred into the form of the non dimensional damping term d as illustrated in table 1 the data in table 1 suggest that the maximum difference of d between the three potential flow solvers is 0 0074 0 0050 0 0074 32 0 0117 0 0093 0 0117 20 and 0 0152 0 0136 0 0152 11 for the gap width of 132 mm 66 mm and 33 mm respectively through the comparison of the d values in the different solvers one can see that the raos are less sensitive or show more tolerance to the values of the imposed damping coefficients for wider gaps 5 conclusion the resonant responses of the fluid in narrow gaps are investigated both numerically and experimentally for cases where the two identical vessel models forming the narrow gaps are fixed the main conclusions are as follows for narrow gaps it takes many periods for the gap resonance to build up to reach a steady state response correspondingly there is a very long decay time for the gap resonance once excited the spectral shape of the gap resonance modes is very spiky hence a very small shift in the frequency of the incident wave from the resonant peak will lead to a significant reduction of the response due to mis tuning artificial damping is introduced to 3 potential flow solvers to account for the viscous damping effect using three industry standard potential flow solvers with artificial damping the calculated raos of the free surface elevations in the gap agree very well with the experimental at least for the cases of interest i e gap widths of 4 m and 8 m for the extremely narrow gap case 2 m in full scale more damping is needed to preferentially dampen the higher modes of the gap resonance for the resonant motion of fluid in narrow gaps which are of practical interests testing with transient focused wave groups appears to be promising this avoids the contamination from reflected waves in the existing wave basin facilities and thus the measured signal is more reliable furthermore short duration experiments are ideal for serving as benchmark cases for cfd simulations saving much computational time both the transient and steady state resonant performance of the fluid in narrow gaps are investigated based on the large scale model test results the gap widths in this study are of practical importance because they correspond to realistic 2 m 4 m and 8 m gap widths at full scale the agreement between the numerical simulations and the experimental data indicates the feasibility of the new version of the potential flow solver wadam which introduced an artificial term to take into account of the linear viscous damping and the adequacy of the damping approaches in waveload fd and hydrostar although the details of the implementations of damping in the three solvers are different the net effect of these damping models are very similar it should be noted that the two vessel models are fixed during the model tests and hence we have tackled a pure diffraction problem in the numerical simulations we applied the same damping coefficients for the different gap resonance modes for simplicity providing satisfactory agreement with the experimental data for the cases of interest acknowledgement this work was funded by the research and development grant from the university of western australia uwa and the arc industrial

values of h s and h max can be as important as other sources of uncertainties induced by for example the generation of extreme waves in numerical and physical models the lengths of scale models scale effects and force measurements at physical models e g reis et al 2008 frostick et al 2011 oliveira et al 2017 marzeddu et al 2017 in this regard probabilistic models for h s h max and h max h s under storm conditions would enable to make more informed choices when it comes to designing and testing marine structures on the other hand to meet the safety design challenge in such very harsh environmental as the portuguese coast requires a thorough evaluation of many different wave parameters then it is thought wave variability characterization for storm conditions would be very useful in the management of structures during their design life in this paper we aim to answer the following scientific questions i what is the variability of the main wave parameters and h max h s relationship under storm conditions in the portuguese mainland coast ii what is the dependence of h max h s on θ m σ θ t z h s and h max under storm conditions specifically we want to understand and model the values of θ m σ θ t z h s h max and h max h s which were recorded in situ under storm conditions at the same time we want to contribute to the global understanding of the long term variability of h m a x h s under storm conditions in order to reach our goal first we analyze wave data recorded in three different locations along the portuguese mainland coast leixões sines and faro under storm conditions then we model based on known probability distribution functions pdfs the variability of the different wave parameters analyzed finally we analyzed the dependence of h max h s on θ m σ θ t z h s and h max the layout of this paper is the following section 2 describes firstly how when and where wave data was collected and secondly how wave data was analyzed in section 3 we present the results here we start by introducing the number of storms and storm duration for the analyzed periods then we present the variability of θ m σ θ t z h s h max and h max h s and analyze the dependence of h max h s on the different wave parameters in section 4 we discuss the results presented in section 3 finally in section 5 the paper ends with the main conclusions 2 methodology 2 1 observations the acquisition of wave data in the portuguese mainland coast has been a constant activity of instituto hidrografico ih www hidrografico pt since 1980 currently ih has three directional wave buoys offshore of leixões sines and faro see fig 1 where data have been collected during the last decades ih installed its first directional wave buoy in september 1986 in faro at 93 m water depth later in may 1988 a directional wave buoy was installed in sines at 97 m water depth almost a decade later in july 1996 leixões buoy started recording data at 83 m water depth previous to directional wave buoys ih had non directional wave buoys working in sines and figueira da foz from 1980 to 1988 and 1981 to 1990 respectively figueira da foz buoy located approximately 100 km south of leixões buoy was decommissioned in january 1996 our work focuses on data collected by the directional wave buoys of leixões sines and faro since the beginning of each buoy data collection until december 2015 in total 19 27 and 28 years of data are analyzed for leixões sines and faro respectively during these considered periods a small number of unregistered data episodes occurred due to occasional failure of the buoys more specifically unregistered data incidents could be caused by repair or replacement of buoys transmission failure or damaged by storms or collisions the mean percentage of unregistered data during the analyzed period ranged between 16 in sines and 19 in faro and leixões most of the unregistered periods occurred during the first decade of measurements see fig 2 ih buoys are equipped with sensors that measure the vertical and horizontal acceleration of sea surface water temperature at the sea surface and the position of the buoy data is transmitted by modem to ih offices where it is subsequently subjected to an elaborate quality control processed and stored in a database presently ih buoys acquire periodically 30 min time series at 1 28 hz under normal sea conditions the interval between acquired time series is 3 h however this interval decreases to 30 min under storm conditions ih classifies a sea state as a storm event whenever h s exceeds 4 5 m on the west coast leixões and sines buoys and 2 5 m on the south coast faro buoy these h s values correspond approximately to two times the annual mean h s at each respective location once received and validated time series are subject to standard treatment by ih which aims at estimating the characteristic wave parameters both in time and frequency domain for each observation period time series the parameters obtained by ih which are studied in this work can be defined as significant wave height h s the mean wave height of the highest third waves in general it agrees quite well with the human visual evaluation of the mean wave height maximum wave height h m a x the maximum wave height mean period t z the average wave period zero upcrossing mean wave direction θ m the mean wave direction corresponding to the peak period calculated through spectral analysis it represents the direction of propagation of the most energetic waves here it is measured from the north clockwise ºn directional dispersion σ θ the directional width in the peak period 2 2 data analysis only data recording during storms events is considered in our work for that we define a storm event as a period of consecutive sea states in which h s exceeds a predefined threshold during a minimum period of 6 h to guarantee that successive storms are independent a minimum storm inter event separation of 6 h is considered the threshold for h s is defined as 4 5 m for sines and leixões west coast and 2 5 m for faro south coast we analyze and characterize wave storminess in leixões sines and faro based on i number of storms and storm duration ii θ m and σ θ iii t z iv h s and h max iv h max h s when analyzing h max h s we also investigate its dependence on θ m σ θ t z h s and h max storms in faro are divided into atlantic storms mean storm wave direction greater than 180ºn and levante storms mean storm wave direction smaller than 180ºn the reason for this division is because storms characteristics in faro mainly depend on where they are generated almeida et al 2011 2012 levante storms are mainly generated somewhere between the strait of gibraltar and gulf of cadiz on the other hand faro atlantic storms are primarily generated in the north atlantic so from herein we will consider four storm datasets i leixões ii sines iii faro atlantic and iv faro levante starting by analyzing the number and duration of storms at each of the three buoys we define the size of each wave storm dataset we highlight that as each buoy had a different operational period and a particular storm threshold different sizes are expected for the four storm datasets our storm duration analysis includes the total storm duration and the duration until the peak of storm i e the time between the beginning of the storm and the moment of maximum values of h m a x and h s during the storm this is because the duration until the peak of storm can provide useful information for the operationally and design of marine structure e g melby and kobayashi 1998 martín soldevilla et al 2015 for the analyzed directional wave related parameters θ m σ θ wave period parameters t z and wave height related parameters h s h max h max h s a series of parametric distributions are tested to find which distribution fit best the storm datasets the fitting process takes into account exponential extreme value generalized extreme value gev generalized pareto log logistic t location scale and weibull probability density functions we select the best distribution using the bayesian information criterion bic 3 results 3 1 number of storms and storm duration the annual number of storms varied over the years in the four storm datasets see fig 3 a in total the number of storms recorded in leixões and sines was 167 and 101 respectively in faro a total of 177 storms 64 from levante and 113 from atlantic occurred the number of storms per year in sines ranged between zero with no storms measured in 1995 and 2004 to 13 storms registered in 2014 similarly 2014 was the year with more storms measured at leixões 23 storms while 2001 was the only year with no storms in leixões however we should notice that leixões buoy was not operational 72 of the time during the winter months of 2001 see fig 2 then most likely the buoy missed some storms during that period faro had no storms recorded in 1993 and a maximum of 16 storms recorded in 1996 which 14 were categorized as faro atlantic storms for faro levante the maximum number of storms per year was 5 1990 2002 2008 and 2011 and no storms were registered in 1993 1994 1998 and 2004 however most of the years in which no storms were observed also correspond to years with large amounts of missing data see fig 2 leixões and sines s storms mostly occurred between november and february see fig 3b faro atlantic storms concentrated between october and march faro levante storms occurred principally between december and march january and february are the months with the highest average number of storms per month in leixões 1 52 and sines 0 90 and 0 86 december and march present the highest average number of storms per month for faro atlantic 1 17 and faro levante 0 67 respectively see fig 3b december 2013 to february 2014 was the period with more consecutive storms measured in leixões 20 and sines 14 the number of storms in function of their total duration varies from north to south datasets and in particular between the west leixões and sines to the south faro atlantic and faro levante coast datasets see fig 4 storms no longer than 1 5 days represent 81 86 and 87 of all the storms in leixões sines and faro respectively in leixões and sines the longest storms lasted 4 3 days starting on 17 january 2009 at 22 00 hereafter all times in utc 00 00 and 3 6 days starting on 16 december 1989 at 00 00 respectively while the longest storm in faro atlantic and faro levante lasted 5 2 days starting on 3 march 2013 at 21 00 and 2 5 days starting on 31 march 1995 respectively leixões storms were longer considering the average storm duration between december and february see fig 4c similarly sines storms were longer between november and january both faro atlantic and levante storms were longer between november and march the duration until the maximum of h m a x and h s see fig 5 was less than 1 day in more than 90 of the storms in the four storm datasets durations to the peak of storm larger than 2 days are very rare with a maximum frequency of 1 8 for faro atlantic storms no storms with durations to storm peak higher than 2 days were registered for sines and faro levante storms at the four storm datasets few storms occurred in which the peak of the storm arises at the beginning of the storm this statement is valid both considering the maximum of h m a x as well the maximum of h s during the storm table 1 summarizes the total duration of the storms and the duration until the maximum of h m a x and h s due to the different operational periods of each buoy and different storm duration characteristics of each storm dataset the total number of dataset points sea states is distinct in the four storm dataset table 2 summarizes the total number of storms total duration of storms and the number of dataset points for each storm dataset the number of dataset points ranges between 1665 for faro levante storms and 6150 for storms recorded by leixões buoy as previously mentioned one data set point corresponds to a resume of a 30 min sea state recorded during a storm these dataset points are the basis for the analyses performed in the next sections then sea states recorded during storms with h s smaler than the h s storm thresholds are not considered here 3 2 mean wave direction and directional dispersion looking at the whole dataset points recorded under storm conditions leixões registered θ m varying from 200 to 336ºn while sines presented a slightly narrow band of directions 209 to 319ºn see fig 6 faro as expected presents two different main quadrants of θ m between 82 and 238ºn levante storms and between 112 and 270ºn atlantic storms in leixões 97 2 of θ m concentrated in the slightly intervale between w and nnw in sines θ m mostly concentrated between w and nw with 95 1 of the total occurrences for faro levante storms 86 5 of θ m concentrated between ese and se while for faro atlantic storms the range was wider with 92 6 of the storms being between ssw and w hence the most representative θ m progressively rotate anticlockwise from north to south locations on the west coast leixões and faro and from southwest to southeast storms on the south coast faro the variability of θ m under storm conditions can be described for leixões sines and faro atlantic storms datasets by an extreme value distribution 1 q θ m 1 σ e x p θ m μ σ e x p e x p θ m μ σ where q θ m is the probability density function σ is the scale parameter and μ is the location parameter faro levante storms dataset best fits a t location scale distribution 2 q θ m ν 1 2 σ ν π γ ν 2 ν θ m μ σ 2 ν ν 1 2 where γ is the gamma function and ν is the shape parameter parameters of best fit distributions for θ m are summarized in fig 6 in summary we can see that the range and variability of θ m is different in the four datasets in what concerns to σ θ under storm conditions see fig 7 leixões faro atlantic and faro levante registered similar minimum and maximum values approximately 10 and 59 while sines presented slightly smaller values 8 and 42 the directional distributions mostly concentrated between 10 and 25 at leixões and sines 89 of occurrences instead for faro atlantic and faro levante σ θ mostly concentrated between 15 and 30 with 82 and 85 of occurrences respectively a log logistic distribution can describe the variability of σ θ q σ θ under storm conditions for leixões sines faro atlantic and faro levante and is given by 3 q σ θ 1 σ 1 σ θ e z 1 e z 2 where 4 z l o g σ θ μ σ 3 3 mean period sines presented the highest value of t z recorded under storm conditions 17 8 s see fig 8 while faro levante presented the smallest maximum value 8 s results show that t z mostly concentrated between 8 and 12 s at leixões 88 and sines 90 for faro atlantic and faro levante t z mostly 86 concentrated between 6 and 8 s t z variability follows a gev distribution type iii for the four storm datasets then the probability density function for t z q t z is given by 5 q t z 1 σ 1 k t z μ σ 1 1 k e x p 1 k t z μ σ 1 k where k is the shape parameter although represented by the same pdf distribution the range and variability of t z is only similar between leixões and sines 3 4 significant and maximum wave height the maximum h s recorded under storm conditions was 9 2 and 9 1 m in leixões and sines respectively see fig 9 these maximums were recorded on march 3 2014 at 16 00 in leixões and on january 6 2014 at 21 00 in sines in faro the maximum h s was 6 4 m recorded on december 22 2000 at 4 01 and 5 3 m recorded on december 19 2007 at 7 09 to atlantic and levante storms respectively in leixões the mean h s and the standard deviation were slightly higher than in sines and both were higher than faro atlantic and faro levante as expected during the storms recorded in leixões aproximatly 10 of the sea states presented an hs 6 6 m and aproximatly 20 an hs 6 1 m in sines these values are slightly smaller with 10 of the sea states presenting an hs 6 2 m and 20 presenting an hs 5 8 m in faro these values are even smaller than leixões and sines while 10 of the sea states presented an hs 3 9 and 3 8 m to atlantic and levante storms respectively furthermore 20 of the sea states in faro presented an h s 3 6 and 3 5 m for atlantic and levante storms respectively the variability of h s q h s under storm conditions can be described by a generalized pareto distribution 6 q h s 1 σ 1 k h s θ σ 1 1 k where θ is the threshold parameter which corresponds to the h s thresholds used to define the beginning of a storm the range and variability of h s diverge from the west leixões and sines to the south faro atlantic and faro levant coast datasets sines buoy recorded on february 10 2014 at 00 30 the highest h m a x of the three analized buoys 17 3 m see fig 10 in that same day leixões buoy recorded a maximum h m a x of 12 7 m however the maximum h m a x recorded in leixões was 16 4 m and occurred on october 31 2003 at 14 34 in faro the maximum h m a x was recorded on december 22 2000 at 4 01 and on march 16 2003 at 15 25 for atlantic and levante storms respectively during the storms recorded in leixões 10 of the sea states presented an hmax 11 0 m and 20 hmax 10 0 m at sines these values are smaller with 10 and 20 of the sea states presenting hmax 10 4 and 9 6 m respectively for faro 10 of the sea states presented an hmax 6 6 and 6 5 m and 20 of the sea states presented hmax 6 1 and 6 0 m for faro atlantic and faro levante respectively h m a x variability follows a gev distribution type ii in the four storm datasets the probability density function for h m a x can then be given by 7 q h m a x 1 σ 1 k h m a x μ σ 1 1 k e x p 1 k h m a x μ σ 1 k similarly to h s the range and variability of h m a x diverge from the west to the south coast datasets fig 11 presents the exceedance probabilities of h m a x from field data and from the best fitted distributions as can be seen the maximum values are well represented by the pdf distribution for sines and faro alantic however for leixões and faro levante the distribution overpredicts these values 3 5 hmax hs the variability of h m a x h s present small differences between the four storm datasets see fig 12 in leixões and sines the minimum h m a x h s ratio recorded was 1 16 but the maximum is slightly higher at leixões 2 47 than in sines 2 44 the mean h m a x h s ratio was very similar in both locations and the standard deviation was the same 0 16 during the storms recorded in both leixões and sines 10 of the sea states presented an h m a x h s 1 83 and for 20 of the sea states presented an h m a x h s 1 74 m faro storms presented maximum minimum and mean values of h m a x h s ratios higher than in leixões and sines faro atlantic h m a x h s maximum is higher than in faro levante however the mean and minimum values are smaller in faro atlantic than for faro levante in faro atlantic and levante 10 of the sea states presented an h m a x h s 1 88 and 1 91 respectively moreover 20 of the sea states registered an h m a x h s 1 79 and 1 81 in faro atlantic and faro levante storms respectively individual waves higher than two times the corresponding h s called by mori and janssen 2006 by freak waves occurred in 2 of the sea states recorded in sines and leixões and in 4 of the sea states of faro atlantic and levante storms h m a x h s follows a gev distribution type iii for the four datasets then the probability density function for the ratio h m a x h s q h m a x h s is given by 8 q h m a x h s 1 σ 1 k h m a x h s μ σ 1 1 k e x p 1 k h m a x h s μ σ 1 k fig 13 presents the exceedance probabilities of h m a x h s from field data and from the best fitted distribution the maximum values are well represented by the pdf distribution for leixões sines and faro levante for faro atlantic the distribution under predict the maximum values in what concerns the dependence of h m a x h s on θ m σ θ t z and h s there are no obvious trends in the four storm dataset however it is possible to observe that the range of h m a x h s values increases with the increases of h m a x in the four storm datasets see fig 14 both the maximum and minimum h m a x h s values associated to a specific h m a x increase linearaly with h m a x the maximums h m a x h s associated to a specific h m a x is limited by the h s thresholds h s t h r e s h o l d used to define a sea state as a storm more specifically the maximums h m a x h s associated to a specific h m a x is given by h m a x h s t h r e s h o l d 4 discussion according to rusu et al 2008 the northern hemisphere winter of 2000 2001 was an unusual very energetic winter at sines our analysis also confirms this fact however we found that the northern hemisphere winter of 2013 2014 posterior to the study of rusu et al 2008 was the winter with more in situ storms recorded in the portuguese west coast and one of most intense in the south coast in accordance with our results scott et al 2016 and masselink et al 2016 also referred the northern hemisphere winter of 2013 2014 as a special extreme season on the west coast of europe a large number of worldwide observations have been used as standard values for directional dispersion models e g young et al 1996 ewans 1998 our analysis shows that the variability of the directional dispersion in the peak period is very similar in sines and leixões and values are in the range of values observed by young et al 1996 and ewans 1998 however very few sea states in leixões presented not typical higher directional dispersion with a maximum of 59 directional dispersion is similar for both faro levante and atlantic storms and in general is greater than that observed in sines and leixões in this regard it is most likely to see directional dispersion in faro higher than those found by young et al 1996 and ewans 1998 pita and abecasis 1998 investigated data from two nondirectional buoys deployed offshore of sines at 50 and 100 m water depth the authors analyzed 18 years data starting on 1981 and considering storm conditions when h s was larger than 5 m at one of the two bouys comparing pita and abecasis 1998 results with our results in which a longer period from 1989 to 2015 and a different definition of a storm h s 4 5 m is consider we find a higher maximum value of h m a x 17 3 instead of 14 7 m previous found and a maximum of h s smaller 9 1 instead of 9 6 m the most frequent class of h m a x also reduces from 10 3 10 7 m to 8 8 5 m however the most frequent class of h s 5 3 5 7 m is almost identical consequently in what concerns to average values of h m a x h s pita and abecasis 1998 found smaller values 1 5 1 6 than those found in this study 1 67 as expected these comparisons shows the importance of long term wave storm characterization based on in situ measurements to determine hystorical maximum wave heights values feng et al 2014b found that norwegian sea observations of h m a x and h s follow a weibull distribution which performs well also for representing non extreme wave heights however for the continental portuguese coast we found that a generalized pareto and gev type ii distribution best fit h m a x and h s variability respectively in feng et al 2014a and 2014b investigations in which ten years of in situ wave data from the norwegian sea was analyzed a weibull distribution was chosen to represent h m a x h s variability however in our study the best fit pdf distribution for h m a x h s was a gev type iii feng et al 2014a and 2014b also referred the importance of long term observations on the evaluation of the statistical distributions that better fit maximum wave height data unlike our study feng et al investigations were focused on every single sea state condition rather than sea states under storm conditions moreover the authors worked with a 10 years dataset which corresponds to a shorter period than the analyzed in this study in our work the percentage of sea states with h m a x h s 2 was found to be 2 in leixões and sines and 4 in faro atlantic and faro levante whereas for the norwegian sea a percentage smaler than 1 was found the same standard deviation for h m a x h s 0 16 was found by feng et al 2014b and in our work for the four storm datasets 5 conclusions in this article we studied wave storminess in the portuguese continental coast based on long term in situ measurements we analyzed almost three decades of data from three directional wave buoys from which four storm datasets were created i leixões ii sines iii faro atlantic and iv faro levante we aimed to understand the variability of the main wave parameters and h max h s relationship under storm conditions furthermore to understand the dependence of h max h s on θ m σ θ t z h s and h max the number of sea states analyzed highly ranged between 1665 for faro levante storms and 6150 for storms recorded in leixões we provide probability distribution functions for θ m σ θ t z h s and h max for the four storm datasets in this regard we conclude that the range and variability of these wave parameters is i different in the four datasets for θ m ii different between west and south coast for σ θ h s and h max iii different between west coast faro atlantic and faro levante for t z despite the differences in the lengths of the four datasets analyzed and the differences found in the range and variability for θ m σ θ t z h s and h max we found that the range and variability of h m a x h s are very similar in the four dataset in this regard gev distributions type iii with very similar shape parameters can be used to represent the variability of h m a x h s for leixões sines faro atlantic and faro levante storms we did not find apparent dependence of h m a x h s on θ m σ θ t z h s however we observed that the range of h m a x h s values increases with the increases of h m a x both the maximum and minimum h m a x h s value associated to a specific h m a x increase linearaly with h m a x moreover the maximum h m a x h s observed for a specific h m a x is limited by the h s thresholds used to define a sea state as a storm practically the probabilistic models proposed in this work would enable ocean engineers and scientists to make more informed choices when it comes to the studying of among others the hydraulic behavior of marine structures erosion processes and wave energy potential in the portuguese continental coast moreover the results presented here can contribute to the global understanding of the long term variability of h m a x h s under storm conditions 
23536,the relevance of long term wave storm characterization based on in situ measurements extends from marine ecosystems management to the design of ocean engineering structures we analyze wave storms recorded over almost three decades 1988 2015 in three points offshore the portuguese continental coast located between 83 and 97 m water depth we provide probability distribution functions for mean wave direction θ m directional wave spreading σ θ significant wave height h s maximum wave height h max mean wave period t z and h max h s relationship based on four storm datasets in the highly energetic portuguese west coast leixões and sines h max and h max h s ranged between 5 5 and 17 3 m and 1 16 to 2 47 respectively we conclude that a gev distribution can represent h max and h max h s variability at the three analyzed locations despite the differences in the dataset lengths and the differences in the range and variability of θ m σ θ t z h s and h max we found that the range and variability of h m a x h s are very similar for the four storm datasets for the analyzed period σ θ ranged between 8 and 52 and 10 to 59 in the west and south coast faro atlantic and faro levante storms respectively and its variability can be described by a log logistic distribution keywords wave storm in situ measurements long term wave storm characterization portuguese continental coast hmax

loureiro et al 2012 gracia et al 2013 in the same way the recent increase in studies concerning the role of ecosystems in coastal protection sheppard et al 2005 cheong et al 2013 duarte et al 2013 fagherazzi 2014 also stressed the importance of extreme wave events in nature the coastline of portugal mainland is 943 km long and its west part is well known for the high energetic sea states since the middle of the last century the portuguese coastline has verified a significant growth in port related activities real estate and tourism which has put pressure on the coastal environment particularly regarding contributing to increasing coastal erosion coelho et al 2009 lira et al 2016 garnier et al 2017 more recently offshore oil prospection brito et al 2017 offshore wind farms pacheco et al 2017 and wave energy farms palha et al 2010 activities have been increasing along the portuguese continental shelf in addition to these coastal and offshore uses the portuguese continental coast presents a high traffic of ships going from the south to the north of europe more precisely from the mediterranean sea to the north sea due to the economic and ecological importance of this part of the european shore several works focused on studying the wave climate along the portuguese continental coast guedes soares et al 1994 sebastião et al 2000 pilar and guedes soares 2002 rusu et al 2005 2008 pilar et al 2008 dodet et al 2010 guedes soares et al 2011 laface et al 2015 these studies were primarily based on numerical wave hindcast modeling and in some cases short term field data was used to validate numerical results typical numerical wave generation and propagation studies provide information about the significant wave height h s mean wave direction θ m peak wave period t p for wind sea and swell as a consequence wave characterization based on hindcast data normally lacks providing information on wave parameters such as maximum wave height h max in this regard several studies have been recently performed to define based on long term in situ measurements the short term statistics of maximum to significant wave height ratio h m a x h s e g casas prat and holthuijsen 2010 feng et al 2014 and σ θ e g forristall and ewans 1998 lee et al 2010 kumar and anoop 2013 liu et al 2016 for different sea state conditions however there is an absence of studies dealing with the variability of these two wave parameters along the portuguese coast likewise there is still a lack of full understanding of the long term variability of h m a x h s under storm conditions feng et al 2014 three different approaches directional width mean spreading angle or spreading parameter have historically been used to define directional wave spreading holthuijsen 2007 on the other hand several parametric models have been used to estimate the directional spreading function e g borgman 1985 zhang and zhang 2006 directional wave spreading can be a relevant parameter in ocean research and engineering studies for instance some studies suggest that freak waves are triggered under small directional wave spreading combined with large wave steepness and narrow spectrum bandwidth conditions waseda et al 2009 onorato et al 2010 liu et al 2016 furthermore the effect of directional spreading on the nonlinearity of the irregular waves and radiation stress was shown in different studies e g prevosto 1998 feddersen 2004 the hydraulic design of several types of marine structures depends on the input of extreme values for h s and h max goda 1985 cuomo et al 2010 also the understanding of these parameters is fundamental to reproduce realistic sea states in laboratory and numerical tests in fact it is expected that uncertainties related to the choose of extreme values of h s and h max can be as important as other sources of uncertainties induced by for example the generation of extreme waves in numerical and physical models the lengths of scale models scale effects and force measurements at physical models e g reis et al 2008 frostick et al 2011 oliveira et al 2017 marzeddu et al 2017 in this regard probabilistic models for h s h max and h max h s under storm conditions would enable to make more informed choices when it comes to designing and testing marine structures on the other hand to meet the safety design challenge in such very harsh environmental as the portuguese coast requires a thorough evaluation of many different wave parameters then it is thought wave variability characterization for storm conditions would be very useful in the management of structures during their design life in this paper we aim to answer the following scientific questions i what is the variability of the main wave parameters and h max h s relationship under storm conditions in the portuguese mainland coast ii what is the dependence of h max h s on θ m σ θ t z h s and h max under storm conditions specifically we want to understand and model the values of θ m σ θ t z h s h max and h max h s which were recorded in situ under storm conditions at the same time we want to contribute to the global understanding of the long term variability of h m a x h s under storm conditions in order to reach our goal first we analyze wave data recorded in three different locations along the portuguese mainland coast leixões sines and faro under storm conditions then we model based on known probability distribution functions pdfs the variability of the different wave parameters analyzed finally we analyzed the dependence of h max h s on θ m σ θ t z h s and h max the layout of this paper is the following section 2 describes firstly how when and where wave data was collected and secondly how wave data was analyzed in section 3 we present the results here we start by introducing the number of storms and storm duration for the analyzed periods then we present the variability of θ m σ θ t z h s h max and h max h s and analyze the dependence of h max h s on the different wave parameters in section 4 we discuss the results presented in section 3 finally in section 5 the paper ends with the main conclusions 2 methodology 2 1 observations the acquisition of wave data in the portuguese mainland coast has been a constant activity of instituto hidrografico ih www hidrografico pt since 1980 currently ih has three directional wave buoys offshore of leixões sines and faro see fig 1 where data have been collected during the last decades ih installed its first directional wave buoy in september 1986 in faro at 93 m water depth later in may 1988 a directional wave buoy was installed in sines at 97 m water depth almost a decade later in july 1996 leixões buoy started recording data at 83 m water depth previous to directional wave buoys ih had non directional wave buoys working in sines and figueira da foz from 1980 to 1988 and 1981 to 1990 respectively figueira da foz buoy located approximately 100 km south of leixões buoy was decommissioned in january 1996 our work focuses on data collected by the directional wave buoys of leixões sines and faro since the beginning of each buoy data collection until december 2015 in total 19 27 and 28 years of data are analyzed for leixões sines and faro respectively during these considered periods a small number of unregistered data episodes occurred due to occasional failure of the buoys more specifically unregistered data incidents could be caused by repair or replacement of buoys transmission failure or damaged by storms or collisions the mean percentage of unregistered data during the analyzed period ranged between 16 in sines and 19 in faro and leixões most of the unregistered periods occurred during the first decade of measurements see fig 2 ih buoys are equipped with sensors that measure the vertical and horizontal acceleration of sea surface water temperature at the sea surface and the position of the buoy data is transmitted by modem to ih offices where it is subsequently subjected to an elaborate quality control processed and stored in a database presently ih buoys acquire periodically 30 min time series at 1 28 hz under normal sea conditions the interval between acquired time series is 3 h however this interval decreases to 30 min under storm conditions ih classifies a sea state as a storm event whenever h s exceeds 4 5 m on the west coast leixões and sines buoys and 2 5 m on the south coast faro buoy these h s values correspond approximately to two times the annual mean h s at each respective location once received and validated time series are subject to standard treatment by ih which aims at estimating the characteristic wave parameters both in time and frequency domain for each observation period time series the parameters obtained by ih which are studied in this work can be defined as significant wave height h s the mean wave height of the highest third waves in general it agrees quite well with the human visual evaluation of the mean wave height maximum wave height h m a x the maximum wave height mean period t z the average wave period zero upcrossing mean wave direction θ m the mean wave direction corresponding to the peak period calculated through spectral analysis it represents the direction of propagation of the most energetic waves here it is measured from the north clockwise ºn directional dispersion σ θ the directional width in the peak period 2 2 data analysis only data recording during storms events is considered in our work for that we define a storm event as a period of consecutive sea states in which h s exceeds a predefined threshold during a minimum period of 6 h to guarantee that successive storms are independent a minimum storm inter event separation of 6 h is considered the threshold for h s is defined as 4 5 m for sines and leixões west coast and 2 5 m for faro south coast we analyze and characterize wave storminess in leixões sines and faro based on i number of storms and storm duration ii θ m and σ θ iii t z iv h s and h max iv h max h s when analyzing h max h s we also investigate its dependence on θ m σ θ t z h s and h max storms in faro are divided into atlantic storms mean storm wave direction greater than 180ºn and levante storms mean storm wave direction smaller than 180ºn the reason for this division is because storms characteristics in faro mainly depend on where they are generated almeida et al 2011 2012 levante storms are mainly generated somewhere between the strait of gibraltar and gulf of cadiz on the other hand faro atlantic storms are primarily generated in the north atlantic so from herein we will consider four storm datasets i leixões ii sines iii faro atlantic and iv faro levante starting by analyzing the number and duration of storms at each of the three buoys we define the size of each wave storm dataset we highlight that as each buoy had a different operational period and a particular storm threshold different sizes are expected for the four storm datasets our storm duration analysis includes the total storm duration and the duration until the peak of storm i e the time between the beginning of the storm and the moment of maximum values of h m a x and h s during the storm this is because the duration until the peak of storm can provide useful information for the operationally and design of marine structure e g melby and kobayashi 1998 martín soldevilla et al 2015 for the analyzed directional wave related parameters θ m σ θ wave period parameters t z and wave height related parameters h s h max h max h s a series of parametric distributions are tested to find which distribution fit best the storm datasets the fitting process takes into account exponential extreme value generalized extreme value gev generalized pareto log logistic t location scale and weibull probability density functions we select the best distribution using the bayesian information criterion bic 3 results 3 1 number of storms and storm duration the annual number of storms varied over the years in the four storm datasets see fig 3 a in total the number of storms recorded in leixões and sines was 167 and 101 respectively in faro a total of 177 storms 64 from levante and 113 from atlantic occurred the number of storms per year in sines ranged between zero with no storms measured in 1995 and 2004 to 13 storms registered in 2014 similarly 2014 was the year with more storms measured at leixões 23 storms while 2001 was the only year with no storms in leixões however we should notice that leixões buoy was not operational 72 of the time during the winter months of 2001 see fig 2 then most likely the buoy missed some storms during that period faro had no storms recorded in 1993 and a maximum of 16 storms recorded in 1996 which 14 were categorized as faro atlantic storms for faro levante the maximum number of storms per year was 5 1990 2002 2008 and 2011 and no storms were registered in 1993 1994 1998 and 2004 however most of the years in which no storms were observed also correspond to years with large amounts of missing data see fig 2 leixões and sines s storms mostly occurred between november and february see fig 3b faro atlantic storms concentrated between october and march faro levante storms occurred principally between december and march january and february are the months with the highest average number of storms per month in leixões 1 52 and sines 0 90 and 0 86 december and march present the highest average number of storms per month for faro atlantic 1 17 and faro levante 0 67 respectively see fig 3b december 2013 to february 2014 was the period with more consecutive storms measured in leixões 20 and sines 14 the number of storms in function of their total duration varies from north to south datasets and in particular between the west leixões and sines to the south faro atlantic and faro levante coast datasets see fig 4 storms no longer than 1 5 days represent 81 86 and 87 of all the storms in leixões sines and faro respectively in leixões and sines the longest storms lasted 4 3 days starting on 17 january 2009 at 22 00 hereafter all times in utc 00 00 and 3 6 days starting on 16 december 1989 at 00 00 respectively while the longest storm in faro atlantic and faro levante lasted 5 2 days starting on 3 march 2013 at 21 00 and 2 5 days starting on 31 march 1995 respectively leixões storms were longer considering the average storm duration between december and february see fig 4c similarly sines storms were longer between november and january both faro atlantic and levante storms were longer between november and march the duration until the maximum of h m a x and h s see fig 5 was less than 1 day in more than 90 of the storms in the four storm datasets durations to the peak of storm larger than 2 days are very rare with a maximum frequency of 1 8 for faro atlantic storms no storms with durations to storm peak higher than 2 days were registered for sines and faro levante storms at the four storm datasets few storms occurred in which the peak of the storm arises at the beginning of the storm this statement is valid both considering the maximum of h m a x as well the maximum of h s during the storm table 1 summarizes the total duration of the storms and the duration until the maximum of h m a x and h s due to the different operational periods of each buoy and different storm duration characteristics of each storm dataset the total number of dataset points sea states is distinct in the four storm dataset table 2 summarizes the total number of storms total duration of storms and the number of dataset points for each storm dataset the number of dataset points ranges between 1665 for faro levante storms and 6150 for storms recorded by leixões buoy as previously mentioned one data set point corresponds to a resume of a 30 min sea state recorded during a storm these dataset points are the basis for the analyses performed in the next sections then sea states recorded during storms with h s smaler than the h s storm thresholds are not considered here 3 2 mean wave direction and directional dispersion looking at the whole dataset points recorded under storm conditions leixões registered θ m varying from 200 to 336ºn while sines presented a slightly narrow band of directions 209 to 319ºn see fig 6 faro as expected presents two different main quadrants of θ m between 82 and 238ºn levante storms and between 112 and 270ºn atlantic storms in leixões 97 2 of θ m concentrated in the slightly intervale between w and nnw in sines θ m mostly concentrated between w and nw with 95 1 of the total occurrences for faro levante storms 86 5 of θ m concentrated between ese and se while for faro atlantic storms the range was wider with 92 6 of the storms being between ssw and w hence the most representative θ m progressively rotate anticlockwise from north to south locations on the west coast leixões and faro and from southwest to southeast storms on the south coast faro the variability of θ m under storm conditions can be described for leixões sines and faro atlantic storms datasets by an extreme value distribution 1 q θ m 1 σ e x p θ m μ σ e x p e x p θ m μ σ where q θ m is the probability density function σ is the scale parameter and μ is the location parameter faro levante storms dataset best fits a t location scale distribution 2 q θ m ν 1 2 σ ν π γ ν 2 ν θ m μ σ 2 ν ν 1 2 where γ is the gamma function and ν is the shape parameter parameters of best fit distributions for θ m are summarized in fig 6 in summary we can see that the range and variability of θ m is different in the four datasets in what concerns to σ θ under storm conditions see fig 7 leixões faro atlantic and faro levante registered similar minimum and maximum values approximately 10 and 59 while sines presented slightly smaller values 8 and 42 the directional distributions mostly concentrated between 10 and 25 at leixões and sines 89 of occurrences instead for faro atlantic and faro levante σ θ mostly concentrated between 15 and 30 with 82 and 85 of occurrences respectively a log logistic distribution can describe the variability of σ θ q σ θ under storm conditions for leixões sines faro atlantic and faro levante and is given by 3 q σ θ 1 σ 1 σ θ e z 1 e z 2 where 4 z l o g σ θ μ σ 3 3 mean period sines presented the highest value of t z recorded under storm conditions 17 8 s see fig 8 while faro levante presented the smallest maximum value 8 s results show that t z mostly concentrated between 8 and 12 s at leixões 88 and sines 90 for faro atlantic and faro levante t z mostly 86 concentrated between 6 and 8 s t z variability follows a gev distribution type iii for the four storm datasets then the probability density function for t z q t z is given by 5 q t z 1 σ 1 k t z μ σ 1 1 k e x p 1 k t z μ σ 1 k where k is the shape parameter although represented by the same pdf distribution the range and variability of t z is only similar between leixões and sines 3 4 significant and maximum wave height the maximum h s recorded under storm conditions was 9 2 and 9 1 m in leixões and sines respectively see fig 9 these maximums were recorded on march 3 2014 at 16 00 in leixões and on january 6 2014 at 21 00 in sines in faro the maximum h s was 6 4 m recorded on december 22 2000 at 4 01 and 5 3 m recorded on december 19 2007 at 7 09 to atlantic and levante storms respectively in leixões the mean h s and the standard deviation were slightly higher than in sines and both were higher than faro atlantic and faro levante as expected during the storms recorded in leixões aproximatly 10 of the sea states presented an hs 6 6 m and aproximatly 20 an hs 6 1 m in sines these values are slightly smaller with 10 of the sea states presenting an hs 6 2 m and 20 presenting an hs 5 8 m in faro these values are even smaller than leixões and sines while 10 of the sea states presented an hs 3 9 and 3 8 m to atlantic and levante storms respectively furthermore 20 of the sea states in faro presented an h s 3 6 and 3 5 m for atlantic and levante storms respectively the variability of h s q h s under storm conditions can be described by a generalized pareto distribution 6 q h s 1 σ 1 k h s θ σ 1 1 k where θ is the threshold parameter which corresponds to the h s thresholds used to define the beginning of a storm the range and variability of h s diverge from the west leixões and sines to the south faro atlantic and faro levant coast datasets sines buoy recorded on february 10 2014 at 00 30 the highest h m a x of the three analized buoys 17 3 m see fig 10 in that same day leixões buoy recorded a maximum h m a x of 12 7 m however the maximum h m a x recorded in leixões was 16 4 m and occurred on october 31 2003 at 14 34 in faro the maximum h m a x was recorded on december 22 2000 at 4 01 and on march 16 2003 at 15 25 for atlantic and levante storms respectively during the storms recorded in leixões 10 of the sea states presented an hmax 11 0 m and 20 hmax 10 0 m at sines these values are smaller with 10 and 20 of the sea states presenting hmax 10 4 and 9 6 m respectively for faro 10 of the sea states presented an hmax 6 6 and 6 5 m and 20 of the sea states presented hmax 6 1 and 6 0 m for faro atlantic and faro levante respectively h m a x variability follows a gev distribution type ii in the four storm datasets the probability density function for h m a x can then be given by 7 q h m a x 1 σ 1 k h m a x μ σ 1 1 k e x p 1 k h m a x μ σ 1 k similarly to h s the range and variability of h m a x diverge from the west to the south coast datasets fig 11 presents the exceedance probabilities of h m a x from field data and from the best fitted distributions as can be seen the maximum values are well represented by the pdf distribution for sines and faro alantic however for leixões and faro levante the distribution overpredicts these values 3 5 hmax hs the variability of h m a x h s present small differences between the four storm datasets see fig 12 in leixões and sines the minimum h m a x h s ratio recorded was 1 16 but the maximum is slightly higher at leixões 2 47 than in sines 2 44 the mean h m a x h s ratio was very similar in both locations and the standard deviation was the same 0 16 during the storms recorded in both leixões and sines 10 of the sea states presented an h m a x h s 1 83 and for 20 of the sea states presented an h m a x h s 1 74 m faro storms presented maximum minimum and mean values of h m a x h s ratios higher than in leixões and sines faro atlantic h m a x h s maximum is higher than in faro levante however the mean and minimum values are smaller in faro atlantic than for faro levante in faro atlantic and levante 10 of the sea states presented an h m a x h s 1 88 and 1 91 respectively moreover 20 of the sea states registered an h m a x h s 1 79 and 1 81 in faro atlantic and faro levante storms respectively individual waves higher than two times the corresponding h s called by mori and janssen 2006 by freak waves occurred in 2 of the sea states recorded in sines and leixões and in 4 of the sea states of faro atlantic and levante storms h m a x h s follows a gev distribution type iii for the four datasets then the probability density function for the ratio h m a x h s q h m a x h s is given by 8 q h m a x h s 1 σ 1 k h m a x h s μ σ 1 1 k e x p 1 k h m a x h s μ σ 1 k fig 13 presents the exceedance probabilities of h m a x h s from field data and from the best fitted distribution the maximum values are well represented by the pdf distribution for leixões sines and faro levante for faro atlantic the distribution under predict the maximum values in what concerns the dependence of h m a x h s on θ m σ θ t z and h s there are no obvious trends in the four storm dataset however it is possible to observe that the range of h m a x h s values increases with the increases of h m a x in the four storm datasets see fig 14 both the maximum and minimum h m a x h s values associated to a specific h m a x increase linearaly with h m a x the maximums h m a x h s associated to a specific h m a x is limited by the h s thresholds h s t h r e s h o l d used to define a sea state as a storm more specifically the maximums h m a x h s associated to a specific h m a x is given by h m a x h s t h r e s h o l d 4 discussion according to rusu et al 2008 the northern hemisphere winter of 2000 2001 was an unusual very energetic winter at sines our analysis also confirms this fact however we found that the northern hemisphere winter of 2013 2014 posterior to the study of rusu et al 2008 was the winter with more in situ storms recorded in the portuguese west coast and one of most intense in the south coast in accordance with our results scott et al 2016 and masselink et al 2016 also referred the northern hemisphere winter of 2013 2014 as a special extreme season on the west coast of europe a large number of worldwide observations have been used as standard values for directional dispersion models e g young et al 1996 ewans 1998 our analysis shows that the variability of the directional dispersion in the peak period is very similar in sines and leixões and values are in the range of values observed by young et al 1996 and ewans 1998 however very few sea states in leixões presented not typical higher directional dispersion with a maximum of 59 directional dispersion is similar for both faro levante and atlantic storms and in general is greater than that observed in sines and leixões in this regard it is most likely to see directional dispersion in faro higher than those found by young et al 1996 and ewans 1998 pita and abecasis 1998 investigated data from two nondirectional buoys deployed offshore of sines at 50 and 100 m water depth the authors analyzed 18 years data starting on 1981 and considering storm conditions when h s was larger than 5 m at one of the two bouys comparing pita and abecasis 1998 results with our results in which a longer period from 1989 to 2015 and a different definition of a storm h s 4 5 m is consider we find a higher maximum value of h m a x 17 3 instead of 14 7 m previous found and a maximum of h s smaller 9 1 instead of 9 6 m the most frequent class of h m a x also reduces from 10 3 10 7 m to 8 8 5 m however the most frequent class of h s 5 3 5 7 m is almost identical consequently in what concerns to average values of h m a x h s pita and abecasis 1998 found smaller values 1 5 1 6 than those found in this study 1 67 as expected these comparisons shows the importance of long term wave storm characterization based on in situ measurements to determine hystorical maximum wave heights values feng et al 2014b found that norwegian sea observations of h m a x and h s follow a weibull distribution which performs well also for representing non extreme wave heights however for the continental portuguese coast we found that a generalized pareto and gev type ii distribution best fit h m a x and h s variability respectively in feng et al 2014a and 2014b investigations in which ten years of in situ wave data from the norwegian sea was analyzed a weibull distribution was chosen to represent h m a x h s variability however in our study the best fit pdf distribution for h m a x h s was a gev type iii feng et al 2014a and 2014b also referred the importance of long term observations on the evaluation of the statistical distributions that better fit maximum wave height data unlike our study feng et al investigations were focused on every single sea state condition rather than sea states under storm conditions moreover the authors worked with a 10 years dataset which corresponds to a shorter period than the analyzed in this study in our work the percentage of sea states with h m a x h s 2 was found to be 2 in leixões and sines and 4 in faro atlantic and faro levante whereas for the norwegian sea a percentage smaler than 1 was found the same standard deviation for h m a x h s 0 16 was found by feng et al 2014b and in our work for the four storm datasets 5 conclusions in this article we studied wave storminess in the portuguese continental coast based on long term in situ measurements we analyzed almost three decades of data from three directional wave buoys from which four storm datasets were created i leixões ii sines iii faro atlantic and iv faro levante we aimed to understand the variability of the main wave parameters and h max h s relationship under storm conditions furthermore to understand the dependence of h max h s on θ m σ θ t z h s and h max the number of sea states analyzed highly ranged between 1665 for faro levante storms and 6150 for storms recorded in leixões we provide probability distribution functions for θ m σ θ t z h s and h max for the four storm datasets in this regard we conclude that the range and variability of these wave parameters is i different in the four datasets for θ m ii different between west and south coast for σ θ h s and h max iii different between west coast faro atlantic and faro levante for t z despite the differences in the lengths of the four datasets analyzed and the differences found in the range and variability for θ m σ θ t z h s and h max we found that the range and variability of h m a x h s are very similar in the four dataset in this regard gev distributions type iii with very similar shape parameters can be used to represent the variability of h m a x h s for leixões sines faro atlantic and faro levante storms we did not find apparent dependence of h m a x h s on θ m σ θ t z h s however we observed that the range of h m a x h s values increases with the increases of h m a x both the maximum and minimum h m a x h s value associated to a specific h m a x increase linearaly with h m a x moreover the maximum h m a x h s observed for a specific h m a x is limited by the h s thresholds used to define a sea state as a storm practically the probabilistic models proposed in this work would enable ocean engineers and scientists to make more informed choices when it comes to the studying of among others the hydraulic behavior of marine structures erosion processes and wave energy potential in the portuguese continental coast moreover the results presented here can contribute to the global understanding of the long term variability of h m a x h s under storm conditions 
23537,submarine pipe in pipe flowline have become a common pipeline arrangement to achieve a significant thermal insulation capacity a pipe in pipe system generally contains four structural components jacket pipe carrier pipe spacers and bulkheads global response of the system depends on both the behaviour of each constituent part and interactions between them existing design approaches to consider this system are either too simplistic resulting in loss of accuracy or significantly complicated finite element analysis demanding expensive highly skilled manpower this paper proposes cost effective design methods which provide accurate prediction with minimum increase in modelling complexity through simplified finite element analysis models pipe in pipe system s lay thermal expansion and spool arrangement design have been investigated abaqus or autopipe based methods have been proposed to cover each application and excellent performance has been observed in addition to cost effectiveness abaqus based method for s lay is able to capture twisting and residual stresses which are generally ignored by traditional approach but important in deep water applications keywords subsea pipelines s lay finite element analysis steel structures deep water nomenclature e is the elastic modulus of the steel f true is the true stress of the steel ε ln p l is the log plastic strain of the steel f nom is the nominal stress of the steel ε n o m is the nominal strain of the steel 1 introduction submarine pipe in pipe hereafter pip has been widely used in offshore oil and gas industry to deal with thermal insulation issues the main characteristic of a pip is a jacket pipe also known as outer or protective pipe and a carrier pipe also known as inner or production pipe where the annulus between the two pipes is generally filled with thermal insulation materials bokaian 2004 kyriakides 2002 olso and kyriakides 2003 zheng et al 2014 spacers are employed to maintain the carrier line concentric within the jacket pipe and are typically placed at intervals of several meters in terms of structural behaviour pipe in pipe system can be divided into two categories compliant or non compliant depending on the method of load transfer between the jacket and carrier pipes bai and bai 2005 bokaian 2004 in the former case forces continuously transfer between jacket and carrier pipes through fully welded tulips generally one each end of each 24 4 m lengths produced by cold forging stock linepipe stress relieved thereafter sahota et al 1999 in the later case jacket and carrier pipes are structurally connected through bulkheads which may be either placed at interval of a few kilometres along the length of the pipeline length or only at both ends of the pipeline a general illustration of a pip is given in fig 1 this paper concerns non compliant systems compared with conventional pipelines hobbs 1984 hobbs and liang 1989 pip systems have more sophisticated structural behaviours due to composite actions between their constituent parts including inner pipes outer pipes spacers welded tulips bulkheads etc extensive investigations on global responses of pip systems have been conducted design approaches for pip systems can be mainly categorized into either analytical or finite element analysis fea methods existing analytical calculation methods either assume only two bulkheads at pipeline extremities harrison et al 1997 or equivalent pip methods where geometries masses structures and stresses of equivalent lines are simply superimposed or derived bokaian 2004 malahy 1996 orcina 2016 the assumptions adopted by analytical methods are useful but use artificial simplifications and generally lead to loss of prediction accuracy in case of deep water applications where tremendous top tensions and significantly reduced stinger radius likely result in pipeline yielding it is subsequently crucial to provide accurate predictions of bundle behaviours wang et al 2017a b for fea methods jukes et al 2008 and sun and jukes 2009 investigated extra high pressure high temperature hpht pip design by using both analytical and numerical method mainly on in place stage harrison and mccarron 2006 sun and jukes 2009 and wang et al 2013 studied pip installation behaviours by detailed numerical modelling suwarno et al 2014 carried out investigations on the effect of stinger stiffness on pipeline installation wang et al 2014 researched effective design of spool which aims to cope with thermal expansion induced by pip pipeline under hpht conditions this paper extends the investigation to pip s lay on which topic literature is somewhat limited in s lay method pipeline is supported by a stinger passing on a regular sequence of rollers following an s shape trajectory before landing on seabed as illustrated in fig 2 pipelines in s lay may confront significant axial tensions existing methods are deemed to be either too simplistic or very complex and detailed fea models requiring high skill levels and resulting in high costs this paper aims to propose cost effective fea solutions which provide accurate predictions with minimum increase on numerical complexities methods of s lay installation in place thermal expansion and spool piece arrangement have been presented in this paper 2 pip installation phase dedicated fea based pipeline installation program offpipe has been frequently employed to obtain optimum parameters for achieving a viable installation and has been widely recognized by industry however the equivalent pip employed by offpipe malahy 1996 is a useful but artificial assumption especially in deep water applications detailed structural interactions between outer and inner pipeline during installation phase cannot be included by offpipe in addition it is not possible for offpipe to consider unstable rotations of the pipe known as twisting which is a known problem with s lay installation since offpipe assumes 2d geometry in addition although non linear material properties can be included in offpipe the reduced flexibility of defining nonlinear material directly limits the depth of investigation on the effect of stinger especially the overbend induced residual strain furthermore offpipe which performs analysis at single point of time limits designer s understanding of the entire structural performance throughout the installation process for example an in line structure installation analyst will prefer a complete time domain three dimensional 3d simulation of the s lay to capture peak strain during a whole process to overcome the challenges presented above a novel methodology based on general fea software has been suggested the method reflects the structural behaviour of pip in each procedure from installation to in place but with an acceptable level of increase in design complexity s lay installation has been investigated here this method has been developed by adopting a detailed fea model via abaqus package abaqus 2014 details about the modelling and analysis procedure are presented in the following sections 2 1 fe modelling 2 1 1 pipe outer and inner pipes are modeled using pipe31h 2 noded hybrid formulation pipe element with 8 integration points abaqus 2014 these elements are selected as they are particularly well suited to model long slender flowlines with better convergence behavior than standard pipe elements 2 1 2 spacer spacers as illustrated in fig 1 usually employed as centralizers to constraint the clearance between inner and outer pipes are modeled through 3d tube to tube contact elements itt31 both lateral and axial movements can be constrained by defining clearance and friction a sliding line is defined to specify the interaction between jacket and carrier pipes contact parameters such as smoothness and offset allowance can be considered details can be found in abaqus keywords reference guidance slide line abaqus 2014 2 1 3 bulkhead bulkheads are commonly employed by pip systems to meet manufacturing requirements however from perspective of structural performance the influence of bulkhead arrangements on the axial section force distributions between jacket and carrier pipes is significant for instance axial force distribution on pipeline with one bulkhead per 10 km km has different structural performance on pipeline with one bulkhead per 1 km a design study has been carried out and the details are presented in later sections bulkheads are modeled by mpc tie elements abaqus 2014 which provide fixed boundary conditions between outer and inner pipes in all 6 degrees of freedom at the corresponding locations 2 1 4 seabed seabed surface is conservatively modeled as a rigid surface with constant anisotropy friction features where hard contact interaction between the pip and seabed is adopted wang et al 2017a b 2 1 5 laybarge laybarge is simulated as a flat horizontal rigid surface with no friction 2 1 6 stingers a simplified stinger is included over which each pipe segment deforms overbend before passing into a subsequent form known as sagbend as shown in fig 2 the stinger representation is a cylindrical contact surface with infinite radial stiffness upper curved part of the s shape resting on stinger is known as overbend where pipeline generally deform into plastic

archimedes law 2 2 analysis procedure the model simulates the passage of pip starting at the stinger overbend through sagbend and ending at touchdown on seabed being 3d the sagbend model has torsional degrees of freedom and can move out of plane these freedoms are potentially required when additional non symmetric cross section structures are installed with pipelines the model consists of an initially straight pip pipeline laybarge stinger and seabed analysis has been conducted by the steps as presented in sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 illustrations of which are given in fig 3 2 2 1 step 1 model preparation seabed and laybarge are placed at the same vertical elevation and the pip is set on the seabed spacer and intermediate bulkheads are assigned to model the structural interaction between outer and inner pipes the seabed and pip interaction is introduced end of the pip at the laybarge is constrained and the axial bottom tension applied at the other end self weight of pip and hydrostatic pressures are employed 2 2 2 step 2 s shape forming the seabed is lowered to the required position with the hard support provided by stinger and downward gravity acting on the pip s lay shape is formed 2 2 3 step 3 piplaying pip passes through laybarge stinger and sagbend and lands at seabed 2 3 validation offpipe is a dedicated finite element fe based program developed specifically for pipeline installation analysis offpipe has been frequently used more than 20 years and widely recognized in the industry for common practice while abaqus is general purpose fea software in order to validate the proposed approach based on abaqus comparisons of predictions on the installation physical behaviours between these two programs have been made 2 3 1 input data the input data employed in this study is given in table 1 2 3 2 results the comparisons of between offpipe and abaqus simulations in terms of suspended pipeline geometry during s lay bending moments and strains sum of inner and outer pipe are presented in figs 4 6 respectively it can be found that good correlations are achieved between offpipe and abaqus based models 2 4 parametric study 2 4 1 stinger the stinger representation employed in this model is over stiff this over constrains the pipe so that it forms more completely to the stinger radius than they would over the more compliant real stinger this gives rise to an over estimation of the residual curvature in the pip after it leaves the stinger residual curvature is represented in the finite element model incorporating a non linear material meanwhile simplified installation design methods adopted by engineering practice usually take no residual effect quantitative investigations into the effect of overbend residual curvatures on sagbend moments have been carried out material models provided by abaqus 2014 enable switches between consideration or non consideration of residual stress history in structural time domain analyses time domain results are given in figs 7 9 for a selected pipeline segment fig 7 gives the relationships between segment vertical displacements installation progress and strain values pink line denotes the model excluding overbend residual stress whereas the blue one denotes the model including it stress and moment results are presented in figs 8 and 9 respectively comparison between models with and without consideration of overbend residual stress has been made it shows that eliminating the overbend residual curvature history gives rise to increases in strain stress and moments approaching 7 this value has a good agreement with findings presented by suwarno et al 2014 where 9 is obtained the extent of the increase relates to the extent of closure of maximum strain to yield strain and material non linearity a better stinger representation could reduce peak moments and strains this will increase engineering efficiency this is not commonly achievable by existing dominant design method 2 5 remarks the developed time domain general fe programme abaqus based pip s lay model has three features 1 3d geometry 2 complete time domain simulation of the s lay with proper simulation of the stinger 3 material and geometry non linearities residual stress with these features the developed model is not only able to perform more functional analysis including full history and 3d analysis on a pip system but also an efficient design it can furthermore potentially perform a deep water in line structure installation analysis odijie et al 2017 improvements can be done on stinger modelling incorporating more realistic stiffness 3 pip in place phase thermal expansion a novel approach based on general finite element package abaqus has been developed to perform thermal expansion calculations the structural behaviours of pip components such as bulkheads spacers etc have been considered the proposed model has been validated against software dpipe based thermal expansion model where dpipe has been employed for more than 15 years and extensively recognized by industry parameter study has been carried out 3 1 fe modelling thermal expansion models have been made in similar methodology as described in section 2 1 the only difference is about the internal content where thermal expansion one includes internal content and corresponding hydrostatic pressure 3 2 validation 3 2 1 input the input data employed in this study is given in table 1 3 2 2 results dpipe has been widely adopted for pip thermal expansion design dpipe assumes only two constraints between outer and inner pipes placed at the two ends of the pipeline besides the two ends there are no axial constraints between inner and outer pipe bulkheads between both ends ignored the thermal expansion trend in the inner pipe is constrained by outer pipe only at both ends then the soil axial friction on outer pipe provides axial resistance against the thermal expansion in order to validate the proposed abaqus based thermal prediction models a model with only two bulkheads two constraints at two ends has been made to compare with a corresponding dpipe based model the comparisons are presented in table 2 and good agreements have been found 3 3 parametric study 3 3 1 bulkhead intervals a design study regarding the effects of bulkhead interval configurations on expansion analysis was carried out once the abaqus based pip expansion model was validated a pip flowline model with total length of 5000 m has been established in this model 7 different bulkhead configurations as shown in table 3 have been investigated figs 10 12 present results of models with configurations shown in table 3 the axial force results of inner and outer pipes under different bulkhead setups are presented in figs 10 and 11 nomenclature such as inner 11 has two parts the first part inner denotes inner pipe and the other one 11 means total of 11 bulkheads adopted the results are summarized in figs 10 and 11 to show the relationship between the maximum effective section force esf and number of bulkheads a clear trend has been found that with increase in the number of bulkheads tensions in outer pipe decrease and compressions in inner pipe increase thermal expansion at pipeline end is defined as end elongation and end elongation number of bulkheads relationship has also been investigated as shown in fig 12 comparing with values of end elongation in practice for conventional pipelines which are generally more than 1 m about 0 5 m elongations determined in this study was attributed to that thermal expansions of the inner pipes are constraint by outer pipe through bulkheads in addition the maximum end elongation has been found with least bulkheads configuration further investigation is suggested to obtain comprehensive relationship between bulkheads arrangement and pipeline elongation response 3 4 remarks a beam element based fea approach has been proposed to provide more accurate prediction on thermal expansions with minimum increase in numerical complexity quantitative relationships between bulkhead configuration and effective section force distribution have been achieved 4 pip in place phase spool arrangement spools have commonly been employed to absorb the pipeline thermal expansion hpht issue this is achieved by allowing spool deform in certain plane directions however increasingly high pressure and temperature hpht induce larger thermal expansions in addition for newly constructed intrafield pipeline connecting to existing central platform seabed space nearby the platform allowing for locating spool piece may be limited due to existing subsea facilities considering increasingly hpht and limited subsea space it is subsequently important to effectively use the limited space to locate a rationally designed spool which can absorb as much expansion as possible a corresponding study has been conducted to propose spool arrangement guidance 4 1 fe modelling autopipe bentley 2010 has been employed to perform numerical simulation and calculation of the riser and spool both static and dynamic analyses have been conducted 4 1 1 pipe and material property outer and inner pipes have been modelled by the default pipe element in autopipe bentley 2010 which is beam element elastic material property has been employed according to applied limit state design criterion det norske veritas 2006 det norske veritas 2010 det norske veritas 2007 4 1 2 spacer and bulkhead performed as the centralizers to keep the clearance between outer and inner pipes spacers have been modelled by adopting guide elements which constrain the radial movements and apply axial frictions between two pipes bentley 2010 bulkhead have been simulated by employing a beam structure as predefined in autopipe bentley 2010 fixed boundary conditions between jacket and carrier pipes have been defined where bulkheads are present 4 1 3 seabed flat horizontal surface has been used with constant anisotropy friction features soil resistances are obtained according to guidance provided by autopip manual bentley 2010 and dnv rp f105 det norske veritas 2006 4 2 validation since autopipe based spool design models have been widely verified by numerous executed projects and qualified third party verification organizations there is no need to carry out a validation specifically bai and bai 2005 ellenberger 2010 the model employed in this study comes from a practical project where models have been verified by a qualified third party organization 4 3 parametric study hpht conditions always induce high expansions for subsea pipelines especially when the length of the pipeline is long enough to develop visual anchor point bai and bai 2005 large expansion challenges spool design parametric studies have been conducted to investigate structural performance and potential optimization plan of spool layouts the parameters studied here include length between elbows different combinations of elbow angles and flange position an illustration is given in fig 13 sensitivities of these three parameters on the unity check uc value have been investigated uc is defined as the fraction of pipeline segment von mises stress to material maximum allowable stress according to code guidance det norske veritas 2010 an autopipe based pip spool model has been employed where dimension of the spool are the same as the pip pipeline where carrier and jackets pipes are 219 1 mm 14 3 mm and 323 9 mm 12 7 mm diameter and thickness respectively since the cross section stiffness of pip pipeline at flange changes dramatically stress concentration always exists in this part in addition because of high moments in elbows and the consideration of elbow thinning fabrication tolerance the uc values in these parts are high 10 year return period bohai environmental condition including wave height and period current velocity and tidal range has been used thermal expansion calculated is 1291mm as shown in fig 13 f1 is the connection flange between riser and spool f2 denotes the flange connecting spool pieces f3 represents the connection between spool and pipeline two elbows are marked b1 and b2 respectively there are 4 variables being studied l1 length between b1 and b2 l2 length between b2 and f3 α elbow b1 angle β elbow b2 angle each variable s sensitivity on the unity check uc values at f1 f2 f3 b1 and b2 has been researched as given in tables 4 7 4 3 1 elbow b1 angle elbow b1 angle varies from 100 to 120 with intervals of 5 elbow b2 angle l1 and l2 are set to 115 29 m and 10 m respectively as given in table 4 the results are presented in fig 14 with increase of elbow b1 angle α uc values of pipe segments at locations of b1 b2 and f3 increase meanwhile when uc values at f2 decrease uc values at f1 do not alter largely therefore the trends show that elbow b1 angle should be designed as small as possible no less than 90 since the increase of this angle will rise the uc values at elbows and flange connecting spool and pipeline dramatically 4 3 2 elbow b2 angle elbow b2 angle changes from 100 to 120 with intervals of 5 elbow b1 angle l1 and l2 are set to 100 29 m and 10 m respectively as shown in fig 15 while elbow b2 angle β getting larger uc values at f3 decrease and uc values at f2 increase however the trends at these f2 and f3 become stable after β larger than 115 4 3 3 length l1 length l1 see fig 13 alters from 19 m to 34 m with interval 5 m elbow b1 and b2 angles and length l2 are set to 100 115 and 10 m respectively fig 16 shows that when l1 gets longer all the uc values at b1 f2 f3 and b2 locations drop the values at the f1 f2 and b3 go down steeply while the values at b2 decrease slowly the uc value at f1 goes up slightly therefore it is suggested that length l1 should be enlarged as long as possible 4 3 4 length l2 length l2 see fig 13 varies from 5 m to 15 m with interval of 5 m elbow b1 and b2 angles and length l1 are set to 100 115 and 29 m respectively in fig 17 when length l2 gets longer uc values at f3 drop sharply uc values at f2 and b2 decrease slightly uc values at other places do not change significantly it can be concluded that length l2 has most influence on uc values at f3 4 4 remarks based on the sensitivity studies of the four parameters on the uc values at the target places presented above trends of the various relationships have been observed and summarized therefore with respect to the illustration shown in fig 13 the golden rule of spool layout design has been proposed as follow angle of first elbow from riser b1 should be as small as possible the rise of the angle at this elbow will increase the uc values at two elbows and last flange connecting spool piece and pipeline when the second elbow angle b2 gets enlarged the uc value at the flange between two elbows increases sharply increase of the distance between two elbows can reduce the uc values at elbows and flanges the length l2 has significant influence on the uc value at f3 flange the sensitivity study of the parameters on the uc values at prescribed locations in spool has shown inconsistent trends of the uc value at a certain location therefore it is essential to employ combinations of the change of the parameters to achieve an optimization of the spool layout 5 conclusions extensive employments and studies of pipe in pipe systems in offshore developments have been described this paper presents cost effective design approaches which provide accurate predictions with minimum increase on computation complexity the proposed abaqus based s lay method is a 3 dimentionsal model which adopts non linear material properties features of pipeline during s lay such as residual stress can be reflected meanwhile computation efficiency is achieved by beam element based models secondly proposed thermal expansion models adopt tube to tube contact elements which consider bulkheads parametric studies show that pipeline structural behaviors depend on bulkhead configurations again beam element models significantly reduce numerical computation requirements in comparison with commonly adopted shell element ones spool arrangement has become a common issue since allocation spaces are frequently limited in recent developments golden rules of spool layout have been proposed through autopipe based parametric studies further experimental investigations on structural behaviors of bulkheads and spacers and finite element studies on pipeline twisting feature during s lay are suggested to define their boundary conditions acknowledgements author would like to acknowledge the china national offshore oil corporation cnooc research fund grant number cnooc kj 125 zdxm

23537,submarine pipe in pipe flowline have become a common pipeline arrangement to achieve a significant thermal insulation capacity a pipe in pipe system generally contains four structural components jacket pipe carrier pipe spacers and bulkheads global response of the system depends on both the behaviour of each constituent part and interactions between them existing design approaches to consider this system are either too simplistic resulting in loss of accuracy or significantly complicated finite element analysis demanding expensive highly skilled manpower this paper proposes cost effective design methods which provide accurate prediction with minimum increase in modelling complexity through simplified finite element analysis models pipe in pipe system s lay thermal expansion and spool arrangement design have been investigated abaqus or autopipe based methods have been proposed to cover each application and excellent performance has been observed in addition to cost effectiveness abaqus based method for s lay is able to capture twisting and residual stresses which are generally ignored by traditional approach but important in deep water applications keywords subsea pipelines s lay finite element analysis steel structures deep water nomenclature e is the elastic modulus of the steel f true is the true stress of the steel ε ln p l is the log plastic strain of the steel f nom is the nominal stress of the steel ε n o m is the nominal strain of the steel 1 introduction submarine pipe in pipe hereafter pip has been widely used in offshore oil and gas industry to deal with thermal insulation issues the main characteristic of a pip is a jacket pipe also known as outer or protective pipe and a carrier pipe also known as inner or production pipe where the annulus between the two pipes is generally filled with thermal insulation materials bokaian 2004 kyriakides 2002 olso and kyriakides 2003 zheng et al 2014 spacers are employed to maintain the carrier line concentric within the jacket pipe and are typically placed at intervals of several meters in terms of structural behaviour pipe in pipe system can be divided into two categories compliant or non compliant depending on the method of load transfer between the jacket and carrier pipes bai and bai 2005 bokaian 2004 in the former case forces continuously transfer between jacket and carrier pipes through fully welded tulips generally one each end of each 24 4 m lengths produced by cold forging stock linepipe stress relieved thereafter sahota et al 1999 in the later case jacket and carrier pipes are structurally connected through bulkheads which may be either placed at interval of a few kilometres along the length of the pipeline length or only at both ends of the pipeline a general illustration of a pip is given in fig 1 this paper concerns non compliant systems compared with conventional pipelines hobbs 1984 hobbs and liang 1989 pip systems have more sophisticated structural behaviours due to composite actions between their constituent parts including inner pipes outer pipes spacers welded tulips bulkheads etc extensive investigations on global responses of pip systems have been conducted design approaches for pip systems can be mainly categorized into either analytical or finite element analysis fea methods existing analytical calculation methods either assume only two bulkheads at pipeline extremities harrison et al 1997 or equivalent pip methods where geometries masses structures and stresses of equivalent lines are simply superimposed or derived bokaian 2004 malahy 1996 orcina 2016 the assumptions adopted by analytical methods are useful but use artificial simplifications and generally lead to loss of prediction accuracy in case of deep water applications where tremendous top tensions and significantly reduced stinger radius likely result in pipeline yielding it is subsequently crucial to provide accurate predictions of bundle behaviours wang et al 2017a b for fea methods jukes et al 2008 and sun and jukes 2009 investigated extra high pressure high temperature hpht pip design by using both analytical and numerical method mainly on in place stage harrison and mccarron 2006 sun and jukes 2009 and wang et al 2013 studied pip installation behaviours by detailed numerical modelling suwarno et al 2014 carried out investigations on the effect of stinger stiffness on pipeline installation wang et al 2014 researched effective design of spool which aims to cope with thermal expansion induced by pip pipeline under hpht conditions this paper extends the investigation to pip s lay on which topic literature is somewhat limited in s lay method pipeline is supported by a stinger passing on a regular sequence of rollers following an s shape trajectory before landing on seabed as illustrated in fig 2 pipelines in s lay may confront significant axial tensions existing methods are deemed to be either too simplistic or very complex and detailed fea models requiring high skill levels and resulting in high costs this paper aims to propose cost effective fea solutions which provide accurate predictions with minimum increase on numerical complexities methods of s lay installation in place thermal expansion and spool piece arrangement have been presented in this paper 2 pip installation phase dedicated fea based pipeline installation program offpipe has been frequently employed to obtain optimum parameters for achieving a viable installation and has been widely recognized by industry however the equivalent pip employed by offpipe malahy 1996 is a useful but artificial assumption especially in deep water applications detailed structural interactions between outer and inner pipeline during installation phase cannot be included by offpipe in addition it is not possible for offpipe to consider unstable rotations of the pipe known as twisting which is a known problem with s lay installation since offpipe assumes 2d geometry in addition although non linear material properties can be included in offpipe the reduced flexibility of defining nonlinear material directly limits the depth of investigation on the effect of stinger especially the overbend induced residual strain furthermore offpipe which performs analysis at single point of time limits designer s understanding of the entire structural performance throughout the installation process for example an in line structure installation analyst will prefer a complete time domain three dimensional 3d simulation of the s lay to capture peak strain during a whole process to overcome the challenges presented above a novel methodology based on general fea software has been suggested the method reflects the structural behaviour of pip in each procedure from installation to in place but with an acceptable level of increase in design complexity s lay installation has been investigated here this method has been developed by adopting a detailed fea model via abaqus package abaqus 2014 details about the modelling and analysis procedure are presented in the following sections 2 1 fe modelling 2 1 1 pipe outer and inner pipes are modeled using pipe31h 2 noded hybrid formulation pipe element with 8 integration points abaqus 2014 these elements are selected as they are particularly well suited to model long slender flowlines with better convergence behavior than standard pipe elements 2 1 2 spacer spacers as illustrated in fig 1 usually employed as centralizers to constraint the clearance between inner and outer pipes are modeled through 3d tube to tube contact elements itt31 both lateral and axial movements can be constrained by defining clearance and friction a sliding line is defined to specify the interaction between jacket and carrier pipes contact parameters such as smoothness and offset allowance can be considered details can be found in abaqus keywords reference guidance slide line abaqus 2014 2 1 3 bulkhead bulkheads are commonly employed by pip systems to meet manufacturing requirements however from perspective of structural performance the influence of bulkhead arrangements on the axial section force distributions between jacket and carrier pipes is significant for instance axial force distribution on pipeline with one bulkhead per 10 km km has different structural performance on pipeline with one bulkhead per 1 km a design study has been carried out and the details are presented in later sections bulkheads are modeled by mpc tie elements abaqus 2014 which provide fixed boundary conditions between outer and inner pipes in all 6 degrees of freedom at the corresponding locations 2 1 4 seabed seabed surface is conservatively modeled as a rigid surface with constant anisotropy friction features where hard contact interaction between the pip and seabed is adopted wang et al 2017a b 2 1 5 laybarge laybarge is simulated as a flat horizontal rigid surface with no friction 2 1 6 stingers a simplified stinger is included over which each pipe segment deforms overbend before passing into a subsequent form known as sagbend as shown in fig 2 the stinger

of pip pipeline at flange changes dramatically stress concentration always exists in this part in addition because of high moments in elbows and the consideration of elbow thinning fabrication tolerance the uc values in these parts are high 10 year return period bohai environmental condition including wave height and period current velocity and tidal range has been used thermal expansion calculated is 1291mm as shown in fig 13 f1 is the connection flange between riser and spool f2 denotes the flange connecting spool pieces f3 represents the connection between spool and pipeline two elbows are marked b1 and b2 respectively there are 4 variables being studied l1 length between b1 and b2 l2 length between b2 and f3 α elbow b1 angle β elbow b2 angle each variable s sensitivity on the unity check uc values at f1 f2 f3 b1 and b2 has been researched as given in tables 4 7 4 3 1 elbow b1 angle elbow b1 angle varies from 100 to 120 with intervals of 5 elbow b2 angle l1 and l2 are set to 115 29 m and 10 m respectively as given in table 4 the results are presented in fig 14 with increase of elbow b1 angle α uc values of pipe segments at locations of b1 b2 and f3 increase meanwhile when uc values at f2 decrease uc values at f1 do not alter largely therefore the trends show that elbow b1 angle should be designed as small as possible no less than 90 since the increase of this angle will rise the uc values at elbows and flange connecting spool and pipeline dramatically 4 3 2 elbow b2 angle elbow b2 angle changes from 100 to 120 with intervals of 5 elbow b1 angle l1 and l2 are set to 100 29 m and 10 m respectively as shown in fig 15 while elbow b2 angle β getting larger uc values at f3 decrease and uc values at f2 increase however the trends at these f2 and f3 become stable after β larger than 115 4 3 3 length l1 length l1 see fig 13 alters from 19 m to 34 m with interval 5 m elbow b1 and b2 angles and length l2 are set to 100 115 and 10 m respectively fig 16 shows that when l1 gets longer all the uc values at b1 f2 f3 and b2 locations drop the values at the f1 f2 and b3 go down steeply while the values at b2 decrease slowly the uc value at f1 goes up slightly therefore it is suggested that length l1 should be enlarged as long as possible 4 3 4 length l2 length l2 see fig 13 varies from 5 m to 15 m with interval of 5 m elbow b1 and b2 angles and length l1 are set to 100 115 and 29 m respectively in fig 17 when length l2 gets longer uc values at f3 drop sharply uc values at f2 and b2 decrease slightly uc values at other places do not change significantly it can be concluded that length l2 has most influence on uc values at f3 4 4 remarks based on the sensitivity studies of the four parameters on the uc values at the target places presented above trends of the various relationships have been observed and summarized therefore with respect to the illustration shown in fig 13 the golden rule of spool layout design has been proposed as follow angle of first elbow from riser b1 should be as small as possible the rise of the angle at this elbow will increase the uc values at two elbows and last flange connecting spool piece and pipeline when the second elbow angle b2 gets enlarged the uc value at the flange between two elbows increases sharply increase of the distance between two elbows can reduce the uc values at elbows and flanges the length l2 has significant influence on the uc value at f3 flange the sensitivity study of the parameters on the uc values at prescribed locations in spool has shown inconsistent trends of the uc value at a certain location therefore it is essential to employ combinations of the change of the parameters to achieve an optimization of the spool layout 5 conclusions extensive employments and studies of pipe in pipe systems in offshore developments have been described this paper presents cost effective design approaches which provide accurate predictions with minimum increase on computation complexity the proposed abaqus based s lay method is a 3 dimentionsal model which adopts non linear material properties features of pipeline during s lay such as residual stress can be reflected meanwhile computation efficiency is achieved by beam element based models secondly proposed thermal expansion models adopt tube to tube contact elements which consider bulkheads parametric studies show that pipeline structural behaviors depend on bulkhead configurations again beam element models significantly reduce numerical computation requirements in comparison with commonly adopted shell element ones spool arrangement has become a common issue since allocation spaces are frequently limited in recent developments golden rules of spool layout have been proposed through autopipe based parametric studies further experimental investigations on structural behaviors of bulkheads and spacers and finite element studies on pipeline twisting feature during s lay are suggested to define their boundary conditions acknowledgements author would like to acknowledge the china national offshore oil corporation cnooc research fund grant number cnooc kj 125 zdxm

23538,this paper concerns the hydrodynamic performance of a two dimensional asymmetric wedge entering waves obliquely with gravity effect in the presence of a uniform current a time domain higher order boundary element method hobem based on potential theory with fully nonlinear boundary conditions is developed to solve this problem a stretched coordinate system is adopted in the spatial domain to avoid a large number of elements discretized in fixed computational domain at the initial stage during mesh regriding and interpolation a rotation scheme of the stretched coordinate system is employed to meet the requirement of continuity of flux at the intersection points an auxiliary function is introduced to calculate pressure distribution on body surface the present model is validated against the published numerical results for vertical wave entry in the absence of currents numerical calculations are conducted to analyze the dependence of the free surface elevation and the pressure distribution on the physical parameters such as current velocity incident wave amplitude entry location heel angle and oblique motion it is found that the variation of current velocity has obvious effect on both the horizontal velocity of fluid and the wave steepness which play a major role on free surface and pressure graphical abstract the hydrodynamic performance of a two dimensional asymmetric wedge entering waves obliquely with gravity effect in the presence of a uniform current image 1 keywords hobem wave current interaction water entry fully nonlinear asymmetric wedge 1 introduction predicting the impact dynamics associated with entry of a solid body into the water surface is of fundamental and practical interest in naval architecture ocean engineering and coastal engineering due to its wide range of applications i e hydrodynamic loading on ships ship slamming launching of torpedoes see landing of aerial vehicles and missile projectiles impact upon entering water iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 during the water entry process the jet flow is formed along the body surface and leads to a short duration but very high fluid force on the body in addition the simulation of the time varying free surface near the intersections between body and water surfaces is difficult and complex but significantly influences the solving accuracy of fluid loads therefore it is very important to account for the effects of body motion on fluid transformation along body surface especially when waves and currents are both present extensive research has been performed using theoretical numerical and experimental models on the entry of a wedge into calm water for example based on the assumption of inviscid and incompressible fluid wagner 1932 derived the wave elevation for the water entry of body with low deadrise angle using the method of matched asymptotic expansions in which there are some implicit coupling of the velocity potential and wetted surface of the body using the wagner theory faltinsen 2002 and korobkin 2004 further discussed solid bodies with large deadrise angle entering into calm water subsequently khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2013 and shams and porfiri 2015 applied the wagner theory for a body with elastic deformation relative to the theoretical treatments based on wagner solution computational schemes based on the fully nonlinear theory enables a precise definition of the boundary conditions imposed on the instantaneous positions of the wetted body surface and water free surface including rigorous quantification of thin and long jet phenomenon due to slamming among the typical work zhao and faltinsen 1993 performed the water entry of a wedge at vertical constant speed using the boundary element method bem in time domain lu et al 2000 further extended the method to treat the hydroelastic interaction of the fluid and the body wu et al 2004 investigated both experimentally and numerically the vertical entry of a wedge through free fall motion with a single degree of freedom to control the number of elements at the initial stage a stretched coordinate system was developed along the same lines bao et al 2016 considered the flow detachment from the wetted body surface during the flow passing the knuckle while the above work is based on the potential flow another interesting solution is the viscous flow models based on the navier stokes equations or the lattice boltzmann equation the proponents of this approach are oger et al 2006 larsen 2013 gu et al 2014 de rosis et al 2014 zarghami et al 2014 anbarsooz et al 2014 erfanian et al 2015 facci et al 2016 and iranmanesh and passandieh fard 2017 besides these judge et al 2004 shams et al 2015 and russo et al 2017 conducted a series of experiments on the water entry of an asymmetric wedge however these mentioned works are limited to the water entry into calm water which will not represent waves events i e the emergence and re entrance of the bow causes severe wave impact as a ship advancing in rough sea conditions a large wave hitting an offshore platform at high speed generates very large slamming pressure on the deck therefore wave entry phenomenon and wave slamming is a common but complicated problem in which the wave will excite prominent effect on the slamming pressure during the coupling process between waves and body for instance the effective area of the slamming load is very finite and the position at which the maximum slamming load occurs varies with time furthermore the duration of slamming load measured at one spot is very short and slamming load has a much shorter rise time than decay time only a few studies of wave entry problems have been reported to date faltinsen 1990 used wagner theory for a wedge entering in linear waves without the gravity effect in the theoretical model the slamming load of ship section is obtained using the relative vertical velocity between ship section and waves korobkin 2007 further applied second order wagner theory to focus the initial stage of wave profile approximated by a liquid parabola impacting onto a rigid flat plate later sun et al 2015 investigated water entry of a two dimensional wedge with the prescribed speed into waves using bem based on the fully nonlinear theory they found that the gravity effect can alter the shape of the pressure distribution the location and the peak of pressure as the impact time progresses thus in the present numerical model the gravity is also included in the dynamic condition of free surface and the pressure distribution along the wetted body surface all foregoing studies are however for body entering into calm water or waves without taking into account the current effects in many coastal regions waves and currents generally coexist simultaneously and their interactions play a key role in most ocean dynamic processes moreover wave entry of a wedge with current effect has led to some new physical features the existence of the current leads to wave deformation and changes the swell spectrum because the incident wave amplitude increases in the presence of an opposing current and reduces in the presence of a following current and the wave energy exchange between the fundamental waves and higher order waves may be enhanced by currents this indicates that the problem for the water entry will no longer be self similar even when the body has a constant speed in addition even during the vertical entry of a symmetric body into waves with uniform currents the horizontal velocity of fluid changes significantly the free surface shape along the wetted body surface likewise the pressure distribution along the body surface may also be altered by currents due to the modification of the dispersion relation and the bernoulli equation the nonlinear interaction between currents and waves changes the wave flow field and influences the development of the thin and long jet flow in other words the coexistence of wave and current can alter the propagation property of respective holders it could be computationally more accurate and physically realistic to model wave entry problem of a wedge in the presence of currents it is the motivation of the present work to address this particular problem among various numerical studies the constant panel method and the first order boundary element method fobem have been commonly used in the analysis of nonlinear water entry zhao and faltinsen 1993 lu et al 2000 wu et al 2004 bao et al 2016 sun et al 2015 however the higher order boundary element method hobem can describe the tips or edges of the body surface more exactly and meet the requirement of continuity of flux at the intersections of the body surface and free surface more conveniently hobem has been widely applied in many nonlinear water wave problems kim and kim 1997 fochesato et al 2017 yan and liu 2011 lin et al 2014 cheng et al 2017a b ji et al 2016 2017 except for water entry modeling of a wedge the primary objective of this paper is to investigate the water entry of an asymmetric wedge into waves with current effects using the developed nonlinear hobem this work considers oblique wave current entry because the wedge has a heel angle and both vertical and horizontal translation velocity the velocity potential is expressed in a defined stretched coordinate system which can maintain sufficient numerical accuracy and control the number of elements at the initial stage in addition the total velocity potential is decomposed as the potential induced by the current speed the scattering potential and the incident potential at the initial stage to make the velocity potential tend to the incident potential far away from the body a rotation scheme of the stretched coordinate system relative to the body surface is applied on the free surface condition to update the intersection point between meshes on the free surface and body surface with the possible numerical stability for the calculation of fluid pressure distribution on the body surface an auxiliary function is introduced which can prevent unexpected inaccuracy and instability when directly solving the time derivative of the velocity potential a relatively comprehensive investigation of the free surface profile and the pressure distribution is provided in the presence of currents this paper is organized as follows in section 2 a description of the proposed numerical model is introduced in section 3 the present model is verified against the existing numerical results section 4 presents and discusses the dependence of the free surface profile and the pressure distribution on the design parameters such as current velocity incident wave amplitude entry location asymmetry of the body shape and horizontal speed finally the conclusions are presented in section 5 2 mathematical formulations and numerical solutions 2 1 governing equation and boundary conditions a two dimensional asymmetry wedge entering a wave and a uniform current obliquely at a prescribed speed is shown in fig 1 two cartesian coordinate systems are defined one is a space fixed coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 with the origin o in the undisturbed free surface and the y axis pointing vertically upwards the other is a body fixed coordinate system oxy when the wedge is at time t 0 the two sets of coordinate systems fully coincide with each other the fluid density ρ vertical velocity v of the wedge and the acceleration g of gravity is used for non dimensionalize u u i v j is the translational velocity of the body where i and j are the unit vectors in the x and y directions respectively σ is the heel angle from the symmetric line of the body to y axis γ is fixed angle between the symmetric line and the wedge face the left and right deadrise angles γ 1 and γ 2 can be given from the following relationships 1 γ 1 π 2 σ γ γ 2 π 2 σ γ the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and inviscid and the flow irrotational the velocity potential φ can therefore be introduced on the other hand considering the effects of current the total velocity potential can be expressed as 2 φ ζ x 0 ϕ where ζ w v w is the steady uniform current velocity and ϕ is the perturbation potential caused by waves both velocity potentials φ and ϕ satisfy the laplace equation 3 2 φ 2 ϕ 0 in ω on the instantaneous free surface s f both fully non linear kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions are satisfied and the mixed eulerian lagrangian mel approach is adopted to track the time dependent free surface nodes with water particles motion in both horizontal and vertical directions the resulting equations on the free surface can be modified as follows in the lagrangian form 4 d x 0 x 0 y 0 d t ϕ ζ i d ϕ d t η 0 1 2 ϕ 2 on s f where x 0 denotes the position vector of a fluid particle in the ox 0 y 0 system η 0 is the free surface elevation above the still water level d dt is the material derivative defined by d d t t φ the boundary condition on instantaneous wetted body surface s b is 5 ϕ n ε ζ 1 n x n y on s b where n n x n y is the normal vector of the wedge surface pointing out of the fluid domain and ε u v the far field boundary condition can then be written as 6 ϕ ϕ i on s where ϕ i is the incident potential in this paper the five order stokes wave theory given by fenton 1985 is used the corresponding potential ϕ i and wave elevation η i can be written as 7 ϕ i g k 3 k a e e k y 0 sin θ 1 2 k 3 a e 3 e k y 0 sin θ 1 2 k 4 a e 4 e 2 k y 0 sin 2 θ 37 24 k 5 a e 5 e k y 0 sin

θ where θ kx 0 ωt θ 0 ω k and θ 0 are the wave frequency wave number and initial phase respectively a e denotes current affected wave amplitude based on the conservation of wave action bretherton and garrett 1968 a e satisfies the following relation 9 a e a 1 k ζ ω c g 0 c g where a is the half of the wave height c g is the group velocity c g0 is current free group velocity considering current effects on wave propagation the following modified dispersion relation lin et al 2014 is used to solve the wave number k 10 ω k ζ 2 g k 1 1 2 k 2 a e 2 1 8 k 4 a e 4 2 as the above boundary value problem is simulated in the time domain the initial water surface conditions should be considered and the undisturbed wave conditions are required as follows 11 ϕ t 0 ϕ i η 0 t 0 η i if the cartesian system oxy moving together with the body is adopted to solve the above problem the following relationship is defined 12 x x 0 ε t y y 0 t a 0 where a 0 is the vertical coordinate of the tip in the ox 0 y 0 system at time t 0 thus further substituting eq 12 into eq 4 we can obtained 13 d x x y d t ϕ ζ ε i j d ϕ d t η t a 0 1 2 ϕ 2 on s f where η the free surface elevation in cartesian system oxy at the initial stage of wave current entry there is only a fraction of the wedge below the water surface if a fixed fluid domain is used a large number of elements would be need to discretize the body surface and free surface at the initial stage to possess sufficient accuracy and efficiency we used the method developed by wu et al 2004 which has also been successfully used by bao et al 2016 in this method a stretched coordinate system oαβ is introduced at the initial stage we define 14 φ x y t ζ x ε t ϕ ζ x ε t t φ d α β t ϕ i x y t in which φ d is the velocity potential due to the disturbance α x t and β y t it can be seen from eq 14 that φ d and ϕ i are defined in the stretched and cartesian coordinate system respectively the corresponding body surface boundary condition can be obtained 15 φ n ε ζ n x n y ϕ i n on s b it should be noted that φ d 0 far away from the body then at time t 0 the free surface boundary condition eq 13 can be defined 16 d t α d t φ d α ϕ i x ζ ε d t β d t φ d β ϕ i y 1 d t φ d ϕ i d t t β t a 0 1 2 φ d α ϕ i x 2 φ d β ϕ i y 2 on s f in the subsequent time steps the velocity potential ϕ is assembled into tφ α β thus the body surface condition is the same form with eq 5 and the free surface boundary conditions can be written as follows 17 d t α d t φ α ζ ε d t β d t φ β 1 d t φ d t t β t a 0 1 2 φ α 2 φ β 2 on s f 2 2 higher order boundary element method hobem by applying green s second identity to the fluid domain the above boundary value problem can be converted in the usual manner into the following boundary integral equation 18 χ p φ p γ g p q φ q n φ q g p q n d γ where p and q are the source point and field point respectively χ is the solid angle coefficient given ning et al 2009 γ is the whole boundary of the fluid domain g is the green function and can be written as g lnr pq where r pq is the distance between the source point and the field point the boundary surface in eq 18 is discretized with a set of collocation nodes and higher order elements i e three node line elements these elements with collocation points are isoparametric i e the physical variables are interpolated by the same quadratic shape functions 19 α i β j l 1 m h l ξ α l i β l j φ ξ l 1 m h l ξ φ l φ ξ n l 1 m h l ξ φ n l where local intrinsic coordinate ξ lies in the interval 1 1 α l β l φ l φ n l and h l are the coordinates the potentials the normal derivatives of the potential and the shape functions corresponding to the l th node in the local system and m is the number of nodes of each element thus substituting eq 19 into 18 and using gauss legendre quadrature with 4 integration points within each element we have 20 χ p φ p i 1 n e j 1 4 l 1 3 h l j g p q ξ j φ n l j ξ j w j i 1 n e j 1 4 l 1 3 h l j φ l g p q ξ j n j ξ j w j where n e is the total number of elements j j represents the jacobian matrix relating the physical coordinates to the local intrinsic coordinates within an element w j is the gauss coefficient finally the discretized integral eq 19 can be transformed in the matrix form and the unknowns i e the normal derivative of the potential on free surface and the potential on body surface can be moved to the left side as follows 21 φ b φ n f r b b h b f r f b h f f 1 h b b r b f h f b r f f φ n b φ f where the subscript b and f represent the solid surface and free surface respectively the matrixes r and h are influence matrixes corresponding to the lng and g respectively after solving the system eq 20 and obtaining the fluid velocities and normal vector on the free surface the velocity potential on free surface and free surface profile are advanced by using the runga kutta 4th order rk4 method thus all boundary surfaces can be remeshed and updated at each time step 2 3 corner problem between body surface and free surface after a sufficiently long time a numerical instability may occur due to the discontinuity of flux at the intersection of the body surface and free surface it means therefore that the mesh should be specifically treated at every time step to realize this process the rotation scheme of the stretched system oαβ to new system oμυ is used to meet the requirement of continuity of flux at the corner here we have 22 α μ cos γ 0 υ sin γ 0 23 β μ sin γ 0 υ cos γ 0 where γ 0 is the angle of rotation from the stretched system oαβ to new system oμυ υ is along the body surface then substituting eqs 22 and 23 into eq 17 the free surface boundary condition can be expressed 24 d t υ d t φ υ ζ ε sin γ 0 cos γ 0 d t φ d t d t υ d t φ υ ε ζ cos γ 0 sin γ 0 φ μ ε ζ sin γ 0 cos γ 0 φ υ t μ sin γ 0 t υ cos γ 0 t a 0 1 2 φ μ 2 φ υ 2 eq 24 hold the criterion that the intersection points can move only along the body surface therefore μ is a constant value i e 0 while φ and υ vary with time t 2 4 hydrodynamic forces the dimensionless pressure distribution on the body surface can be obtained from the bernoulli equation 25 p ϕ t 1 2 ϕ 2 ζ ϕ x t β t a 0 where ϕ t is the temporal derivative of ϕ in the space fixed system and its accurate calculation is very crucial in solving correct pressure distribution on the body surface in eq 25 the backward finite difference method is instability and inaccurate for fully nonlinear problems because nodes on the wetted body surface move with the time compared with acceleration potential method combined with the modal decomposition method the auxiliary function χ proposed by wu et al 2004 can enhance computing efficiency in this method the auxiliary function satisfies the laplace equation in the fluid domain and the flowing boundary conditions on the free surface we specify 26 χ 1 2 φ 2 ζ φ x t β t a 0 ε φ α φ β the condition on the body surface is taken as 27 χ n 0 and on the far field the boundary condition can be expressed as 28 χ n ϕ i t n ε ϕ i x 0 n ϕ i y 0 n thus the boundary integral equation similar to eq 18 can be obtained to determine the auxiliary function χ then the temporal derivative of ϕ can be solved through ϕ t χ ε φ α φ β on the other hand spatial derivatives of the velocity potential on body surface in eq 24 can be obtained from follows 29 φ α φ β x ξ z ξ n α n β 1 φ ξ φ n 3 model validation 3 1 convergent tests in the convergent test the vertical water entry of a symmetric wedge with γ 45 into calm water i e a 0 is considered the gravity effect is included in the simulation the length and height of the numerical computational domain are respectively set to 50 and 20 the time step is selected as dt t 0 0 05 in which initial time t 0 0 002 the size of meshes on the body surface free surface and control surface of far field is non uniform the smallest element is set near the jet root which is the position of the largest impact pressure gradient and the size of the element increases gradually away from the jet at a given ratio which is 1 03 in this study however in order to remain good numerical accuracy it is essential to set the largest size of the element i e 14 meshes per wavelength λ 14 this means when the size of the element increases to λ 14 the elements are then equal three different mesh schemes i e a fine mesh minimal element length l m 0 04 an intermediate mesh minimal element length l m 0 06 and a coarse mesh minimal element length is l m 0 08 are selected figs 2 and 3 depict the free surface profile and the total pressure distribution at various time t t 0 10 50 and 500 respectively the results are identical between the fine and intermediate mesh schemes indicating that mesh convergence can be achieved using the intermediate mesh scheme however the fobem is used to reach the same results using minimal element length l m 0 03 for the same case this indicated that compared with fobem the hobem can describe the tips or edges of the body surface more exactly using less elements similar tests for three time steps dt t 0 0 03 0 05 and 0 07 using the intermediate mesh indicate that dt t 0 0 05 is sufficiently small thus l m 0 06 t 0 0 002 and dt t0 0 05 are sufficient for numerical purposes and are adopted in the following simulation it is also interesting from fig 3 that the pressure near tip of the wedge increases rapidly with time progresses while the pressure near the jet root is reduced gradually this is because the gravity effect on the pressure become more prominent as time increases and this result is consistent with the work of sun et al 2015 in addition the water particles on the wetted body surface should be pulled down by the gravity as the thin and long jet is gradually developed and the flow cannot be always attached on the body this requires undertake the air cavity effect which beyond the scope of the presented model 3 2 validation tests the present nonlinear results are compared with the published numerical solutions for validation a case of a symmetric wedge with γ 45 entering waves vertically with gravity effect is considered and the input conditions are the incident wave amplitude a 0 1 the initial phase θ 0 0 and the wave number k 2 513 which corresponds to the wavelength λ 2 5 and the wave period t 3 84 figs 4 and 5 give the free surface profile and the pressure distribution at time t 0 02 0 1 and 0 5 respectively the comparison with the published numerical solution from sun et al 2015 is also presented the excellent agreement between our hobem numerical solutions and the fobem numerical solutions obtained by sun et al 2015 validates and confirms the capability of the present formulation and numerical method in resolving the nonlinear wave entry problem from figs 4 and 5 it can be observed when the body vertically enters into progressing wave both the free surface profile and the pressure distribution are asymmetric due to the horizontal velocity of the incident waves which is different from the results of water entry of a wedge into calm see figs 2 and 3 this indicates that the wave entry problem should be done with rigorous analysis in addition it is evident that the effect of temporal variation of the wave depends on the entry time t for example when t 0 02 fig 4 a and fig 5 a the term ωt in the wave phase θ can be regard as zero and thus the wave including velocity potential eq 7 and wave elevation eq 8 are almost stationary which means that the wedge is approximatively entering a given wave profile conversely when t 0 1 and 0 5 the term ωt is not small relative to θ so the free surface profile fig 4 b and c and pressure distribution fig 5 b and c are sensitive to wave propagation it is noted that when the time t is small or only a small part of the wedge is in the wave i e t 0 02 the pressure distribution is almost completely dominated by the horizontal velocity of the incident waves and thus the pressure distribution near tip of the wedge has discontinuity phenomenon as t increases or more part of the wedge is in waves the horizontal velocity decays rapidly according to the derivative of eq 7 with respect to x0 while the effect of the effective deadrise angle between the body surface and the free surface becomes more prominent and thus the difference between pressure on both sides decreases gradually see fig 5 c when t increases to 0 1 the horizontal velocity of the waves at the tip of the wedge is almost zero and thus the pressure at the tip of the wedge is continuous 4 numerical results 4 1 vertical wave current entry of a symmetric body in this and the following two sections currents are imposed on the wave field to examine wave current entry problems of a wedge with special attention to the free surface profile and the pressure distribution figs 6 and 7 show respectively the computed free surface profile and pressure distribution at t 0 02 0 1 and 0 5 for the wedge considered in fig 4 with input parameters a 0 1 k 2 513 and ζ 0 0 05 and 0 05 all curves in these figures are plotted in the stretched system it can be seen that when t 0 02 the free surface solutions in fig 6 a are near the region of the wave peak due to the initial phase θ 0 0 and the corresponding jet surface is larger for a following current than that for absence of a current and vice versa for an opposing current this behavior can be explanation by the potential theory when the incident waves are following a current the incident wave length increases and the wave steepness a λ is reduced according to the modified dispersion relation eq 10 however when the incident waves are against a current the opposite is true in addition the jet difference among following current zero current and opposing current on the left hand side of the wedge is more obvious than that on the right hand side of the wedge this is because the initial free surface is mainly related to the velocity of the fluid and the horizontal velocity of the fluid which is expressed by the superposition of wave velocity derivative of eq 7 with respect to x 0 and current velocity ζ is much larger than the vertical velocity of the fluid this means that the body at a equivalent horizontal velocity moves along the negative direction of fluid velocity which can cause the variation of the jet surface as time increases a larger region of free surface will be distorted by the body surface see fig 6 b and c fig 6 d presents the whole free surface at t 0 1 it is obvious that the incident wave length increases but wave height decreases in the presence of a following current and vice versa in the presence of an opposing current this is consistent with the conclusion given by lin et al 2014 also at the far field the numerical solutions agree well with the analytical solution by eq 8 which indicates that the disturbance induced by the wedge is completely diminished we further investigate the effects of the fluid horizontal velocity and the wave steepness on the pressure distribution shown in fig 7 at initial time the wave surface near the tip of the wedge is almost flat and the horizontal velocity is the determining factor in pressure distribution it can be observed from fig 7 a that when t 0 02 the pressures on the left hand side for all currents are larger than that on the right hand side which indicates that the incident wave velocity is dominant in this case moreover the wave horizontal velocity decreases for a following current and increases for an opposing current because the initial wave horizontal velocity on the free surface is related to a k according to eq 7 on the other hand the pressure on the left right hand side can be increased reduced for a following current due to larger relative horizontal velocity between the fluid and the body and vice versa for an opposing current thus the fluid horizontal velocity is more complicated due to the presence of current as time t increases to 0 1 the wedge has moved quite a distance from the free surface in which the incident wave horizontal velocity decays rapidly with submerged depth of the wedge and the fluid horizontal velocity comes mainly from the current also the effects of the wave steepness is gradually evident when the wave steepness increases i e an opposing current the local deadrise angle between the wedge surface and the free surface increases and the pressure on both sides is inversely proportional to the wave steepness consequently as shown in fig 7 b the differences among the pressures on the left hand side for a following current a zero current and an opposing current become much larger and that on the right hand side is close to zero due to the combination of the current and the wave steepness when the wedge has move enough distance see fig 7 c the effects of wave can be ignored at very large y 0 and the current velocity is dominant which results in that the pressure on the left hand side for a following current is larger than that for zero current and vice versa for an opposing current while the opposite is true on the right hand side for wave current entry of a wedge the incident current free wave amplitude a has a evident influence on the free surface profile and pressure distribution as shown in figs 8 11 figs 8 and 9 respectively give the free surface profile at t 0 02 and 0 1 for varying values of wave amplitude a and current velocity ζ when k 2 513 and the rest of the input parameters are fixed using the given values it can be seen from these figures that the jet surface is reduced as the incident current free wave amplitude increases which is because the wave steepness of incident wave increases with a when current velocity increases from 0 05 to 0 05 the surface difference among a 0 0 1 and 0 15 becomes much smaller as the incident wave amplitude is increased by an opposing current and is reduced by a following current it is noted that the free surface in fig 9 include a larger area of the wave than that in fig 8 as the time increases and thus the deformation of the free surface becomes more prominent figs 10 and 11 respectively give the corresponding pressure distribution at t 0 02 and 0 1 in the absence of waves and currents when the wedge enters vertically into calm water the pressure distribution about the symmetric line of the body is symmetric and continuous because of the boundary condition near the tip however in the presence of waves or currents the results are not symmetric because the fluid horizontal velocity has a sharp variation near the tip furthermore at t 0 02 the pressure difference between that on the both sides of the body increases gradually for all current velocities as a increases because the wave horizontal velocity increases with a when t increases to 0 1 see fig 11 the pressure on both sides of the body decreases as a increases due to the increase of the effective dearise angle it is noted that when a 0 figs 10 b and 11 b show a larger pressure on the left hand side of the wedge for a following current while figs 10 c and 11 c show the opposite results for an opposing current this is because that a following current leads to larger relative horizontal velocity between the fluid and the wedge and vice versa for an opposing current when a is not equal to zero at t 0 02 the pressure on the right hand side is almost identical among ζ 0 05 0 and 0 05 this is because the fluid horizontal velocity is determined by both the current affected wave velocity and the current velocity taking a following current as an example the wave horizontal velocity is reduced whereas the fluid velocity is increased by current velocity consequently the pressure on the right hand side is close to that in the case of zero current at t 0 1 the pressure difference between on both sides increases as current increases due to the combined effect of the wave steepness and the current velocity all the curves of figs 6 11 are given for a fixed water entry location i e wave peak θ 0 0 to further validate the effects of the water entry location on the free surface profile and pressure distribution the cases with θ 0 90 and 180 which are respectively correspond to that the wedge hits the middle of wave slope and the wave trough are also conducted and compared with the counterpart of θ 0 0 for this numerical simulation a 0 1 k 2 513 γ 45 and vertical entry are selected for given parameters comparisons of the free surface profile with different current velocities ζ 0 05 0 and 0 05 at t 0 02 and 0 1 are respectively shown in figs 12 and 13 as well as the pressure distribution are shown in figs 14 and 15 it can be seen that the water entry location for a following current occurs at x coordinate somewhat larger than that for zero current and vice versa for an opposing current this is mainly caused by an changed wave length in the presence of currents when θ 0 is fixed in the case of peak entry the pressure on the left hand side for all currents is larger than that on the right hand side while the opposite is true for the case of trough entry except for the curve of t 0 1 in the presence of a following current the reason is that when the wedge hits the wave peak or wave trough the initial wave slope near the tip is zero and the pressure difference between on the both sides is mainly related to the wave horizontal velocity which is along the wave incident direction for peak entry and vice versa for trough entry the exception for trough entry at t 0 1 in the presence of a following current see fig 15 b can be explained by the direction of current velocity it is also interesting that at t 0 1 the pressure on both sides of the wedge for trough entry is larger than that for peak entry this is because that the effective deadrise angle becomes bigger for peak entry and becomes smaller for trough entry as more part of the wedge enters into the water in the particular case of middle slope entry the downward slope results in that the effectiveness deadrise angle on the left hand side is much smaller than that on the right hand side and thus a lager pressure can be obtained on the left hand side in addition the maximum pressure at middle slop entry is significantly enhanced as compared with the peak and trough entries 4 2 vertical wave current entry of an asymmetric body simulations for asymmetric entry can be achieved by adjusting σ in eq 1 figs 16 and 17 respectively show the free surface profile at t 0 02 and 0 1 with different current velocities ζ 0 05 0 and 0 05 the corresponding pressure distribution is shown in figs 18 and 19 four different heel angles σ 0 5 10 and 15 are selected with the fixed angle γ 45 the wave period t 3 84 considered in the numerical model corresponds to k 2 513 the wave amplitude a and initial phase θ 0 are 0 1 and 0 respectively it can be seen that as the heel angle increases the jet on the left hand side of the wedge becomes longer but is reduced on the right hand side which is because larger heel angle leads to more area of fluid structure interface on the left hand side in addition the difference between the free surfaces on both sides of the wedge is increased by a following current and is reduced by an opposing current the patterns of the pressure distribution is similar to that of the flow attached to the body surface i e the larger heel angle leads to the bigger difference between pressure on both sides and this increase of σ broadens the effective area under the p curves on the left hand side and vice versa for the right hand side due to the variation of the deadrise angle between the body surface and the free surface at σ 15 a sudden drop of the pressure occurs near the tip of the wedge at t 0 02 for all currents as indicated in fig 18 which is may be because of the velocity singularity at the tip in physical reality the fluid particle attached on the body surface will fall into fluid domain by the gravity and the attached flow cannot be abidingly maintained to realize the flow detachment including turbulent flow and particle separation the kutta condition with vortex shedding should be implemented in the velocity continuity on the body surface this is beyond the scope of the presented model with impermeable body surface boundary condition which does allow water moving only along the body surface as described in section 2 4 it is also interesting that the current can mitigate the pressure values of the sudden drop either in a following current or in an opposing current as t increase the tip has moved farther away from the water surface and thus the effect of wave velocity is rapidly attenuated which leads to the disappearance of the sudden drop phenomena from the pressure curves in fig 19 the pressure on the left hand side is increased by a following current and is reduced by an opposing current but that on the right hand side is almost identical among a following current a zero current and an opposing current which is mainly due the effect of the current on the fluid velocity and the wave steepness 4 3 oblique wave current entry of an asymmetric body finally we consider the case of an asymmetric wedge obliquely entering waves in the presence of currents at different ε u v with γ 45 σ 5 a 0 1 t 3 84 and θ 0 0 ε 0 0 ε 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 and 0 ε 0 2 represent the vertical entry the lower right entry and lower left entry respectively figs 20 and 21 respectively gives the free surface profile at t 0 02 and 0 1 for an following current a zero current and an opposing current it can be seen that the length of the jet on the left hand side is gradually reduced as ε increases and vice versa for that on the right side this is also reflected by the pressure distribution in figs 22 and 23 in addition the variation of the pressure distribution versus ε is more prominent than that of the free surface profile which has also been found by sun et al 2015 when the wedge pushes the fluid along the negative direction of x i e ε 0 2 whereas the incident wave propagates along the x direction the relative horizontal velocity between the fluid and wedge becomes larger which results in a significant increase of pressure on the left hand side and a sharp pressure variation near the tip of the wedge due to the cross flow mentioned in the foregoing section when the wedge has a positive velocity ε 0 the pressure difference between on the both sides of the wedge decreases due to the reduction of the relative horizontal velocity between the fluid and wedge and then the horizontal motion of the wedge is dominant when ε 0 4 at t 0 02 or ε 0 3 at t 0 1 for the following and zero currents while ε 0 3 at t 0 02 or ε 0 2 at t 0 1 for the opposing current this leads to a larger pressure distribution on the right hand side as ε continues to increase this feature becomes more obvious a following current and an opposing current is equivalent to that the wedge has a same value of velocity in the negative and positive direction of x respectively therefore the role of the positive horizontal velocity of the wedge can be weakened for a following current and enhanced for an opposing current and this is opposite is true for the negative horizontal velocity of the wedge 5 conclusions based on the potential theory a time domain hobem mel has been implemented to simulate fully nonlinear oblique wave entry of an asymmetric wedge with gravity effect in the presence of a uniform current at initial stage a stretched coordinate system according to the ratio of the spatial coordinates and the travelled vertical displacement of the wedge is adopted to describe the scattering velocity while a body fixed cartesian coordinate system is defined to deal with the potential induced by currents and the incident wave potential as time progresses the total velocity potential is expressed in the stretched coordinate system and a rotation coordinate scheme is used to avoiding the intersection point between the free surface and the body surface moving into or away from the body an auxiliary function is introduced to obtain the temporal derivative of velocity potential in bernoulli pressure equation by solving the relating boundary integral equation again by making use of the shape functions the spatial derivatives of the velocity potential on the body surface is analytically obtained in higher order elements the present hobem model is verified by comparing with the published fobem numerical solutions and reasonably good agreement between them are obtained the physical characteristics of the wave current entry is examined through extensive numerical calculations the results indicate that the elevation of jet surface is enhanced by a following current and reduced by an opposing current the horizontal velocity of the fluid including indent waves and currents causes a larger jet difference on the side of the wedge facing the fluid flow when the wedge hits the wave peak the horizontal velocity of the fluid which is dependent of the combined effect of waves and currents plays a major role on the pressure distribution as time progresses a following current gives a reduction of the effective deadrise angle which increases the pressure on the side of the wedge facing the fluid flow but remain almost identical pressure on the other side due to the coupling effect with current velocity this opposite is true for an opposing current when the tip of wedge has moved enough away from the water surface the effect of the wave steepness and wave velocity can be ignored and only the effect of current velocity is remained the jet surface become steeper as the incident current free wave amplitude increases due to the change of wave steepness additionally the jet surface difference among various incident wave amplitudes is more sensitive to the opposing current than the following current due to the change of wave steepness this opposite feature is reflected in the pressure the effects of wave amplitude and entry location on pressure value are complicated due to the major role of horizontal velocity of the fluid or wave steepness the vertical entry of the asymmetric wedge entering into wave current reveals that the heel angle changes the contact area of both sides and water surface which has a significant influence on the length of the jets and the pressure on both sides furthermore a larger variation of pressure near the tip of the wedge occurs with increasing heel angle due to the velocity singularity at the tip and can be mitigated by the currents when the tip has moved vertically rather distance the discontinuity of the pressure at the tip will is weakened during oblique wave current entry the effect of horizontal velocity of the wedge on pressure is more pronounced than that on the free surface profile when the wedge is supposed to move heading toward the fluid flow the pressure variation near the tip of the wedge is more evident due to the increase of relative horizontal velocity between the fluid and the wedge and the role of horizontal velocity of the wedge is enhanced by the following current and reduced by the opposing current this opposite is true when the moving direction is reversed to the following fluid condition acknowledgment the authors are grateful to the national science

23538,this paper concerns the hydrodynamic performance of a two dimensional asymmetric wedge entering waves obliquely with gravity effect in the presence of a uniform current a time domain higher order boundary element method hobem based on potential theory with fully nonlinear boundary conditions is developed to solve this problem a stretched coordinate system is adopted in the spatial domain to avoid a large number of elements discretized in fixed computational domain at the initial stage during mesh regriding and interpolation a rotation scheme of the stretched coordinate system is employed to meet the requirement of continuity of flux at the intersection points an auxiliary function is introduced to calculate pressure distribution on body surface the present model is validated against the published numerical results for vertical wave entry in the absence of currents numerical calculations are conducted to analyze the dependence of the free surface elevation and the pressure distribution on the physical parameters such as current velocity incident wave amplitude entry location heel angle and oblique motion it is found that the variation of current velocity has obvious effect on both the horizontal velocity of fluid and the wave steepness which play a major role on free surface and pressure graphical abstract the hydrodynamic performance of a two dimensional asymmetric wedge entering waves obliquely with gravity effect in the presence of a uniform current image 1 keywords hobem wave current interaction water entry fully nonlinear asymmetric wedge 1 introduction predicting the impact dynamics associated with entry of a solid body into the water surface is of fundamental and practical interest in naval architecture ocean engineering and coastal engineering due to its wide range of applications i e hydrodynamic loading on ships ship slamming launching of torpedoes see landing of aerial vehicles and missile projectiles impact upon entering water iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 during the water entry process the jet flow is formed along the body surface and leads to a short duration but very high fluid force on the body in addition the simulation of the time varying free surface near the intersections between body and water surfaces is difficult and complex but significantly influences the solving accuracy of fluid loads therefore it is very important to account for the effects of body motion on fluid transformation along body surface especially when waves and currents are both present extensive research has been performed using theoretical numerical and experimental models on the entry of a wedge into calm water for example based on the assumption of inviscid and incompressible fluid wagner 1932 derived the wave elevation for the water entry of body with low deadrise angle using the method of matched asymptotic expansions in which there are some implicit coupling of the velocity potential and wetted surface of the body using the wagner theory faltinsen 2002 and korobkin 2004 further discussed solid bodies with large deadrise angle entering into calm water subsequently khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2013 and shams and porfiri 2015 applied the wagner theory for a body with elastic deformation relative to the theoretical treatments based on wagner solution computational schemes based on the fully nonlinear theory enables a precise definition of the boundary conditions imposed on the instantaneous positions of the wetted body surface and water free surface including rigorous quantification of thin and long jet phenomenon due to slamming among the typical work zhao and faltinsen 1993 performed the water entry of a wedge at vertical constant speed using the boundary element method bem in time domain lu et al 2000 further extended the method to treat the hydroelastic interaction of the fluid and the body wu et al 2004 investigated both experimentally and numerically the vertical entry of a wedge through free fall motion with a single degree of freedom to control the number of elements at the initial stage a stretched coordinate system was developed along the same lines bao et al 2016 considered the flow detachment from the wetted body surface during the flow passing the knuckle while the above work is based on the potential flow another interesting solution is the viscous flow models based on the navier stokes equations or the lattice boltzmann equation the proponents of this approach are oger et al 2006 larsen 2013 gu et al 2014 de rosis et al 2014 zarghami et al 2014 anbarsooz et al 2014 erfanian et al 2015 facci et al 2016 and iranmanesh and passandieh fard 2017 besides these judge et al 2004 shams et al 2015 and russo et al 2017 conducted a series of experiments on the water entry of an asymmetric wedge however these mentioned works are limited to the water entry into calm water which will not represent waves events i e the emergence and re entrance of the bow causes severe wave impact as a ship advancing in rough sea conditions a large wave hitting an offshore platform at high speed generates very large slamming pressure on the deck therefore wave entry phenomenon and wave slamming is a common but complicated problem in which the wave will excite prominent effect on the slamming pressure during the coupling process between waves and body for instance the effective area of the slamming load is very finite and the position at which the maximum slamming load occurs varies with time furthermore the duration of slamming load measured at one spot is very short and slamming load has a much shorter rise time than decay time only a few studies of wave entry problems have been reported to date faltinsen 1990 used wagner theory for a wedge entering in linear waves without the gravity effect in the theoretical model the slamming load of ship section is obtained using the relative vertical velocity between ship section and waves korobkin 2007 further applied second order wagner theory to focus the initial stage of wave profile approximated by a liquid parabola impacting onto a rigid flat plate later sun et al 2015 investigated water entry of a two dimensional wedge with the prescribed speed into waves using bem based on the fully nonlinear theory they found that the gravity effect can alter the shape of the pressure distribution the location and the peak of pressure as the impact time progresses thus in the present numerical model the gravity is also included in the dynamic condition of free surface and the pressure distribution along the wetted body surface all foregoing studies are however for body entering into calm water or waves without taking into account the current effects in many coastal regions waves and currents generally coexist simultaneously and their interactions play a key role in most ocean dynamic processes moreover wave entry of a wedge with current effect has led to some new physical features the existence of the current leads to wave deformation and changes the swell spectrum because the incident wave amplitude increases in the presence of an opposing current and reduces in the presence of a following current and the wave energy exchange between the fundamental waves and higher order waves may be enhanced by currents this indicates that the problem for the water entry will no longer be self similar even when the body has a constant speed in addition even during the vertical entry of a symmetric body into waves with uniform currents the horizontal velocity of fluid changes significantly the free surface shape along the wetted body surface likewise the pressure distribution along the body surface may also be altered by currents due to the modification of the dispersion relation and the bernoulli equation the nonlinear interaction between currents and waves changes the wave flow field and influences the development of the thin and long jet flow in other words the coexistence of wave and current can alter the propagation property of respective holders it could be computationally more accurate and physically realistic to model wave entry problem of a wedge in the presence of currents it is the motivation of the present work to address this particular problem among various numerical studies the constant panel method and the first order boundary element method fobem have been commonly used in the analysis of nonlinear water entry zhao and faltinsen 1993 lu et al 2000 wu et al 2004 bao et al 2016 sun et al 2015 however the higher order boundary element method hobem can describe the tips or edges of the body surface more exactly and meet the requirement of continuity of flux at the intersections of the body surface and free surface more conveniently hobem has been widely applied in many nonlinear water wave problems kim and kim 1997 fochesato et al 2017 yan and liu 2011 lin et al 2014 cheng et al 2017a b ji et al 2016 2017 except for water entry modeling of a wedge the primary objective of this paper is to investigate the water entry of an asymmetric wedge into waves with current effects using the developed nonlinear hobem this work considers oblique wave current entry because the wedge has a heel angle and both vertical and horizontal translation velocity the velocity potential is expressed in a defined stretched coordinate system which can maintain sufficient numerical accuracy and control the number of elements at the initial stage in addition the total velocity potential is decomposed as the potential induced by the current speed the scattering potential and the incident potential at the initial stage to make the velocity potential tend to the incident potential far away from the body a rotation scheme of the stretched coordinate system relative to the body surface is applied on the free surface condition to update the intersection point between meshes on the free surface and body surface with the possible numerical stability for the calculation of fluid pressure distribution on the body surface an auxiliary function is introduced which can prevent unexpected inaccuracy and instability when directly solving the time derivative of the velocity potential a relatively comprehensive investigation of the free surface profile and the pressure distribution is provided in the presence of currents this paper is organized as follows in section 2 a description of the proposed numerical model is introduced in section 3 the present model is verified against the existing numerical results section 4 presents and discusses the dependence of the free surface profile and the pressure distribution on the design parameters such as current velocity incident wave amplitude entry location asymmetry of the body shape and horizontal speed finally the conclusions are presented in section 5 2 mathematical formulations and numerical solutions 2 1 governing equation and boundary conditions a two dimensional asymmetry wedge entering a wave and a uniform current obliquely at a prescribed speed is shown in fig 1 two cartesian coordinate systems are defined one is a space fixed coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 with the origin o in the undisturbed free surface and the y axis pointing vertically upwards the other is a body fixed coordinate system oxy when the wedge is at time t 0 the two sets of coordinate systems fully coincide with each other the fluid density ρ vertical velocity v of the wedge and the acceleration g of gravity is used for non dimensionalize u u i v j is the translational velocity of the body where i and j are the unit vectors in the x and y directions respectively σ is the heel angle from the symmetric line of the body to y axis γ is fixed angle between the symmetric line and the wedge face the left and right deadrise angles γ 1 and γ 2 can be given from the following relationships 1 γ 1 π 2 σ γ γ 2 π 2 σ γ the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and inviscid and the flow irrotational the velocity potential φ can therefore be introduced on the other hand considering the effects of current the total velocity potential can be expressed as 2 φ ζ x 0 ϕ where ζ w v w is the steady uniform current velocity and ϕ is the perturbation potential caused by waves both velocity potentials φ and ϕ satisfy the laplace equation 3 2 φ 2 ϕ 0 in ω on the instantaneous free surface s f both fully non linear kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions are satisfied and the mixed eulerian lagrangian mel approach is adopted to track the time dependent free surface nodes with water particles motion in both horizontal and vertical directions the resulting equations on the free surface can be modified as follows in the lagrangian form 4 d x 0 x 0 y 0 d t ϕ ζ i d ϕ d t η 0 1 2 ϕ 2 on s f where x 0 denotes the position vector of a fluid particle in the ox 0 y 0 system η 0 is the free surface elevation above the still water level d dt is the material derivative defined by d d t t φ the boundary condition on instantaneous wetted body surface s b is 5 ϕ n ε ζ 1 n x n y on s b where n n x n y is the normal vector of the wedge surface pointing out of the fluid domain and ε u v the far field boundary condition can then be written as 6 ϕ ϕ i on s where ϕ i is the incident potential in this paper the five order stokes wave theory given by fenton 1985 is used the corresponding potential ϕ i and wave elevation η i can be written as 7 ϕ i g k 3 k a e e k y 0 sin θ 1 2 k 3 a e 3 e k y 0 sin θ 1 2 k 4 a e 4 e 2 k y 0 sin 2 θ 37 24 k 5 a e 5 e k y 0 sin

θ where θ kx 0 ωt θ 0 ω k and θ 0 are the wave frequency wave number and initial phase respectively a e denotes current affected wave amplitude based on the conservation of wave action bretherton and garrett 1968 a e satisfies the following relation 9 a e a 1 k ζ ω c g 0 c g where a is the half of the wave height c g is the group velocity c g0 is current free group velocity considering current effects on wave propagation the following modified dispersion relation lin et al 2014 is used to solve the wave number k 10 ω k ζ 2 g k 1 1 2 k 2 a e 2 1 8 k 4 a e 4 2 as the above boundary value problem is simulated in the time domain the initial water surface conditions should be considered and the undisturbed wave conditions are required as follows 11 ϕ t 0 ϕ i η 0 t 0 η i if the cartesian system oxy moving together with the body is adopted to solve the above problem the following relationship is defined 12 x x 0 ε t y y 0 t a 0 where a 0 is the vertical coordinate of the tip in the ox 0 y 0 system at time t 0 thus further substituting eq 12 into eq 4 we can obtained 13 d x x y d t ϕ ζ ε i j d ϕ d t η t a 0 1 2 ϕ 2 on s f where η the free surface elevation in cartesian system oxy at the initial stage of wave current entry there is only a fraction of the wedge below the water surface if a fixed fluid domain is used a large number of elements would be need to discretize the body surface and free surface at the initial stage to possess sufficient accuracy and efficiency we used the method developed by wu et al 2004 which has also been successfully used by bao et al 2016 in this method a stretched coordinate system oαβ is introduced at the initial stage we define 14 φ x y t ζ x ε t ϕ ζ x ε t t φ d α β t ϕ i x y t in which φ d is the velocity potential due to the disturbance α x t and β y t it can be seen from eq 14 that φ d and ϕ i are defined in the stretched and cartesian coordinate system respectively the corresponding body surface boundary condition can be obtained 15 φ n ε ζ n x n y ϕ i n on s b it should be noted that φ d 0 far away from the body then at time t 0 the free surface boundary condition eq 13 can be defined 16 d t α d t φ d α ϕ i x ζ ε d t β d t φ d β ϕ i y 1 d t φ d ϕ i d t t β t a 0 1 2 φ d α ϕ i x 2 φ d β ϕ i y 2 on s f in the subsequent time steps the velocity potential ϕ is assembled into tφ α β thus the body surface condition is the same form with eq 5 and the free surface boundary conditions can be written as follows 17 d t α d t φ α ζ ε d t β d t φ β 1 d t φ d t t β t a 0 1 2 φ α 2 φ β 2 on s f 2 2 higher order boundary element method hobem by applying green s second identity to the fluid domain the above boundary value problem can be converted in the usual manner into the following boundary integral equation 18 χ p φ p γ g p q φ q n φ q g p q n d γ where p and q are the source point and field point respectively χ is the solid angle coefficient given ning et al 2009 γ is the whole boundary of the fluid domain g is the green function and can be written as g lnr pq where r pq is the distance between the source point and the field point the boundary surface in eq 18 is discretized with a set of collocation nodes and higher order elements i e three node line elements these elements with collocation points are isoparametric i e the physical variables are interpolated by the same quadratic shape functions 19 α i β j l 1 m h l ξ α l i β l j φ ξ l 1 m h l ξ φ l φ ξ n l 1 m h l ξ φ n l where local intrinsic coordinate ξ lies in the interval 1 1 α l β l φ l φ n l and h l are the coordinates the potentials the normal derivatives of the potential and the shape functions corresponding to the l th node in the local system and m is the number of nodes of each element thus substituting eq 19 into 18 and using gauss legendre quadrature with 4 integration points within each element we have 20 χ p φ p i 1 n e j 1 4 l 1 3 h l j g p q ξ j φ n l j ξ j w j i 1 n e j 1 4 l 1 3 h l j φ l g p q ξ j n j ξ j w j where n e is the total number of elements j j represents the jacobian matrix relating the physical coordinates to the local intrinsic coordinates within an element w j is the gauss coefficient finally the discretized integral eq 19 can be transformed in the matrix form and the unknowns i e the normal derivative of the potential on free surface and the potential on body surface can be moved to the left side as follows 21 φ b φ n f r b b h b f r f b h f f 1 h b b r b f h f b r f f φ n b φ f where the subscript b and f represent the solid surface and free surface respectively the matrixes r and h are influence matrixes corresponding to the lng and g respectively after solving the system eq 20 and obtaining the fluid velocities and normal vector on the free surface the velocity potential on free surface and free surface profile are advanced by using the runga kutta 4th order rk4 method thus all boundary surfaces can be remeshed and updated at each time step 2 3 corner problem between body surface and free surface after a sufficiently long time a numerical instability may occur due to the discontinuity of flux at the intersection of the body surface and free surface it means therefore that the mesh should be specifically treated at every time step to realize this process the rotation scheme of the stretched system oαβ to new system oμυ is used to meet the requirement of continuity of flux at the corner here we have 22 α μ cos γ 0 υ sin γ 0 23 β μ sin γ 0 υ cos γ 0 where γ 0 is the angle of rotation from the stretched system oαβ to new system oμυ υ is along the body surface then substituting eqs 22 and 23 into eq 17 the free surface boundary condition can be expressed 24 d t υ d t φ υ ζ ε sin γ 0 cos γ 0 d t φ d t d t υ d t φ υ ε ζ cos γ 0 sin γ 0 φ μ ε ζ sin γ 0 cos γ 0 φ υ t μ sin γ 0 t υ cos γ 0 t a 0 1 2 φ μ 2 φ υ 2 eq 24 hold the criterion that the intersection points can move only along the body surface therefore μ is a constant value i e 0 while φ and υ vary with time t 2 4 hydrodynamic forces the dimensionless pressure distribution on the body surface can be obtained from the bernoulli equation 25 p ϕ t 1 2 ϕ 2 ζ ϕ x t β t a 0 where ϕ t is the temporal derivative of ϕ in the space fixed system and its accurate calculation is very crucial in solving correct pressure distribution on the body surface in eq 25 the backward finite difference method is instability and inaccurate for fully nonlinear problems because nodes on the wetted body surface move with the time compared with acceleration potential method combined with the modal decomposition method the auxiliary function χ proposed by wu et al 2004 can enhance computing efficiency in this method the auxiliary function satisfies the laplace equation in the fluid domain and the flowing boundary conditions on the free surface we specify 26 χ 1 2 φ 2 ζ φ x t β t a 0 ε φ α φ β the condition on the body surface is taken as 27 χ n 0 and on the far field the boundary condition can be expressed as 28 χ n ϕ i t n ε ϕ i x 0 n ϕ i y 0 n thus the boundary integral equation similar to eq 18 can be obtained to determine the auxiliary function χ then the temporal derivative of ϕ

validation 3 1 convergent tests in the convergent test the vertical water entry of a symmetric wedge with γ 45 into calm water i e a 0 is considered the gravity effect is included in the simulation the length and height of the numerical computational domain are respectively set to 50 and 20 the time step is selected as dt t 0 0 05 in which initial time t 0 0 002 the size of meshes on the body surface free surface and control surface of far field is non uniform the smallest element is set near the jet root which is the position of the largest impact pressure gradient and the size of the element increases gradually away from the jet at a given ratio which is 1 03 in this study however in order to remain good numerical accuracy it is essential to set the largest size of the element i e 14 meshes per wavelength λ 14 this means when the size of the element increases to λ 14 the elements are then equal three different mesh schemes i e a fine mesh minimal element length l m 0 04 an intermediate mesh minimal element length l m 0 06 and a coarse mesh minimal element length is l m 0 08 are selected figs 2 and 3 depict the free surface profile and the total pressure distribution at various time t t 0 10 50 and 500 respectively the results are identical between the fine and intermediate mesh schemes indicating that mesh convergence can be achieved using the intermediate mesh scheme however the fobem is used to reach the same results using minimal element length l m 0 03 for the same case this indicated that compared with fobem the hobem can describe the tips or edges of the body surface more exactly using less elements similar tests for three time steps dt t 0 0 03 0 05 and 0 07 using the intermediate mesh indicate that dt t 0 0 05 is sufficiently small thus l m 0 06 t 0 0 002 and dt t0 0 05 are sufficient for numerical purposes and are adopted in the following simulation it is also interesting from fig 3 that the pressure near tip of the wedge increases rapidly with time progresses while the pressure near the jet root is reduced gradually this is because the gravity effect on the pressure become more prominent as time increases and this result is consistent with the work of sun et al 2015 in addition the water particles on the wetted body surface should be pulled down by the gravity as the thin and long jet is gradually developed and the flow cannot be always attached on the body this requires undertake the air cavity effect which beyond the scope of the presented model 3 2 validation tests the present nonlinear results are compared with the published numerical solutions for validation a case of a symmetric wedge with γ 45 entering waves vertically with gravity effect is considered and the input conditions are the incident wave amplitude a 0 1 the initial phase θ 0 0 and the wave number k 2 513 which corresponds to the wavelength λ 2 5 and the wave period t 3 84 figs 4 and 5 give the free surface profile and the pressure distribution at time t 0 02 0 1 and 0 5 respectively the comparison with the published numerical solution from sun et al 2015 is also presented the excellent agreement between our hobem numerical solutions and the fobem numerical solutions obtained by sun et al 2015 validates and confirms the capability of the present formulation and numerical method in resolving the nonlinear wave entry problem from figs 4 and 5 it can be observed when the body vertically enters into progressing wave both the free surface profile and the pressure distribution are asymmetric due to the horizontal velocity of the incident waves which is different from the results of water entry of a wedge into calm see figs 2 and 3 this indicates that the wave entry problem should be done with rigorous analysis in addition it is evident that the effect of temporal variation of the wave depends on the entry time t for example when t 0 02 fig 4 a and fig 5 a the term ωt in the wave phase θ can be regard as zero and thus the wave including velocity potential eq 7 and wave elevation eq 8 are almost stationary which means that the wedge is approximatively entering a given wave profile conversely when t 0 1 and 0 5 the term ωt is not small relative to θ so the free surface profile fig 4 b and c and pressure distribution fig 5 b and c are sensitive to wave propagation it is noted that when the time t is small or only a small part of the wedge is in the wave i e t 0 02 the pressure distribution is almost completely dominated by the horizontal velocity of the incident waves and thus the pressure distribution near tip of the wedge has discontinuity phenomenon as t increases or more part of the wedge is in waves the horizontal velocity decays rapidly according to the derivative of eq 7 with respect to x0 while the effect of the effective deadrise angle between the body surface and the free surface becomes more prominent and thus the difference between pressure on both sides decreases gradually see fig 5 c when t increases to 0 1 the horizontal velocity of the waves at the tip of the wedge is almost zero and thus the pressure at the tip of the wedge is continuous 4 numerical results 4 1 vertical wave current entry of a symmetric body in this and the following two sections currents are imposed on the wave field to examine wave current entry problems of a wedge with special attention to the free surface profile and the pressure distribution figs 6 and 7 show respectively the computed free surface profile and pressure distribution at t 0 02 0 1 and 0 5 for the wedge considered in fig 4 with input parameters a 0 1 k 2 513 and ζ 0 0 05 and 0 05 all curves in these figures are plotted in the stretched system it can be seen that when t 0 02 the free surface solutions in fig 6 a are near the region of the wave peak due to the initial phase θ 0 0 and the corresponding jet surface is larger for a following current than that for absence of a current and vice versa for an opposing current this behavior can be explanation by the potential theory when the incident waves are following a current the incident wave length increases and the wave steepness a λ is reduced according to the modified dispersion relation eq 10 however when the incident waves are against a current the opposite is true in addition the jet difference among following current zero current and opposing current on the left hand side of the wedge is more obvious than that on the right hand side of the wedge this is because the initial free surface is mainly related to the velocity of the fluid and the horizontal velocity of the fluid which is expressed by the superposition of wave velocity derivative of eq 7 with respect to x 0 and current velocity ζ is much larger than the vertical velocity of the fluid this means that the body at a equivalent horizontal velocity moves along the negative direction of fluid velocity which can cause the variation of the jet surface as time increases a larger region of free surface will be distorted by the body surface see fig 6 b and c fig 6 d presents the whole free surface at t 0 1 it is obvious that the incident wave length increases but wave height decreases in the presence of a following current and vice versa in the presence of an opposing current this is consistent with the conclusion given by lin et al 2014 also at the far field the numerical solutions agree well with the analytical solution by eq 8 which indicates that the disturbance induced by the wedge is completely diminished we further investigate the effects of the fluid horizontal velocity and the wave steepness on the pressure distribution shown in fig 7 at initial time the wave surface near the tip of the wedge is almost flat and the horizontal velocity is the determining factor in pressure distribution it can be observed from fig 7 a that when t 0 02 the pressures on the left hand side for all currents are larger than that on the right hand side which indicates that the incident wave velocity is dominant in this case moreover the wave horizontal velocity decreases for a following current and increases for an opposing current because the initial wave horizontal velocity on the free surface is related to a k according to eq 7 on the other hand the pressure on the left right hand side can be increased reduced for a following current due to larger relative horizontal velocity between the fluid and the body and vice versa for an opposing current thus the fluid horizontal velocity is more complicated due to the presence of current as time t increases to 0 1 the wedge has moved quite a distance from the free surface in which the incident wave horizontal velocity decays rapidly with submerged depth of the wedge and the fluid horizontal velocity comes mainly from the current also the effects of the wave steepness is gradually evident when the wave steepness increases i e an opposing current the local deadrise angle between the wedge surface and the free surface increases and the pressure on both sides is inversely proportional to the wave steepness consequently as shown in fig 7 b the differences among the pressures on the left hand side for a following current a zero current and an opposing current become much larger and that on the right hand side is close to zero due to the combination of the current and the wave steepness when the wedge has move enough distance see fig 7 c the effects of wave can be ignored at very large y 0 and the current velocity is dominant which results in that the pressure on the left hand side for a following current is larger than that for zero current and vice versa for an opposing current while the opposite is true on the right hand side for wave current entry of a wedge the incident current free wave amplitude a has a evident influence on the free surface profile and pressure distribution as shown in figs 8 11 figs 8 and 9 respectively give the free surface profile at t 0 02 and 0 1 for varying values of wave amplitude a and current velocity ζ when k 2 513 and the rest of the input parameters are fixed using the given values it can be seen from these figures that the jet surface is reduced as the incident current free wave amplitude increases which is because the wave steepness of incident wave increases with a when current velocity increases from 0 05 to 0 05 the surface difference among a 0 0 1 and 0 15 becomes much smaller as the incident wave amplitude is increased by an opposing current and is reduced by a following current it is noted that the free surface in fig 9 include a larger area of the wave than that in fig 8 as the time increases and thus the deformation of the free surface becomes more prominent figs 10 and 11 respectively give the corresponding pressure distribution at t 0 02 and 0 1 in the absence of waves and currents when the wedge enters vertically into calm water the pressure distribution about the symmetric line of the body is symmetric and continuous because of the boundary condition near the tip however in the presence of waves or currents the results are not symmetric because the fluid horizontal velocity has a sharp variation near the tip furthermore at t 0 02 the pressure difference between that on the both sides of the body increases gradually for all current velocities as a increases because the wave horizontal velocity increases with a when t increases to 0 1 see fig 11 the pressure on both sides of the body decreases as a increases due to the increase of the effective dearise angle it is noted that when a 0 figs 10 b and 11 b show a larger pressure on the left hand side of the wedge for a following current while figs 10 c and 11 c show the opposite results for an opposing current this is because that a following current leads to larger relative horizontal velocity between the fluid and the wedge and vice versa for an opposing current when a is not equal to zero at t 0 02 the pressure on the right hand side is almost identical among ζ 0 05 0 and 0 05 this is because the fluid horizontal velocity is determined by both the current affected wave velocity and the current velocity taking a following current as an example the wave horizontal velocity is reduced whereas the fluid velocity is increased by current velocity consequently the pressure on the right hand side is close to that in the case of zero current at t 0 1 the pressure difference between on both sides increases as current increases due to the combined effect of the wave steepness and the current velocity all the curves of figs 6 11 are given for a fixed water entry location i e wave peak θ 0 0 to further validate the effects of the water entry location on the free surface profile and pressure distribution the cases with θ 0 90 and 180 which are respectively correspond to that the wedge hits the middle of wave slope and the wave trough are also conducted and compared with the counterpart of θ 0 0 for this numerical simulation a 0 1 k 2 513 γ 45 and vertical entry are selected for given parameters comparisons of the free surface profile with different current velocities ζ 0 05 0 and 0 05 at t 0 02 and 0 1 are respectively shown in figs 12 and 13 as well as the pressure distribution are shown in figs 14 and 15 it can be seen that the water entry location for a following current occurs at x coordinate somewhat larger than that for zero current and vice versa for an opposing current this is mainly caused by an changed wave length in the presence of currents when θ 0 is fixed in the case of peak entry the pressure on the left hand side for all currents is larger than that on the right hand side while the opposite is true for the case of trough entry except for the curve of t 0 1 in the presence of a following current the reason is that when the wedge hits the wave peak or wave trough the initial wave slope near the tip is zero and the pressure difference between on the both sides is mainly related to the wave horizontal velocity which is along the wave incident direction for peak entry and vice versa for trough entry the exception for trough entry at t 0 1 in the presence of a following current see fig 15 b can be explained by the direction of current velocity it is also interesting that at t 0 1 the pressure on both sides of the wedge for trough entry is larger than that for peak entry this is because that the effective deadrise angle becomes bigger for peak entry and becomes smaller for trough entry as more part of the wedge enters into the water in the particular case of middle slope entry the downward slope results in that the effectiveness deadrise angle on the left hand side is much smaller than that on the right hand side and thus a lager pressure can be obtained on the left hand side in addition the maximum pressure at middle slop entry is significantly enhanced as compared with the peak and trough entries 4 2 vertical wave current entry of an asymmetric body simulations for asymmetric entry can be achieved by adjusting σ in eq 1 figs 16 and 17 respectively show the free surface profile at t 0 02 and 0 1 with different current velocities ζ 0 05 0 and 0 05 the corresponding pressure distribution is shown in figs 18 and 19 four different heel angles σ 0 5 10 and 15 are selected with the fixed angle γ 45 the wave period t 3 84 considered in the numerical model corresponds to k 2 513 the wave amplitude a and initial phase θ 0 are 0 1 and 0 respectively it can be seen that as the heel angle increases the jet on the left hand side of the wedge becomes longer but is reduced on the right hand side which is because larger heel angle leads to more area of fluid structure interface on the left hand side in addition the difference between the free surfaces on both sides of the wedge is increased by a following current and is reduced by an opposing current the patterns of the pressure distribution is similar to that of the flow attached to the body surface i e the larger heel angle leads to the bigger difference between pressure on both sides and this increase of σ broadens the effective area under the p curves on the left hand side and vice versa for the right hand side due to the variation of the deadrise angle between the body surface and the free surface at σ 15 a sudden drop of the pressure occurs near the tip of the wedge at t 0 02 for all currents as indicated in fig 18 which is may be because of the velocity singularity at the tip in physical reality the fluid particle attached on the body surface will fall into fluid domain by the gravity and the attached flow cannot be abidingly maintained to realize the flow detachment including turbulent flow and particle separation the kutta condition with vortex shedding should be implemented in the velocity continuity on the body surface this is beyond the scope of the presented model with impermeable body surface boundary condition which does allow water moving only along the body surface as described in section 2 4 it is also interesting that the current can mitigate the pressure values of the sudden drop either in a following current or in an opposing current as t increase the tip has moved farther away from the water surface and thus the effect of wave velocity is rapidly attenuated which leads to the disappearance of the sudden drop phenomena from the pressure curves in fig 19 the pressure on the left hand side is increased by a following current and is reduced by an opposing current but that on the right hand side is almost identical among a following current a zero current and an opposing current which is mainly due the effect of the current on the fluid velocity and the wave steepness 4 3 oblique wave current entry of an asymmetric body finally we consider the case of an asymmetric wedge obliquely entering waves in the presence of currents at different ε u v with γ 45 σ 5 a 0 1 t 3 84 and θ 0 0 ε 0 0 ε 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 and 0 ε 0 2 represent the vertical entry the lower right entry and lower left entry respectively figs 20 and 21 respectively gives the free surface profile at t 0 02 and 0 1 for an following current a zero current and an opposing current it can be seen that the length of the jet on the left hand side is gradually reduced as ε increases and vice versa for that on the right side this is also reflected by the pressure distribution in figs 22 and 23 in addition the variation of the pressure distribution versus ε is more prominent than that of the free surface profile which has also been found by sun et al 2015 when the wedge pushes the fluid along the negative direction of x i e ε 0 2 whereas the incident wave propagates along the x direction the relative horizontal velocity between the fluid and wedge becomes larger which results in a significant increase of pressure on the left hand side and a sharp pressure variation near the tip of the wedge due to the cross flow mentioned in the foregoing section when the wedge has a positive velocity ε 0 the pressure difference between on the both sides of the wedge decreases due to the reduction of the relative horizontal velocity between the fluid and wedge and then the horizontal motion of the wedge is dominant when ε 0 4 at t 0 02 or ε 0 3 at t 0 1 for the following and zero currents while ε 0 3 at t 0 02 or ε 0 2 at t 0 1 for the opposing current this leads to a larger pressure distribution on the right hand side as ε continues to increase this feature becomes more obvious a following current and an opposing current is equivalent to that the wedge has a same value of velocity in the negative and positive direction of x respectively therefore the role of the positive horizontal velocity of the wedge can be weakened for a following current and enhanced for an opposing current and this is opposite is true for the negative horizontal velocity of the wedge 5 conclusions based on the potential theory a time domain hobem mel has been implemented to simulate fully nonlinear oblique wave entry of an asymmetric wedge with gravity effect in the presence of a uniform current at initial stage a stretched coordinate system according to the ratio of the spatial coordinates and the travelled vertical displacement of the wedge is adopted to describe the scattering velocity while a body fixed cartesian coordinate system is defined to deal with the potential induced by currents and the incident wave potential as time progresses the total velocity potential is expressed in the stretched coordinate system and a rotation coordinate scheme is used to avoiding the intersection point between the free surface and the body surface moving into or away from the body an auxiliary function is introduced to obtain the temporal derivative of velocity potential in bernoulli pressure equation by solving the relating boundary integral equation again by making use of the shape functions the spatial derivatives of the velocity potential on the body surface is analytically obtained in higher order elements the present hobem model is verified by comparing with the published fobem numerical solutions and reasonably good agreement between them are obtained the physical characteristics of the wave current entry is examined through extensive numerical calculations the results indicate that the elevation of jet surface is enhanced by a following current and reduced by an opposing current the horizontal velocity of the fluid including indent waves and currents causes a larger jet difference on the side of the wedge facing the fluid flow when the wedge hits the wave peak the horizontal velocity of the fluid which is dependent of the combined effect of waves and currents plays a major role on the pressure distribution as time progresses a following current gives a reduction of the effective deadrise angle which increases the pressure on the side of the wedge facing the fluid flow but remain almost identical pressure on the other side due to the coupling effect with current velocity this opposite is true for an opposing current when the tip of wedge has moved enough away from the water surface the effect of the wave steepness and wave velocity can be ignored and only the effect of current velocity is remained the jet surface become steeper as the incident current free wave amplitude increases due to the change of wave steepness additionally the jet surface difference among various incident wave amplitudes is more sensitive to the opposing current than the following current due to the change of wave steepness this opposite feature is reflected in the pressure the effects of wave amplitude and entry location on pressure value are complicated due to the major role of horizontal velocity of the fluid or wave steepness the vertical entry of the asymmetric wedge entering into wave current reveals that the heel angle changes the contact area of both sides and water surface which has a significant influence on the length of the jets and the pressure on both sides furthermore a larger variation of pressure near the tip of the wedge occurs with increasing heel angle due to the velocity singularity at the tip and can be mitigated by the currents when the tip has moved vertically rather distance the discontinuity of the pressure at the tip will is weakened during oblique wave current entry the effect of horizontal velocity of the wedge on pressure is more pronounced than that on the free surface profile when the wedge is supposed to move heading toward the fluid flow the pressure variation near the tip of the wedge is more evident due to the increase of relative horizontal velocity between the fluid and the wedge and the role of horizontal velocity of the wedge is enhanced by the following current and reduced by the opposing current this opposite is true when the moving direction is reversed to the following fluid condition acknowledgment the authors are grateful to the national science

23539,water entry experiments of a constraint posture projectile were performed under different entry angles and ventilation rates the near water surface cavity flow characteristics including splash sheet surface closure pull away deep closure and cavity ripples were investigated under different entry angles and ventilation rates without the posture perturbation influence of the projectile the experimental results demonstrate that the dimensionless cavity surface closure and pull away time increase gradually with the increasing of the water entry angle and the dimensionless cavity deep closure time and the pinch off depth experience a slight increase and decrease respectively the deep closure patterns shift from the point closure to the line closure as the water entry angle increases for the oblique water entry cases and the cavity ripples were observed before the pinch off and after the pull away for ours experiment which are more likely acoustic in origin in addition the surface closure contributed by the splash sheet is clearly delayed at similar entry conditions except for the ventilation rate the dimensionless cavity deep closure times of the ventilation cases are significantly higher than the cases without ventilation however with further increase the ventilation the deep closure time changes slightly keywords constraint posture projectile water entry ventilation cavity multiphase flow 1 introduction water entry is a fundamental problem widely presents in different applications which including some natural phenomena such as a basilisk lizard walking on the water surface glasheen and mcmahon 1996 and a stone skipping on water clanet et al 2004 military application such as antitorpedo and antisubmarine water entry may 1975 aerospace engineering such as aerospace structures water entry impaction seddon and moatamedi 2016 and even the sports such as the water entry of swimmers and divers and the entry and exit of the oars in rowing truscott et al 2012 there are three mainly science problems for object water entry as follows the prediction of the impaction load the calculation of the vehicle trajectory with the cavity running and the understanding of the air cavity development in the present study we focus on investigating experimentally the effects of the entry angle and ventilation rate to the air entraining cavity development which are the most typical operating situation for antitorpedo and antisubmarine water entry may 1975 aerospace structures water entry impaction seddon and moatamedi 2016 and supercavitating vehicle water entry semenenko 2001 specifically water entry experiments of a constraint posture projectile were conducted for understanding the fundamental flow characteristics involved in oblique and ventilation water entry in general there are typical flow phenomena including the crown splash surface closure pull away deep closure and cavity ripples in the water entry experiments which were systematically investigated with a sphere under different entry velocities and surface treatments worthington and cole 1897 truscott et al 2014 marston et al 2016 specifically for the crown splash the earliest images were captured by worthington and cole 1897 in which the splash sheet water is coming from the undisturbed water surface layer and no additional water contribution to it after its formation after that the crown splash has been presented with extensive high speed imaging studies bell 1924 logvinovich 1973 may 1975 duez et al 2007 recently the crown splash buckling type azimuthal instability structure were captured in marston et al 2016 i e the instability is structured by vertical striations along the crown and a thin film connects each striation after crown splash buckling type azimuthal instability the surface closure appears which means the flow into the cavity is completely interrupted and the splash jet is observed below the roof of the cavity for the first time may 1975 gillbarg and anderson 1948 are the first one who explained the under pressure based on the dynamic pressure term from the bernoulli equation and the surface tension are the chief forces make surface closure particularly the ratio of the inertial force to the surface tension showing that the surface tension can be neglected in the splash crown dynamics gillbarg and anderson 1948 later the experimental measurement data of the cavity inner pressure shows bernoulli pressure underestimates the true pressure differential abelson 1970 lee et al 1997 furthermore the surface tension pays a role in the splash crown dynamics and cannot be neglected based on the newest experimental investigations marston et al 2016 for the quantitatively the surface closure dimensionless time t s c t s c v 0 d c 3 88 is roughly constant for a sphere vertical experiments under an atmosphere pressure and constant air density may 1975 where t s c v 0 d c are the surface closure time water entry velocity and the diameter of the sphere respectively it is worth noting that the effects of the entry angles and ventilation rates to the crown splash development and surface closure has not been examined based on the prior published works for the pull away which is a phenomenon of the cavity top moving downward from the water surface and never occurs without surface closure the pull away may not occur when the cavity pressure does not drop sufficiently may 1975 the pull away time is linearly increase with the entry velocity whatever the head shapes are based on the vertical water entry experimental data may 1975 moreover the effects of the water entry angle on the pull away time can be neglected as there is only a slight change with the entry angle under higher entry speeds between 300 and 1600 feet per second and entry angles from 45 to 70 may 1975 for the deep closure the dimensionless deep closure time t d c t d c v 0 d c of a sphere undergoing vertical water entry in a single homogeneous fluid is a linear function of f r and the slope are 1 27 for sunflower oil tan et al 2016 and 1 25 for water truscott and techet 2009 respectively under the condition of the f r 40 moreover there is another dimensionless deep closure time τ d c t d c 2 g d c is used when the water entry velocity v 0 is much higher than the cavity collapse typical velocity scale d c g tan et al 2016 specifically the dimensionless values of the deep closure are τ d c 1 74 for a sphere undergoing vertical entry into water gillbarg and anderson 1948 τ d c 1 726 0 0688 n 118 trials for a sphere undergoing vertical entry into water truscott and techet 2009 τ d c 1 796 for a sphere undergoing vertical entry into homogeneous sunflower oil tan et al 2016 and τ d c 2 285 0 0653 n 47 trials for a disc undergoing vertical entry into water glasheen and mcmahon 1996 respectively to the author s best knowledge the pinch off depth only was discussed quantitatively for a sphere vertical water entry in single homogeneous sunflower oil and an oil water multi layer fluid tan et al 2016 the pinch off depth is also a linear function of f r and the slope is approximately 0 72 for homogeneous sunflower oil under f r 30 tan et al 2016 for the water entry cavity ripples which were first mentioned by worthington 1908 and then by mallock 1918 there are two typical physical mechanism explanations based on the prior published works for the vertical water entry cavity ripples the first one is the elastic of the air entrapped from the water surface based on the analysis by semenenko 1998 the second one is the acoustic in origin formed by the pressure perturbation of the pinch off based on the comments by grumstrup et al 2007 moreover the mechanism of the multiple pinch offs under the influence of the tank wall is the interaction of both the water tank wall and the attachment of the upper edge of the cavity mansoor et al 2014 and the two layer system cavity ripples and the corresponding strouhal number were discussed to confirm that the physical mechanism of the cavity ripples are not related to vortex shedding tan et al 2016 which was measured and captured by using the piv in truscott et al 2012 additional gekle et al 2008 noted that the capillary waves produced before pinch off can affect the dynamics of the cavity until the cavity collapse therefore the present study focuses on examining the fundamental flow characteristics involved in oblique and ventilation water entry under f r 20 which has not been studied in the past the current paper is structured as follows section 2 provides the details of the experimental methods in section 3 the experimental observations and the corresponding explanations of the water entry cavity flow characteristics under different entry angles and ventilation rates are reported finally the conclusion of the experimental results are provided in section 4 2 experimental methods the systematic experiments were performed to investigate the near water surface cavity flow characteristics under different water entry angles and ventilation rates we conducted the experiments in a water entry tank system that is designed and manufactured by ourselves shown schematically in fig 1 a the water entry tank system consists of a water tank a high speed camera a ventilation system a model posture constraint system and a water entry model for the water tank as shown in fig 1a is a tempered glass tank with dimensions of 1 2 m 1 0 m 1 2 m and a 15 mm thick rubber mat is placed on the bottom to prevent the test model from crashing on it the images and videos of the water entry air cavity were captured by a phantom v12 1 high speed camera acquired 1000 frames s 1 at 800 600 resolution in ours experiments which can acquire 6242 frames s 1 at 1280 800 resolution to obtain better videos and images a 3 4100 w led light source array is placed on the side of the water tank the field of view of the experimental images is approximately 570 mm 430 mm the imaging system is calibrated before the experiments by a 24 mm 18 mm grid pasted on the water tank covering the entire field of view both pixel dimensions is 0 71 mm in all images and the uncertainty is 3 5 for the ventilation system which consists of a high pressure gas cylinder decompression table regulating valve gas tube and mass flowmeter it worthy note that the ventilation gas flow rate is reported at standard conditions i e at a temperature of 273 k and a pressure of 1 bar in terms of standard liters per minutes slpm the mass flowmeter i e the omega engineering rotameter fl 2044 with a full scale reading of 100 slpm is employed for ensuring accurate measurement of ventilation flow rate spanning from 25 slpm to 80 slpm used in the current study factory calibration is used for the rotameter and the uncertainty in the flow measurement is 3 of the full scale reading moreover the gas tube is connected to the test model and it can move along the pulley with the test model when the model enters the water fig 1 for the model posture constraint system it is composed of an upper rail a bottom rail a rail bracket and a steel wire used to keep identical vertical water entry experimental conditions in semenenko 1998 the upper rail is supported by a bracket the bottom rail is installed on the bottom of the water tank the steel wire with a diameter of 0 5 mm is fixed on each of the two rails by a slider and passed through the test model which can be used to regulate the water entry angle by moving the fixed point location of the steel wire on the upper and bottom rails in other words the posture constraint system can be used to prevent the model trajectory to affect the cavity and make sure the model water entry angle at a fixed and desired value however the water entry angle is a little different the desired value since the wire will elastic deform under the gravity and the hydrodynamics forces acting on the model therefore the real water entry angles are measured based on the high speed images and the uncertainty in the entry angle measurement is less than 3 5 based on the captured images for the test model which is composed of a cone cylinder combination model and a disc cavitator as shown in fig 1b is made of aluminum and polished to a smooth surface there are three kinds of holes located at different positions of the test model the first kind is the center hole which is 0 5 mm steel wire hole the second one is used to attach the gas tube for ventilation the last one is the front ventilation holes connected to the tail gas tube hole for ventilation to keep identical water entry velocity under different entry angles and ventilation rates the release height calculated by the h v 0 2 2 g 1 μ cot α of the test model increase with the entry angle and the entry velocity is calibrated using the high speed images for each experiment where h μ 0 32 α are the model release height the corrected friction coefficient considering all the friction between the tube wire and model and the water entry angle respectively for example to ensure the experimental repeatability there are two experimental videos with the identical conditions i e ventilation rate water entry angle and entry velocity were recorded in present work and the speed of water entry at the onset of impact can be calculated using the moving displacement of the test model divided by the time interval of the neighboring two images in this work the corresponding ventilation coefficient at standard conditions is defined as c q s q v 0 d c 2 where q represents the gas ventilation flow rate under standard conditions meanwhile the definition of the froude number reynolds number and weber number is f r v o g d c r e v o d c v and w e ρ v 0 2 d c γ respectively where v ρ γ are the kinematic viscosity of the water the density of the water and the surface tension coefficient respectively the measurements are conducted at multiple different f r over a range of 8 3 13 5 and at different c q s of 0 22 0 74 and the corresponding ranges of reynolds number and weber number are r e 7 3 10 4 1 2 10 5 and w e 3 7 10 3 9 9 10 3 overall in our experiments the maximum uncertainty in the measurement of c q s f r and α are estimated to be 3 3 5 and 3 5 respectively 3 experimental results 3 1 splash and surface closure to investigate the splash and surface closure characteristics of the oblique water entry with ventilation we first show some typical images of the splash and surface closure under different entry angles and ventilation rates at a fixed froude number f r 10 8 in fig 2 after that the dimensionless surface closure time t s c t s c v 0 d c and dimensionless moving distance s s c d c as shown in fig 2b of the model at the moment of the surface closure are illustrated in fig 3 at a fixed froude number f r 10 8 where t s c v 0 d c are the surface closure time water entry velocity and the diameter of the disc respectively as explained in introduction the t s c is recorded at the moment of the flow into the cavity is completely interrupted and the splash jet is observed below the roof of the cavity for the first time may 1975 by the high speed camera all the s s c are measured based on the images and the uncertainty in the measurement are estimated to be 3 5 as shown in fig 2 the splash sheet is more easier to form at one side for all oblique water entry and the size of the splash sheet increases with the entry angle and the ventilation rate obviously moreover the surface closure contributed by the splash sheet is significantly delayed and the moving distance s s c increases with the entry angle and the ventilation rate for the quantitative data as shown in fig 3 both the entry angle and ventilation rate can promote the delay of the cavity surface closure furthermore the dimensionless moving distance of the test model at the moment of surface closure has the similar trend as the surface closure time since the cavitation drag coefficients are approximately same in ours experiments these trends can be explained based on the newest experimentally investigations on the crown splash marston et al 2016 that the surface closure is driven by the under pressure and surface tension in general the water surface air will rush into the cavity which makes the inside pressure of the splash sheet become lower than outside may 1975 moreover the entrainment gas of the ventilation case will reduce the velocity of the rushing air which means the inside pressure of splash sheet will decrease more slowly for the ventilation case furthermore with increasing of α and c q s the value of the sheet thickness δ is increase since the splash sheet size is obviously increase thus the weber number based on the sheet thickness i e w e δ ρ v s 2 δ γ suggested by marston et al 2016 increases with the water entry angle and ventilation rate here v s is sheet moving velocity and γ is the surface tension coefficient therefore with the increasing of the entry angle and ventilation rate the w e δ increases and the pressure difference between the cavity inside and outside decreases which both cause the surface closure to delay 3 2 pull away although the effects of the water entry angle on the pull away time can be neglected at high speed water entry the data from water entries of missiles with diameters of 1 and 1 5 inches at angles to the horizontal of 45 70 with the entry velocities between 300 and 1600 feet per second i e 150 f r 977 may 1975 some interesting conclusions can be drawn based on ours low velocity water entry experiments i e f r 20 as illustrated in fig 4 more specifically the pull away time is obviously increasing with the water entry angle for the same froude number f r 10 8 without ventilation c q s 0 as shown in fig 4a the dimensionless pull away time t p a t p a v 0 d c and dimensionless moving distance s p a d c of the model at the moment of the pull away are illustrated in fig 4b at a fixed froude number f r 10 8 where t p a is recorded at the moment of the cavity top moving downward from the water surface may 1975 by the high speed camera all the s p a are measured based on the images and the uncertainty in the measurement are estimated to be 3 5 remarkably similar to the increase in the entry angle the water entry velocity can promote the increase of the pressure difference inside and outside of the cavity obviously in addition the development of the pull away mainly depends on the pressure difference between inside and outside of the cavity may 1975 therefore the effects of the water entry angle on the pull away time can be neglected for the high speed oblique water entry 150 f r 977 as mentioned in may 1975 and it cannot be neglected in ours low speed oblique water entry f r 20 it worthy note that there isn t pull away phenomenon when the entry angle was increased up to 45 for non ventilation case and all ventilation water entry cases we attribute this to the pressure difference is too smaller to make the cavity pull away occur more quickly than the cavity deep closure under large water entry angle and ventilation cases 3 3 deep closure this section focuses on investigating the deep closure characteristics under various water entry angles and ventilation rates to implement the comparison more accurate the deep closure time τ d c t d c 2 g d c is selected more reasonably based on the discussion by tan et al 2016 since the velocity scale of the cavity collapse is v c d c g 0 44 m s and the entry velocity is 3 5 m s v 0 6 m s in present experiments where the t d c is recorded at the moment of the cavity collapses near water surface first time by the high speed camera moreover the definition of the dimensionless pinch off depth and closure length are y p y p d c and l p l p d c respectively as shown in fig 5 a both y p and l p are measured based on the pixel points of the images and the uncertainty in the measurement are estimated to be 3 5 for the oblique water entry without ventilation cases there are two different typical deep closure patterns observed in the experiments i e the point closure and the line closure fig 5a shows the deep closure pattern shifts from the point closure to the line closure with the water entry angle increased at f r 10 8 furthermore as shown in fig 5b the deep closure time and pinch off depth exhibit a slight increase and decrease with the water entry angle respectively additional as shown in fig 5c the closure length increases firstly with the entry angle and then it keeps approximately constant at a large entry angle the value is α 40 0 in the experiments we attribute the trend of the dimensionless deep closure time shown in fig 5b to the inner pressure characteristics of the oblique water entry cavity since the deep closure is driven by the cavity cross independent development logvinovich 1973 logvinovich and yakimov yu 1973 specifically as abovementioned the trend about surface closure with the water entry angle the pressure difference value at deep closure location is smaller at large water entry angle thus dimensionless deep closure time increases with the water entry angle as shown that of the first three square data points in fig 5b however the pressure difference changes are limited under the effects of the entry angle since the surface closure time significantly increases fig 3a which makes the deep closure time increase slowness as shown that of the last three square data points in fig 5c additionally the main reason for the pinch off depth trend as shown in fig 5b circle data points is that the cavity section of the shallow water location of the large water entry angle cases can obtain the same energy as that of the deeper water location of the small water entry angle cases which control the cavity cross development logvinovich and yakimov yu 1973 logvinovich 1973 furthermore the trend of the closure length presented in fig 5b is attributed to the cavity section development of the cavity deep closure region i e the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the cavity section varies slightly the upper cavity section obtains more energy and forms earlier and the lower cavity section obtains a smaller amount of energy but forms later in other words the region of the cavity section collapse at the same moment is expanded with the increasing of the water entry angle however this trend is slowed down when the entry angle increases to one value the value is α 40 0 in ours experiments compared to the cases without ventilation the deep closure time of the ventilation cases is significantly higher at smaller water entry angle as shown that of the first two square data points in fig 6 b however with the further increase of the ventilation rate the deep closure time keeps approximately constant as shown that of the last two square data points in fig 6b moreover the ventilation has little effects on the deep closure time for large water entry angle cases as shown that of the circle data points in fig 6b these flow characteristics can be attributed to the cavity inner pressure characteristics under the action of the ventilation gas in general ventilation gas can significantly reduce the pressure difference under small water entry cases however the redundant ventilation gas will discharge from the cavity under the large ventilation rate and large water entry angle cases in other words the inner pressure mechanism of the ventilation water entry cavity is similar to the ventilation supercavitation behind a disc cavitator suggested by karn et al 2016 furthermore the change trend of the pinch off depth under different ventilation rates as shown that of the triangle and star data points in fig 6b is similar to the oblique water entry cases fig 5c we attribute this trend to the inner pressure characteristics also as abovementioned in section 3 2 since both the entry angle and ventilation gas have similar contribution to the cavity inner pressure it worthy note that the deep closure pattern as shown in fig 6a is not a line closure since there is numerous gas bubbles leakage from the attached cavity tail 3 4 cavity ripples in present work the cavity ripples at different water entry angles without ventilation were observed as shown in fig 7 the cavity ripples were observed before the pinch off and after the pull away for ours experiment and different with the previous results that the cavity ripples were observed after pinch off savchenko et al 2000 grumstrup et al 2007 mansoor et al 2014 the wave length λ and the frequency f of the cavity ripples were measured based on the experimental images and the strouhal number s t λ f v 0 was calculated also the strouhal numbers are 0 89 1 03 and 0 92 for three different entry angles of 0 0 14 0 and 18 4 under the same froude number f r 10 8 and reynolds number r e 9 5 10 4 therefore these types of ripples are not related to the vortex shedding sakamoto and haniu 1990 or capillary waves gekle et al 2008 based on the magnitudes of the reynolds number froude number and strouhal number furthermore the value of the wave number n 2 e u f r b π is approximate 4 for the abovementioned three cases where the e u 2 p a t m ρ v 0 2 8 8 is the euler number the b c x 0 25 0 95 is a constant and the c x 0 8275 is the cavitation drag coefficient savchenko et al 2000 for these cases however the wave number is 3 in this three cases as shown in fig 7 so the wave number estimate formula suggested by savchenko et al 2000 may not suit ours low froude number cases f r 20 thus the cavity ripples are more likely acoustic in origin and the resonant volume oscillations of the cavity after the pull away can produce a re entrant jet such as pinch off to form the initial pressure perturbation grumstrup et al 2007 for the ventilation cases the cavity ripples weren t observed which supports the explain of the cavity ripples since there aren t pull away phenomenon in ours ventilation water entry experiments 4 concluding remarks with a systematic experimental investigation of the oblique and ventilation water entry some insights into the water entry cavity flow near the water surface were reached for the oblique water entry without ventilation experiments the surface closure time and pull away time dependent on the entry angle and increase gradually furthermore the deep closure pattern changes from a point closure to a line closure and the closure length increases firstly with the entry angle then keeps approximately constant at large entry angles the value is α 40 0 in ours experiments moreover the deep closure time and the pinch off depth slightly increase and decrease respectively all these can be attributed the under pressure and surface tension of the cavity under different water entry angles the cavity ripples observed in oblique water entry experiments are more likely acoustic in origin caused by initial pressure perturbation of the pull away for the ventilation water entry experiments the surface closure time will be increased with the ventilation rate since the water surface air rushed into the cavity will be blocked by the ventilation gas the deep closure time of the ventilation case is higher than that of the non ventilation at small entry angle cases however with the further increase of the ventilation rate the deep closure time changes slightly and the ventilation has little effects on the deep closure time for large water entry angle cases the pinch off depth slightly increases with the ventilation rate and the deep closure pattern is not a line closure since there are numerous gas bubbles leaking from the attached cavity tail these flow characteristics can be attributed to the cavity inner pressure characteristics under the action of the ventilation gas

23539,water entry experiments of a constraint posture projectile were performed under different entry angles and ventilation rates the near water surface cavity flow characteristics including splash sheet surface closure pull away deep closure and cavity ripples were investigated under different entry angles and ventilation rates without the posture perturbation influence of the projectile the experimental results demonstrate that the dimensionless cavity surface closure and pull away time increase gradually with the increasing of the water entry angle and the dimensionless cavity deep closure time and the pinch off depth experience a slight increase and decrease respectively the deep closure patterns shift from the point closure to the line closure as the water entry angle increases for the oblique water entry cases and the cavity ripples were observed before the pinch off and after the pull away for ours experiment which are more likely acoustic in origin in addition the surface closure contributed by the splash sheet is clearly delayed at similar entry conditions except for the ventilation rate the dimensionless cavity deep closure times of the ventilation cases are significantly higher than the cases without ventilation however with further increase the ventilation the deep closure time changes slightly keywords constraint posture projectile water entry ventilation cavity multiphase flow 1 introduction water entry is a fundamental problem widely presents in different applications which including some natural phenomena such as a basilisk lizard walking on the water surface glasheen and mcmahon 1996 and a stone skipping on water clanet et al 2004 military application such as antitorpedo and antisubmarine water entry may 1975 aerospace engineering such as aerospace structures water entry impaction seddon and moatamedi 2016 and even the sports such as the water entry of swimmers and divers and the entry and exit of the oars in rowing truscott et al 2012 there are three mainly science problems for object water entry as follows the prediction of the impaction load the calculation of the vehicle trajectory with the cavity running and the understanding of the air cavity development in the present study we focus on investigating experimentally the effects of the entry angle and ventilation rate to the air entraining cavity development which are the most typical operating situation for antitorpedo and antisubmarine water entry may 1975 aerospace structures water entry impaction seddon and moatamedi 2016 and supercavitating vehicle water entry semenenko 2001 specifically water entry experiments of a constraint posture projectile were conducted for understanding the fundamental flow characteristics involved in oblique and ventilation water entry in general there are typical flow phenomena including the crown splash surface closure pull away deep closure and cavity ripples in the water entry experiments which were systematically investigated with a sphere under different entry velocities and surface treatments worthington and cole 1897 truscott et al 2014 marston et al 2016 specifically for the crown splash the earliest images were captured by worthington and cole 1897 in which the splash sheet water is coming from the undisturbed water surface layer and no additional water contribution to it after its formation after that the crown splash has been presented with extensive high speed imaging studies bell 1924 logvinovich 1973 may 1975 duez et al 2007 recently the crown splash buckling type azimuthal instability structure were captured in marston et al 2016 i e the instability is structured by vertical striations along the crown and a thin film connects each striation after crown splash buckling type azimuthal instability the surface closure appears which means the flow into the cavity is completely interrupted and the splash jet is observed below the roof of the cavity for the first time may 1975 gillbarg and anderson 1948 are the first one who explained the under pressure based on the dynamic pressure term from the bernoulli equation and the surface tension are the chief forces make surface closure particularly the ratio of the inertial force to the surface tension showing that the surface tension can be neglected in the splash crown dynamics gillbarg and anderson 1948 later the experimental measurement data of the cavity inner pressure shows bernoulli pressure underestimates the true pressure differential abelson 1970 lee et al 1997 furthermore the surface tension pays a role in the splash crown dynamics and cannot be neglected based on the newest experimental investigations marston et al 2016 for the quantitatively the surface closure dimensionless time t s c t s c v 0 d c 3 88 is roughly constant for a sphere vertical experiments under an atmosphere pressure and constant air density may 1975 where t s c v 0 d c are the surface closure time water entry velocity and the diameter of the sphere respectively it is worth noting that the effects of the entry angles and ventilation rates to the crown splash development and surface closure has not been examined based on the prior published works for the pull away which is a phenomenon of the cavity top moving downward from the water surface and never occurs without surface closure the pull away may not occur when the cavity pressure does not drop sufficiently may 1975 the pull away time is linearly increase with the entry velocity whatever the head shapes are based on the vertical water entry experimental data may 1975 moreover the effects of the water entry angle on the pull away time can be neglected as there is only a slight change with the entry angle under higher entry speeds between 300 and 1600 feet per second and entry angles from 45 to 70 may 1975 for the deep closure the dimensionless deep closure time t d c t d c v 0 d c of a sphere undergoing vertical water entry in a single homogeneous fluid is a linear function of f r and the slope are 1 27 for sunflower oil tan et al 2016 and 1 25 for water truscott and techet 2009 respectively under the condition of the f r 40 moreover there is another dimensionless deep closure time τ d c t d c 2 g d c is used when the water entry velocity v 0 is much higher than the cavity collapse typical velocity scale d c g tan et al 2016 specifically the dimensionless values of the deep closure are τ d c 1 74 for a sphere undergoing vertical entry into water gillbarg and anderson 1948 τ d c 1 726 0 0688 n 118 trials for a sphere undergoing vertical entry into water truscott and techet 2009 τ d c 1 796 for a sphere undergoing vertical entry into homogeneous sunflower oil tan et al 2016 and τ d c 2 285 0 0653 n 47 trials for a disc undergoing vertical entry into water glasheen and mcmahon 1996 respectively to the author s best knowledge the pinch off depth only was discussed quantitatively for a sphere vertical water entry in single homogeneous sunflower oil and an oil water multi layer fluid tan et al 2016 the pinch off depth is also a linear function of f r and the slope is approximately 0 72 for homogeneous sunflower oil under f r 30 tan et al 2016 for the water entry cavity ripples which were first mentioned by worthington 1908 and then by mallock 1918 there are two typical physical mechanism explanations based on the prior published works for the vertical water entry cavity ripples the first one is the elastic of the air entrapped from the water surface based on the analysis by semenenko 1998 the second one is the acoustic in origin formed by the pressure perturbation of the pinch off based on the comments by grumstrup et al 2007 moreover the mechanism of the multiple pinch offs under the influence of the tank wall is the interaction of both the water tank wall and the attachment of the upper edge of the cavity mansoor et al 2014 and the two layer system cavity ripples and the corresponding strouhal number were discussed to confirm that the physical mechanism of the cavity ripples are not related to vortex shedding tan et al 2016 which was measured and captured by using the piv in truscott et al 2012 additional gekle et al 2008 noted that the capillary waves produced before pinch off can affect the dynamics of the cavity until the cavity collapse therefore the present study focuses on examining the fundamental flow characteristics involved in oblique and ventilation water entry under f r 20 which has not been studied in the past the current paper is structured as follows section 2 provides the details of the experimental methods in section 3 the experimental observations and the corresponding explanations of the water entry cavity flow characteristics under different entry angles and ventilation rates are reported finally the conclusion of the experimental results are provided in section 4 2 experimental methods the systematic experiments were performed to investigate the near water surface cavity flow characteristics under different water entry angles and ventilation rates we conducted the experiments in a water entry tank system that is designed and manufactured by ourselves shown schematically in fig 1 a the water entry tank system consists of a water tank a high speed camera a ventilation system a model posture constraint system and a water entry model for the water tank as shown in fig 1a is a tempered glass tank with dimensions of 1 2 m 1 0 m 1 2 m and a 15 mm thick rubber mat is placed on the bottom to prevent the test model from crashing on it the images and videos of the water entry air cavity were captured by a phantom v12 1 high speed camera acquired 1000 frames s 1 at 800 600 resolution in ours experiments which can acquire 6242 frames s 1 at 1280 800 resolution to obtain better videos and images a 3 4100 w led light source array is placed on the side of the water tank the field of view of the experimental images is approximately 570 mm 430 mm the imaging system is calibrated before the experiments by a 24 mm 18 mm grid pasted on the water tank covering the entire field of view both pixel dimensions is 0 71 mm in all images and the uncertainty is 3 5 for the ventilation system which consists of a high pressure gas cylinder decompression table regulating valve gas tube and mass flowmeter it worthy note that the ventilation gas flow rate is reported at standard conditions i e at a temperature of 273 k and a pressure of 1 bar in terms of standard liters per minutes slpm the mass flowmeter i e the omega engineering rotameter fl 2044 with a full scale reading of 100 slpm is employed for ensuring accurate measurement of ventilation flow rate spanning from 25 slpm to 80 slpm used in the current study factory calibration is used for the rotameter and the uncertainty in the flow measurement is 3 of the full scale reading moreover the gas tube is connected to the test model and it can move along the pulley with the test model when the model enters the water fig 1 for the model posture constraint system it is composed of an upper rail a bottom rail a rail bracket and a steel wire used to keep identical vertical water entry experimental conditions in semenenko 1998 the upper rail is supported by a bracket the bottom rail is installed on the bottom of the water tank the steel wire with a diameter of 0 5 mm is fixed on each of the two rails by a slider and passed through the test model which can be used to regulate the water entry angle by moving the fixed point location of the steel wire on the upper and bottom rails in other words the posture constraint system can be used to prevent the model trajectory to affect the cavity and make sure the model water entry angle at a fixed and desired value however the water entry angle is a little different the desired value since the wire will elastic deform under the gravity and the hydrodynamics forces acting on the model therefore the real water entry angles are measured based on the high speed images and the uncertainty in the entry angle measurement is less than 3 5 based on the captured images for the test model which is composed of a cone cylinder combination model and a disc cavitator as shown in fig 1b is made of aluminum and polished to a smooth surface there are three kinds of holes located at different positions of the test model the first kind is the center hole which is 0 5 mm steel wire hole the second one is used to attach the gas tube for ventilation the last one is the front ventilation holes connected to the tail gas tube hole for ventilation to keep identical water entry velocity under different entry angles and ventilation rates the release height calculated by the h v 0 2 2 g 1 μ cot α of the test model increase with the entry angle and the entry velocity is calibrated using the high speed images for each experiment where h μ 0 32 α are the model release height the corrected friction coefficient considering all the friction between the tube wire and model and the water entry angle respectively for example to ensure the experimental repeatability there are two experimental videos with the identical conditions i e ventilation rate water entry angle and entry velocity were recorded in present work and the speed of water entry at the onset of impact can be calculated using the moving displacement of the test model divided by the time interval of the neighboring two images in this work the corresponding ventilation coefficient at standard conditions is defined as c q s q v 0 d c 2 where q represents the gas ventilation flow rate under standard conditions meanwhile the definition of the froude number reynolds number and weber number is f r v o g d c r e v o d c v and w e ρ v 0 2 d c γ respectively where v ρ γ are the kinematic viscosity of the water the density of the water and the surface tension coefficient respectively the measurements are conducted at multiple different f r over a range of 8 3 13 5 and at different c q s of 0 22 0 74 and the corresponding ranges of reynolds number and weber number are r e 7 3 10 4 1 2 10 5 and w e 3 7 10 3 9 9 10 3 overall in our experiments the maximum uncertainty in the measurement of c q s f r and α are estimated to be 3 3 5 and 3 5 respectively 3 experimental results 3 1 splash and surface closure to investigate the splash and surface closure characteristics of the oblique water entry with ventilation we first show some typical images of the splash and surface closure under different entry angles and ventilation rates at a fixed froude number f r 10 8 in fig 2 after that the dimensionless surface closure time t s c t s c v 0 d c and dimensionless moving distance s s c d c as shown in fig 2b of the model at the moment of the surface closure are illustrated in fig 3 at a fixed froude number f r 10 8 where t s c v 0 d c are the surface closure time water entry velocity and the diameter of the disc respectively as explained in introduction the t s c is recorded at the moment of the flow into the cavity is completely interrupted and the splash jet is observed below

similar trend as the surface closure time since the cavitation drag coefficients are approximately same in ours experiments these trends can be explained based on the newest experimentally investigations on the crown splash marston et al 2016 that the surface closure is driven by the under pressure and surface tension in general the water surface air will rush into the cavity which makes the inside pressure of the splash sheet become lower than outside may 1975 moreover the entrainment gas of the ventilation case will reduce the velocity of the rushing air which means the inside pressure of splash sheet will decrease more slowly for the ventilation case furthermore with increasing of α and c q s the value of the sheet thickness δ is increase since the splash sheet size is obviously increase thus the weber number based on the sheet thickness i e w e δ ρ v s 2 δ γ suggested by marston et al 2016 increases with the water entry angle and ventilation rate here v s is sheet moving velocity and γ is the surface tension coefficient therefore with the increasing of the entry angle and ventilation rate the w e δ increases and the pressure difference between the cavity inside and outside decreases which both cause the surface closure to delay 3 2 pull away although the effects of the water entry angle on the pull away time can be neglected at high speed water entry the

interesting conclusions can be drawn based on ours low velocity water entry experiments i e f r 20 as illustrated in fig 4 more specifically the pull away time is obviously increasing with the water

by the high speed camera all the s p a are measured based on the images and the uncertainty in the measurement are estimated to be 3 5 remarkably similar to the increase in the entry angle the water entry velocity can promote the increase of the pressure difference inside and outside of the cavity obviously in addition the development of the pull away mainly depends on the pressure difference between inside and outside of the cavity may 1975 therefore the effects of the water entry angle on the pull away time can be neglected for the high speed oblique water entry 150 f r 977 as mentioned in may 1975 and it cannot be neglected in ours low speed oblique water entry f r 20 it worthy note that there isn t pull away phenomenon when the entry angle was increased up to 45 for non ventilation case and all ventilation water entry cases we attribute this to the pressure difference is too smaller to make the cavity pull away occur more quickly than the cavity deep closure under large water entry angle and ventilation cases 3 3 deep closure this section focuses on investigating the deep closure characteristics under various water entry angles and ventilation rates to implement the comparison more accurate the deep closure time τ d c t d c 2 g d c is selected more reasonably based on the discussion by tan et al 2016 since the velocity scale of the cavity collapse is v c d c g 0

increases firstly with the entry angle and then it keeps approximately constant at a large entry angle the value is α 40 0 in the experiments we attribute the trend of the dimensionless deep closure

fig 5c additionally the main reason for the pinch off depth trend as shown in fig 5b circle data points is that the cavity section of the shallow water location of the large water entry angle cases can obtain the same energy as that of the deeper water location of the small water entry angle cases which control the cavity cross development logvinovich and yakimov yu 1973 logvinovich 1973 furthermore the trend of the closure length presented in fig 5b is attributed to the cavity section development of the cavity deep closure region i e the pressure difference between the inside and

value the value is α 40 0 in ours experiments compared to the cases without ventilation the deep closure time of the ventilation cases is significantly higher at smaller water entry angle as shown that of the first two square data points in fig 6 b however with the further increase of the ventilation rate the deep closure time keeps approximately constant as shown that of the last two square data points in fig 6b moreover the ventilation has little effects on the deep closure time for large water entry angle cases as shown that of the circle data points in fig 6b these flow characteristics can be attributed to the cavity inner pressure characteristics under the action of the ventilation gas in general ventilation gas can significantly reduce the pressure difference under small water entry cases however the redundant ventilation gas will discharge from the cavity under the large ventilation rate and large water entry angle cases in other words the inner pressure mechanism of the ventilation water entry cavity is similar to the ventilation supercavitation behind a disc cavitator suggested by karn et al 2016 furthermore the change trend of the pinch off depth under different ventilation rates as shown that of the triangle and star data points in fig 6b is similar to the oblique water entry cases fig 5c we attribute this trend to the inner pressure characteristics also as abovementioned in section 3 2 since both the entry angle and ventilation gas have similar contribution to the cavity inner pressure it worthy note that the deep closure pattern as shown in fig 6a is not a line closure since there is numerous gas bubbles leakage from the attached cavity tail 3 4 cavity ripples in present work the cavity ripples at different water entry angles without ventilation were observed as shown in fig 7 the cavity ripples were observed before the pinch off and after the pull away for ours experiment and different with the previous results that the cavity ripples were observed after pinch off savchenko et al 2000 grumstrup et al 2007 mansoor et al 2014 the wave length λ and the frequency f of the cavity ripples were measured based on the experimental images and the strouhal number s t λ f v 0 was calculated also the strouhal numbers are 0 89 1 03 and 0 92 for three different entry angles of 0 0 14 0 and 18 4 under the same froude number f r 10 8 and reynolds number r e 9 5 10 4 therefore these types of ripples are not related to the vortex shedding sakamoto and haniu 1990 or capillary waves gekle et al 2008 based on the magnitudes of the reynolds number froude number and strouhal number furthermore the value of the wave number n 2 e u f r b π is approximate 4 for the abovementioned three cases where the e u 2 p a t m ρ v 0 2 8 8 is the euler number the b c x 0 25 0 95 is a constant and the c x 0 8275 is the cavitation drag coefficient savchenko et al 2000 for these cases however the wave number is 3 in this three cases as shown in fig 7 so the wave number estimate formula suggested by savchenko et al 2000 may not suit ours low froude number cases f r 20 thus the cavity ripples are more likely acoustic in origin and the resonant volume oscillations of the cavity after the pull away can produce a re entrant jet such as pinch off to form the initial pressure perturbation grumstrup et al 2007 for the ventilation cases the cavity ripples weren t observed which supports the explain of the cavity ripples since there aren t pull away phenomenon in ours ventilation water entry experiments 4 concluding remarks with a systematic experimental investigation of the oblique and ventilation water entry some insights into the water entry cavity flow near the water surface were reached for the oblique water entry without ventilation experiments the surface closure time and pull away time dependent on the entry angle and increase gradually furthermore the deep closure pattern changes from a point closure to a line closure and the closure length increases firstly with the entry angle then keeps approximately constant at large entry angles the value is α 40 0 in ours experiments moreover the deep closure time and the pinch off depth slightly increase and decrease respectively all these can be attributed the under pressure and surface tension of the cavity under different water entry angles the cavity ripples observed in oblique water entry experiments are more likely acoustic in origin caused by initial pressure perturbation of the pull away for the ventilation water entry experiments the surface closure time will be increased with the ventilation rate since the water surface air rushed into the cavity will be blocked by the ventilation gas the deep closure time of the ventilation case is higher than that of the non ventilation at small entry angle cases however with the further increase of the ventilation rate the deep closure time changes slightly and the ventilation has little effects on the deep closure time for large water entry angle cases the pinch off depth slightly increases with the ventilation rate and the deep closure pattern is not a line closure since there are numerous gas bubbles leaking from the attached cavity tail these flow characteristics can be attributed to the cavity inner pressure characteristics under the action of the ventilation gas
