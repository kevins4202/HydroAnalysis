5220,stable oxygen isotope as a valuable environmental tracer can provide unique insights on hydrology and climate research however sparse isotopic observations hinder its utilization of interpreting hydrological processes eastern china is a typical region where isotopic measurements are limited isotope equipped global climate models igcms are able to provide detailed isotope information to extend observations in time at a large spatial scale however biases between observations and simulations challenge the direct application of igcms simulations accordingly this study investigates the potential of bias correcting igcms to generate reliable and spatiotemporally continuous isotopic landscape isoscape for eastern china spatial and temporal correlations between observations and simulations are investigated at a regional scale performances of six igcm simulations and two bias correction methods bcms are compared in this study uncertainties for the precipitation oxygen isoscape poi are estimated by comparing results from an ensemble mean of six igcm simulations and two bcms as well as using a variance decomposition method the poi for eastern china is generated by averaging the results from the six igcm simulations corrected by the two bcms results show that igcm simulations are strongly correlated to observations at a given temporal and spatial scale model simulations generally underestimate the precipitation oxygen isotope the two bcms exhibit the ability of reducing biases in the simulated values the igcms seem to contribute more uncertainty to mean δ 18 op estimates than the two bcms used in this study followed by the interaction between igcms and bcms with the least in bcms the poi built by a multi igcm and multi bcm approach adequately preserves the spatiotemporal pattern of isotopic measurements overall bias correction is imperative and effective in building high resolution poi by making of spatiotemporally coherent igcms simulations

op plays a critical role in hydrological research such as estimating land atmosphere interaction e g kurita yamada 2008 risi et al 2013 interpreting global paleoclimate e g midhun ramesh 2016 dee et al 2017 etc δ 18 op which is affected by evaporation condensation and other complicated hydrological processes shows large spatial and temporary variabilities bowen 2010 because of the technical difficulty and high cost of measuring δ 18 op allen et al 2018 observations are often rather sparse in time and space galewsky et al 2016 as such developing accurate precipitation oxygen isoscape poi using alternative methods is needed to help improve our understanding of hydrological processes eastern china is characterized by sparse isotope observation network and spatiotemporally complicated hydrological extremes which motivates the need for developing poi two types of methods have been widely applied to generate meteoric isoscape bowen 2010 zhang and wang 2016 one is empirically based statistical or geostatistical models using identified relationships between predictors and δ 18 op kern et al 2014 the other is physically based numerical models e g various isotope equipped general circulation models igcms involving physical processes associated with the variation of δ 18 op hoffmann et al 2000 the former method is relatively simple and computationally efficient however due to the uneven and limited distribution of available precipitation isotope data in time this method is unable to generate time explicit isoscape allen et al 2018 moreover isoscape built solely by geostatistical interpolation eliminates the representation of dynamic features e g the trajectory and interaction of circulation systems holmes 2012 the igcms approach could provide detailed information and leverage the products by incorporating underlying dynamic processes that control water isotopologues the drawbacks of this method are high computational demand and lack of validation galewsky et al 2016 most previous studies compared global or regional δ 18 op from igcms and isotopic observations e g jouzel et al 2000 risi et al 2012 wang et al 2015 but seldom focused on correcting biases of igcms outputs and generating precipitation isotope database the different characteristics and process representations of each igcms contribute to different distributions of precipitation isotope jouzel et al 2000 furthermore the choice of bias correction methods bcms for post processing the isoscape may amplify the differences and introduce additional uncertainty chen et al 2011 thus it is necessary to assess the performance of different combinations of igcms and bcms as well as to analyze the uncertainties in building poi the objectives of this study are to 1 evaluate the performances of six igcm simulations and two bcms for eastern china 2 compare the potential contributions of the igcm uncertainty and bcm uncertainty in generating the isoscape and 3 develop a spatiotemporal database of poi for eastern china by integration 2 materials 2 1 study area eastern china stretches from latitude 18 n to 53 n and from longitude 106 e to 135 e covering approximately 260 000 km2 this region lies west of the pacific ocean the great khingan mountain taihang mountain wu mountain and xuefeng mountain border the region to the western fig 1 topographically most of the study region comprises of plains below 500 m the climatic patterns are mainly dominated by the east asian monsoon westerly and polar air masses the intensity of air masses varying in the course of a year modulates the pattern of moisture transport and leads to the spatiotemporal variation of precipitation guo et al 2019 in summer the southern part of the study area is characterized by strong and continuous precipitation namely the meiyu climate systems ding et al 2009 in winter droughts frequently happen in the northern study area to characterize the spatial variation of isotopic values the study area is subdivided into four sub regions including southern china sc central china cc northern china nc and northeastern china nec in fig 1 each sub region is characterized by its vapor flux isotope distribution and geophysical conditions the detailed information about the subdivision is discussed in peng et al 2020 we collected long term meteorological information from the china meteorological data service center cmdc and calculated monthly mean meteorological parameters of the four sub regions for different seasons table 1 as showed in table 1 temperature and precipitation decrease from sc to nec for the four sub regions the maximum temperature and precipitation occur in summer whereas the minimum temperature and precipitation occur in winter 2 2 data set observed isotopic data are collected from the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip and the chinese network of isotopes in precipitation chnip the gnip is a worldwide observation network of isotopic composition of precipitation initiated in 1960 by the international atomic energy agency iaea and the world meteorological organization wmo accessible at https nucleus iaea org iaea wmo 1998 in the early 2000 s most of the gnip stations in china suspended observations zhang and wang 2016 to continue systematic nationwide observation network chnip was established by the chinese academy of sciences covering the period from 2005 to 2010 there are 17 gnip stations and 15 chnip stations with monthly isotopic data in the study area the locations of these stations are given in fig 1 six simulations by five igcms cam2 hadam giss miroc and lmdz at different resolutions are utilized and compared in this study cam2 is the first igcm that compares the simulations to satellite water isotope retrievals hadam3 is a hydrostatic grid point model using an arakawa b grid and hybrid vertical coordinates giss is the first igcm that couples atmosphere ocean models with water isotopes miroc separates cloud processes into cumulus convective processes and stratiform clouds lmdz is the first isotopic gcm with stretched grid zoom functionality more detailed information about these igcms can be found in the references of table 2 among the six igcm simulations giss runs two simulations including nudged and free running simulations see table 2 for model information four of the six igcm simulations are obtained from the second stable water isotope intercomparison group phase 2 swing2 https data giss nasa gov swing2 the isotopic outputs of lmdz are developed at the laboratoire demétéorologie dynamique lmd and described in detail by risi et al 2010 and gao et al 2011 3 methods 3 1 bias correction methods generally bcms can be classified into mean based and distribution based approaches chen et al 2013a the former assumes that at a specific spatiotemporal scale biases in simulations are constant whereas the latter assumes that the biases vary with the magnitudes of simulated values chen et al 2013b the simplest and typical methods of each kind i e linear scaling ls and distribution translation dt are adopted to correct the biases from igcms all the bias corrections are conducted for each season in each sub region the ls method involves three steps lafon et al 2013 1 simulations are linearly interpolated to a station scale to match the locations of observations 2 the correction factor is calculated by averaging the differences between the observed isotopic values and the corresponding simulated isotopic monthly values during a specific season as showed in eqs 1 and 3 the correction factor is added to the simulated isotopic values for bias correction eq 2 1 r ls δ o obs s or δ o gcm s or 2 δ o cor s nr δ o gcm s nr r ls where rls is the bias correction factor of the ls method the superscripts nr and or represent stations grids without and with observations respectively the subscripts cor gcm obs and s represent corrected simulations raw simulations observations and a specific season respectively for example δ o obs s or δ o o b s s o r represents averaged isotopic observations in stations grids where containing observations during a specific season s δ o g c m s o r represents averaged isotopic simulations in stations grids where containing observations during a specific season s for the dt method the steps are almost the same as those of the ls method except the calculation of correction factors chen et al 2016 a different correction factor is calculated for each percentile of the simulations using eq 3 and then the factors are interpolated or extrapolated for the grids without observations using eq 4 the interpolation and extrapolation are performed using a linear method 3 r dt or δ o obs q or δ o gcm q or 4 r dt or interpolation e x t r a p o l a t i o n r dt nr 5 δ o cor s nr δ o gcm s nr r dt nr where and are the correction factors of the dt method for stations grids without and with observation respectively and the two are assumed to be equal at the same percentile the subscript q is a percentile for a specific season other subscripts and subscripts are the same as eqs 3 and 4 δ o obs q or represents percentile of isotopic observations in stations grids where containing observations during a specific season δ o gcm q or represents percentile of isotopic simulations in stations grids where containing observations during a specific season six integral percentiles 0th 20th 40th 60th 80th 100th are calculated for each season in each sub region 3 2 performance and uncertainty evaluation all the evaluations are based on the monthly data from 1979 to 2001 which is the common period of the observations and igcms simulations due to limited availability of isotopic data in space and time samples that are too few to represent seasonal or regional variance are not used we eliminate the isotopic data if the timespan is less than one year or the sample size is less than six at one station in one season to evaluate the performance of bcms in this study a spatial cross validation approach namely leave one station out is applied in the following three steps lafon et al 2013 1 all the isotopic stations are divided into one station and the remaining stations 2 the remaining stations are used to calibrate the bcms and the one left out station is used for validation 3 the two steps are repeated until all the stations are chosen as a validation station for evaluation purpose means and quantiles of δ 18 op for validated stations are used as metrics to analyze the uncertainty sources six igcm simulations are bias corrected by two bcms to generate 12 poi for the 12 different combinations of igcms and bcms for investigating the uncertainty of igcms the twelve combinations are classified into six groups each group comprises of the isoscape generated by one igcm and two bcms with regard to the uncertainty of bcms the combinations are classified into two groups and each group contains six gcm simulations corrected by each bcm the averaged results of each group are compared using means and cumulative distribution functions cdfs of poi as criteria in addition a variance decomposition method is applied to disaggregate the total uncertainty or variance of mean δ 18 op into three components uncertainties related to igcms and bcms and the interaction between igcms and bcms the total variance attributed to the mean δ 18 op can be expressed as below déqué et al 2007 ferro 2004 6 v total v igcm v bcm v i g c m b c m the contribution of each component is calculated by dividing vtotal and yields 7 1 v igcm v total v bcm v total v i g c m b c m v total where v igcm v total v bcm v total and v i g c m b c m v total represent the uncertainty contribution of igcm bcm and the interaction between igcm and bcm respectively the mean seasonal δ 18 op for each sub region is calculated for the 12 poi the sum of the squared deviation of the averaged δ 18 op from the 12 poi is regarded as overall variances the sum of the squared deviation of the averaged δ 18 op from different igcms is regarded as the variance of igcms the sum of the squared deviation of the averaged δ 18 op from different bcms is regarded as the variance of bcms the residual error is regarded as the variance of interaction between igcm and bcm based on the calculation of variances the uncertainty contributions of the three components are estimated by eq 7 3 3 precipitation oxygen isoscape generation to generate the isotopic database the sparse chnip dataset is included as a reference to correct igcm simulations for generating a more reliable poi data for eastern china based on gnip and chnip the six simulations are corrected by the two bcms individually to build 12 poi for reducing or averaging out the poi variations caused by differences between bcms as well as among igcms the 12 combinations of igcms and bcms are averaged to obtain the poi database for eastern china 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial and temporal correlations between observations and igcm simulations before applying the bcms to correct the biases from igcms it is necessary to assess spatial and temporal correlations between observations and igcm simulations spatial correlation is calculated by comparing annual mean observations with annual mean simulations at different sites kohn and welker 2005 temporal correlation compares mean monthly observations with mean monthly simulations over a specific region spatial and temporal correlation coefficients are calculated for the four sub regions results of sc and nec representing the north and south of the study area are chosen to be listed in table 3 the observations and igcm simulations are strongly correlated at both spatial and temporal scales providing a strong scientific basis for applying the bcms to generate spatiotemporal coherent poi among the six simulations simulations run by nudged giss and lmdz show the strongest correlation with observations the atmospheric circulations in nudged giss and lmdz are constrained by observations risi et al 2010 whereas other models are free running the pearson correlation coefficients for nec are greater than those for sc because the changes of atmospheric circulation patterns in nec are more pronounced than those in sc li et al 2012 making it easier for igcms to capture the more prominent spatiotemporal features it should be noted that the spatial correlation is generally weaker than temporal correlation between observed and raw simulated δ 18 op this phenomenon is partially explained by relatively small spatial variation of δ 18 op in each sub region as compared to the temporal or seasonal variation 4 2 performance of bias correction methods applied to different igcms fig 2 compares observed uncorrected and corrected mean δ 18 op in different sub regions for each season the simulated results are generated by different combinations of the two bcms and six igcm simulations the rows from top to bottom represent the results for sc cc nc and nec respectively each panel shows the biases exist between observed and simulated δ 18 op in each sub region all year round the six simulations present similar temporal and spatial patterns to the observed data as shown in fig 2 a d g and j this indicates that igcm simulations can be used to derive a reliable poi via bias correction for sc and cc δ 18 op is more negative during the summer season than during the winter season whereas for nc and nec the seasonality of δ 18 op is quite opposite to that in sc and cc the atmospheric circulations relating to these patterns are discussed in more detail below section 4 4 the spatiotemporal pattern is consistent with previous studies conroy et al 2013 zhao et al 2012 most igcms underestimate the composition of isotope in precipitation for this study region simulations nudged by ncep show better skill in reproducing the seasonal mean δ 18 op in the sub regions because in nudged simulations the simulated variations are constrained by ncep and therefore consistent with the observed variations in synoptic weather and atmospheric circulation genthon et al 2002 goursaud et al 2018 whereas free running simulations allow the atmosphere to run freely galewsky et al 2016 fig 2 b e h and k as well as c f i and l show the performance of the ls method and dt method respectively biases in regional and seasonal mean δ 18 op are reduced by the two bcms the ls method presents a similar performance with the dt method only in cc the ls method performs slightly better than the dt method based on the criteria for sample selection section 3 2 there is not enough isotopic data for leave one station out cross validation in spring and winter for nec thus the results of validation in spring and winter for nec are omitted fig 2 k and l figs 3 6 demonstrate seasonal and regional performance of the two bcms applied to the six igcm simulations by quantile quantile plots for sc cc nc and nec respectively the rows in each figure from top to bottom represent the results of spring summer autumn and winter both bcms are able to reduce the biases in terms of modeled distributions the bcms yield the best results in summer while the worst in winter this is caused by the availability of sample sizes for calibration which generally are the largest for summer and the smallest for winter spatially the biases for nc are relatively larger than those for other sub regions because the movements of air masses in nc are more complicated and variable with seasons yang et al 2017 in summer the east asian monsoon controls nc whereas in winter westerly and polar air masses dominate the sub region these temporal variations are difficult to be accurately captured by igcms under most circumstances the dt method shows better performance than the ls method indicating that the quantile based method is better than the mean based method the lack of observed data hinders bias correction for nec in spring and winter as is shown in the blank plots in fig 6 b c k and l 4 3 uncertainty in building precipitation oxygen isoscape in order to understand the uncertainty of igcms and bcms in building the poi δ 18 op from the same source is first grouped and then averaged to obtain the mean values fig 7 illustrates seasonal variations of mean δ 18 op for each sub region the ensembles of six igcm simulations and two bcms are grouped by igcms the upper row and bcms the bottom row in sc and cc the mean δ 18 op values in summer are lower than those in other sub regions in nc and nec the lowest δ 18 op value negative value occurs in winter both igcms and bcms contribute to the uncertainty envelope which varies in space and time compared to the uncertainty associated with igcms the uncertainty related to bcms is generally less in this study the east asian monsoon happening in summer controls isotopic signals for the study area however the isotopic signals caused by movement of the east asian monsoon are difficult to simulate with igcms yoshimura 2015 thus as the marginal sub region affected by the east asian monsoon nc exhibits much more variabilities than other sub regions in summer figs 8 11 present the cdfs of seasonal δ 18 op during four seasons for sc cc nc and nec respectively the cdfs for sc and cc in winter suggest a relatively narrow uncertainty envelope which reflects that the uncertainty associated with igcms and bcms are not important in projecting seasonal cdfs of δ 18 op for cc in winter overall the igcms display slightly greater uncertainty than the bcms considering cdf of seasonal and regional δ 18 op the igcm uncertainties vary across sub regions and seasons depending on atmosphere circulation patterns for sc and cc the uncertainty of igcms is greater in summer than in winter in contrast for nc and nec the uncertainty present an opposite seasonal pattern this can be interpreted by different atmosphere circulation patterns for the sub regions the meteorology of eastern china is dominated by east asian monsoon westerly and polar air masses zhao et al 2012 the east asian monsoon dominates sc and cc in summer whereas westerly and polar air masses control nc and nec in winter the complicated movements of air masses contribute to difficulties in simulating isotopic signals under specific cases the total uncertainty of mean δ18op for each sub region and each season is disaggregated into three components by using the variance decomposition method the relative contribution of each uncertainty source to the total uncertainty is quantified and presented in table 4 results show that the choice of igcms made the greatest contribution to uncertainty in estimating δ18op whereas the bcms played a relatively smaller role this is consistent with the results from fig 7 but is different from results from figs 8 11 for example for nec in winter the uncertainty of bcms is near 0 in table 3 in fig 7 there is nearly no difference between two bcms in winter for nec however in figs 8 11 the uncertainty of bcms cannot be neglected in winter for nec the discordance is mainly attributed to different criteria or aspects of uncertainty table 3 and fig 7 presents the uncertainty in simulating mean δ18op while figs 8 11 shows the uncertainty in simulating quantiles of δ18op in table 3 it is also found that the contributions of interaction uncertainty between igcms and bcms are also generally greater than the contributions of the bcms temporally the uncertainty contributions of igcms in winter are bigger than those of in the other seasons the relative contributions of bcms are amplified in autumn for sc and cc comparing with the influence in other seasons because for sc and cc the δ18op is mainly influenced by the monsoon from the pacific ocean which usually happens in spring and summer wang and ho 2002 in winter siberian northwest winter monsoon affects the δ18op for sc and cc wu et al 2015 comparing to the atmospheric movement in spring summer and winter the atmospheric movement in autumn is simpler which reduces the difficulty in igcms simulations as such the uncertainty contributions of igcms simulations for sc and cc in autumn are lower and the relative contributions of bcms are higher than other seasons the effect of interaction between igcms and bcms is lower in winter all the year round 4 4 precipitation oxygen isoscape of eastern china the performance and uncertainty evaluation cover the common period 1979 2001 using gnip dataset as presented in section 4 2 the two bcms are able to correct the biases of igcms however their performances are slightly different for each sub region and season results also show that each igcm is capable of simulating poi with bias correction though certain differences exist among them thus the poi database is generated by averaging the poi based on the multi igcm and multi bcm ensemble as described in section 3 3 fig 12 compares mean seasonal observations averaged raw multi igcm simulations and averaged poi for the study area the raw simulations present similar spatial and temporal patterns of poi to observations however they generally underestimate the δ 18 op the biases are reduced by bias correction as shown in fig 12 c f i and l in eastern china the isotopic values of precipitation decrease with latitude all year round this spatial pattern can be explained by rayleigh distillation a slow process with immediate removal of the condensate as rain from the vapor bowen 2010 dansgaard 1964 yoshimura 2015 as latitude decreases temperature becomes higher the increasing temperature would evaporate more heavy isotope from liquid form leading to an increase in isotopic values of precipitation the positive relationship between δ 18 op and temperature is called temperature effect dansgaard 1964 sturm et al 2005 seasonality of the poi varies with different sub regions and is impacted by various factors for sc and cc δ 18 op in summer are more negative compared to those in other seasons the patterns of sc and cc are associated with the deep convection driven by the east asian monsoon vuille et al 2005 the traditional rayleigh distillation framework is not sufficient to interpret isotopic variations where most of the precipitation arises from deep convection and vertical motions dominate over horizontal transport the east asian monsoon weakens gradually as it extends northward and has little effect on the precipitation in nc and nec it brings moisture from the pacific ocean to eastern china and dominates sc and cc in summer araguás araguás et al 1998 the air mass from the pacific ocean is more isotopically depleted than those from sub regions sc and cc zhao et al 2012 the convergence with depleted air mass from the pacific ocean would undoubtedly dilute the content of isotope in precipitation for sc and cc besides when the convection becomes more intensive rain re evaporation is usually weaker and thus the rain drops become less enriched as they fall guy et al 2019 li et al 2016 the general trend of decreasing of δ 18 op with amount of precipitation increases which is contrary to temperature effect is named amount effect matsuyama et al 2005 rozanski et al 1993 for nc and nec the δ 18 op in winter shows more negative results than those of other seasons this temporal variation is correlated with the movement of westerly and polar air masses zhao et al 2012 which is much drier and enriched in precipitation comparing to the air masses from the pacific ocean tang et al 2017 no convergence with isotopically depleted air mass or strong convection happens in these sub regions the patterns for nc and nec are consistent with temperature effect which can be interpreted by rayleigh distillation theory furthermore the monthly corrected isotope data spanning the years 1958 through 2009 are provided in the supplement for the first time as a most comprehensive database for the east china region this study suggests strong potential of bias correcting igcms to provide detailed isotope data by making of limited observed data however the performance of bcms is evaluated based on sparse isotopic measurements no validation is done for nec in spring and winter due to lack of measured data the bcms would produce better datasets if more observed data are available for calibration besides climate change has its own decadal variability which would result in periodical changes of δ 18 op thus longer records of isotopic observations are needed to better calibrating or validating igcm output obviously more measured isotopic data are preferred for calibrating and validating bias correction methods the existing measurement technology is limited by low temporal resolution and high sample preparation efforts and costs allen et al 2018 braden behrens et al 2017 further improvement in techniques for measuring precipitation isotopic composition is clearly required when it comes to the uncertainty analysis the number of igcms involved is larger than the number of bcms the smaller sample size of bcms may underestimate the uncertainty envelope though the two chosen bcms cover the two common kinds of bcms conclusions might be different if more bcms are applied to investigate the uncertainty more work can be focused on involving more bcms to assess the uncertainty linked to bcms additionally the scale effect on bias correcting δ 18 op is neglected in this study for evaluating the performance and uncertainty of igcms even though the resolution of five igcms are different some might argue that the bias correction quality may be improved by finer resolutions of igcms however this scale effect may be negligible for a certain downscaling approach that directly maps climate model outputs at a grid box scale to station observations which was confirmed in chen et al 2014 the generated poi could improve our understanding of climate and hydrology science in climate science factors affecting the isotopic composition of a water mass can be explored by analyzing the relationships between poi and climatic variables based on influencing factors and isotopic composition of paleo records researchers could attempt to reconstruct paleo climatic variations clark and fritz 1997 lykoudis and argiriou 2007 in hydrology science poi can be used as tracers to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of water cycles isotopic fractionation varies during hydrological processes including convection evaporation concentration etc as such the signals of poi is applicable to quantify the contributions of evapotranspiration and advection flux to precipitation at different spatiotemporal scales sengupta and sarkar 2006 tian et al 2007 current isotopic observations are too limited to satisfy the climatic and hydrological needs of time space explicit dataset there are only 32 stations unevenly distributed in the study area liu et al 2014 besides most observational records are discontinuous and shorter than 6 years zhang and wang 2016 comparing to the station poi observations the generated poi in section 4 3 could provide a relatively dense network extending for several decades and permit investigation into hydrometeorology research for example inter annual precipitation sources can be partitioned with the produced poi but cannot be estimated with isotopic stations due to the scarcity of time explicit observations however the generated poi has two main limitations for further study one is the relatively low temporal resolution the generated poi is at a monthly scale so it cannot be used for daily precipitation events another limitation is the short time span the poi only covers the period from 1958 to 2009 and the isotopic database of the past decade are missing these limitations mainly result from the lack of observations to build the poi 5 conclusions this study analyzes the correlations between measured δ 18 op and modelled δ 18 op from igcms the strong correlations ensure the validity and applicability of bias correcting igcms to develop poi for the study region the performances of six igcm simulations free running cam2 hadam giss miroc as well as nudged giss and lmdz and two bcms ls and dt are evaluated using means and quantiles of δ 18 op as criteria results show that igcm simulations generally underestimate δ 18 op the biases in regional and seasonal δ 18 op are reduced by two bcms the ls method presents a similar performance with the dt method in projecting mean δ 18 op with regard to probability distributions the dt method performs better than the ls method uncertainty evaluation for the isoscape is estimated by combining results from an ensemble of six igcm simulations and two bcms the results indicate that the uncertainty linked to igcms dominates followed by uncertainty in the interaction between igcms and bmcs with the least associated with bcms to eliminate the biases caused by individual igcms or bcms a multi igcm and multi bcm approach is applied to generate the averaged poi for eastern china the corrected isoscape adequately represents the spatiotemporal pattern of isotopic measurements which can be obtained in the supplement in sc and cc the mean δ 18 op values in summer are lower than the values in other seasons in nc and nec the lowest δ 18 op values occur in winter these spatial and temporal patterns are consistent with atmospheric circulations overall combination of igcms and bcms can be a powerful tool to produce detailed and useful poi for use in characterizing hydrological processes and water cycles at large scales credit authorship contribution statement

hydrological processes eastern china is a typical region where isotopic measurements are limited isotope equipped global climate models igcms are able to provide detailed isotope information to extend observations in time at a large spatial scale however biases between observations and simulations challenge the direct application of igcms simulations accordingly this study investigates the

simulations generally underestimate the precipitation oxygen isotope the two bcms exhibit the ability of reducing biases in the simulated values the igcms seem to contribute more uncertainty to mean δ

develop a spatiotemporal database of poi for eastern china by integration 2 materials 2 1 study area eastern china stretches from latitude 18 n to 53 n and from longitude 106 e to 135 e covering approximately 260 000 km2 this region lies west of the pacific ocean the great khingan mountain taihang mountain wu mountain and xuefeng mountain border the region to the western fig 1 topographically most of the study region comprises of plains below 500 m the climatic patterns are mainly dominated by the east asian monsoon westerly and polar air masses the intensity of air masses varying in the course of a year modulates the pattern of moisture transport and leads to the spatiotemporal variation of precipitation guo et al 2019 in summer the southern part of the study area is characterized by strong and continuous precipitation namely the meiyu climate systems ding et al 2009 in winter droughts frequently happen in the northern study area to characterize the spatial variation of isotopic values the study area is subdivided into four sub regions including southern china sc central china cc northern china nc and northeastern china nec in fig 1 each sub region is characterized by its vapor flux isotope distribution and geophysical conditions the detailed information about the subdivision is discussed in peng et al 2020 we collected long term meteorological information from the china meteorological data service center cmdc and calculated monthly mean meteorological parameters of the four sub regions for different seasons table 1 as showed in table 1 temperature and precipitation decrease from sc to nec for the four sub regions the maximum temperature and precipitation occur in summer whereas the minimum temperature and precipitation occur in winter 2 2 data set observed isotopic data are collected from the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip and the chinese network of isotopes in precipitation chnip the gnip is a worldwide observation network of isotopic composition of precipitation initiated in 1960 by the international atomic energy agency iaea and the world meteorological organization wmo accessible at https nucleus iaea org iaea wmo 1998 in the early 2000 s most of the gnip stations in china suspended observations zhang and wang 2016 to continue systematic nationwide observation network chnip was established by the chinese academy of sciences covering the period from 2005 to 2010 there are 17 gnip stations and 15 chnip stations with monthly isotopic data in the study area the locations of these stations are given in fig 1 six simulations by five igcms cam2 hadam giss miroc and lmdz at different resolutions are utilized and compared in this study cam2 is the first igcm that compares the simulations to satellite water isotope retrievals hadam3 is a hydrostatic grid point model using an arakawa b grid and hybrid vertical coordinates giss is the first igcm that couples atmosphere ocean models with water isotopes miroc separates cloud processes into cumulus convective processes and stratiform clouds lmdz is the first isotopic gcm with stretched grid zoom functionality more detailed information about these igcms can be found in the references of table 2 among the six igcm simulations giss runs two simulations including nudged and free running simulations see table 2 for model information four of the six igcm simulations are obtained from the second stable water isotope intercomparison group phase 2 swing2 https data giss nasa gov swing2 the isotopic outputs of lmdz are developed at the laboratoire demétéorologie dynamique lmd and described in detail by risi et al 2010 and gao et al 2011 3 methods 3 1 bias correction methods generally bcms can be classified into mean based and distribution based approaches chen et al 2013a the former assumes that at a specific spatiotemporal scale biases in simulations are constant whereas the latter assumes that the biases vary with the magnitudes of simulated values chen et al 2013b the simplest and typical methods of each kind i e linear scaling ls and distribution translation dt are adopted to correct the biases from igcms all the bias corrections are conducted for each season in each sub region the ls method involves three steps lafon et al 2013 1 simulations are linearly interpolated to a station scale to match the locations of observations 2 the correction factor is calculated by averaging the differences between the observed isotopic values and the corresponding simulated isotopic monthly values during a specific season as showed in eqs 1 and 3 the correction factor is added to the simulated isotopic values for bias correction eq 2 1 r ls δ o obs s or δ o gcm s or 2 δ o cor s nr δ o gcm s nr r ls where rls is the bias correction factor of the ls method the superscripts nr and or represent stations grids without and with observations respectively the subscripts cor gcm obs and s represent corrected simulations raw simulations observations and a specific season respectively for example δ o obs s or δ o o b s s o r represents averaged isotopic observations in stations grids where containing observations during a specific season s δ o g c m s o r represents averaged isotopic simulations in stations grids where containing observations during a specific season s for the dt method the steps are almost the same as those of the ls method except the calculation of correction factors chen et al 2016 a different correction factor is calculated for each percentile of the simulations using eq 3 and then the factors are interpolated or extrapolated for the grids without observations using eq 4 the interpolation and extrapolation are performed using a linear method 3 r dt or δ o obs q or δ o gcm q or 4 r dt or interpolation e x t r a p o l a t i o n r dt nr 5 δ o cor s nr δ o gcm s nr r dt nr where and are the correction factors of the dt method for stations grids without and with observation respectively and the two are assumed to be equal at the same percentile the subscript q is a percentile for a specific season other subscripts and subscripts are the same as eqs 3 and 4 δ o obs q or represents percentile of isotopic observations in stations grids where containing observations during a specific season δ o gcm q or represents percentile of isotopic simulations in stations grids where containing observations during a specific season six integral percentiles 0th 20th 40th 60th 80th 100th are calculated for each season in each sub region 3 2 performance and uncertainty evaluation all the evaluations are based on the monthly data from 1979 to 2001 which is the common period of the observations and igcms simulations due to limited availability of isotopic data in space and time samples that are too few to represent seasonal or regional variance are not used we eliminate the isotopic data if the timespan is less than one year or the sample size is less than six at one station in one season to evaluate the performance of bcms in this study a spatial cross validation approach namely leave one station out is applied in the following three steps lafon et al 2013 1 all the isotopic stations are divided into one station and the remaining stations 2 the remaining stations are used to calibrate the bcms and the one left out station is used for validation 3 the two steps are repeated until all the stations are chosen as a validation station for evaluation purpose means and quantiles of δ 18 op for validated stations are used as metrics to analyze the uncertainty sources six igcm simulations are bias corrected by two bcms to generate 12 poi for the 12 different combinations of igcms and bcms for investigating the uncertainty of igcms the twelve combinations are classified into six groups each group comprises of the isoscape generated by one igcm and two bcms with regard to the uncertainty of bcms the combinations are classified into two groups and each group contains six gcm simulations corrected by each bcm the averaged results of each group are compared using means and cumulative distribution functions cdfs of poi as criteria in addition a variance decomposition method is applied to disaggregate the total uncertainty or variance of mean δ 18 op into three components uncertainties related to igcms and bcms and the interaction between igcms and bcms the total variance attributed to the mean δ 18 op can be expressed as below déqué et al 2007 ferro 2004 6 v total v igcm v bcm v i g c m b c m the contribution of each component is calculated by dividing vtotal and yields 7 1 v igcm v total v bcm v total v i g c m b c m v total where v igcm v total v bcm v total and v i g c m b c m v total represent the uncertainty contribution of igcm bcm and the interaction between igcm and bcm respectively the mean seasonal δ 18 op for each sub region is calculated for the 12 poi the sum of the squared deviation of the averaged δ 18 op from the 12 poi is regarded as overall variances the sum of the squared deviation of the averaged δ 18 op from different igcms is regarded as the variance of igcms the sum of the squared deviation of the averaged δ 18 op from different bcms is regarded as the variance of bcms the residual error is regarded as the variance of interaction between igcm and bcm based on the calculation of variances the uncertainty contributions of the three components are estimated by eq 7 3 3 precipitation oxygen isoscape generation to generate the isotopic database the sparse chnip dataset is included as a reference to correct igcm simulations for generating a more reliable poi data for eastern china based on gnip and chnip the six simulations are corrected by the two bcms individually to build 12 poi for reducing or averaging out the poi variations caused by differences between bcms as well as among igcms the 12 combinations of igcms and bcms are averaged to obtain the poi database for eastern china 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial and temporal correlations between observations and igcm simulations before applying the bcms to correct the biases from igcms it is necessary to assess spatial and temporal correlations between observations and igcm simulations spatial correlation is calculated by comparing annual mean observations with annual mean simulations at different sites kohn and welker 2005 temporal correlation compares mean monthly observations with mean monthly simulations over a specific region spatial and temporal correlation coefficients are calculated for the four sub regions results of sc and nec representing the north and south of the study area are chosen to be listed in table 3 the observations and igcm simulations are strongly correlated at both spatial and temporal scales providing a strong scientific basis for applying the bcms to generate spatiotemporal coherent poi among the six simulations simulations run by nudged giss and lmdz show the strongest correlation with observations the atmospheric circulations in nudged giss and lmdz are constrained by observations risi et al 2010 whereas other models are free running the pearson correlation coefficients for nec are greater than those for sc because the changes of atmospheric circulation patterns in nec are more pronounced than those in sc li et al 2012 making it easier for igcms to capture the more prominent spatiotemporal features it should be noted that the spatial correlation is generally weaker than temporal correlation between observed and raw simulated δ 18 op this phenomenon is partially explained by relatively small spatial variation of δ 18 op in each sub region as compared to the temporal or seasonal variation 4 2 performance of bias correction methods applied to different igcms fig 2 compares observed uncorrected and corrected mean δ 18 op in different sub regions for each season the simulated results are generated by different combinations of the two bcms and six igcm simulations the rows from top to bottom represent the results for sc cc nc and nec respectively each panel shows the biases exist between observed and simulated δ 18 op in each sub region all year round the six simulations present similar temporal and spatial patterns to the observed data as shown in fig 2 a d g and j this indicates that igcm simulations can be used to derive a reliable poi via bias correction for sc and cc δ 18 op is more negative during the summer season than during the winter season whereas for nc and nec the seasonality of δ 18 op is quite opposite to that in sc and cc the atmospheric circulations relating to these patterns are discussed in more detail below section 4 4 the spatiotemporal pattern is consistent with previous studies conroy et al 2013 zhao et al 2012 most igcms underestimate the composition of isotope in precipitation for this study region simulations nudged by ncep show better skill in reproducing the seasonal mean δ 18 op in the sub regions because in nudged simulations the simulated variations are constrained by ncep and therefore consistent with the observed variations in synoptic weather and atmospheric circulation genthon et al 2002 goursaud et al 2018 whereas free running simulations allow the atmosphere to run freely galewsky et al 2016 fig 2 b e h and k as well as c f i and l show the performance of the ls method and dt method respectively biases in regional and seasonal mean δ 18 op are reduced by the two bcms the ls method presents a similar performance with the dt method only in cc the ls method performs slightly better than the dt method based on the criteria for sample selection section 3 2 there is not enough isotopic data for leave one station out cross validation in spring and winter for nec thus the results of validation in spring and winter for nec are omitted fig 2 k and l figs 3 6 demonstrate seasonal and regional performance of the two bcms applied to the six igcm simulations by quantile quantile plots for sc cc nc and nec respectively the rows in each figure from top to bottom represent the results of spring summer autumn and winter both bcms are able to reduce the biases in terms of modeled distributions the bcms yield the best results in summer while the worst in winter this is caused by the availability of sample sizes for calibration which generally are the largest for summer and the smallest for winter spatially the biases for nc are relatively larger than those for other sub regions because the movements of air masses in nc are more complicated and variable with seasons yang et al 2017 in summer the east asian monsoon controls nc whereas in winter westerly and polar air masses dominate the sub region these temporal variations are difficult to be accurately captured by igcms under most circumstances the dt method shows better performance than the ls method indicating that the quantile based method is better than the mean based method the lack of observed data hinders bias correction for nec in spring and winter as is shown in the blank plots in fig 6 b c k and l 4 3 uncertainty in building precipitation oxygen isoscape in order to understand the uncertainty of igcms and bcms in building the poi δ 18 op from the same source is first grouped and then averaged to obtain the mean values fig 7 illustrates seasonal variations of mean δ 18 op for each sub region the ensembles of six igcm simulations and two bcms are grouped by igcms the upper row and bcms the bottom row in sc and cc the mean δ 18 op values in summer are lower than those in other sub regions in nc and nec the lowest δ 18 op value negative value occurs in winter both igcms and bcms contribute to the uncertainty envelope which varies in space and time compared to the uncertainty associated with igcms the uncertainty related to bcms is generally less in this study the east asian monsoon happening in summer controls isotopic signals for the study area however the isotopic signals caused by movement of the east asian monsoon are difficult to simulate with igcms yoshimura 2015 thus as the marginal sub region affected by the east asian monsoon nc exhibits much more variabilities than other sub regions in summer figs 8 11 present the cdfs of seasonal δ 18 op during four seasons for sc cc nc and nec respectively the cdfs for sc and cc in winter suggest a relatively narrow uncertainty envelope which reflects that the uncertainty associated with igcms and bcms are not important in projecting seasonal cdfs of δ 18 op for cc in winter overall the igcms display slightly greater uncertainty than the bcms considering cdf of seasonal and regional δ 18 op the igcm uncertainties vary across sub regions and seasons depending on atmosphere circulation patterns for sc and cc the uncertainty of igcms is greater in summer than in winter in contrast for nc and nec the uncertainty present an opposite seasonal pattern this can be interpreted by different atmosphere circulation patterns for the sub regions the meteorology of eastern china is dominated by east asian monsoon westerly and polar air masses zhao et al 2012 the east asian monsoon dominates sc and cc in summer whereas westerly and polar air masses control nc and nec in winter the complicated movements of air masses contribute to difficulties in simulating isotopic signals under specific cases the total uncertainty of mean δ18op for each sub region and each season is disaggregated into three components by using the variance decomposition method the relative contribution of each uncertainty source to the total uncertainty is quantified and presented in table 4 results show that the choice of igcms made the greatest contribution to uncertainty in estimating δ18op whereas the bcms played a relatively smaller role this is consistent with the results from fig 7 but is different from results from figs 8 11 for example for nec in winter the uncertainty of bcms is near 0 in table 3 in fig 7 there is nearly no difference between two bcms in winter for nec however in figs 8 11 the uncertainty of bcms cannot be neglected in winter for nec the discordance is mainly attributed to different criteria or aspects of uncertainty table 3 and fig 7 presents the uncertainty in simulating mean δ18op while figs 8 11 shows the uncertainty in simulating quantiles of δ18op in table 3 it is also found that the contributions of interaction uncertainty between igcms and bcms are also generally greater than the contributions of the bcms temporally the uncertainty contributions of igcms in winter are bigger than those of in the other seasons the relative contributions of bcms are amplified in autumn for sc and cc comparing with the influence in other seasons because for sc and cc the δ18op is mainly influenced by the monsoon from the pacific ocean which usually happens in spring and summer wang and ho 2002 in winter siberian northwest winter monsoon affects the δ18op for sc and cc wu et al 2015 comparing to the atmospheric movement in spring summer and winter the atmospheric movement in autumn is simpler which reduces the difficulty in igcms simulations as such the uncertainty contributions of igcms simulations for sc and cc in autumn are lower and the relative contributions of bcms are higher than other seasons the effect of interaction between igcms and bcms is lower in winter all the year round 4 4 precipitation oxygen isoscape of eastern china the performance and uncertainty evaluation cover the common period 1979 2001 using gnip dataset as presented in section 4 2 the two bcms are able to correct the biases of igcms however their performances are slightly different for each sub region and season results also show that each igcm is capable of simulating poi with bias correction though certain differences exist among them thus the poi database is generated by averaging the poi based on the multi igcm and multi bcm ensemble as described in section 3 3 fig 12 compares mean seasonal observations averaged raw multi igcm simulations and averaged poi for the study area the raw simulations present similar spatial and temporal patterns of poi to observations however they generally underestimate the δ 18 op the biases are reduced by bias correction as shown in fig 12 c f i and l in eastern china the isotopic values of precipitation decrease with latitude all year round this spatial pattern can be explained by rayleigh distillation a slow process with immediate removal of the condensate as rain from the vapor bowen 2010 dansgaard 1964 yoshimura 2015 as latitude decreases temperature becomes higher the increasing temperature would evaporate more heavy isotope from liquid form leading to an increase in isotopic values of precipitation the positive relationship between δ 18 op and temperature is called temperature effect dansgaard 1964 sturm et al 2005 seasonality of the poi varies with different sub regions and is impacted by various factors for sc and cc δ 18 op in summer are more negative compared to those in other seasons the patterns of sc and cc are associated with the deep convection driven by the east asian monsoon vuille et al 2005 the traditional rayleigh distillation framework is not sufficient to interpret isotopic variations where most of the precipitation arises from deep convection and vertical motions dominate over horizontal transport the east asian monsoon weakens gradually as it extends northward and has little effect on the precipitation in nc and nec it brings moisture from the pacific ocean to eastern china and dominates sc and cc in summer araguás araguás et al 1998 the air mass from the pacific ocean is more isotopically depleted than those from sub regions sc and cc zhao et al 2012 the convergence with depleted air mass from the pacific ocean would undoubtedly dilute the content of isotope in precipitation for sc and cc besides when the convection becomes more intensive rain re evaporation is usually weaker and thus the rain drops become less enriched as they fall guy et al 2019 li et al 2016 the general trend of decreasing of δ 18 op with amount of precipitation increases which is contrary to temperature effect is named amount effect matsuyama et al 2005 rozanski et al 1993 for nc and nec the δ 18 op in winter shows more negative results than those of other seasons this temporal variation is correlated with the movement of westerly and polar air masses zhao et al 2012 which is much drier and enriched in precipitation comparing to the air masses from the pacific ocean tang et al 2017 no convergence with isotopically depleted air mass or strong convection happens in these sub regions the patterns for nc and nec are consistent with temperature effect which can be interpreted by rayleigh distillation theory furthermore the monthly corrected isotope data spanning the years 1958 through 2009 are provided in the supplement for the first time as a most comprehensive database for the east china region this study suggests strong potential of bias correcting igcms to provide detailed isotope data by making of limited observed data however the performance of bcms is evaluated based on sparse isotopic measurements no validation is done for nec in spring and winter due to lack of measured data the bcms would produce better datasets if more observed data are available for calibration besides climate change has its own decadal variability which would result in periodical changes of δ 18 op thus longer records of isotopic observations are needed to better calibrating or validating igcm output obviously more measured isotopic data are preferred for calibrating and validating bias correction methods the existing measurement technology is limited by low temporal resolution and high sample preparation efforts and costs allen et al 2018 braden behrens et al 2017 further improvement in techniques for measuring precipitation isotopic composition is clearly required when it comes to the uncertainty analysis the number of igcms involved is larger than the number of bcms the smaller sample size of bcms may underestimate the uncertainty envelope though the two chosen bcms cover the two common kinds of bcms conclusions might be different if more bcms are applied to investigate the uncertainty more work can be focused on involving more bcms to assess the uncertainty linked to bcms additionally the scale effect on bias correcting δ 18 op is neglected in this study for evaluating the performance and uncertainty of igcms even though the resolution of five igcms are different some might argue that the bias correction quality may be improved by finer resolutions of igcms however this scale effect may be negligible for a certain downscaling approach that directly maps climate model outputs at a grid box scale to station observations which was confirmed in chen et al 2014 the generated poi could improve our understanding of climate and hydrology science in climate science factors affecting the isotopic composition of a water mass can be explored by analyzing the relationships between poi and climatic variables based on influencing factors and isotopic composition of paleo records researchers could attempt to reconstruct paleo climatic variations clark and fritz 1997 lykoudis and argiriou 2007 in hydrology science poi can be used as tracers to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of water cycles isotopic fractionation varies during hydrological processes including convection evaporation concentration etc as such the signals of poi is applicable to quantify the contributions of evapotranspiration and advection flux to precipitation at different spatiotemporal scales sengupta and sarkar 2006 tian et al 2007 current isotopic observations are too limited to satisfy the climatic and hydrological needs of time space explicit dataset there are only 32 stations unevenly distributed in the study area liu et al 2014 besides most observational records are discontinuous and shorter than 6 years zhang and wang 2016 comparing to the station poi observations the generated poi in section 4 3 could provide a relatively dense network extending for several decades and permit investigation into hydrometeorology research for example inter annual precipitation sources can be partitioned with the produced poi but cannot be estimated with isotopic stations due to the scarcity of time explicit observations however the generated poi has two main limitations for further study one is the relatively low temporal resolution the generated poi is at a monthly scale so it cannot be used for daily precipitation events another limitation is the short time span the poi only covers the period from 1958 to 2009 and the isotopic database of the past decade are missing these limitations mainly result from the lack of observations to build the poi 5 conclusions this study analyzes the correlations between measured δ 18 op and modelled δ 18 op from igcms the strong correlations ensure the validity and applicability of bias correcting igcms to develop poi for the study region the performances of six igcm simulations free running cam2 hadam giss miroc as well as nudged giss and lmdz and two bcms ls and dt are evaluated using means and quantiles of δ 18 op as criteria results show that igcm simulations generally underestimate δ 18 op the biases in regional and seasonal δ 18 op are reduced by two bcms the ls method presents a similar performance with the dt method in projecting mean δ 18 op with regard to probability distributions the dt method performs better than the ls method uncertainty evaluation for the isoscape is estimated by combining results from an ensemble of six igcm simulations and two bcms the results indicate that the uncertainty linked to igcms dominates followed by uncertainty in the interaction between igcms and bmcs with the least associated with bcms to eliminate the biases caused by individual igcms or bcms a multi igcm and multi bcm approach is applied to generate the averaged poi for eastern china the corrected isoscape adequately represents the spatiotemporal pattern of isotopic measurements which can be obtained in the supplement in sc and cc the mean δ 18 op values in summer are lower than the values in other seasons in nc and nec the lowest δ 18 op values occur in winter these spatial and temporal patterns are consistent with atmospheric circulations overall combination of igcms and bcms can be a powerful tool to produce detailed and useful poi for use in characterizing hydrological processes and water cycles at large scales credit authorship contribution statement

5221,the macroscopic capillary length λ c is a fundamental soil parameter expressing the relative importance of the capillary over gravity forces during water movement in unsaturated soil in this investigation we propose a simple field method for estimating λ c using only a single ring infiltration experiment of the beerkan type and measurements of initial and saturated soil water contents we assumed that the intercept of the linear regression fitted to the steady state portion of the experimental infiltration curve could be used as a reliable predictor of λ c this hypothesis was validated by assessing the proposed calculation approach using both analytical and field data the analytical validation demonstrated that the proposed method was able to provide reliable λ c estimates over a wide range of soil textural characteristics and initial soil water contents the field testing was performed on a large database including 433 beerkan infiltration experiments with the 99 of the experiments yielding realistic λ c values the generated λ c values were then used in conjunction with four different methods for estimating saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks estimated ks values were close to those generated by a reference method with relative error 25 in nearly all cases by comparison assuming constant or soil dependent λ c values caused relative errors in ks of up to 600 altogether the proposed method constitutes an easy solution for estimating λ c which can improve our ability to estimate ks in the field keywords infiltration macroscopic capillary length beerkan ring infiltrometer hydraulic conductivity 1 introduction the macroscopic capillary length λ c l was first described by bouwer 1964 and expresses the relative importance of capillary over gravity forces during water movement in unsaturated soil raats 1976 more specifically low λ c values e g 0 λ c 10 mm indicate a dominance of gravity over capillarity and are typically found in coarse textured or highly structured porous media reynolds et al 2002 alternately high λ c values i e 1000 mm indicate dominance of capillarity over gravity as found in many fine textured or poorly structured porous media table 1 λ c can also be used to estimate the macroscopic pore radius i e the average radius of the pores that are active in flow via the young laplace equation kutilek and nielsen 1994 as suggested by roulier et al 2002 because it indicates soil capillarity λ c is included in many infiltrometer methods for calculating ks e g bagarello et al 2017 2014d 2004 elrick and reynolds 1992 nimmo et al 2009 reynolds and elrick 1990 stewart and abou najm 2018a wu et al 1999 it is thus important to accurately constrain λ c under field conditions previously developed methods to estimate λ c have all presented some limitations for instance the two ponding depths method by reynolds and elrick 1990 requires measuring steady state flow rates under two distinct water ponding conditions thus inducing considerable effort and experimental complexity bagarello et al 2013 proposed empirical equations to estimate λ c however those results were site specific and therefore lacked generality in addition those authors used the cumulative linearization method smiles and knight 1976 which can fail in the presence of layered media entrapped air and vertical soil water content gradients vandervaere et al 2000 other methods are based on the analysis of transient state data as for the case of the method 1 by wu et al 1999 and approach 2 by stewart and abou najm 2018a however these approaches require accurate characterization of the transient state which can be challenging under specific field conditions such as highly permeable slightly sorptive and water repellent soils di prima et al 2019 therefore alternative methods for estimating λ c from simple and replicable infiltration experiments have the potential to substantially reduce the amount of work necessary to accurately estimate soil hydraulic properties the first objective of this investigation was to validate a simple field method to estimate λ c that requires only a single ring infiltration experiment taken to steady state conditions lassabatere et al 2006 and estimates for initial and saturated soil water contents to meet this objective we first developed the theoretical analysis for the estimation of λ c from a single beerkan run we then validated the proposed method using analytically generated data involving soils with different texture and initial water contents and an empirical infiltration database that included data from 433 field measurements collected during previous investigations the second objective was to evaluate how λ c values generated by our approach affected predictions of ks from infiltration experiments here we used four different models to estimate ks from steady state infiltration and then compared those results with both reference values and with those estimated using constant and soil dependent λ c values 2 theory for water infiltrating into an unsaturated soil from a constant head source the soil matric flux potential ϕ m l2 t 1 is defined as gardner 1958 1a ϕ m h 0 h i k h d h h i h h 0 where k l t 1 is hydraulic conductivity and h l is water pressure head with an initial value hi l and a source pressure head h 0 l eq 1a simplifies to

difference between the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks l t 1 and the initial soil hydraulic conductivity ki l t 1 i e δk ks ki according to white and sully 1987 eq 2 can be rewritten as 3 λ c b s 2 δ θ δ k where b is a dimensionless constant dependent on the shape of the soil water diffusivity function s l t 0 5 is the soil sorptivity philip 1957 δθ stands for the difference between the saturated θ s l3 l 3 and initial θ i l3 l 3 volumetric soil water contents i e δθ θ s θ i for field soils b is commonly set equal to 0 55 even though it can theoretically vary from 1 2 to π 4 white and sully 1987 ki is often assumed negligible such that δk ks white and sully 1992 estimating λ c with eq 3 requires prior determination of sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity these quantities can be estimated thanks to water infiltration experiments and fitting to the quasi exact implicit qei model developed by haverkamp et al 1994 or its related approximate expansions see lassabatere et al 2009 for more details haverkamp et al 1994 proposed the following approximate expansion for the description of the steady state for three dimensional 3d water infiltration from a disc source while maintaining a zero water pressure head at the soil surface 4 i 3 d t k s γ s 2 r δ θ t s 2 2 1 β δ k l n 1 β where r l is the radius of the source and γ and β are two infiltration constants often

measurement of the initial and saturated soil water contents θ i and θ s indeed bs is calculated as the intercept of the linear regression fitted to the steady state portion of the experimental infiltration curve eq 5 so bs calculation does not require the use of eq 6b note that the simplified proposed method combines equations related to two approaches with distinct but not necessarily incompatible assumptions the first approach by white and sully 1987 was originally developed assuming the gardner 1958 model for the hydraulic conductivity function the second approach developed by haverkamp et al 1994 and smettem et al 1994 does not expect any specific hydraulic functions but requires that these functions follow a specific equation defining the infiltration constant β equation 6 in haverkamp et al 1994 eq 9 may also simplify and improve estimates for ks as λ c is an important and often unknown parameter in many infiltration models four examples of methods that require λ c

as suggested by reynolds and elrick 2002 3 material and methods 3 1 analytically generated data we assessed the accuracy of the proposed calculation approach for λ c and ks by using the same six soils considered by hinnell et al 2009 and bagarello et al 2017 sand loamy sand sandy loam loam silt loam silty clay loam these soils were chosen to cover a wide range of hydraulic responses we modelled the infiltration experiments for these synthetic soils using the infiltration model proposed by smettem et al 1994 14 i t i 1 d t γ s 2 r d δ θ where i l is 3d cumulative infiltration and i 1d l is the 1d

related to the water pressure head n is the pore size distribution index and l is the pore connectivity parameter which we assumed to be 0 5 following mualem 1976 hydraulic parameters for the six synthetic soils were taken from carsel and parrish 1988 with ks values reported in that text used to represent the reference saturated hydraulic conductivity table 2 default values of β 0 6 and γ 0 75 were assumed as commonly suggested by many investigations angulo jaramillo et al 2019 to ensure steady state conditions each infiltration process was modelled for a period three times longer than the maximum time for which the explicit short term expansion of eq 15 haverkamp et al 1994 is considered valid with tmax t calculated as follows lassabatere et al 2006 18a t max 1 4 1 b 2 s k s 2 18b b 2 β 3 1 k i k s k i k s these analytical data were used to estimate the intercept bs l and the slope is l t 1 by linear regression analysis of the last three data points of the cumulative infiltration time series then we defined the estimator for λ c λ c using eq 9 and the estimator for ks k s via the standard predictive equations for ks eqs 10 13 the reference macroscopic capillary length λc was calculated for each combination of soil type and initial se value using eq 2 relative error er was then calculated for each estimated value for λ c and k s compared to the corresponding reference value i e λ c and k s as follows 19 e r x 100 x x x where x is the estimated value and x is the target i e the reference value λ c eq 2 or ks table 2 according to the accuracy criterion by reynolds 2013 the estimates were deemed accurate when they fell within the range 0 75 x x 1 25 i e 25 error this stringent criterion was used because the parameters were estimated by analytically generated data and therefore were free of the perturbations embedded in field and laboratory measurements e g measurement error random noise and natural variability 3 2 the beerkan infiltration database in this investigation we also considered a large database of single ring beerkan infiltration experiments carried out in four different countries italy burundi france and spain during the period 2010 2017 table 3 nearly half of the runs were carried out in sicily italy 202 out of 433 and another 1 3 of the runs 152 out of 433 were carried out in burundi in the african great lakes region the tested soils covered a range of textures from sandy to clayey fig 1 the beerkan experiment is a variation of the single ring infiltrometer technique which consists of infiltrating water through a ring inserted shallowly e g 1 cm into the soil with a quasi zero head of water imposed on the soil surface braud et al 2005 all beerkan experiments were carried out according to the methodology described by lassabatere et al 2006 first a stainless steel ring was inserted shallowly into the soil 1 cm then water was poured on the confined soil surface in fixed volume increments v to establish and maintain ponding conditions the increments v ranged from 17 to 800 ml depending on ring diameter table 3 the energy of the falling water was dissipated with fingers to minimize the soil disturbance owing to water pouring as commonly suggested e g di prima et al 2019 for each poured volume the time needed for the water to infiltrate was recorded the total number of poured volumes varied depending on time needed to reach steady state as required by the beerkan method angulo jaramillo et al 2019 we then estimated the intercept bs mm and the slope is mm h 1 of the regression line fitted to the cumulative infiltration time series the final three data points were used as those were assumed to represent steady state infiltration conditions we estimated ks by using eqs 10 13 and constraining λ c through three different approaches scenario 1 determining λ c through eq 9 scenario 2 using λ c 83 mm taking into account that it represents the suggested first approximation value for most field soils elrick and reynolds 1992 scenario 3 using a soil dependent λ c value according to table 1 specifically we used λ c 250 mm for soils with sand content 20 83 mm for sand contents between 20 and 70 and 28 mm when the soil had 70 sand bagarello et al 2017 for the experimental dataset the comparison of the estimator to the target is not possible indeed we don t have any information on the real value of the macroscopic capillary length given that previously developed methods to estimate λ c have all presented some limitations as discussed in the introduction instead we compared the estimates to representative values from the five soil capillarity categories suggested by elrick and reynolds 1992 note that these categories were originally proposed to select a representative value for five soil texture structure categories table 1 when calculating ks by the opd method angulo jaramillo et al 2016 in this investigation we also proposed range of values for each category as detailed in table 1 the range values of the intermediate categories strong moderate and weak were calculated as the mean of the representative values of two consecutive categories the same issue arises for the estimation of the saturated hydraulic conductivity in this case we chose to use the best steady method proposed by bagarello et al 2014c as a benchmark as an independent ks datum that can be used for assessing simplified procedures or validating newly developed methods this method estimates ks as follows 20a k s b e s t c i s a b s c 20b a γ r θ s θ i note that we also chose the bagarello et al 2014c method because it requires the same experimental information as the λ c dependent methods considered in this investigation for estimating ks yet does not require an estimate of λ c we also avoided using laboratory measurements as benchmark as they can induce experimental artifacts such as soil compaction and samples biased by pores that may limit their comparability with in situ measurements haverkamp et al 1999 to compare ks values estimated by eqs 10 13 with the reference ks best values obtained by eq 20 we again used the relative error metric eq 19 we also calculated paired differences for each method i e ks best ks and checked them for normality using the kolmogorov smirnov test for non normally distributed data we used the wilcoxon signed rank test to evaluate the median difference between paired observations at the 95 confidence level all statistical analyses were carried out using the minitab computer program minitab inc state college pa usa 4 results 4 1 analytical validation 4 1 1 estimating λ c from analytically generated data when applied to the six synthetic soils eq 2 yielded the highest λ c values for fine textured soils table 4 this is logical since for fine soils the capillary contribution to water flow was higher than for coarser soils more specifically high λ c values were associated to initially flat k h relationships i e when a decrease in pressure head determined a moderate pore emptying angulo jaramillo et al 2016 reynolds 1994 moreover λ c values decreased for all soils as se increased when cumulative infiltration was calculated for all synthetic soils table 2 using eqs 14 and 15 all curves exhibited a typical concave shape as a function of time fig 2 as the process approached steady state cumulative infiltration curves became approximately linear with time this behaviour shows how the influence of capillarity decreases as the wetting front moves away from the source and the hydraulic gradient decreases xu et al 2012 note that the duration of the infiltration process decreased for higher values of se as steady state conditions were attained in less time in these cases capillary forces only influenced infiltration during the early stage of the process the value of the linear regression model intercept bs estimated from each curve was used in conjunction with the known θ i and θ s values to calculate λ c using eq 9 both bs and is decreased in all soils as se increased bs ranged from 3 1 to 35 1 mm with larger values corresponding to the fine textured silt loam and silty clay loam soils table 4 the slope of the linear regression model is had values as low as 1 7 mm h 1 fine soil and as high as 516 7 mm h 1 coarse soil the estimated λ c for the six synthetic soils ranged from 36 3 to 87 8 mm and were classified only into weak or moderate capillary categories table 1 although those soils had textures which ranged from sand to silty clay loam relative error er λ c between estimated λ c and reference λ c values ranged from 7 9 to 23 3 indicating that all λ c values were accurate based on our stated criterion the largest er λ c values were obtained for the coarse textured sandy and loamy sand soils under initial wet conditions fig 3 indeed neglecting ki is expected to introduce more uncertainty on λ c estimations for higher se values nevertheless λ c estimates were sufficiently accurate also in these cases with error always 25 4 1 2 estimating ks from analytically generated data the values of the slope is estimated from the analytically generated curves were used to calculate ks by the four λ c dependent methods i e opd eq 10 wu2 eq 11 ssbi eq 12 a4 eq 13 then relative error er ks was calculated using eq 14 fig 4 er ks ranged from 9 5 to 3 1 for opd from 5 4 to 7 4 for wu2 from 2 2 to 24 7 for ssbi and from 14 to 2 4 for a4 while we observe higher er λ c values for initial wet conditions fig 3 for ks we observe similar trends between the four methods but also a consistent vertical shift of the er ks values fig 4 for instance for the ssbi method lower errors corresponded to higher se values conversely for the a4 method the errors always increased for increasing se values given that this method always underestimated ks we therefore argue that the discrepancies between the four methods were more relevant than the variations within a specific method due to different initial saturation degree nevertheless the four methods always yielded ks estimates close to the reference values since er ks values were always 25 mean er ks values were ordered as opd a4 wu2 ssbi showing that the opd method yielded the lower er ks values 4 2 field testing 4 2 1 estimating λ c from the beerkan infiltration database eq 9 was also used to estimate λ c from the field based single ring beerkan infiltration experiments the procedure worked for nearly all beerkan tests however six of the tests had infiltration rates that increased with time i e the cumulative infiltration curves exhibited convex shapes fitting eq 5 to those data yielded negative value for the intercept bs which led to negative values for λ c which is meaningless from a physical point of view those six cases two at the kinyami site one at the palermo saaf site and three at the crépieux charmy site were excluded from subsequent analysis the remaining 427 successful tests yielded λ c values ranging from 1 5 to 737 7 mm table 5 thus covering the full range of soil capillarity categories suggested by elrick and reynolds 1992 table 1 across all soils there was a consistent yet non linear relationship between λ c values and their corresponding intercepts bs fig 5 a as shown by three different examples of λ c estimation cumulative infiltration shapes and times to steady state conditions varied widely between soils with moderate fig 5b strong fig 5c and negligible capillarity fig 5d in the first case fig 5b cumulative infiltration exhibited the typical concave shape as a function of time for this run we estimated bs value of 30 9 mm and a λ c value of 49 2 mm moderate capillarity in the second case fig 5c the cumulative infiltration curve exhibited a strong concave shape with a bs value of 209 6 mm yielding a λ c value of 598 7 mm strong capillarity this behavior is typical for very fine soils with low permeability for this run capillary forces predominated for almost the entire duration of the experiment in the third case fig 5d the cumulative infiltration curve had an almost linear shape with a bs value of 1 0 mm which translated to a λ c value of 1 5 mm i e lower than the considered threshold of 10 mm for negligible capillarity forces this behaviour is typical for coarse textured soils and occurs when the infiltration process is mainly driven by gravity altogether 127 29 7 of the λ c values represented strong capillarity conditions 189 values 44 3 represented moderate capillarity 107 values 25 1 represented weak capillary and 4 values 0 9 represented negligible capillarity 4 2 2 estimating ks from the beerkan infiltration database the λ c values determined through eq 9 were next used with four methods i e opd wu2 ssbi a4 to estimate ks for the beerkan dataset the wilcoxon signed rank test showed that all methods yielded ks estimates significantly different from the best steady values and the differences between ks and ks best were always non normally distributed according to the kolmogorov smirnov test however the discrepancies between methods were always 25 with the exception of the ssbi method fig 6 a the wu2 method yielded the best overall fit with the best steady values with er ks values between 12 1 and 22 1 the wu2 method yielded lower ks estimates than the best estimated values for 76 of the runs and higher ks values for 24 of runs and the median ks values for the two methods differed by only a factor of 1 002 the opd and a4 methods also performed well though those methods tended to under predict ks to a greater extent than wu2 with 82 of opd runs and 91 of a4 runs under predicting ks the ssbi method by contrast yielded ks values that were higher than ks best with only a single exception the er ks values ranged from 1 0 to 32 8 with 21 of the runs 88 out of 427 yielding higher values than the considered threshold of 25 using constant scenario 2 or a soil dependent scenario 3 λ c values resulted in greater difference between ks and ks best with the constant λ c value scenario 2 er ks values ranged from 66 8 to 576 9 fig 6b with 68 4 of opd runs 68 1 of wu2 runs 55 7 of ssbi runs and 72 1 of a4 runs yielding higher values than the considered threshold of 25 with the soil dependent λ c values scenario 3 er ks values ranged from 82 9 to 486 5 fig 6c with 70 5 of opd runs 69 3 of wu2 runs 62 3 of ssbi runs and 74 0 of a4 runs yielding higher values than the considered threshold these results also suggest that among the four considered methods the ssbi was the least sensitive to the assumed λ c value with less runs 55 7 and 62 3 for scenario 2 and 3 respectively yielding higher er ks values than the considered threshold of 25 5 discussion in this investigation we developed a new procedure to estimate λ c using simple beerkan infiltration experiments and measurements of initial and saturated soil water contents eq 9 previous investigations also suggested that the measured infiltration curve contains the necessary information to estimate λ c bagarello et al 2014d 2013 stewart and abou najm 2018a wu et al 1999 however those methods are based on the analysis of the transient infiltration process and can be subject to considerable error particularly due to uncertainties with the duration of the transient phase vandervaere et al 2000 in contrast the proposed method uses measurements collected during the steady state stage of the infiltration process where the infiltration rate is is assumed to be independent of the initial infiltration phase bagarello et al 2013 estimating λ c using the proposed method requires linear regression analysis of cumulative infiltration versus time to determine the intercept bs because the magnitude of bs depends on the entire cumulative infiltration curve including the transient phase that term is sensitive to the relative importance of capillary and gravity forces during ponded infiltration angulo jaramillo et al 2019 specifically small bs values indicate a linear infiltration curve i e when gravity prevails over capillarity which occurs primarily in coarse textured and or highly structured porous media on the contrary high intercept values indicate conditions when capillarity prevails over gravity particularly in the transient infiltration phase which occurs primarily in fine textured soils therefore bs is expected to be a reliable predictor of the macroscopic capillary length but one that necessitates collecting accurate data during the final stage of the infiltration process in this investigation the proposed method eq 9 was validated using both analytical and field data the analytical verification demonstrated that eq 9 provided reliable λ c estimates in nearly all conditions including different soils and for the same soils under different initial soil water contents for the field data verification was conducted using a set of 427 beerkan infiltration experiments carried out on different soils having a range of textural characteristics i e from sandy to clayey that analysis showed that nearly all soils i e 99 1 of the experiments yielded λ c values falling within the realistic range 10 λ c 1000 mm reynolds and elrick 2002 only four cases yielded λ c values lower than 10 mm further the proposed method predicted λ c values very close to the reference λ c values with all tests having relative errors between 23 2 and 7 9 the consistency of eq 9 shows that it is a suitable method to constrain λ c many models to estimate ks from field measurements e g eqs 10 13 require knowledge of λ c which is often estimated based on general descriptions of soil textural and structural characteristics e g table 1 previous research has shown that choosing an incorrect capillarity category can lead to threefold or greater error in estimated ks bagarello et al 2014d and that ks estimates are more sensitive to underpredictions of λ c compared with overpredictions stewart and abou najm 2018b in this investigation we demonstrated that using constant or a soil dependent λ c value may result in considerably greater relative error when predicting ks specifically using eq 9 resulted in relative errors 25 for all beerkan tests when analyzed with three of the four methods and 30 when the fourth method was used by comparison assuming λ c 83 mm resulted in relative error up to 600 and using a soil dependent λ c value caused relative errors of close to 500 beyond its use in estimating ks λ c can provide information on soil pore structure and water retention stewart and abou najm 2018b making it important to have a simple method for use in the field for example the proposed method for constraining λ c may also facilitate the estimation of dynamic indicators such as the flow weighted mean pore radius and the number of hydraulically active pores per unit area previously proposed by warrick and broadbridge 1992 and watson and luxmoore 1986 the flow weighted mean pore radius represents the size of pores that are actively conducting and it expresses the ability of a soil to transmit water reynolds and elrick 2005 these indicators quantitatively linked to λ c and ks are useful to understand the effects of land use and management on soil physical quality bouarafa et al 2019 castellini et al 2019 iovino et al 2016 therefore accurate estimation of λ c through eq 9 could also facilitate determination of dynamic indicators from infiltration experiments and improve soil quality assessment 6 summary and conclusions in this investigation we assessed a simple field method for estimating the macroscopic capillary length λ c by only using a single ring infiltration experiment of the beerkan type and a measurement of the initial and saturated soil water contents we validated the proposed method using both analytically generated data and a large database of 433 beerkan infiltration experiments carried out in four countries italy burundi france and spain over the period 2010 2017 the analytical validation supported our hypothesis that the intercept bs is a reliable predictor of the macroscopic capillary length while the testing carried out using the beerkan database increased our confidence that the approach performs well under field conditions therefore we conclude that the method proposed here constitutes an easy and effective solution for constraining λ c which at the same time can help users to better estimate ks from field infiltration measurements the proposed procedure may also avoid uncertainty due to an imprecise description of the transient state of infiltration and any subjectivity caused by the selection of a representative λ c value based solely on textural or structural characteristics funding this work was supported through i the

5221,the macroscopic capillary length λ c is a fundamental soil parameter expressing the relative importance of the capillary over gravity forces during water movement in unsaturated soil in this investigation we propose a simple field method for estimating λ c using only a single ring infiltration experiment of the beerkan type and measurements of initial and saturated soil water contents we assumed that the intercept of the linear regression fitted to the steady state portion of the experimental infiltration curve could be used as a reliable predictor of λ c this hypothesis was validated by assessing the proposed calculation approach using both analytical and field data the analytical validation demonstrated that the proposed method was able to provide reliable λ c estimates over a wide range of soil textural characteristics and initial soil water contents the field testing was performed on a large database including 433 beerkan infiltration experiments with the 99 of the experiments yielding realistic λ c values the generated λ c values were then used in conjunction with four different methods for estimating saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks estimated ks values were close to those generated by a reference method with relative error 25 in nearly all cases by comparison assuming constant or soil dependent λ c values caused relative errors in ks of up to 600 altogether the proposed method constitutes an easy solution for estimating λ c which can improve our ability to estimate ks in the field keywords infiltration macroscopic capillary length beerkan ring infiltrometer hydraulic conductivity 1 introduction the macroscopic capillary length λ c l was first described by bouwer 1964 and expresses the relative importance of capillary over gravity forces during water movement in unsaturated soil raats 1976 more specifically low λ c values e g 0 λ c 10 mm indicate a dominance of gravity over capillarity and are typically found in coarse textured or highly structured porous media reynolds et al 2002 alternately high λ c values i e 1000 mm indicate dominance of capillarity over gravity as found in many fine textured or poorly structured porous media table 1 λ c can also be used to estimate the macroscopic pore radius i e the average radius of the pores that are active in flow via the young laplace equation kutilek and nielsen 1994 as suggested by roulier et al 2002 because it indicates soil capillarity λ c is included in many infiltrometer methods for calculating ks e g bagarello et al 2017 2014d 2004 elrick and reynolds 1992 nimmo et al 2009 reynolds and elrick 1990 stewart and abou najm 2018a wu et al 1999 it is thus important to accurately constrain λ c under field conditions previously developed methods to estimate λ c have all presented some limitations for instance the two ponding depths method by reynolds and elrick 1990 requires measuring steady state flow rates under two distinct water ponding conditions thus inducing considerable effort and experimental complexity bagarello et al 2013 proposed empirical equations to estimate λ c however those results were site specific and therefore lacked generality in addition those authors used the cumulative linearization method smiles and knight 1976 which can fail in the presence of layered media entrapped air and vertical soil water content gradients vandervaere et al 2000 other methods are based on the analysis of transient state data as for the case of the method 1 by wu et al 1999 and approach 2 by stewart and abou najm 2018a however these approaches require accurate characterization of the transient state which can be challenging under specific field conditions such as highly permeable slightly sorptive and water repellent soils di prima et al 2019 therefore alternative methods for estimating λ c from simple and replicable infiltration experiments have the potential to substantially reduce the amount of work necessary to accurately estimate soil hydraulic properties the first objective of this investigation was to validate a simple field method to estimate λ c that requires only a single ring infiltration experiment taken to steady state conditions lassabatere et al 2006 and estimates for initial and saturated soil water contents to meet this objective we first developed the theoretical analysis for the estimation of λ c from a single beerkan run we then validated the proposed method using analytically generated data involving soils with different texture and initial water contents and an empirical infiltration database that included data from 433 field measurements collected during previous investigations the second objective was to evaluate how λ c values generated by our approach affected predictions of ks from infiltration experiments here we used four different models to estimate ks from steady state infiltration and then compared those results with both reference values and with those estimated using constant and soil dependent λ c values 2 theory for water infiltrating into an unsaturated soil from a constant head source the soil matric flux potential ϕ m l2 t 1 is defined as gardner 1958 1a ϕ m h 0 h i k h d h h i h h 0 where k l t 1 is hydraulic conductivity and h l is water pressure head with an initial value hi l and a source pressure head h 0 l eq 1a simplifies to eq 1b when water infiltrates from a ponded source 1b ϕ m 0 h i k h d h h i h 0 the macroscopic capillary length λ c l is defined as philip 1985 smith et al 2002 2 λ c ϕ m δ k where δk represents the difference between the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks l t 1 and the initial soil hydraulic conductivity ki l t 1 i e δk ks ki according to white and sully 1987 eq 2 can be rewritten as 3 λ c b s 2 δ θ δ k where b is a dimensionless constant dependent on the shape of the soil water diffusivity function s l t 0 5 is the soil sorptivity philip 1957 δθ stands for the difference between the saturated θ s l3 l 3 and initial θ i l3 l 3 volumetric soil water contents i e δθ θ s θ i for field soils b is commonly set equal to 0 55 even though it can theoretically vary from 1 2 to π 4 white and sully 1987 ki is often assumed negligible such that δk ks white and sully 1992 estimating λ c with eq 3 requires prior determination of sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity these quantities can be estimated thanks to water infiltration experiments and fitting to the quasi exact implicit qei model developed by haverkamp et al 1994 or its related approximate expansions see lassabatere et al 2009 for more details haverkamp et al 1994 proposed the following approximate expansion for the description of the steady state for three dimensional 3d water infiltration from a disc source while maintaining a zero water pressure head at the soil surface 4 i 3 d t k s γ s 2 r δ θ t s 2 2 1 β δ k l n 1 β where r l is the radius of the source and γ and β are two infiltration constants often fixed at γ 0 75 and β 0 6 haverkamp et al 1994 eq 4 was later extended to include infiltration experiments from cylindrical sources with a slightly ponded water source ross et al 1996 with negligible effect on results eq 4 is a linear equation of the form 5 i 3 d t i s t b s with bs l and is l t 1 defined as functions of hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity as follows 6a i s k s γ s 2 r δ θ 6b b

8b can be simplified as follows 9 λ c 0 861 b s δ θ eq 9 constitutes a considerable simplification as λ c can now be estimated by only using the steady state infiltration data to determine bs and a measurement of the initial and saturated soil water contents θ i and θ s indeed bs is calculated as the intercept of the linear regression fitted to the steady state portion of the experimental infiltration curve eq 5 so bs calculation does not require the use of eq 6b note that the simplified proposed method combines equations related to two approaches with distinct but not necessarily incompatible assumptions the first approach by white and sully 1987 was originally developed assuming the gardner 1958 model for the hydraulic conductivity function the second approach developed by haverkamp et al 1994 and smettem et al 1994 does not expect any specific hydraulic functions but requires that these functions follow a specific equation defining the infiltration constant β equation

as suggested by reynolds and elrick 2002 3 material and methods 3 1 analytically generated data we assessed the accuracy of the proposed calculation approach for λ c and ks by using the same six soils considered by hinnell et al 2009 and bagarello et al 2017 sand loamy sand sandy loam loam silt loam silty clay loam these soils were chosen to cover a wide range of hydraulic responses we modelled the infiltration experiments for these synthetic soils using the infiltration model proposed by smettem et al 1994 14 i t i 1 d t γ s 2 r d δ θ where i l is 3d cumulative infiltration and i 1d l is the 1d

related to the water pressure head n is the pore size distribution index and l is the pore connectivity parameter which we assumed to be 0 5 following mualem 1976 hydraulic parameters for the six synthetic soils were taken from carsel and parrish 1988 with ks values reported in that text used to represent the reference saturated hydraulic conductivity table 2 default values of β 0 6 and γ 0 75 were assumed as commonly suggested by many investigations angulo jaramillo et al 2019 to ensure steady state conditions each infiltration process was modelled for a period three times longer than the maximum time for which the explicit short term expansion of eq 15 haverkamp et al 1994 is considered valid with tmax t calculated as follows lassabatere et al 2006 18a t max 1 4 1 b 2 s k s 2 18b b 2 β 3 1 k i k s k i k s these analytical data were used to estimate the intercept bs l and the slope is l t 1 by linear regression analysis of the last three data points of the cumulative infiltration time series then we defined the estimator for λ c λ c using eq 9 and the estimator for ks k s via the standard predictive equations for ks eqs 10 13 the reference macroscopic capillary length λc was calculated for each combination of soil type and initial se value using eq 2 relative error er was then calculated for each estimated value for λ c and k s compared to the corresponding reference value i e λ c and k s as follows 19 e r x 100 x x x where x is the estimated value and x is the target i e the reference value λ c eq 2 or ks table 2 according to the accuracy criterion by reynolds 2013 the estimates were deemed accurate when they fell within the range 0 75 x x 1 25 i e 25 error this stringent criterion was used because the parameters were estimated by analytically generated data and therefore were free of the perturbations embedded in field and laboratory measurements e g measurement error random noise and natural variability 3 2 the beerkan infiltration database in this investigation we also considered a large database of single ring beerkan infiltration experiments carried out in four different countries italy burundi france and spain during the period 2010 2017 table 3 nearly half of the runs were carried out in sicily italy 202 out of 433 and another 1 3 of the runs 152 out of 433 were carried out in burundi in the african great lakes region the tested soils covered a range of textures from sandy to clayey fig 1 the beerkan experiment is a variation of the single ring infiltrometer technique which consists of infiltrating water through a ring inserted shallowly e g 1 cm into the soil with a quasi zero head of water imposed on the soil surface braud et al 2005 all beerkan experiments were carried out according to the methodology described by lassabatere et al 2006 first a stainless steel ring was inserted shallowly into the soil 1 cm then water was poured on the confined soil surface in fixed volume increments v to establish and maintain ponding conditions the increments v ranged from 17 to 800 ml depending on ring diameter table 3 the energy of the falling water was dissipated with fingers to minimize the soil disturbance owing to water pouring as commonly suggested e g di prima et al 2019 for each poured volume the time needed for the water to infiltrate was recorded the total number of poured volumes varied depending on time needed to reach steady state as required by the beerkan method angulo jaramillo et al 2019 we then estimated the intercept bs mm and the slope is mm h 1 of the regression line fitted to the cumulative infiltration time series the final three data points were used as those were assumed to represent steady state infiltration conditions we estimated ks by using eqs 10 13 and constraining λ c through three different approaches scenario 1 determining λ c through eq 9 scenario 2 using λ c 83 mm taking into account that it represents the suggested first approximation value for most field soils elrick and reynolds 1992 scenario 3 using a soil dependent λ c value according to table 1 specifically we used λ c 250 mm for soils with sand content 20 83 mm for sand contents between 20 and 70 and 28 mm when the soil had 70 sand bagarello et al 2017 for the experimental dataset the comparison of the estimator to the target is not possible indeed we don t have any information on the real value of the macroscopic capillary length given that previously developed methods to estimate λ c have all presented some limitations as discussed in the introduction instead we compared the estimates to representative values from the five soil capillarity categories suggested by elrick and reynolds 1992 note that these categories were originally proposed to select a representative value for five soil texture structure categories table 1 when calculating ks by the opd method angulo jaramillo et al 2016 in this investigation we also proposed range of values for each category as detailed in table 1 the range values of the intermediate categories strong moderate and weak were calculated as the mean of the representative values of two consecutive categories the same issue arises for the estimation of the saturated hydraulic conductivity in this case we chose to use the best steady method proposed by bagarello et al 2014c as a benchmark as an independent ks datum that can be used for assessing simplified procedures or validating newly developed methods this method estimates ks as follows 20a k s b e s t c i s a b s c 20b a γ r θ s θ i note that we also chose the bagarello et al 2014c method because it requires the same experimental information as the λ c dependent methods considered in this investigation for estimating ks yet does not require an estimate of λ c we also avoided using laboratory measurements as benchmark as they can induce experimental artifacts such as soil compaction and samples biased by pores that may limit their comparability with in situ measurements haverkamp et al 1999 to compare ks values estimated by eqs 10 13 with the reference ks best values obtained by eq 20 we again used the relative error metric eq 19 we also calculated paired differences for each method i e ks best ks and checked them for normality using the kolmogorov smirnov test for non normally distributed data we used the wilcoxon signed rank test to evaluate the median difference between paired observations at the 95 confidence level all statistical analyses were carried out using the minitab computer program minitab inc state college pa usa 4 results 4 1 analytical validation 4 1 1 estimating λ c from analytically generated data when applied to the six synthetic soils eq 2 yielded the highest λ c values for fine textured soils table 4 this is logical since for fine soils the capillary contribution to water flow was higher than for coarser soils more specifically high λ c values were associated to initially flat k h relationships i e when a decrease in pressure head determined a moderate pore emptying angulo jaramillo et al 2016 reynolds 1994 moreover λ c values decreased for all soils as se increased when cumulative infiltration was calculated for all synthetic soils table 2 using eqs 14 and 15 all curves exhibited a typical concave shape as a function of time fig 2 as the process approached steady state cumulative infiltration curves became approximately linear with time this behaviour shows how the influence of capillarity decreases as the wetting front moves away from the source and the hydraulic gradient decreases xu et al 2012 note that the duration of the infiltration process decreased for higher values of se as steady state conditions were attained in less time in these cases capillary forces only influenced infiltration during the early stage of the process the value of the linear regression model intercept bs estimated from each curve was used in conjunction with the known θ i and θ s values to calculate λ c using eq 9 both bs and is decreased in all soils as se increased bs ranged from 3 1 to 35 1 mm with larger values corresponding to the fine textured silt loam and silty clay loam soils table 4 the slope of the linear regression model is had values as low as 1 7 mm h 1 fine soil and as high as 516 7 mm h 1 coarse soil the estimated λ c for the six synthetic soils ranged from 36 3 to 87 8 mm and were classified only into weak or moderate capillary categories table 1 although those soils had textures which ranged from sand to silty clay loam relative error er λ c between estimated λ c and reference λ c values ranged from 7 9 to 23 3 indicating that all λ c values were accurate based on our stated criterion the largest er λ c values were obtained for the coarse textured sandy and loamy sand soils under initial wet conditions fig 3 indeed neglecting ki is expected to introduce more uncertainty on λ c estimations for higher se values nevertheless λ c estimates were sufficiently accurate also in these cases with error always 25 4 1 2 estimating ks from analytically generated data the values of the slope is estimated from the analytically generated curves were used to calculate ks by the four λ c dependent methods i e opd eq 10 wu2 eq 11 ssbi eq 12 a4 eq 13 then relative error er ks was calculated using eq 14 fig 4 er ks ranged from 9 5 to 3 1 for opd from 5 4 to 7 4 for wu2 from 2 2 to 24 7 for ssbi and from 14 to 2 4 for a4 while we observe higher er λ c values for initial wet conditions fig 3 for ks we observe similar trends between the four methods but also a consistent vertical shift of the er ks values fig 4 for instance for the ssbi method lower errors corresponded to higher se values conversely for the a4 method the errors always increased for increasing se values given that this method always underestimated ks we therefore argue that the discrepancies between the four methods were more relevant than the variations within a specific method due to different initial saturation degree nevertheless the four methods always yielded ks estimates close to the reference values since er ks values were always 25 mean er ks values were ordered as opd a4 wu2 ssbi showing that the opd method yielded the lower er ks values 4 2 field testing 4 2 1 estimating λ c from the beerkan infiltration database eq 9 was also used to estimate λ c from the field based single ring beerkan infiltration experiments the procedure worked for nearly all beerkan tests however six of the tests had infiltration rates that increased with time i e the cumulative infiltration curves exhibited convex shapes fitting eq 5 to those data yielded negative value for the intercept bs which led to negative values for λ c which is meaningless from a physical point of view those six cases two at the kinyami site one at the palermo saaf site and three at the crépieux charmy site were excluded from subsequent analysis the remaining 427 successful tests yielded λ c values ranging from 1 5 to 737 7 mm table 5 thus covering the full range of soil capillarity categories suggested by elrick and reynolds 1992 table 1 across all soils there was a consistent yet non linear relationship between λ c values and their corresponding intercepts bs fig 5 a as shown by three different examples of λ c estimation cumulative infiltration shapes and times to steady state conditions varied widely between soils with moderate fig 5b strong fig 5c and negligible capillarity fig 5d in the first case fig 5b cumulative infiltration exhibited the typical concave shape as a function of time for this run we estimated bs value of 30 9 mm and a λ c value of 49 2 mm moderate capillarity in the second case fig 5c the cumulative infiltration curve exhibited a strong concave shape with a bs value of 209 6 mm yielding a λ c value of 598 7 mm strong capillarity this behavior is typical for very fine soils with low permeability for this run capillary forces predominated for almost the entire duration of the experiment in the third case fig 5d the cumulative infiltration curve had an almost linear shape with a bs value of 1 0 mm which translated to a λ c value of 1 5 mm i e lower than the considered threshold of 10 mm for negligible capillarity forces this behaviour is typical for coarse textured soils and occurs when the infiltration process is mainly driven by gravity altogether 127 29 7 of the λ c values represented strong capillarity conditions 189 values 44 3 represented moderate capillarity 107 values 25 1 represented weak capillary and 4 values 0 9 represented negligible capillarity 4 2 2 estimating ks from the beerkan infiltration database the λ c values determined through eq 9 were next used with four methods i e opd wu2 ssbi a4 to estimate ks for the beerkan dataset the wilcoxon signed rank test showed that all methods yielded ks estimates significantly different from the best steady values and the differences between ks and ks best were always non normally distributed according to the kolmogorov smirnov test however the discrepancies between methods were always 25 with the exception of the ssbi method fig 6 a the wu2 method yielded the best overall fit with the best steady values with er ks values between 12 1 and 22 1 the wu2 method yielded lower ks estimates than the best estimated values for 76 of the runs and higher ks values for 24 of runs and the median ks values for the two methods differed by only a factor of 1 002 the opd and a4 methods also performed well though those methods tended to under predict ks to a greater extent than wu2 with 82 of opd runs and 91 of a4 runs under predicting ks the ssbi method by contrast yielded ks values that were higher than ks best with only a single exception the er ks values ranged from 1 0 to 32 8 with 21 of the runs 88 out of 427 yielding higher values than the considered threshold of 25 using constant scenario 2 or a soil dependent scenario 3 λ c values resulted in greater difference between ks and ks best with the constant λ c value scenario 2 er ks values ranged from 66 8 to 576 9 fig 6b with 68 4 of opd runs 68 1 of wu2 runs 55 7 of ssbi runs and 72 1 of a4 runs yielding higher values than the considered threshold of 25 with the soil dependent λ c values scenario 3 er ks values ranged from 82 9 to 486 5 fig 6c with 70 5 of opd runs 69 3 of wu2 runs 62 3 of ssbi runs and 74 0 of a4 runs yielding higher values than the considered threshold these results also suggest that among the four considered methods the ssbi was the least sensitive to the assumed λ c value with less runs 55 7 and 62 3 for scenario 2 and 3 respectively yielding higher er ks values than the considered threshold of 25 5 discussion in this investigation we developed a new procedure to estimate λ c using simple beerkan infiltration experiments and measurements of initial and saturated soil water contents eq 9 previous investigations also suggested that the measured infiltration curve contains the necessary information to estimate λ c bagarello et al 2014d 2013 stewart and abou najm 2018a wu et al 1999 however those methods are based on the analysis of the transient infiltration process and can be subject to considerable error particularly due to uncertainties with the duration of the transient phase vandervaere et al 2000 in contrast the proposed method uses measurements collected during the steady state stage of the infiltration process where the infiltration rate is is assumed to be independent of the initial infiltration phase bagarello et al 2013 estimating λ c using the proposed method requires linear regression analysis of cumulative infiltration versus time to determine the intercept bs because the magnitude of bs depends on the entire cumulative infiltration curve including the transient phase that term is sensitive to the relative importance of capillary and gravity forces during ponded infiltration angulo jaramillo et al 2019 specifically small bs values indicate a linear infiltration curve i e when gravity prevails over capillarity which occurs primarily in coarse textured and or highly structured porous media on the contrary high intercept values indicate conditions when capillarity prevails over gravity particularly in the transient infiltration phase which occurs primarily in fine textured soils therefore bs is expected to be a reliable predictor of the macroscopic capillary length but one that necessitates collecting accurate data during the final stage of the infiltration process in this investigation the proposed method eq 9 was validated using both analytical and field data the analytical verification demonstrated that eq 9 provided reliable λ c estimates in nearly all conditions including different soils and for the same soils under different initial soil water contents for the field data verification was conducted using a set of 427 beerkan infiltration experiments carried out on different soils having a range of textural characteristics i e from sandy to clayey that analysis showed that nearly all soils i e 99 1 of the experiments yielded λ c values falling within the realistic range 10 λ c 1000 mm reynolds and elrick 2002 only four cases yielded λ c values lower than 10 mm further the proposed method predicted λ c values very close to the reference λ c values with all tests having relative errors between 23 2 and 7 9 the consistency of eq 9 shows that it is a suitable method to constrain λ c many models to estimate ks from field measurements e g eqs 10 13 require knowledge of λ c which is often estimated based on general descriptions of soil textural and structural characteristics e g table 1 previous research has shown that choosing an incorrect capillarity category can lead to threefold or greater error in estimated ks bagarello et al 2014d and that ks estimates are more sensitive to underpredictions of λ c compared with overpredictions stewart and abou najm 2018b in this investigation we demonstrated that using constant or a soil dependent λ c value may result in considerably greater relative error when predicting ks specifically using eq 9 resulted in relative errors 25 for all beerkan tests when analyzed with three of the four methods and 30 when the fourth method was used by comparison assuming λ c 83 mm resulted in relative error up to 600 and using a soil dependent λ c value caused relative errors of close to 500 beyond its use in estimating ks λ c can provide information on soil pore structure and water retention stewart and abou najm 2018b making it important to have a simple method for use in the field for example the proposed method for constraining λ c may also facilitate the estimation of dynamic indicators such as the flow weighted mean pore radius and the number of hydraulically active pores per unit area previously proposed by warrick and broadbridge 1992 and watson and luxmoore 1986 the flow weighted mean pore radius represents the size of pores that are actively conducting and it expresses the ability of a soil to transmit water reynolds and elrick 2005 these indicators quantitatively linked to λ c and ks are useful to understand the effects of land use and management on soil physical quality bouarafa et al 2019 castellini et al 2019 iovino et al 2016 therefore accurate estimation of λ c through eq 9 could also facilitate determination of dynamic indicators from infiltration experiments and improve soil quality assessment 6 summary and conclusions in this investigation we assessed a simple field method for estimating the macroscopic capillary length λ c by only using a single ring infiltration experiment of the beerkan type and a measurement of the initial and saturated soil water contents we validated the proposed method using both analytically generated data and a large database of 433 beerkan infiltration experiments carried out in four countries italy burundi france and spain over the period 2010 2017 the analytical validation supported our hypothesis that the intercept bs is a reliable predictor of the macroscopic capillary length while the testing carried out using the beerkan database increased our confidence that the approach performs well under field conditions therefore we conclude that the method proposed here constitutes an easy and effective solution for constraining λ c which at the same time can help users to better estimate ks from field infiltration measurements the proposed procedure may also avoid uncertainty due to an imprecise description of the transient state of infiltration and any subjectivity caused by the selection of a representative λ c value based solely on textural or structural characteristics funding this work was supported through i the

5222,antecedent effective rainfall ar and rainfall intensity i play an important role in the formation process of debris flow establishing ar i threshold curve of debris flow is hence of great importance for early warning purpose however conventional statistical models require sufficient observation data which is not feasible for developing countries without adequate field observation stations to this end a hydrology process based method is proposed to construct the ar i threshold in this model debris flow is considered as a soil water mixture composed of solid and water the loose solid sources contributing to debris flow is provided by the rainfall induced shallow landslide and the water is from rainfall induced runoff a necessity of having the characteristics of debris flow is that the density of water soil mixture should approximate to the density of debris flow ranging from 1 2 to 2 3 g cm3 the value of 1 2 and 2 3 g cm3 which represent lower and upper borders of the density of debris flow is used as the threshold for predicting debris flow the task of the model is to find out the rainfall parameters that correlate with the border value of density and use the searched data of rainfall parameters to fit corresponding curves verification of the proposed threshold was conducted based on field observation data of jiangjia gully located in yunnan province china which indicates the false negative and false positive rates of the threshold are 26 7 and 15 respectively the precision of the threshold is evaluated as 82 6 by the receiver operator characteristics method which can provide a solution for debris flow early warning keywords debris flow early warning antecedent rainfall rainfall intensity 1 introduction rainfall is one of the main triggering factors to debris flow abancó et al 2016 intrieri et al 2017 as for rainfall induced debris flow threshold conditions based on rainfall parameters can be constructed through the statistical analysis of debris flow and rainfall events iadanza et al 2016 when precipitation exceeds the threshold debris flows may occur guzzetti et al 2007 2008 abancó et al 2016 currently the thresholds expressed by rainfall parameter mainly include the following four categories segoni et al 2018 threshold based on rainfall intensity duration caine 1980 segoni et al 2014 de luca and versace 2017 threshold relies on antecedent rainfall conditions tien bui et al 2013 saadatkhah et al 2015 yang et al 2020 threshold using total rainfall accumulated during the event and its duration lee et al 2014 ma et al 2014 kanjanakul et al 2016 and the rest presents various different parameters used to define rainfall thresholds martelloni et al 2012 vallet et al 2016 e g a multidimensional threshold that includes groundwater recharge and several rainfall indexes based on 115 rainfall thresholds involved in 107 related literatures segoni et al 2018 comprehensively explore the above four categories and reported the intensity duration i d is the most widely utilized threshold by using the rainfall data and i d threshold this type of threshold can indicate whether a debris flow is likely to occur govi and sorzana 1980 keefer et al 1987 crosta 1998 cardinali et al 2006 guo et al 2013 however most of the i d thresholds only use the triggering rainfall data of debris flow without considering antecedent effective rainfall ar as reported by guzzetti et al 2008 only 9 6 of available i d thresholds take antecedent effective rainfall into account research increasingly suggests that antecedent effective rainfall plays an important role in the formation process of debris flow d orsi et al 1997 glade et al 2000 chleborad 2003 aleotti 2004 gabet et al 2004 kanungo and sharma 2014 huang et al 2015 lee et al 2015 yang et al 2020 because it can induce variations of the water table and pore water pressure both of them are responsible for shallow landslides and provide loose solid sources for debris flow guzzetti et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 based on the analysis of field observation data in jiangjia gully antecedent effective rainfall was demonstrated to contribute more than 80 in all of the rainfall index affecting debris flow cui et al 2003 consequently relationship between antecedent effective rainfall and debris flow was gained increasingly attention zhang et al 2014a b 2018 extensive investigations on the ar based threshold of debris flow were performed khan et al 2012 ma et al 2014 napolitano et al 2016 segoni et al 2018 campbell 1975 pointed out that the cause of debris flow was the combination of antecedent effective rainfall and event rainfall intensity as for the event rainfall intensity although both prolonged rainfall of medium intensity and short duration rainfall of heavy intensity can induce debris flow marques et al 2008 khan et al 2012 most of debris flows are triggered by an intensive rainfall within hours premchitt et al 1986 ng and shi 1998 tien bui et al 2013 rainfall intensity in different time scales was adopted in this kind of threshold kim et al 1991 tan and duan 1995 saadatkhah et al 2015 lee et al 2015 as instances tien bui et al 2013 combined daily rainfall and 15 day antecedent effective rainfall heyerdahl et al 2003 used hourly rainfall tan and duan 1995 used the rainfall intensity in 10 min combing with 15 day antecedent effective rainfall to establish the threshold in jiangjia gully despite of various different temporal resolution of rainfall intensity thresholds used for early warning purposes are based on data of at least hourly time scale wu and lin 2017 segoni et al 2018 currently most of ar based thresholds were derived by statistical analysis of the observation data however peres and cancelliere 2014 suggested three main drawbacks for statistical thresholds including 1 observation data of debris flow and rainfall are in most cases available for a relatively short period and may not be sufficiently from a statistical point of view 2 the identification of the triggering time in many cases is uncertain and debris flow archives are seldom complete 3 many thresholds have been derived by investigating triggering events and neglecting the non triggering ones thresholds that applied in an early warning purpose tend to produce an unacceptable degree of false alarms especially the biggest problem of statistical based thresholds in developing country is inadequate observation data to support analysis because rain gauge networks may be in most cases not available guzzetti et al 2007 dixon et al 2018 in this situation the physical mode to derive rainfall threshold is an alternative choice guzzetti et al 2007 capparelli and tiranti 2010 ruiz villanueva et al 2011 salciarini et al 2012 wu et al 2015 napolitano et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 the key of the mode is to select a parameter that can represent the occurrence of debris flow the chosen parameters are adopted as the control factors to search the data of rainfall parameters in the form of the scenario simulation these searched data are then used to fit the threshold curves some scholars have tried to construct the i d threshold curves in physical mode as instances papa et al 2013 used the area ratio of rainfall induced landslides to a watershed nc as the control parameter for fitting the i d threshold curve but this control parameter only considers the loose solid sources that affect the formation of debris flow while runoff providing hydrodynamic conditions for debris flow was not taken into account zhang et al 2020 selected the debris flow density as the control factor for fitting the i d threshold of debris flow this factor can reflect the fluid characteristics of the debris flow and can incorporate the two major factors loose solid sources and runoff that affect the formation of debris flow into an equation the numerical calculations were used to construct a correlation of rainfall parameters and the density boundary values of 1 2 g cm3 and 2 3 g cm3 then the i d threshold curve of debris flow can be constructed under the physical framework it is reported that the fitted i d curve for debris flow in the physical framework has a similar curve shape to the statistical based curve zhang et al 2020 as mentioned above the ar based threshold curve is an important tool for the debris flow early warning it is important to examine the shape of ar i threshold curve because its shape can represent the hydrological characteristics triggering debris flow which will be helpful to choose a suitable fitting equation to the ar i threshold curve in the statistical mode however there is no relating reports about the ar i threshold curve under a physical framework to this end the density of debris flow is used as the control factor to fit the ar i threshold curves and also the equation zhang et al 2020 considering the factors of loose solid sources and runoff is adopted to calculate the density of debris flow in the conditions of the scenario simulation different ar and i values are set for numerical calculations and the data of ar and i that meet the condition of density constraint are examined and saved which are used to fit the ar i threshold curves after this the ar i curve shape and its corresponding hydrological characteristics that triggering debris flow are investigated the ar i threshold curves corresponding to the boundary values of debris flow density were selected whose accuracy is verified by the field observation data of jiangjia gully correspondingly the possibility of its application in debris flow early warning is discussed 2 methodology 2 1 simplification of the complex debris flow process in a debris flow gully shallow landslide or bed erosion are the two main sources of supply for debris flow formation gabet and mudd 2006 berti and simoni 2005 coe et al 2008 although the above two supply modes may exist at a same gully there is always a relatively dominant type debris flow gully with shallow landslides as the solid source of supply is widely distributed in southwest china zhang et al 2020 and this study focuses on the analysis of physical processes and methods around this type of debris flow the formation process of debris flow in a gully is very complicated generally intensive rainfalls can induce flash floods and landslides upstream ray and smedt 2009 apip et al 2010 cui et al 2013 landslides are usually the dominant mechanism for conveying large amounts of debris to river channels korup et al 2004 the interaction of floods upstream and abundant loose solids deposited along channels can cause a debris flow in a gully cui et al 2013 this interaction process is generally accompanied by the typical phenomenon such as the process of debris flow confluence blockage breakage and scale amplification that can be catastrophic chen et al 2006 cui et al 2013 as shown in fig 1 the complex physical process of debris flow formation in the valley is simplified into two steps including a rainfall infiltration leads to failure of the soil mass providing loose solid sources to the gully in the form of shallow landslides b rainfall induced runoff coupled with loose solid sources to form a soil water mixture with a certain density based on above simplification a hydrology process based simulation model is established to calculate the density of the water soil mixture under various rainfall conditions 2 2 hydrology process based method to derive the fitting ar i curves 2 2 1 loose solid resources provided by shallow landslides rainfall infiltration leads to a rapid decrease of the matrix suction in unsaturated slopes or an increase of pore water pressure in saturated soil slopes which are the main factors causing shallow landslides li et al 2013 zhang et al 2014a liu et al 2016 iverson et al 1997 apip et al 2010 affected by the monsoons of pacific and indian ocean southwestern china has abundant rainfall during may to october while other seasons are dry most geological disasters in southwestern china occur during the rainy season accordingly before that the slopes were generally unsaturated zhang et al 2018 for unsaturated soil mass rainfall infiltration increases the water content of the soil which in turn reduces the matrix suction and finally causes the failure of soil mass here based on the mohr coulomb failure criterion of unsaturated soil and the infinite slope model a formula for assessing the stability of the slopes in the debris flow gully is established 1 fs tan φ tan β c ψ tan φ b γ t h s cos β sin β where fs is the safety factor c is the cohesion φ is the internal friction angle β is the slope gradient γt is the soil density and γt γ s 1 θ γ w θ where γ s is the bulk density of soil particle and γ w is the bulk density of water φb is related to the matrix suction which is close to the internal friction angle under conditions of low matrix suction hs is the soil depth ψ and is the matrix suction and calculated by the following formula van genuchten 1980 2 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α ψ n m where se is the saturation degree θs and θr represent the saturated water content and residual water content of the soil θ is the soil water content at the current moment n and m are parameters of soil water characteristic curve and n 1 1 m taking the grid as the analysis object when the safety factor fs 1 in eq 1 it indicates that the grid is stable fs 1 indicates the grid unstable in this way the total volume of loose solid resources provided by shallow landslides can be estimated by eq 3 zhang et al 2014a b liu et al 2016 3 v s t 1 t i 1 n s a i d s where vs represents the cumulative total volume of loose solid resources t represents the computation time of the model ns represents the number of unstable grids ai is the grid area ds is the unstable depth of each unstable grid 2 2 2 rainfall induced runoff based on grid level simulation of hydrological processes a hydrological process simulation needs to be performed in order to deliver key hydrological parameters to eqs 1 3 the infiltration process in the vertical direction of each grid is described by the 1d richards equation 1931 4 θ t z d θ θ z k θ θ where θ is the soil water content d θ k θ dθ dψ is the soil water diffusivity z is the soil depth and is positive downwards along the soil depth as taking the topsoil as the origin point k θ is the hydraulic conductivity eq 4 cannot analyse the 2d phenomena that are strongly influenced by lateral flows and subsurface outflows the two kind of flows actually influence the slope stability however 1d richards equation is more convenient for numerical calculation without considering complicate border conditions of 2d numerical model the implicit finite difference method is used to discrete the 1d richards equation in our numerical algorithm the time domain is discretized into equal time intervals of 1 h the space domain is mainly reflected in the vertical soil layer thickness and the soil layer of each grid is discretized into a series of equal thickness layers according to the observational data in jiangjia gully rainfall generally has little effect on the soil moisture content more than 40 cm below the topsoil therefore the lower boundary of the numerical model adopts an impermeable boundary that is water exchange between the lower boundary and groundwater is not considered is a reasonable choice as for the infiltration border of our model when the rainfall intensity is less than the infiltration capacity of the topsoil the boundary conditions are controlled by the following equation 5 d θ θ z k θ r t where r t is the rainfall intensity at time t however when the precipitation intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity of the surface it is immediately converted to runoff the boundary conditions controlled by eq 5 are converted into θ θs the rainfall induced runoff flows into the debris flow gully providing water source to debris flow which can be estimated by the following equation zhang et al 2014a b liu et al 2016 6 v w t 1 t i 1 n w a i d w where vw is the total volume of the runoff within the gully t is the computation time nw is the number of girds that can generate runoff ai is the grid area dw is the runoff depth of each grid 2 2 3 estimation of density of the water soil mixture the density of the water soil mixture can be estimated by using the following equation 7 ρ mix ρ w v w ρ s v s v w v s where ρmix is the density of the water soil mixture ρw is the density of water ρs is the density of soil particle vw and vs are the volume of the runoff and loose solid resources which can be calculated by eqs 3 and 6 2 2 4 fitting of the ar i curve using scenario simulation under the action of rainfall infiltration slopes transport loose solid sources into the gully in the form of shallow landslides and is coupled with the rainfall induced runoff to form a typical soil water mixture according to field observations the most typical feature of the debris flow is a water soil mixture with a high density which is generally between 1 2 g and 2 3 g cm3 zhuang et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 for any specific density value within the threshold interval from 1 2 to 2 3 g cm3 there may be multiple combinations of ar and i to make density of the soil water mixture equal to this specific value for example when ar is at a high level a smaller i value can trigger debris flow with a specific density value while if ar is low a larger i value is required for the same density value the task of our model is to search for these combinations of rainfall parameters that satisfy the density constraints and use these searched data to fit the corresponding curves based on all of the above equations combinations of ar and i are searched following the calculation process in fig 2 so that the ar i curves can be fitted through these data the fitted curves correspond to a specific density value of debris flow so which can also be called isolines of the density as shown in fig 2 the steps to fit the ar i curve are as follows 1 select several typical density values from the density interval of debris flow as control points e g ρ fix 1 2 1 5 2 0 2 2 g cm3 2 precipitation data is the input quantities of the model and is divided into two types ar and triggering rainfall triggering rainfall is represented by rainfall intensity and rainfall duration ar refers to the portion of precipitation that remains in the soil before the debris flow occurrence after selecting the debris flow density value different ar values are set such as ar 5 mm 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm 40 mm 50 mm 60 mm 75 mm 85 mm and 100 mm the ar value is a set value to facilitate the scenario simulation of the model its distribution the in the soil cannot be exactly descripted since ar characterizes the amount of rainfall stored inside the soil it can be equivalent to the water content of the soil zhang et al 2015 here it is assumed that precipitation is evenly distributed in the soil mass of each grid cell although this assumption may be different from the actual situation it is more convenient for the model calculation from this the model can obtain the initial soil water content in the area caused by the previous rainfall and then use formula 2 to obtain the corresponding initial matrix suction and other hydrological parameters so the antecedent effective rainfall can provide the initial hydrological conditions to the model for the calculation purpose zhang et al 2015 3 controlled by conditions of 1 and 2 the calculation time t of each case is set to be 200 h and the calculation step δt is equal to 1 h the calculation step affects the accuracy of numerical calculation and even more so to the simulation accuracy of surface soil moisture content because the variation processes of soil moisture content in the topsoil are faster and strongly influenced by rainfall intensities gradually higher basically a small calculation step size is beneficial to the accuracy however due to the limitation of rainfall observation conditions only the hour level rainfall data is available for verifying the model and it is impossible to provide minute level rainfall data for this reason this model sets the time step to 1 h the initial value of i for each case is 1 mm h and then increase with the increase of δt as i increase to a certain value there will be a situation where the calculated ρ mix is equal to ρ fix at t 1 at this time the ar and i values are both saved in a two dimensional array 4 repeat steps 1 3 until all the pre set data involved in steps 1 and 2 are used in the calculation cases of the model then four two dimensional arrays including ar and i are obtained each array corresponds to one pre set density value of debris flow 5 four ar i threshold curves corresponding to different density values are finally fitted using the ar and i data contained in the four arrays 3 case study 3 1 study area as a tributary of the xiaojiang river jiangjia gully with an area of about 48 6 km2 is located in dongchuan district kunming city yunnan province fig 3 influenced by the intense neotectonic movement and the earthquake activity slopes within this gully are covered by tens of meters of loose solid materials and they transport a large amount of loose material sources in the form of shallow landslides to the main channel the outbreak of debris flow in jiangjia gully depends on factors such as i and ar and the magnitude of i required for debris flow is related to the antecedent soil moisture of loose solid sources generally rainfall intensity increases with the decrease of ar cui et al 2003 the dongchuan debris flow observation and research station was established by the chinese academy of sciences in 1961 it is one of the first batch of five field open stations in the chinese academy of sciences the field observation works for debris flow have lasted for more than 58 years which can provide adequate observation data for the verification of the ar i threshold 3 2 data collection the underlying surface data within jiangjia gully required for the model calculation can be divided into two categories one is the hydrological parameters used for simulations of rainfall infiltration and runoff the other is the soil mechanical parameters required to calculate the slope stability 1 underlying surface data for hydrological process simulation digital elevation model dem of jiangjia gully was generated from a 1 10 000 topographic map with a grid accuracy of 10 m three types of soil are distributed in jiangjia gully including gravelly soil red yellow soil and dry red soil gravel soil is widely distributed on deposits of landslides upstream jiangjia gully it is the main loose solid sources for debris flow formation hydrological parameters of each soil type were obtained from the national soil database table 1 a land use map with the grid size of 250 m and its corresponding parameter such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi are provided by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis database these above data relating to hydrological parameters are transformed into the map consistent with the accuracy of dem using the resampling function in arcgis three types of soil and their corresponding hydrological mechanical parameters are illustrated in table 1 where the fs in table 1 is the infiltration capacity of the topsoil when it is close to the residual moisture content 2 the soil cohesion c and internal friction angle φ of field samples are determined using direct shear tests the two parameters are used in eq 1 for estimating the safety factor fs most of the loose solid sources for debris flow in jiangjia gully are provided by gravel soil for this reason three groups of samples were taken on the gravel soil slopes upstream jiangjia gully and one group of samples was taken from the red yellow soil and dry red soil upstream jiangjia gully respectively the results of the direct shear test are shown in table 2 3 3 density evolution of the water soil mixture before fitting the ar i curve density evolution of the water soil mixture subjected to different rainfall event need to be investigated at first according to the field observation the antecedent effective rainfall that can trigger debris flows in jiangjia gully is generally between 1 and 100 mm zhuang et al 2015 therefore the ar is divided into ten categories including 5 mm 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm 40 mm 50 mm 60 mm 75 mm 85 mm and 100 mm after a specific value of the ar is assigned as the input quantities of the model the density evolution process of water soil mixture under the action of different rainfall intensities are achieved and shown in fig 4 fig 4 shows 6 sets of working cases each curve corresponds to each case the ar of these cases are equal to 40 mm the calculation duration of all cases in fig 4 is 200 h and the calculation step is also the same which is equal to 1 h it should be noted that rainfall intensity i of the six cases is different as instance the i of the case 1 is set to 1 mm which means that the rainfall intensity is always kept constant at 1 mm from the start of calculation to the end the density evolution with time can represent the formation process of debris flow at the beginning of runoff process the hydrodynamic conditions are too weak to entrain the loose solid resources in the channel and so the fluid in the channel is water dominated as rainfall continues the rapid increase discharge of runoff makes the hydrodynamic conditions reaching the ability to entrain the solid source at this time the fluid in the channel immediately turns into a two phase fluid composed by water and soil when its density is located between 1 2 and 2 3 g cm3 this kind of fluid is similar to debris flow indicating debris flow occurrence in the gully at last stage of the density evolution the loose solid sources are gradually saturated making a rapid decreasing in infiltration capacity of topsoil in this situation the producing rate of runoff increases more rapidly than that of loose material from shallow landslides so the density of the water soil mixture also decreases rapidly to below 1 2 g cm3 the water soil mixture in the channel will no longer have the fluid characteristics of debris flow similarly the debris flow in the channel changes to a hyper concentrated flow zhang et al 2020 the six working cases have a similar curve shape of the mixture density but the time point of density change is different it can be observed from fig 4 under the same condition of the ar the greater rainfall intensity the earlier the debris flow is promoted in the gully whereas the duration of the density of the water soil mixture from 2 3 g cm3 to 1 2 g cm3 is also shorter indicating that higher rainfall conditions can stimulate more drastic changes of the water soil mixture in the channel as shown in fig 4 the density of the water soil mixture rapidly decreased from 2 3 g cm3 to 1 2 g cm3 during this period there was no sudden increase in density which means that the debris flow formation process simulated by the model cannot reflect the characteristics of debris flow surges the main reason is that the model considers the runoff from all of the grids within the gully but in fact the runoff that provides hydrodynamic conditions for debris flow generally comes from the upstream catchment area of the landslide deposit in this way the model overestimates the runoff involved in debris flow activities even if there is still landslide that continues to participate in the debris flow in the channel it still cannot exceed the producing rate of runoff within the entire watershed accordingly it is very difficult for the fluid density to increase more obviously additionally it can be known from the density evolution curves that the density of the soil water mixture generally changes from high to low which means that the one with a high density is more likely to form in the channel under the same rainfall conditions 3 4 derived ar i curve of jiangjia gully following the calculation process in fig 2 the model derives an array containing ar and i that meets the density constraint conditions and the ar i curve can be fitted through the data within the array because each fitted curve corresponds to a certain density value of debris flow which can be deemed as the isoline of the density table 3 shows the combination of antecedent effective rainfall and hourly rainfall intensity under different conditions of debris flow density as shown in table 3 it is necessary for the ar exceeding a certain threshold when the debris flow is triggered within one hour although the hourly rainfall intensity is important for debris flow formation it is still difficult to trigger a debris flow if the soil water content of the loose solid source is low cui et al 2003 taking ρ 1 5 g cm3 as an example the conditions of the ar equal to 10 20 30 40 50 60 75 85 and 100 mm can trigger a debris flow with this density value in one hour however the condition of ar equal to 5 mm is not suitable in this case a longer rainfall duration is necessary to ensure that the loose solid resource in the gully is gradually saturated the four fitted curves in fig 5 correspond to the four density values of debris flow respectively the data used to fit the four curves are from table 3 as mentioned above the black and yellow curves corresponding to 1 2 and 2 2 g cm3 in fig 5 is regarded as the upper and lower boundary lines for determining the occurrence of debris flow the fitting equations of the two boundary lines are as follows 8 lower boundary i 0 000006 a r 3 0 0128 a r 2 0 6069 a r 9 7673 20 mm a r 100 mm 9 upper boundary i 0 000006 a r 3 0 0118 a r 2 0 6067 a r 14 067 10 mm a r 100 mm as shown in fig 6 the upper and lower boundary lines form an early warning interval the black and yellow dashed lines parallel to the y axis indicate the minimum threshold conditions of ar and the black dashed line parallel to the y axis is the maximum value of ar 100 mm used in the calculation process in practical operation if the ar i of monitored rainfall in real time locates in the two boundary lines it indicates that this rainfall condition can trigger a debris flow in a short time in the practical operation performance of monitoring rainfall condition using rain gauges can achieve the purpose of debris flow early warning the detailed operation is as follows 1 based on the monitored rainfall data eq 10 is used to calculate ar the values of i 2 2 and i 1 2 are derived by substituting ar into eqs 8 and 9 and the early warning interval is identified as i 2 2 i 1 2 10 ar i 1 n k n r i where ar is the antecedent effective rainfall k is the attenuation coefficient which is equal to 0 78 based on the field test in the gully cui et al 2013 n is the number of days preceding the debris flow occurrence 2 hourly rainfall intensity monitored by a rain gauge in real time can be calculated through the accumulating rainfall mm divided by the rainfall duration h 3 if the i monitor falls into the range of early warning thresholds i 2 2 i 1 2 a debris flow may occur in jiangjia gully 3 5 verification the false negative and false positive rate are two key factors affecting the precision of early warning models zhang et al 2020 so the receiver operator characteristics roc method fawcett 2006 is adopted to verify the accuracy of the ar i threshold derived by our method according to the roc method the precision of the model pm is determined by the following three parameters including true positive rate tp false negative rate fn and false positive rate fp the equation relating to the precision of the model pm is as follows 11 pm tp fn f p 3 5 1 false negative rate fifteen typical debris flows were selected from the observation data of jiangjia gully and rainfall data corresponding to the occurrence time of debris flow were collected the black circle in fig 3 represents the rain gauge installed at mayiping which provided the rainfall data as shown in table 4 a total of 15 short duration rainfall processes triggered debris flow events in jiangjia gully from1994 to 2017 since the observation station is located downstream of the debris flow gully the time when the debris flow is observed downstream is not equal to the occurrence time of the debris flow upstream in this case the precise time point of triggering debris flow cannot be determined so it is impossible to find the corresponding i value that triggered the debris flow therefore the i value listed in table 4 represents the maximum hourly rainfall intensity during a rainfall process the ar values in table 4 are calculated according to eq 10 where the attenuation coefficient k 0 78 and the number of days preceding the debris flow occurrence n 15 the rainfall data of ar and i in table 3 triggered debris flows therefore the false negative rate and true positive rate of the threshold curve can be evaluated by these data as shown in fig 7 there are 4 false negatives red dots the false negative rate fn of the ar i threshold curve is equal to 26 7 accordingly the true positive tp rate is 73 3 3 5 2 false positive rate it is well known that rainfall processes with low intensity or small daily precipitation are difficult to trigger debris flow in practical situations of course the prediction results of the model under this rainfall condition will also be consistent with the actual situation consequently selecting these data is actually difficult to test the false positive rate of the threshold curve for the purpose of verification 20 rainfall processes with daily precipitation greater than 20 mm which did not trigger debris flow were collected from the historical records of rain gauge at mayiping i in table 5 still indicates the maximum hourly rainfall intensity during the rainfall process and the ar values in table 5 are calculated according to eq 10 where the attenuation coefficient k 0 78 and the number of days preceding the debris flow occurrence n 15 as shown in fig 8 there are three points red dots between the threshold curves which indicates that three debris flows occur under these rainfall conditions but it is not consistent with the actual situation so there are 3 false positive numbers causing the fp of the curves equal to 15 according to eq 11 the accuracy of the ar i threshold curve of debris flow pm 82 6 can be finally determined 4 discussions 4 1 density boundary of debris flow debris flow density is an important parameter which reflects the genetic types of debris flow and determines fundamental properties yang et al 2019 it is an integrated index of the constitution of debris flow fluids and also implies the regime and scale in that high mobility and large scale debris flows almost always feature high densities wang et al 2018 the density of debris flow which is closely related to soil condition or grain size distribution is so high that it can make the boulders in a suspended state zhang et al 2019 flow density is generally used for engineering designs worldwide generally speaking the flow density primarily determines what measures or structures we employ to prevent disasters wang et al 2018 scholars have found through field observation that the density of debris flow generally varies between 1 2 and 2 3 g cm3 cui et al 2005 zhuang et al 2010 as the density of the water soil mixture is between 1 2 and 1 7 g cm3 its fluid behaviour is close to newtonian fluid whereas the density of the water soil mixture between 1 8 and 2 3 g cm3 represents that its behaviour is similar to bingham fluid when the density of the soil water mixture exceeds this interval it will change to another fluid from debris flow theule et al 2015 as instances when the density of the water soil mixture is less than 1 2 g cm3 the fluid properties of the water soil mixture are biased towards a hyper concentration flow while when the density is higher than 2 3 g cm3 the shear resistance of the water soil mixture is enhanced which reduces the fluid characteristics of the water soil mixture and make it difficult to flow in the gully water soil mixtures with different densities have different rheological characteristics and motion states correspondingly distribution laws of surface velocity internal velocity and impact force are also different therefore the debris flow density interval 1 2 2 3 g cm3 provides a reliable basis for identifying whether the water soil mixture is a debris flow accordingly its border values of 1 2 and 2 3 g cm3 are used as the thresholds for debris flow early warning 4 2 ar i curves for various mixture densities as shown in fig 4 the four curves respectively represent the threshold conditions of ar i required for the occurrence of debris flow with different density in jiangjia gully the proportion of the area covered by the threshold curves in the ar o i plane is very low which indicates that rainfall induced debris flow is a relatively small probability event relative to the frequency of precipitation under the same conditions of ar the smaller the debris flow density value the greater the hourly rainfall intensity required this indicates that the formation of lower density debris flows requires better hydrodynamic conditions it also means that the higher the density of debris flows the lower the requirements for rainfall conditions the antecedent effective rainfall represents the saturation of the loose solid source and therefore it can characterize the potential volume of the solid material source that participated in the debris flow during the current precipitation process therefore a close value of ar means a similar supply level of loose solid resource for debris flow and consequently the occurrence of debris flow with a lower density e g 1 2 g cm3 requires more powerful hydrodynamic conditions according to eq 7 as for the debris flow with a high density value in jiangjia gully the main controlling factor to determine its fluidity is the pore water pressure the viscous fine particles within a denser debris flow are not beneficial to the dissipation of the pore water pressure inside and the pore water pressure can effectively weaken the effective stress of soil particles and then greatly promote the movement of debris flow so excessive hydrodynamic conditions are not necessary to the formation of denser debris flows however the gradation of the sediments within debris flow with a low density is beneficial to dissipate pore water pressure because large particles dominate in this structure the formation of this kind of low density debris flow requires stronger hydrodynamic conditions and corresponding more intensive rainfall condition 4 3 fitting of the ar i curves cui et al 2003 summarized the issue of debris flow induced by intensive rainfall in jiangjia gully the debris flow formation depends on factors such as rain intensity and antecedent effective rainfall the rainfall intensity required for a debris flow formation is related to the antecedent soil moisture of loose solid sources generally rainfall intensity increases with the decrease of ar but this is not the rule for the prosed ar i curve in fig 4 because there is an obvious inflection point as shown in table 3 vs gradually increases with the increase of ar when ar is less than 50 mm however the volume of loose solid sources provided by shallow landslides in the gully reached a peak value after ar exceeding 50 mm taking the isoline of 1 5 g cm3 as an example the cumulative total volume of loose solid resources vs and the total volume of runoff in table 6 are the two key parameters for calculating this density value see eq 7 as shown in table 6 before the inflection point ar 50 mm the rainfall intensity triggering debris flow has a positive correlation with the antecedent effective rainfall however the two have a negative correlation after the inflection point ar 50 mm in the stage of the increases in vs more total volume of vw is required to balance the gradually increasing vs in order to make the density of the water soil mixture reaching 1 5 g cm3 accordingly the rainfall intensity increases during this stage before the ar exceeding 50 mm this is the reason that the i triggering debris flow has a positive correlation with ar vs in table 6 has reached a peak value of 13866 7 m3 after ar exceeding 50 mm although the increase of ar can no longer contribute to the increase in the volume of loose solid source it can cause the increase in the soil moisture of the solid resource as a result the hourly rainfall intensity required for the formation of debris flow with a density value of 1 5 cm3 gradually decreases this is why there is a negative correlation between the ar and i in this stage 5 conclusions aiming at the mechanism of debris flow induced by short duration rainfall with a high intensity this paper builds a model that can derive the ar i threshold curve for debris flow this model is expected to solve the drawback of statistical mode highly dependent on observation data the model was verified and the results showed that the ar i threshold curve constructed under the hydrology process based framework is similar to a parabola correspondingly the fitting equation of the ar i curve is a third power polynomial which is different from the exponential equation of the i d threshold curve in the i d threshold curve the rainfall intensity and rainfall duration have always maintained a negative correlation while as for the ar i threshold curve in this study there is a significant inflection point between the rainfall intensity and antecedent effective rainfall before the inflection point they have a positive correlation while after an inflection point there was a negative correlation between them this relationship is actually the game result between yield rate of sediment and runoff under precipitation in the gully which is mainly controlled by the key hydrological processes such as variations in soil moisture and matrix suction the false positive rate of the prediction curve based on the combinations of ar and i is 15 0 and prediction accuracy of this model is evaluated as 82 5 this evaluated precision indicating a high reliability of the prediction results from the model therefore the proposed ar i

5222,antecedent effective rainfall ar and rainfall intensity i play an important role in the formation process of debris flow establishing ar i threshold curve of debris flow is hence of great importance for early warning purpose however conventional statistical models require sufficient observation data which is not feasible for developing countries without adequate field observation stations to this end a hydrology process based method is proposed to construct the ar i threshold in this model debris flow is considered as a soil water mixture composed of solid and water the loose solid sources contributing to debris flow is provided by the rainfall induced shallow landslide and the water is from rainfall induced runoff a necessity of having the characteristics of debris flow is that the density of water soil mixture should approximate to the density of debris flow ranging from 1 2 to 2 3 g cm3 the value of 1 2 and 2 3 g cm3 which represent lower and upper borders of the density of debris flow is used as the threshold for predicting debris flow the task of the model is to find out the rainfall parameters that correlate with the border value of density and use the searched data of rainfall parameters to fit corresponding curves verification of the proposed threshold was conducted based on field observation data of jiangjia gully located in yunnan province china which indicates the false negative and false positive rates of the threshold are 26 7 and 15 respectively the precision of the threshold is evaluated as 82 6 by the receiver operator characteristics method which can provide a solution for debris flow early warning keywords debris flow early warning antecedent rainfall rainfall intensity 1 introduction rainfall is one of the main triggering factors to debris flow abancó et al 2016 intrieri et al 2017 as for rainfall induced debris flow threshold conditions based on rainfall parameters can be constructed through the statistical analysis of debris flow and rainfall events iadanza et al 2016 when precipitation exceeds the threshold debris flows may occur guzzetti et al 2007 2008 abancó et al 2016 currently the thresholds expressed by rainfall parameter mainly include the following four categories segoni et al 2018 threshold based on rainfall intensity duration caine 1980 segoni et al 2014 de luca and versace 2017 threshold relies on antecedent rainfall conditions tien bui et al 2013 saadatkhah et al 2015 yang et al 2020 threshold using total rainfall accumulated during the event and its duration lee et al 2014 ma et al 2014 kanjanakul et al 2016 and the rest presents various different parameters used to define rainfall thresholds martelloni et al 2012 vallet et al 2016 e g a multidimensional threshold that includes groundwater recharge and several rainfall indexes based on 115 rainfall thresholds involved in 107 related literatures segoni et al 2018 comprehensively explore the above four categories and reported the intensity duration i d is the most widely utilized threshold by using the rainfall data and i d threshold this type of threshold can indicate whether a debris flow is likely to occur govi and sorzana 1980 keefer et al 1987 crosta 1998 cardinali et al 2006 guo et al 2013 however most of the i d thresholds only use the triggering rainfall data of debris flow without considering antecedent effective rainfall ar as reported by guzzetti et al 2008 only 9 6 of available i d thresholds take antecedent effective rainfall into account research increasingly suggests that antecedent effective rainfall plays an important role in the formation process of debris flow d orsi et al 1997 glade et al 2000 chleborad 2003 aleotti 2004 gabet et al 2004 kanungo and sharma 2014 huang et al 2015 lee et al 2015 yang et al 2020 because it can induce variations of the water table and pore water pressure both of them are responsible for shallow landslides and provide loose solid sources for debris flow guzzetti et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 based on the analysis of field observation data in jiangjia gully antecedent effective rainfall was demonstrated to contribute more than 80 in all of the rainfall index affecting debris flow cui et al 2003 consequently relationship between antecedent effective rainfall and debris flow was gained increasingly attention zhang et al 2014a b 2018 extensive investigations on the ar based threshold of debris flow were performed khan et al 2012 ma et al 2014 napolitano et al 2016 segoni et al 2018 campbell 1975 pointed out that the cause of debris flow was the combination of antecedent effective rainfall and event rainfall intensity as for the event rainfall intensity although both prolonged rainfall of medium intensity and short duration rainfall of heavy intensity can induce debris flow marques et al 2008 khan et al 2012 most of debris flows are triggered by an intensive rainfall within hours premchitt et al 1986 ng and shi 1998 tien bui et al 2013 rainfall intensity in different time scales was adopted in this kind of threshold kim et al 1991 tan and duan 1995 saadatkhah et al 2015 lee et al 2015 as instances tien bui et al 2013 combined daily rainfall and 15 day antecedent effective rainfall heyerdahl et al 2003 used hourly rainfall tan and duan 1995 used the rainfall intensity in 10 min combing with 15 day antecedent effective rainfall to establish the threshold in jiangjia gully despite of various different temporal resolution of rainfall intensity thresholds used for early warning purposes are based on data of at least hourly time scale wu and lin 2017 segoni et al 2018 currently most of ar based thresholds were derived by statistical analysis of the observation data however peres and cancelliere 2014 suggested three main drawbacks for statistical thresholds including 1 observation data of debris flow and rainfall are in most cases available for a relatively short period and may not be sufficiently from a statistical point of view 2 the identification of the triggering time in many cases is uncertain and debris flow archives are seldom complete 3 many thresholds have been derived by investigating triggering events and neglecting the non triggering ones thresholds that applied in an early warning purpose tend to produce an unacceptable degree of false alarms especially the biggest problem of statistical based thresholds in developing country is inadequate observation data to support analysis because rain gauge networks may be in most cases not available guzzetti et al 2007 dixon et al 2018 in this situation the physical mode to derive rainfall threshold is an alternative choice guzzetti et al 2007 capparelli and tiranti 2010 ruiz villanueva et al 2011 salciarini et al 2012 wu et al 2015 napolitano et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 the key of the mode is to select a parameter that can represent the occurrence of debris flow the chosen parameters are adopted as the control factors to search the data of rainfall parameters in the form of the scenario simulation these searched data are then used to fit the threshold curves some scholars have tried to construct the i d threshold curves in physical mode as instances papa et al 2013 used the area ratio of rainfall induced landslides to a watershed nc as the control parameter for fitting the i d threshold curve but this control parameter only considers the loose solid sources that affect the formation of debris flow while runoff providing hydrodynamic conditions for debris flow was not taken into account zhang et al 2020 selected the debris flow density as the control factor for fitting the i d threshold of debris flow this factor can reflect the fluid characteristics of the debris flow and can incorporate the two major factors loose solid sources and runoff that affect the formation of debris flow into an equation the numerical calculations were used to construct a correlation of rainfall parameters and the density boundary values of 1 2 g cm3 and 2 3 g cm3 then the i d threshold curve of debris flow can be constructed under the physical framework it is reported that the fitted i d curve for debris flow in the physical framework has a similar curve shape to the statistical based curve zhang et al 2020 as mentioned above the ar based threshold curve is an important tool for the debris flow early warning it is important to examine the shape of ar i threshold curve because its shape can represent the hydrological characteristics triggering debris flow which will be helpful to choose a suitable fitting equation to the ar i threshold curve in the statistical mode however there is no relating reports about the ar i threshold curve under a physical framework to this end the density of debris flow is used as the control factor to fit the ar i threshold curves and also the equation zhang et al 2020 considering the factors of loose solid sources and runoff is adopted to calculate the density of debris flow in the conditions of the scenario simulation different ar and i values are set for numerical calculations and the data of ar and i that meet the condition of density constraint are examined and saved which are used to fit the ar i threshold curves after this the ar i curve shape and its corresponding hydrological characteristics that triggering debris flow are investigated the ar i threshold curves corresponding to the boundary values of debris flow density were selected whose accuracy is verified by the field observation data of jiangjia gully correspondingly the possibility of its application in debris flow early warning is discussed 2 methodology 2 1 simplification of the complex debris flow process in a debris flow gully shallow landslide or bed erosion are the two main sources of supply for debris flow formation gabet and mudd 2006 berti and simoni 2005 coe et al 2008 although the above two supply modes may exist at a same gully there is always a relatively dominant type debris flow gully with shallow landslides as the solid source of supply is widely distributed in southwest china zhang et al 2020 and this study focuses on the analysis of physical processes and methods around this type of debris flow the formation process of debris flow in a gully is very complicated generally intensive rainfalls can induce flash floods and landslides upstream ray and smedt 2009 apip et al 2010 cui et al 2013 landslides are usually the dominant mechanism for conveying large amounts of debris to river channels korup et al 2004 the interaction of floods upstream and abundant loose solids deposited along channels can cause a debris flow in a gully cui et al 2013 this interaction process is generally accompanied by the typical phenomenon such as the process of debris flow confluence blockage breakage and scale amplification that can be catastrophic chen et al 2006 cui et al 2013 as shown in fig 1 the complex physical process of debris flow formation in the valley is simplified into two steps including a rainfall infiltration leads to failure of the soil mass providing loose solid sources to the gully in the form of shallow landslides b rainfall induced runoff coupled with loose solid sources to form a soil water mixture with a certain density based on above simplification a hydrology process based simulation model is established to calculate the density of the water soil mixture under various rainfall conditions 2 2 hydrology process based method to derive the fitting ar i curves 2 2 1 loose solid resources provided by shallow landslides rainfall infiltration leads to a rapid decrease of the matrix suction in unsaturated slopes or an increase of pore water pressure in saturated soil slopes which are the main factors causing shallow landslides li et al 2013 zhang et al 2014a liu et al 2016 iverson et al 1997 apip et al 2010 affected by the monsoons of pacific and indian ocean southwestern china has abundant rainfall during may to october while other seasons are dry most geological disasters in southwestern china occur during the rainy season accordingly before that the slopes were generally unsaturated zhang et al 2018 for unsaturated soil mass rainfall infiltration increases the water content of the soil which in turn reduces the matrix suction and finally causes the failure of soil mass here based on the mohr coulomb failure criterion of unsaturated soil and the infinite slope model a formula for assessing the stability of the slopes in the debris flow gully is established 1 fs tan φ tan β c ψ tan φ b γ t h s cos β sin β where fs is the safety factor c is the cohesion φ is the internal friction angle β is the slope gradient γt is the soil density and γt γ s 1 θ γ w θ where γ s is the bulk density of soil particle and γ w is the bulk density of water φb is related to the matrix suction which is close to the internal friction angle under conditions of low matrix suction hs is the soil depth ψ and is the matrix suction and calculated by the following formula van genuchten 1980 2 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α ψ n m where se is the saturation degree θs and θr represent the saturated water content and residual water content of the soil θ is the soil water content at the current moment n and m are parameters of soil water characteristic curve and n 1 1 m taking the grid as the analysis object when the safety factor fs 1 in eq 1 it indicates that the grid is stable fs 1 indicates the grid unstable in this way the total volume of loose solid resources provided by shallow landslides can be estimated by eq 3 zhang et al 2014a b liu et al 2016 3 v s t 1 t i 1 n s a i d s where vs represents the cumulative total volume of loose solid resources t represents the computation time of the model ns represents the number of unstable grids ai is the grid area ds is the unstable depth of each unstable grid 2 2 2 rainfall induced runoff based on grid level simulation of hydrological processes a hydrological process simulation needs to be performed in order to deliver key hydrological parameters to eqs 1 3 the infiltration process in the vertical direction of each grid is described by the 1d richards equation 1931 4 θ t z d θ θ z k θ θ where θ is the soil water content d θ k θ dθ dψ is the soil water diffusivity z is the soil depth and is positive downwards along the soil depth as taking the topsoil as the origin point k θ is the hydraulic conductivity eq 4 cannot analyse the 2d phenomena that are strongly influenced by lateral flows and subsurface outflows the two kind of flows actually influence the slope stability however 1d richards equation is more convenient for numerical calculation without considering complicate border conditions of 2d numerical model the implicit finite difference method is used to discrete the 1d richards equation in our numerical algorithm the time domain is discretized into equal time intervals of 1 h the space domain is mainly reflected in the vertical soil layer thickness and the soil layer of each grid is discretized into a series of equal thickness layers according to the observational data in jiangjia gully rainfall generally has little effect on the soil moisture content more than 40 cm below the topsoil therefore the lower boundary of the numerical model adopts an impermeable boundary that is water exchange between the lower boundary and groundwater is not considered is a reasonable choice as for the infiltration border of our model when the rainfall intensity is less than the infiltration capacity of the topsoil the boundary conditions are controlled by the following equation 5 d θ θ z k θ r t where r t is the rainfall intensity at time t however when the precipitation intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity of the surface it is immediately converted to runoff the boundary conditions controlled by eq 5 are converted into θ θs the rainfall induced runoff flows into the debris flow gully providing water source to debris flow which can be estimated by the following equation zhang et al 2014a b liu et al 2016 6 v w t 1 t i 1 n w a i d w where vw is the total volume of the runoff within the gully t is the computation time nw is the number of girds that can generate runoff ai is the grid area dw is the runoff depth of each grid 2 2 3 estimation of density of the water soil mixture the density of the water soil mixture can be estimated by using the following equation 7 ρ mix ρ w v w ρ s v s v w v s where ρmix is the density of the water soil mixture ρw is the density of water ρs is the density of soil particle vw and vs are the volume of the runoff and loose solid resources which can be calculated by eqs 3 and 6 2 2 4 fitting of the ar i curve using scenario simulation under the action of rainfall infiltration slopes transport loose solid sources into the gully in the form of shallow landslides and is coupled with the rainfall induced runoff to form a typical soil water mixture according to field observations the most typical feature of the debris flow is a water soil mixture with a high density which is generally between 1 2 g and 2 3 g cm3 zhuang et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 for any specific density value within the threshold interval from 1 2 to 2 3 g cm3 there may be multiple combinations of ar and i to make density of the soil water mixture equal to this specific value for example when ar is at a high level a smaller i value can trigger debris flow with a specific density value while if ar is low a larger i value is required for the same density value the task of our model is to search for these combinations of rainfall parameters that satisfy the density constraints and use these searched data to fit the corresponding curves based on all of the above equations combinations of ar and i are searched following the calculation process in fig 2 so that the ar i curves can be fitted through these data the fitted curves correspond to a specific density value of debris flow so which can also be called isolines of the density as shown in fig 2 the steps to fit the ar i curve are as follows 1 select several typical density values from the density interval of debris flow as control points e g ρ fix 1 2 1 5 2 0 2 2 g cm3 2 precipitation data is the input quantities of the model and is divided into two types ar and triggering rainfall triggering rainfall is represented by rainfall intensity and rainfall duration ar refers to the portion of precipitation that remains in the soil before the debris flow occurrence after selecting the debris flow density value different ar values are set such as ar 5 mm 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm 40 mm 50 mm 60 mm 75 mm 85 mm and 100 mm the ar value is a set value to facilitate the scenario simulation of the model its distribution the in the soil cannot be exactly descripted since ar characterizes the amount of rainfall stored inside the soil it can be equivalent to the water content of the soil zhang et al 2015 here it is assumed that precipitation is evenly distributed in the soil mass of each grid cell although this assumption may be different from the actual situation it is more convenient for the model calculation from this the model can obtain the initial soil water content in the area caused by the previous rainfall and then use formula 2 to obtain the corresponding initial matrix suction and other hydrological parameters so the antecedent effective rainfall can provide the initial hydrological conditions to the model for the calculation purpose zhang et al 2015 3 controlled by conditions of 1 and 2 the calculation time t of each case is set to be 200 h and the calculation step δt is equal to 1 h the calculation step affects the accuracy of numerical calculation and even more so to the simulation accuracy of surface soil moisture content because the variation processes of soil moisture content in the topsoil are faster and strongly influenced by rainfall intensities gradually higher basically a small calculation step size is beneficial to the accuracy however due to the limitation of rainfall observation conditions only the hour level rainfall data is available for verifying the model and it is impossible to provide minute level rainfall data for this reason this model sets the time step to 1 h the initial value of i for each case is 1 mm h and then increase with the increase of δt as i increase to a certain value there will be a situation where the calculated ρ mix is equal to ρ fix at t 1 at this time the ar and i values are both saved in a two dimensional array 4 repeat steps 1 3 until all the pre set data involved in steps 1 and 2 are used in the calculation cases of the model then four two dimensional arrays including ar and i are obtained each array corresponds to one pre set density value of debris flow 5 four ar i threshold curves corresponding to different density values are finally fitted using the ar and i data contained in the four arrays 3 case study 3 1 study area as a tributary of the xiaojiang river jiangjia gully with an area of about 48 6 km2 is located in dongchuan district kunming city yunnan province fig 3 influenced by the intense neotectonic movement and the earthquake activity slopes within this gully are covered by tens of meters of loose solid materials and they transport a large amount of loose material sources in the form of shallow landslides to the main channel the outbreak of debris flow in jiangjia gully depends on factors such as i and ar and the magnitude of i required for debris flow is related to the antecedent soil moisture of loose solid sources generally rainfall intensity increases with the decrease of ar cui et al 2003 the dongchuan debris flow observation and research station was established by the chinese academy of sciences in 1961 it is one of the first batch of five field open stations in the chinese academy of sciences the field observation works for debris flow have lasted for more than 58 years which can provide adequate observation data for the verification of the ar i threshold 3 2 data collection the underlying surface data within jiangjia gully required for the model calculation can be divided into two categories one is the hydrological parameters used for simulations of rainfall infiltration and runoff the other is the soil mechanical parameters required to calculate the slope stability 1 underlying surface data for hydrological process simulation digital elevation model dem of jiangjia gully was generated from a 1 10 000 topographic map with a grid accuracy of 10 m three types of soil are distributed in jiangjia gully including gravelly soil red yellow soil and dry red soil gravel soil is widely distributed on deposits of landslides upstream jiangjia gully it is the main loose solid sources for debris flow formation hydrological parameters of each soil type were obtained from the national soil database table 1 a land use map with the grid size of 250 m and its corresponding parameter such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi are provided by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis database these above data relating to hydrological parameters are transformed into the map consistent with the accuracy of dem using the resampling function in arcgis three types of soil and their corresponding hydrological mechanical parameters are illustrated in table 1 where the fs in table 1 is the infiltration capacity of the topsoil when it is close to the residual moisture content 2 the soil cohesion c and internal friction angle φ of field samples are determined using direct shear tests the two parameters are used in eq 1 for estimating the safety factor fs most of the loose solid sources for debris flow in jiangjia gully are provided by gravel soil for this reason three groups of samples were taken on the gravel soil slopes upstream jiangjia gully and one group of samples was taken from the red yellow soil and dry red soil upstream jiangjia gully respectively the results of the direct shear test are shown in table 2 3 3 density evolution of the water soil mixture before fitting the ar i curve density evolution of the water soil mixture subjected to different rainfall event need to be investigated at first according to the field observation the antecedent effective rainfall that can trigger debris flows in jiangjia gully is generally between 1 and 100 mm zhuang et al 2015 therefore the ar is divided into ten categories including 5 mm 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm 40 mm 50 mm 60 mm 75 mm 85 mm and 100 mm after a specific value of the ar is assigned as the input quantities of the model the density evolution process of water soil mixture under the action of different rainfall intensities are achieved and shown in fig 4 fig 4 shows 6 sets of working cases each curve corresponds to each case the ar of these cases are equal to 40 mm the calculation duration of all cases in fig 4 is 200 h and the calculation step is also the same which is equal to 1 h it should be noted that rainfall intensity i of the six cases is different as instance the i of the case 1 is set to 1 mm which means that the rainfall intensity is always kept constant at 1 mm from the start of calculation to the end the density evolution with time can represent the formation process of debris flow at the beginning of runoff process the hydrodynamic conditions are too weak to entrain the loose solid resources in the channel and so the fluid in the channel is water dominated as rainfall continues the rapid increase discharge of runoff makes the hydrodynamic conditions reaching the ability to entrain the solid source at this time the fluid in the channel immediately turns into a two phase fluid composed by water and soil when its density is located between 1 2 and 2 3 g cm3 this kind of fluid is similar to debris flow indicating debris flow occurrence in the gully at last stage of the density evolution the loose solid sources are gradually saturated making a rapid decreasing in infiltration capacity of topsoil in this situation the producing rate of runoff increases more rapidly than that of loose material from shallow landslides so the density of the water soil mixture also decreases rapidly to below 1 2 g cm3 the water soil mixture in the channel will no longer have the fluid characteristics of debris flow similarly the debris flow in the channel changes to a hyper concentrated flow zhang et al 2020 the six working cases have a similar curve shape of the mixture density but the time point of density change is different it can be observed from fig 4 under the same condition of the ar the greater rainfall intensity the earlier the debris flow is promoted in the gully whereas the duration of the density of the water soil mixture from 2 3 g cm3 to 1 2 g cm3 is also shorter indicating that higher rainfall conditions can stimulate more drastic changes of the water soil mixture in the channel as shown in fig 4 the density of the water soil mixture rapidly decreased from 2 3 g cm3 to 1 2 g cm3 during this period there was no sudden increase in density which means that the debris flow formation process simulated by the model cannot reflect the characteristics of debris flow surges the main reason is that the model considers the runoff from all of the grids within the gully but in fact the runoff that provides hydrodynamic conditions for debris flow generally comes from the upstream catchment area of the landslide deposit in this way the model overestimates the runoff involved in debris flow activities even if there is still landslide that continues to participate in the debris flow in the channel it still cannot exceed the producing rate of runoff within the entire watershed accordingly it is very difficult for the fluid density to increase more obviously additionally it can be known from the density evolution curves that the density of the soil water mixture generally changes from high to low which means that the one with a high density is more likely to form in the channel under the same rainfall conditions 3 4 derived ar i curve of jiangjia gully following the calculation process in fig 2 the model derives an array containing ar and i that meets the density constraint conditions and the ar i curve can be fitted through the data within the array because each fitted curve corresponds to a certain density value of debris flow which can be deemed as the isoline of the density table 3 shows the combination of antecedent effective rainfall and hourly rainfall intensity under different conditions of debris flow density as shown in table 3 it is necessary for the ar exceeding a certain threshold when the debris flow is triggered within one hour although the hourly rainfall intensity is important for debris flow formation it is still difficult to trigger a debris flow if the soil water content of the loose solid source is low cui et al 2003 taking ρ 1 5 g cm3 as an example the conditions of the ar equal to 10 20 30 40 50 60 75 85 and 100 mm can trigger a debris flow with this density value in one hour however the condition of ar equal to 5 mm is not suitable in this case a longer rainfall duration is necessary to ensure that the loose solid resource in the gully is gradually saturated the four fitted curves in fig 5 correspond to the four density values of debris flow respectively the data used to fit the four curves are from table 3 as mentioned above the black and yellow curves corresponding to 1 2 and 2 2 g cm3 in fig 5 is regarded as the upper and lower boundary lines for determining the occurrence of debris flow the fitting equations of the two boundary lines are as follows 8 lower boundary i 0 000006 a r 3 0 0128 a r 2 0 6069 a r 9 7673 20 mm a r 100 mm 9 upper boundary i 0 000006 a r 3 0 0118 a r 2 0 6067 a r 14 067 10 mm a r 100 mm as shown in fig 6 the upper and lower boundary lines form an early warning interval the black and yellow dashed lines parallel to the y axis indicate the minimum threshold conditions of ar and the black dashed line parallel to the y axis is the maximum value of ar 100 mm used in the calculation process in practical operation if the ar i of monitored rainfall in real time locates in the two boundary lines it indicates that this rainfall condition can trigger a debris flow in a short time in the practical operation performance of monitoring rainfall condition using rain gauges can achieve the purpose of debris flow early warning the detailed operation is as follows 1 based on the monitored rainfall data eq 10 is used to calculate ar the values of i 2 2 and i 1 2 are derived by substituting ar into eqs 8 and 9 and the early warning interval is identified as i 2 2 i 1 2 10 ar i 1 n k n r i where ar is the antecedent effective rainfall k is the attenuation coefficient which is equal to 0 78 based on the field test in the gully cui et al 2013 n is the number of days preceding the debris flow occurrence 2 hourly rainfall intensity monitored by a rain gauge in real time can be calculated through the accumulating rainfall mm divided by the rainfall duration h 3 if the i monitor falls into the range of early warning thresholds i 2 2 i 1 2 a debris flow may occur in jiangjia gully 3 5 verification the false negative and false positive rate are two key factors affecting the precision of early warning models zhang et al 2020 so the receiver operator characteristics roc method fawcett 2006 is adopted to verify the accuracy of the ar i threshold derived by our method according to the roc method the precision of the model pm is determined by the following three parameters including true positive rate tp false negative rate fn and false positive rate fp the equation relating to the precision of the model pm is as follows 11 pm tp fn f p 3 5 1 false negative rate fifteen typical debris flows were selected from the observation data of jiangjia gully and rainfall data corresponding to the occurrence time of debris flow were collected the black circle in fig 3 represents the rain gauge installed at mayiping which provided the rainfall data as shown in table 4 a total of 15 short duration rainfall processes triggered debris flow events in jiangjia gully from1994 to 2017 since the observation station is located downstream of the debris flow gully the time when the debris flow is observed downstream is not equal to the occurrence time of the debris flow upstream in this case the precise time point of triggering debris flow cannot be determined so it is impossible to find the corresponding i value that triggered the debris flow therefore the i value listed in table 4 represents the maximum hourly rainfall intensity during a rainfall process the ar values in table 4 are calculated according to eq 10 where the attenuation coefficient k 0 78 and the number of days preceding the debris flow occurrence n 15 the rainfall data of ar and i in table 3 triggered debris flows therefore the false negative rate and true positive rate of the threshold curve can be evaluated by these data as shown in fig 7 there are 4 false negatives red dots the false negative rate fn of the ar i threshold curve is equal to 26 7 accordingly the true positive tp rate is 73 3 3 5 2 false positive rate it is well known that rainfall processes with low intensity or small daily precipitation are difficult to trigger debris flow in practical situations of course the prediction results of the model under this rainfall condition will also be consistent with the actual situation consequently selecting these data is actually difficult to test the false positive rate of the threshold curve for the purpose of verification 20 rainfall processes with daily precipitation greater than 20 mm which did not trigger debris flow were collected from the historical records of rain gauge at mayiping i in table 5 still indicates the maximum hourly rainfall intensity during the rainfall process and the ar values in table 5 are calculated according to eq 10 where the attenuation coefficient k 0 78 and the number of days preceding the debris flow occurrence n 15 as shown in fig 8 there are three points red dots between the threshold curves which indicates that three debris flows occur under these rainfall conditions but it is not consistent with the actual situation so there are 3 false positive numbers causing the fp of the curves equal to 15 according to eq 11 the accuracy of the ar i threshold curve of debris flow pm 82 6 can be finally determined 4 discussions 4 1 density boundary of debris flow debris flow density is an important parameter which reflects the genetic types of debris flow and determines fundamental properties yang et al 2019 it is an integrated index of the constitution of debris flow fluids and also implies the regime and scale in that high mobility and large scale debris flows almost always feature high densities wang et al 2018 the density of debris flow which is closely related to soil condition or grain size distribution is so high that it can make the boulders in a suspended state zhang et al 2019 flow density is generally used for engineering designs worldwide generally speaking the flow density primarily determines what measures or structures we employ to prevent disasters wang et al 2018 scholars have found through field observation that the density of debris flow generally varies between 1 2 and 2 3 g cm3 cui et al 2005 zhuang et al 2010 as the density of the water soil mixture is between 1 2 and 1 7 g cm3 its fluid behaviour is close to newtonian fluid whereas the density of the water soil mixture between 1 8 and 2 3 g cm3 represents that its behaviour is similar to bingham fluid when the density of the soil water mixture exceeds this interval it will change to another fluid from debris flow theule et al 2015 as instances when the density of the water soil mixture is less than 1 2 g cm3 the fluid properties of the water soil mixture are biased towards a hyper concentration flow while when the density is higher than 2 3 g cm3 the shear resistance of the water soil mixture is enhanced which reduces the fluid characteristics of the water soil mixture and make it difficult to flow in the gully water soil mixtures with different densities have different rheological characteristics and motion states correspondingly distribution laws of surface velocity internal velocity and impact force are also different therefore the debris flow density interval 1 2 2 3 g cm3 provides a reliable basis for identifying whether the water soil mixture is a debris flow accordingly its border values of 1 2 and 2 3 g cm3 are used as the thresholds for debris flow early warning 4 2 ar i curves for various mixture densities as shown in fig 4 the four curves respectively represent the threshold conditions of ar i required for the occurrence of debris flow with different density in jiangjia gully the proportion of the area covered by the threshold curves in the ar o i plane is very low which indicates that rainfall induced debris flow is a relatively small probability event relative to the frequency of precipitation under the same conditions of ar the smaller the debris flow density value the greater the hourly rainfall intensity required this indicates that the formation of lower density debris flows requires better hydrodynamic conditions it also means that the higher the density of debris flows the lower the requirements for rainfall conditions the antecedent effective rainfall represents the saturation of the loose solid source and therefore it can characterize the potential volume of the solid material source that participated in the debris flow during the current precipitation process therefore a close value of ar means a similar supply level of loose solid resource for debris flow and consequently the occurrence of debris flow with a lower density e g 1 2 g cm3 requires more powerful hydrodynamic conditions according to eq 7 as for the debris flow with a high density value in jiangjia gully the main controlling factor to determine its fluidity is the pore water pressure the viscous fine particles within a denser debris flow are not beneficial to the dissipation of the pore water pressure inside and the pore water pressure can effectively weaken the effective stress of soil particles and then greatly promote the movement of debris flow so excessive hydrodynamic conditions are not necessary to the formation of denser debris flows however the gradation of the sediments within debris flow with a low density is beneficial to dissipate pore water pressure because large particles dominate in this structure the formation of this kind of low density debris flow requires stronger hydrodynamic conditions and corresponding more intensive rainfall condition 4 3 fitting of the ar i curves cui et al 2003 summarized the issue of debris flow induced by intensive rainfall in jiangjia gully the debris flow formation depends on factors such as rain intensity and antecedent effective rainfall the rainfall intensity required for a debris flow formation is related to the antecedent soil moisture of loose solid sources generally rainfall intensity increases with the decrease of ar but this is not the rule for the prosed ar i curve in fig 4 because there is an obvious inflection point as shown in table 3 vs gradually increases with the increase of ar when ar is less than 50 mm however the volume of loose solid sources provided by shallow landslides in the gully reached a peak value after ar exceeding 50 mm taking the isoline of 1 5 g cm3 as an example the cumulative total volume of loose solid resources vs and the total volume of runoff in table 6 are the two key parameters for calculating this density value see eq 7 as shown in table 6 before the inflection point ar 50 mm the rainfall intensity triggering debris flow has a positive correlation with the antecedent effective rainfall however the two have a negative correlation after the inflection point ar 50 mm in the stage of the increases in vs more total volume of vw is required to balance the gradually increasing vs in order to make the density of the water soil mixture reaching 1 5 g cm3 accordingly the rainfall intensity increases during this stage before the ar exceeding 50 mm this is the reason that the i triggering debris flow has a positive correlation with ar vs in table 6 has reached a peak value of 13866 7 m3 after ar exceeding 50 mm although the increase of ar can no longer contribute to the increase in the volume of loose solid source it can cause the increase in the soil moisture of the solid resource as a result the hourly rainfall intensity required for the formation of debris flow with a density value of 1 5 cm3 gradually decreases this is why there is a negative correlation between the ar and i in this stage 5 conclusions aiming at the mechanism of debris flow induced by short duration rainfall with a high intensity this paper builds a model that can derive the ar i threshold curve for debris flow this model is expected to solve the drawback of statistical mode highly dependent on observation data the model was verified and the results showed that the ar i threshold curve constructed under the hydrology process based framework is similar to a parabola correspondingly the fitting equation of the ar i curve is a third power polynomial which is different from the exponential equation of the i d threshold curve in the i d threshold curve the rainfall intensity and rainfall duration have always maintained a negative correlation while as for the ar i threshold curve in this study there is a significant inflection point between the rainfall intensity and antecedent effective rainfall before the inflection point they have a positive correlation while after an inflection point there was a negative correlation between them this relationship is actually the game result between yield rate of sediment and runoff under precipitation in the gully which is mainly controlled by the key hydrological processes such as variations in soil moisture and matrix suction the false positive rate of the prediction curve based on the combinations of ar and i is 15 0 and prediction accuracy of this model is evaluated as 82 5 this evaluated precision indicating a high reliability of the prediction results from the model therefore the proposed ar i threshold curve of debris flow has the potential for early warning application in debris flow gully lacking observation data credit authorship contribution statement kui long writing original draft

tehran metropolitan area iran in the framework of the presented dss the quantitative characteristics of the stakeholders are taken into account to develop a decentralized decision making method an agent based simulation model is employed to evaluate the outcomes of implementing each management scenario by calculating nine distinct environmental social and economic criteria over a 25 year simulation period it is shown that the best scenarios selected by the dss have merits to enhance the sustainability of the water resources in the study area and to shift the stakeholders network towards cooperation and collaboration keywords social choice theory sct stakeholder analysis sa social network analysis sna management scenarios natural resources management iran 1 introduction worldwide natural resources are managed by diverse stakeholders which have different institutional characteristics various levels of influencing power and dissimilar stakes and interests noting these heterogeneities centralized modeling of natural resources cannot be counted on as a rigorous representation of a management system and even may lead to misleading impressions therefore in recent years numerous studies have attempted to introduce decentralized and multi stakeholder management systems to model natural resources more accurately and manage them more sustainably hämäläinen et al 2001 warner 2006 hajkowicz 2008 reed et al 2009 ribot 2012 basco carrera et al 2017 water resources are maybe the most vital natural resources as the life on the earth would perish without them climate change population growth and intense chemical and biological pollution are only some of the obstacles that make the sustainable management of water resources challenging vörösmarty et al 2000 oki kanae 2006 knox et al 2012 boyd 2015 ahmadalipour et al 2019 moreover in recent years another problem has drawn the research community s attention how a water resource can be managed sustainably when there are diverse stakeholders with various and even conflicting objectives to address this problem in this research a new decision support system dss is presented which considers and formulates the characteristics and objectives of the stakeholders to rank order different management alternatives regarding increasing complexities of the problem developing a dss to address it is a challenging task mysiak et al 2005 especially dealing with polycentric and decentralized decision making contexts zulkafli et al 2017 the dss presented in this paper is based on social choice theory sct sen 1986 fishburn 2015 sct is the study of collective decision procedures that aggregates individual inputs into collective outputs the sct can be considered as a voting technique which especially in group decision contexts is close to multi criteria decision making mcdm recently much research in the field of environmental and natural resources management have implemented sct approaches to develop dss laukkanen et al 2002 kant lee 2004 srdjevic 2007 ghodsi et al 2016a estalaki et al 2016 mahjouri pourmand 2017 even though applying sct approaches to develop dss by these studies have resulted in a variety of methods to manage environmental and natural resources they rarely employ the stakeholders characteristics systematically and appropriately in their framework the methodology presented by this paper attempts to fill this research gap by applying outcomes of a systematic stakeholder analysis sa as well as insights of social network analysis sna in this study by utilizing the combination of these two methods in the structure of a dss the proposed approach aims to find the best management alternative that not only provides sustainability of water resources but also is able to shift the stakeholders network structure toward more participation and collaboration in natural resources management and especially water resources management decision alternatives usually are proposed as management scenarios watkins et al 2000 wollenberg et al 2000 lynam et al 2007 mahmoud et al 2011 dong et al 2013 after developing various scenarios in most studies a multi criteria decision analysis mcda is conducted to compare different scenarios and eventually to rank them srdjevic et al 2004 mendoza and martins 2006 weng et al 2010 huang et al 2011 although there are a variety of studies trying to incorporate social criteria in the multi criteria decision making models estévez et al 2013 soltani et al 2015 and employ participatory modeling in natural resource management hare et al 2003 castelletti and soncini sessa 2007 to the best of the authors knowledge they have rarely considered the stakeholders characteristics in their framework quantitatively and systematically in the proposed methodology all stakeholders participate in the decision making process exactly according to their influencing power the influencing power index is calculated by utilizing two appropriate methods i e sa and sna this is a promising step toward introducing more realistic assumptions to decision making models which as munda 2008 mentioned is a crucial task to address contemporary issues of real world policy making depicting stakeholders network by the means of sna is proven to be a strong approach to understand existing institutional relations and information flows between them their positions in the network as well as the holistic structure of the network lienert et al 2013 caniato et al 2014 xu et al 2016 dos muchangos et al 2017 saint ville et al 2017 ingold et al 2018 skardi et al 2020 the use of sna in the realm of natural resources management has resulted in some promising insights to cast light on the management processes and reduce the inherent uncertainties about them bodin crona 2009 prell et al 2009 paletto et al 2015 yamaki 2017 giurca metz 2018 krupa et al 2018 in recent years sna has also been implemented in diverse water resources studies to elucidate the governance system kuzdas et al 2015 chaffin et al 2016 ogada et al 2017 it is shown in some studies that the combined use of sna with a systematic sa can boost their performance reciprocally prell et al 2009 lienert et al 2013 paletto et al 2015 dos muchangos et al 2017 in other words when combining sna with sa these two methods can enhance each other s effectiveness by compensating for each other s shortcomings ahmadi et al 2019a have drawn a statistical comparison between the features of sna and sa that demonstrates some interesting similarities in their structures in the current paper the results of this statistical analysis are employed to formulate a novel stakeholder based dss which considers the stakeholders characteristics needs and notions these quantitative characteristics that are obtained from sa and sna can augment the dss by taking the exact features of the decision makers into account one advantageous and powerful technique to simulate the stakeholders decision making process is agent based modeling abm bonabeau 2002 railsback et al 2006 the use of abm in complex management systems like the coupled social ecological systems has appeared to be a promising procedure to model these systems more precisely schlüter pahl wostl 2007 maes van passel 2017 karslen et al 2019 moreover in various water related studies like urban water supply and catchment water management abm is employed as the simulation tool to predict the effectiveness of different management policies and recommend management alternatives for improving the sustainability of water resources becu et al 2003 ali et al 2017 darbandsari et al 2017 darbandsari et al 2020 in this paper to evaluate distinctive management alternatives i e scenarios a variant of abm which simulates the decisions and actions of stakeholders is used in the employed agent based model agents learn from their prior actions and decisions a learning based simulation is a simple approach with a low computational cost that helps agents to learn how to act optimally by successively improving evaluations of the quality of their particular actions at particular states of the simulated system watkins dayan 1992 in the realm of water systems management mainly to deal with the curse of dimensionality and the curse of modeling the use of learning based algorithms like reinforcement learning and q learning is reported in diverse studies castelletti et al 2002 abolpour et al 2007 castelletti et al 2010 in the current paper a new dss has been developed and employed to rank order different management scenarios for an urban water system constituted of surface water groundwater and wastewater resources in a metropolitan area innovatively the results of a systematic sa along with the qualitative outcomes of an sna have been used in the framework of a social choice approach the outcomes of this new approach that directly and precisely considers the characteristics of all stakeholders in its formulation are discussed and evaluated and it is shown that it has merits in the following parts of the paper the methodology the case study results and discussions are presented the final part suggests some concluding remarks 2 methodology the flowchart illustrating the methodology is presented in fig 1 the following sections explain the proposed methodology by describing different parts of the flowchart 2 1 system identification and data collection as can be seen in the flowchart the first step of the methodology is system identification generally when dealing with a coupled social ecological system the process of identification can be divided into two major categories 1 identification of study area and 2 identification of actors ahmadi et al 2019a to identify the study area first the location and geographic boundary of the area should be determined precisely only after this determination the most critical environmental issues as well as the primary management challenges of the study area can be distinguished for instance the study area of this paper which is a developing urban area in the middle east suffers from various socio environmental problems such as intense population growth water pollution and conflicts among divergent stakeholders these problems make the decision making process complex therefore it is required to introduce new modeling approaches that are able to take various dimensions of the problem into account just like the study area the network of actors i e stakeholders has its own boundary to be determined accurately of course this boundary is not geographical but represents the management level of the stakeholders for instance when studying an environmental system if the objective of the research is to analyze the highest management level considering the low management level stakeholders like individual fishers or farmers would not be necessary in this paper by conducting six pre interviews with scholars who have studied the study area the first list of main actors was created the pre interviews were conducted from june to august 2017 to make sure that all relevant and important actors are identified snowball sampling was applied in both identification and data collection stages goodman 1961 on the contrary to a fixed selection method that results in a fixed list of actors expanding selection procedures like snowball sampling are less prone to omitting stakeholders and ties therefore are more reliable doreian and woodard 1992 in addition to pre interviews some physical characteristics of the study area were acknowledged to recognize the main organizations that hold a significant stake the physical characteristics include hydrological boundaries main water bodies and land use eventually in the highest management level eleven stakeholders were identified who could directly and significantly affect the management status of the system table 4 after identifying the main stakeholders the next step of collecting data was designing the survey the survey consisted of two major sections one providing data for sa and the other providing data for sna in the first section the interviewees are asked to characterize the role of their organization in the system to outline their institutional objectives and preferences and to specify the power and interest of their organization moreover interviewees are asked to determine the powers and interests of all other stakeholders in the second section of the survey interviewees are asked to characterize other stakeholders with whom they have formal i e institutional relationships to determine the magnitude of those relationships and their nature i e whether the relations are collaborative or conflictive to measure the magnitude of all quantitative questions a likert scale likert 1932 with five points is employed and in the case of sa questions i e the first section interviewees are asked to provide explanations on the chosen point in our case study after designing the survey eleven structured or standardized interviews were conducted with individuals representing eleven principal organizations that hold an important stake in the system in some cases more than one person was interviewed simultaneously the total number of individuals interviewed was sixteen all representing individuals were high ranked administrators of their organizations and well aware of the system and their own organization s policies interviews lasted approximately 90 min and were performed face to face interviews were conducted in persian farsi from september to december 2017 2 2 sna sa and statistical analysis to consider the stakeholders characteristics quantitatively in the framework of the presented dss different indicators resulting from sa and sna can be employed to determine which indicator is more appropriate for this task the results of a statistical analysis first proposed by ahmadi et al 2019a is used the first goal here is to determine stakeholders influence on the process of decision making in other words the aim is to discover each stakeholder s power to influence the process as it is shown by ahmadi et al 2019a the power index computed by a systematic sa has the most statistical similarity with two indicators of sna method 1 in degree centrality and 2 beta centrality eqs 1 and 2 demonstrate how in degree and beta centralities are calculated for each stakeholder respectively freeman 1978 bonacich 1987 1 ic j i 1 n r ij 2 bc i j 1 n r ij α β b c j where ic j and bc i are the in degree centrality of the jth node and the beta centrality of the ith node respectively n is the number of nodes here stakeholders and r ij is the element in the ith row of the jth column of the adjacency matrix that is an n by n matrix bc j is the beta centrality of the jth node parameter α is the normalization parameter and β is a factor determining the amount of dependence of each node s beta centrality on the centrality of its adjacent nodes for more information about these metrics readers are referred to bonacich 1987 the following equation is used to calculate the sa power of each stakeholder ahmadi et al 2019a this power index is the arithmetic mean of all the values that all stakeholders assigned to the power of the interested stakeholder 3 p i j 1 n p ij n where p i is the power index of the ith stakeholder p ij is the amount of power that the jth stakeholder assigns to the ith stakeholder in their interviews and n is the number of stakeholders as can be seen in fig 1 in addition to the influence index another index is achieved by performing sa and that is the welfare index this index demonstrates how each alternative is according to the welfare of stakeholders and is determined based on the information gathered in the interviews detailed formulations of these indices will be discussed in the following parts 2 3 agent based simulation in this research to evaluate the results of implementing each management scenario an agent based simulation model is used this model simulates both the physical characteristics of the water resources of the study area and the behavior of the stakeholders in response to these characteristics in each simulation time step fig 2 as can be seen in fig 2 the employed simulation model consists of two sub models the first sub model applies water balance equations to simulate the physical characteristics of surface water and groundwater in every time step also it has another section to evaluate the nitrate concentration of the groundwater basin in this model the basin is divided into three sections or sub basins fig 3 and the interactions of these sections are taken into account by the use of darcy s law moreover the nitrate concentration is calculated for each section of the basin separately in each time step the model also considers the interactions of surface water and groundwater resources by examining the infiltration of surface water into the basin the second sub model simulates the actions and decisions of the agents in each time step in this sub model in every time step each agent takes their actions in response to the system status modeled by the first sub model and the consequences of their previous actions and decisions more technically each agent has a utility function or a reward function that measures their reward for taking their previous actions therefore knowing the rewards of their actions in prior time steps agents try to take better actions in other words they learn from their past behavior and use this learning to adjust their current behavior to maximize their reward the time step of the employed agent based model is one year and it is used to simulate the study area of this paper in a 25 year time period from 2017 to 2042 2 4 influence criteria and welfare indices as can be seen in fig 1 there are three indices applied in the presented dss in this section various variables with varied value scales are employed in the presented formulations therefore it is necessary to normalize all the variables before using them in the formulations of the given indices there are two general types of variables 1 positive variables in which higher amounts are better or more preferable e g the groundwater elevation 2 negative variables in which lower amounts are better or more preferable e g the groundwater nitrate concentration eqs 4 and 5 normalize the first and the second type of variables respectively 4 v i n v i v min v max v min 5 v i n v max v i v max v min where v i and v i n are the amounts of the ith variable before and after normalization respectively and v min and v max are the minimum and maximum amounts of the variable in the dataset as can be understood from eqs 4 and 5 the normalized quantities of all variables are between 0 and 1 and their higher amounts now for both types are preferable 2 4 1 influence index the influence index is one of the proposed indices and it employs the results of sa sna and the statistical analysis to represent the influencing power of the stakeholders quantitatively in other words the amount of this index demonstrates how each stakeholder is able to influence the decisions taken by the presented dss based on their power and position in the governance network stakeholders with higher values of influence index i e closer to 1 have more power and can influence the management system more easily as mentioned earlier three indicators affect the amount of this index 1 the power index calculated by sa 2 beta centrality and 3 in degree centrality both calculated by sna actually in the presented methodology it is assumed that the sa power index is the best indicator to represent the stakeholders power to influence the dss ahmadi et al 2019a moreover two other indicators from sna have been applied to present a more accurate and multidimensional formulation for the proposed influence index the following equation demonstrates how the influence index is calculated for stakeholders 6 ii i 5 sap i n 4 bc i n 3 ic i n 5 4 3 where ii i is the influence index of the ith stakeholder sap i n bc i n and ic i n are the normalized amount of sa power index beta centrality and in degree centrality of the ith stakeholder respectively it is worth noting that since all these three indicators are positive their higher amounts are better they all are normalized using eq 4 the coefficients of the equation i e numbers 5 4 and 3 are based on the statistical analysis between the indicators table 1 based on the results of the statistical analysis presented in table 1 sa power s similarity to the in degree centrality is 3 5 and to the beta centrality is 4 5 2 4 2 criteria index in the presented methodology 9 criteria have been considered to evaluate the outcomes of implementing each management scenario as can be seen in fig 1 criteria indices are calculated as results of simulating the implementation of management scenarios by the use of the agent based model by doing so it can be understood how distinct management scenarios affect the water resources of the study area as well as the governance network and social and economic aspects the criteria indices are presented in table 2 after normalization a higher value i e closer to 1 for each criterion index shows a more preferable situation see eqs 4 and 5 as demonstrated in table 2 different water related social and economic aspects are taken into account to compare and contrast various management scenarios 2 4 3 welfare index the welfare index simply shows how each criterion is important for each stakeholder as shown in the flowchart of the presented methodology the amount of this index is obtained from sa and is as follows 7 wi i j 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 where wi i j is the welfare index of the ith criterion for the jth stakeholder in other words it represents the priority and importance of the ith criterion for the jth stakeholder the welfare index takes discrete amounts from 0 to 1 based on what stakeholders stated about the role objectives and preferences of their organizations low values of this index show that the criterion is not important for the stakeholder for example if a water quality criterion e g nitrate 1 is not important at all for a stakeholder the amount of welfare index for this stakeholder and this criterion would be 0 2 5 social choice theory after calculating all the indices we can analyze the score of each scenario using the following equation 8 s k i 1 9 j 1 11 wi i j ii j ci i k n where s k is the score of the kth scenario with respect to the stakeholders welfare wi i j their influencing power ii j and the simulated consequences of implementing this scenario ci i k n it is worth noting that there are 9 criteria evaluating the consequences of the scenarios and 11 stakeholders that influence the dss in this study there are 63 different management scenarios therefore k ranges from 1 to 63 on the contrary to classic centralized dss in the proposed formulation of this paper all the stakeholders contribute to the decision making process regarding their rate of power and institutional objectives of their organizations 3 case study 3 1 study area as depicted in fig 3 the study area of this paper is kan river basin that is located in the west part of tehran surface runoff constituted of kan river and its sub flows groundwater basin as well as reclaimed wastewater are the main water resources of the area there are a variety of land use and water demands in this area like farmlands and orchards industrial zones urban green spaces residential areas and an artificial lake fig 3 the presence of divergent water demanding stakeholders with various required levels of water quality and quantity makes this area a challenging case of urban water resources management water shortage resulted from climate change and recent droughts together with a fast population growth of the area has inversely affected the sustainability of the system moreover industrial activities and major factories e g two huge automobile manufacturing factories along with increasing urban and agricultural wastewater production have made a lot of serious environmental issues in this developing area more details about the study area can be found in darbandsari et al 2017 khorasani et al 2018 and darbandsari et al 2020 the average annual precipitation of the study area is 230 mm year table 3 presents land uses water demands and their withdrawal from surface and groundwater resources 3 2 stakeholders system the system s boundary determination is the first step toward stakeholders identification the boundary of actors indicates the management level of those actors for instance by considering the highest management level in this study considering and analyzing lower management level stakeholders like individual gardeners and farmers is not necessary to identify the main stakeholders of the study area first some pre interviews were conducted with scholars who have studied the area by conducting these pre interviews the first list of important actors was created and the original interviews were started to make sure that all the essential stakeholders are taken into account snowball sampling was applied goodman 1961 eventually eleven stakeholders at the highest management level of the study area were identified and structured interviews were conducted with them to gather required information for sa and sna table 4 based on the organizational missions and objectives stakeholders are divided into three different categories protective developing and intermediate stakeholders these categories are especially important when analyzing stakeholders interests to assign welfare indices for example regarding the nature of developing stakeholders the sustainability of the water resources are less important for them than protective agents since the main objective of developing stakeholders is to maximize their profit and productivity but the main goal of protective agents is to protect the natural resources for more information about the stakeholders and their characteristics readers may refer to ahmadi et al 2019a 4 results 4 1 comprehensive management scenarios each comprehensive management scenario consists of three categories 1 water and wastewater allocation scenarios 2 water and wastewater pricing scenarios 3 scenarios related to the collection and treatment of municipal wastewater and river aquifer recharge by the treated wastewater collection and treatment of the urban wastewater in the study area depend on the implementation of the urban wastewater collection and treatment plan uwctp that is proposed by the policy maker stakeholders of the study area mainly trw if this plan will be implemented the treated wastewater can be allocated to different demands therefore comprehensive management scenarios can be divided into two classes 1 scenarios in which uwctp is implemented and 2 scenarios in which this plan won t be implemented i e business as usual bau if uwctp won t be implemented three scenarios can be considered for pricing so the second class of comprehensive scenarios has only 3 scenarios by assuming that uwctp will be implemented there are four scenarios in the first category which are represented by numbers 1 to 4 table 5 in the second category there are 3 different scenarios represented by numbers 1 to 3 table 6 and finally in the third category there are five scenarios shown by numbers 1 to 5 table 7 therefore there are 4 3 5 60 scenarios in the first class of comprehensive scenarios and altogether there are 60 3 63 comprehensive management scenarios a three digit number is assigned to each scenario to represent its three sub scenarios for example scenario 2 3 5 is constituted of the second allocation scenario table 5 third pricing scenario table 6 and fifth recharge scenario table 7 4 2 scenarios implementation and the system s simulation after developing the management scenarios each scenario is implemented in the simulation model and the results and consequences of the implementation of that scenario for the whole simulation period i e 25 years are determined by calculating nine criteria table 2 the results of this simulation are presented in table 8 4 3 scenarios rank ordering by the dss after calculating the results of implementing each management scenario in the form of nine criteria table 8 by means of the presented dss the score of each scenario is calculated table 9 as can be seen the differences between the scores are not very sharp and it is not surprising because all these scenarios are selected from a pool of scenarios therefore basically all of them were considered suitable scenarios having merits over other ones in other words there was a pre selection process and based on that these 63 suitable scenarios have been chosen and implemented in the simulation model and eventually compared by means of the proposed dss fig 4 shows the scores of rank ordered scenarios as can be seen in table 9 the best management scenario chosen by the proposed dss is scenario 3 1 5 in this scenario the urban plants wastewater will be allocated to industries green spaces and artificial recharge respectively table 5 it is worth mentioning that in this scenario all the wastewater allocated to artificial recharge will be discharged to the kan river table 7 in scenario 3 1 5 the annual price growth rate is 30 table 6 in this scenario the priority of groundwater allocation is with drink green space industry and agriculture respectively 5 discussion the first thing that can be understood from the results of the dss is that without implementing uwctp the conditions of the water resources in the future will not be satisfactory table 9 and fig 4 in other words scenarios 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 are the worst options on the other hand by implementing uwctp urban and suburban treatment plants will produce a considerable volume of reclaimed wastewater which can be allocated to varied demands it should be noted that this result is important in particular because on the contrary to outcomes of centralized procedures it s not based on the objectives and notions of a single leader zabojnik 2002 ghodsi et al 2016b zulkafli et al 2017 as mentioned earlier the best management scenario based on the results of the presented dss is scenario 3 1 5 however as can be seen in table 9 and fig 4 the score of the best scenario is not very different from the next high ranked scenarios therefore decision makers using the dss might consider a group or family of high ranked scenarios as suitable management alternatives it is worth mentioning that these scenarios are considered the best ones because of the utilities and preferences of all of the stakeholders in other words in the selection process of the presented dss all stakeholders have the right to influence the final decision moreover this right is according to their influencing power which is calculated precisely and systematically by considering more stakeholders in the presented methodology and by evaluating their influencing power more accurately the final outcome can be more exact and reliable however since managing water resources is always dealing with inherent and complicated uncertainties it can never be claimed that a management scenario is exactly the best option nasseri et al 2011 montanari et al 2013 ahmadi et al 2019b ahmadi and nasseri 2020 nevertheless in the presented methodology of this paper the scenarios with higher values of score can be regarded as suitable scenarios more reliably since they have not been selected by a central director i e dictatorship but by a subtle consensus between all the stakeholders warner 2006 reed et al 2009 ribot 2012 basco carrera et al 2017 it should be noted that in the presented framework quantitative characteristics of the stakeholders are taken into account systematically which is not done in previous similar studies kant lee 2004 kangas et al 2006 srdjevic 2007 mahjouri abbasi 2015 chiu et al 2020 in the presented methodology to rank order management scenarios distinctive environmental social and economic criteria are employed this multidimensional selection approach is another important aspect of the presented dss by considering more criteria in distinct categories the final outcome can be assumed more trustworthy for example by implementing the best scenarios in this study e g scenario 3 1 5 all 9 criteria would have an acceptable value table 8 therefore the water resources management system will be more sustainable and the stakeholders system will be more satisfactory and cooperative employing an agent based model coupling the stakeholders actions and decisions with physical characteristics of surface and groundwater resources has resulted in a rigorous simulation of implementing different management scenarios railsback et al 2006 schlüter pahl wostl 2007 for instance in scenario 3 1 5 all the treated wastewater will be allocated to the kan river this is not surprising since in the simulation model the interaction of surface and groundwater is taken into account and by recharging the river the basin will be recharged consequently 6 conclusion in this research a novel dss based on the sct that employs the results of a systematic sa and the insights of an sna in its framework was presented this dss uses the quantitative representations of the stakeholders characteristics in its formulations to ensure that the final decision is according to the notions and objectives of all the stakeholders not just the powerful ones moreover the proposed dss consists of an abm simulation model that simulates both the behavior of the agents i e stakeholders and the physical characteristics of the water resources in separate time steps this model was employed to simulate the outcomes of implementing each management alternative i e scenario in the simulation period 25 years as depicted in the flowchart of the proposed dss fig 1 it employs a variety of tools or sub models in its structure the presented dss is appropriate for modeling decentralized and multi stakeholder management systems especially natural resources systems that inherently consist of divergent stakeholders with various and even conflicting objectives and diverse rates of influencing power the framework of the presented methodology is flexible for instance by considering more stakeholders evaluation criteria and or management scenarios the final results would be more accurate and reliable furthermore different parts of the dss s framework like sa sna and abm can get more elaborated and even replaced by more detailed alternatives due to the changing climate developing cities and societies and growing population sustainable management of urban water resources is getting more complicated every year especially in developing regions like the middle east madani 2014 hameed et al 2019 old fashioned approaches to model and manage these crucial resources are not adequate or even reliable anymore and new procedures are needed which are able to consider fundamental complications and uncertainties of the problem stakeholder based methods and agent based models are maybe some of the best options to deal with this convoluted problem and avoid a possible crisis in the future credit authorship contribution statement arman

worldwide natural resources are managed by diverse stakeholders which have different institutional characteristics various levels of influencing power and dissimilar stakes and interests noting these heterogeneities centralized modeling of natural resources cannot be counted on as a rigorous representation of a management system and even may lead to misleading impressions therefore in recent years numerous studies have attempted to introduce decentralized and multi stakeholder management systems to model natural resources more accurately and manage them more sustainably hämäläinen et al 2001 warner 2006 hajkowicz 2008 reed et al 2009 ribot 2012 basco carrera et al 2017 water resources are maybe the most vital natural resources as the life on the earth would perish without them climate change population growth and intense chemical and biological pollution are only some of the obstacles that make the sustainable management of water resources challenging vörösmarty et al 2000 oki kanae 2006 knox et al 2012 boyd 2015 ahmadalipour et al 2019 moreover in recent years another problem has drawn the research community s attention how a water resource can be managed sustainably when there are diverse stakeholders with various and even conflicting objectives to address this problem in this research a new decision support system dss is presented which considers and formulates the characteristics and objectives of the stakeholders to rank order different management alternatives regarding increasing complexities of the problem developing a dss to address it is a challenging task mysiak et al 2005 especially dealing with polycentric and decentralized decision making contexts zulkafli et al 2017 the dss presented in this paper is based on social choice theory sct sen 1986 fishburn 2015 sct is the study of collective decision procedures that aggregates individual inputs into collective outputs the sct can be considered as a voting technique which especially in group decision contexts is close to multi criteria decision making mcdm recently much research in the field of environmental and natural resources management have implemented sct approaches to develop dss laukkanen et al 2002 kant lee 2004 srdjevic 2007 ghodsi et al 2016a estalaki et al 2016 mahjouri pourmand 2017 even though applying sct approaches to develop dss by these studies have resulted in a variety of methods to manage environmental and natural resources they rarely employ the stakeholders characteristics systematically and appropriately in their framework the methodology presented by this paper attempts to fill this research gap by applying outcomes of a systematic stakeholder analysis sa as well as insights of social network analysis sna in this study by utilizing the combination of these two methods in the structure of a dss the proposed approach aims to find the best management alternative that not only provides sustainability of water resources but also is able to shift the stakeholders network structure toward more participation and collaboration in natural resources management and especially water resources management decision alternatives usually are proposed as management scenarios watkins et al 2000 wollenberg et al 2000 lynam et al 2007 mahmoud et al 2011 dong et al 2013 after developing various scenarios in most studies a multi criteria decision analysis mcda is conducted to compare different scenarios and eventually to rank them srdjevic et al 2004 mendoza and martins 2006 weng et al 2010 huang et al 2011 although there are a variety of studies

2003 castelletti and soncini sessa 2007 to the best of the authors knowledge they have rarely considered the stakeholders characteristics in their framework quantitatively and systematically in the proposed methodology all stakeholders participate in the decision making process exactly according to their influencing power the influencing power index is calculated by utilizing two appropriate methods i e sa and sna this is a promising step toward introducing more realistic assumptions to decision making models which as munda 2008 mentioned is a crucial task to address contemporary issues of real world policy making depicting stakeholders network by the means of sna is proven to be a strong approach to understand existing institutional relations and information flows between them their positions in the network as well as the holistic structure of the network lienert et al 2013 caniato et al 2014 xu et al 2016 dos muchangos et al 2017 saint ville et al 2017 ingold et al 2018 skardi et al 2020 the use of sna in the realm of natural resources management has resulted in some promising insights to cast light on the management processes and reduce the inherent uncertainties about them bodin crona 2009 prell et al 2009 paletto et al 2015 yamaki 2017 giurca metz 2018 krupa et al 2018 in recent years sna has also been implemented in diverse water resources studies to elucidate the governance system kuzdas et al 2015 chaffin et al 2016 ogada et al 2017 it is shown in some studies that the combined use of sna with a systematic sa can boost their performance reciprocally prell et al 2009 lienert et al 2013 paletto et al 2015 dos muchangos et al 2017 in other words when combining sna with sa these two methods can enhance each other s effectiveness by compensating for each other s shortcomings ahmadi et al 2019a have drawn a statistical comparison between the features of sna and sa that demonstrates some interesting similarities in their structures in the current paper the results of this statistical analysis are employed to formulate a novel stakeholder based dss which considers the stakeholders characteristics needs and notions these quantitative characteristics that are obtained from sa and sna can augment the dss by taking the exact features of the decision makers into account one advantageous and powerful technique to simulate the stakeholders decision making process is agent based modeling abm bonabeau 2002 railsback et al 2006 the use of abm in complex management systems like the coupled social ecological systems has appeared to be a promising procedure to model these systems more precisely schlüter pahl wostl 2007 maes van passel 2017 karslen et al 2019 moreover in various water related studies like urban water supply and catchment water management abm is employed as the simulation tool to predict the effectiveness of different management policies and recommend management alternatives for improving the sustainability of water resources becu et al 2003 ali et al 2017 darbandsari et al 2017 darbandsari et al 2020 in this paper to evaluate distinctive management alternatives i e scenarios a variant of abm which simulates the decisions and actions of stakeholders is used in the employed agent based model agents learn from their prior actions and decisions a learning based simulation is a simple approach with a low computational cost that helps agents to learn how to act optimally by successively improving evaluations of the quality of their particular actions at particular states of the simulated system watkins dayan 1992 in the realm of water systems management mainly to deal with the curse of dimensionality and the curse of modeling the use of learning based algorithms like reinforcement learning and q learning is reported in diverse studies castelletti et al 2002 abolpour et al 2007 castelletti et al 2010 in the current paper a new dss has been developed and employed to rank order different management scenarios for an urban water system constituted of surface water groundwater and wastewater resources in a metropolitan area innovatively the results of a systematic sa along with the qualitative outcomes of an sna have been used in the framework of a social choice approach the outcomes of this new approach that directly and precisely considers the characteristics of all stakeholders in its formulation are discussed and evaluated and it is shown that it has merits in the following parts of the paper the methodology the case study results and discussions are presented the final part suggests some concluding remarks 2 methodology the flowchart illustrating the methodology is presented in fig 1 the following sections explain the proposed methodology by describing different parts of the flowchart 2 1 system identification and data collection as can be seen in the flowchart the first step of the methodology is system identification generally when dealing with a coupled social ecological system the process of identification can be divided into two major categories 1 identification of study area and 2 identification of actors ahmadi et al 2019a to identify the study area first the location and geographic boundary of the area should be determined precisely only after this determination the most critical environmental issues as well as the primary management challenges of the study area can be distinguished for instance the study area of this paper which is a developing urban area in the middle east suffers from various socio environmental problems such as intense population growth water pollution and conflicts among divergent stakeholders these problems make the decision making process complex therefore it is required to introduce new modeling approaches that are able to take various dimensions of the problem into account just like the study area the network of actors i e stakeholders has its own boundary to be determined accurately of course this boundary is not geographical but represents the management level of the stakeholders for instance when studying an environmental system if the objective of the research is to analyze the highest management level considering the low management level stakeholders like individual fishers or farmers would not be necessary in this paper by conducting six pre interviews with scholars who have studied the study area the first list of main actors was created the pre interviews were conducted from june to august 2017 to make sure that all relevant and important actors are identified snowball sampling was applied in both identification and data collection stages goodman 1961 on the contrary to a fixed selection method that results in a fixed list of actors expanding selection procedures like snowball sampling are less prone to omitting stakeholders and ties therefore are more reliable doreian and woodard 1992 in addition to pre interviews some physical characteristics of the study area were acknowledged to recognize the main organizations that hold a significant stake the physical characteristics include hydrological boundaries main water bodies and land use eventually in the highest management level eleven stakeholders were identified who could directly and significantly affect the management status of the system table 4 after identifying the main stakeholders the next step of collecting data was designing the survey the survey consisted of two major sections one providing data for sa and the other providing data for sna in the first section the interviewees are asked to characterize the role of their organization in the system to outline their institutional objectives and preferences and to specify the power and interest of their organization moreover interviewees are asked to determine the powers and interests of all other stakeholders in the second section of the survey interviewees are asked to characterize other stakeholders with whom they have formal i e institutional relationships to determine the magnitude of those relationships and their nature i e whether the relations are collaborative or conflictive to measure the magnitude of all quantitative questions a likert scale likert 1932 with five points is employed and in the case of sa questions i e the first section interviewees are asked to provide explanations on the chosen point in our case study after designing the survey eleven structured or standardized interviews were conducted with individuals representing eleven principal organizations that hold an important stake in the system in some cases more than one person was interviewed simultaneously the total number of individuals interviewed was sixteen all representing individuals were high ranked administrators of their organizations and well aware of the system and their own organization s policies interviews lasted approximately 90 min and were performed face to face interviews were conducted in persian farsi from september to december 2017 2 2 sna sa and statistical analysis to consider the stakeholders characteristics quantitatively in the framework of the presented dss different indicators resulting from sa and sna can be employed to determine which indicator is more appropriate for this task the results of a statistical analysis first proposed by ahmadi et al 2019a is used the first goal here is to determine stakeholders influence on the process of decision making in other words the aim is to discover each stakeholder s power to influence the process as it is shown by ahmadi et al 2019a the power index computed by a systematic sa has the most statistical similarity with two indicators of sna method 1 in degree centrality and 2 beta centrality eqs 1 and 2 demonstrate how in degree and beta centralities are calculated for each stakeholder respectively freeman 1978 bonacich 1987 1 ic j i 1 n r ij 2 bc i j 1 n r ij α β b c j where ic j and bc i are the in degree centrality of the jth node and the beta centrality of the ith node respectively n is the number of nodes here stakeholders and r ij is the element in the ith row of the jth column of the adjacency matrix that is an n by n matrix bc j is the beta centrality of the jth node parameter α is the normalization parameter and β is a factor determining the amount of dependence of each node s beta centrality on the centrality of its adjacent nodes for more information about these metrics readers are referred to bonacich 1987 the following equation is used to calculate the sa power of each stakeholder ahmadi et al 2019a this power index is the arithmetic mean of all the values that all stakeholders assigned to the power of the interested stakeholder 3 p i j 1 n p ij n where p i is the power index of the ith stakeholder p ij is the amount of power that the jth stakeholder assigns to the ith stakeholder in their interviews and n is the number of stakeholders as can be seen in fig 1 in addition to the influence index another index is achieved by performing sa and that is the welfare index this index demonstrates how each alternative is according to the welfare of stakeholders and is determined based on the information gathered in the interviews detailed formulations of these indices will be discussed in the following parts 2 3 agent based simulation in this research to evaluate the results of implementing each management scenario an agent based simulation model is used this model simulates both the physical characteristics of the water resources of the study area and the behavior of the stakeholders in response to these characteristics in each simulation time step fig 2 as can be seen in fig 2 the employed simulation model consists of two sub models the first sub model applies water balance equations to simulate the physical characteristics of surface water and groundwater in every time step also it has another section to evaluate the nitrate concentration of the groundwater basin in this model the basin is divided into three sections or sub basins fig 3 and the interactions of these sections are taken into account by the use of darcy s law moreover the nitrate concentration is calculated for each section of the basin separately in each time step the model also considers the interactions of surface water and groundwater resources by examining the infiltration of surface water into the basin the second sub model simulates the actions and decisions of the agents in each time step in this sub model in every time step each agent takes their actions in response to the system status modeled by the first sub model and the consequences of their previous actions and decisions more technically each agent has a utility function or a reward function that measures their reward for taking their previous actions therefore knowing the rewards of their actions in prior time steps agents try to take better actions in other words they learn from their past behavior and use this learning to adjust their current behavior to maximize their reward the time step of the employed agent based model is one year and it is used to simulate the study area of this paper in a 25 year time period from 2017 to 2042 2 4 influence criteria and welfare indices as can be seen in fig 1 there are three indices applied in the presented dss in this section various variables with varied value scales are employed in the presented formulations therefore it is necessary to normalize all the variables before using them in the formulations of the given indices there are two general types of variables 1 positive variables in which higher amounts are better or more preferable e g the groundwater elevation 2 negative variables in which lower amounts are better or more preferable e g the groundwater nitrate concentration eqs 4 and 5 normalize the first and the second type of variables respectively 4 v i n v i v min v max v min 5 v i n v max v i v max v min where v i and v i n are the amounts of the ith variable before and after normalization respectively and v min and v max are the minimum and maximum amounts of the variable in the dataset as can be understood from eqs 4 and 5 the normalized quantities of all variables are between 0 and 1 and their higher amounts now for both types are preferable 2 4 1 influence index the influence index is one of the proposed indices and it employs the results of sa sna and the statistical analysis to represent the influencing power of the stakeholders quantitatively in other words the amount of this index demonstrates how each stakeholder is able to influence the decisions taken by the presented dss based on their power and position in the governance network stakeholders with higher values of influence index i e closer to 1 have more power and can influence the management system more easily as mentioned earlier three indicators affect the amount of this index 1 the power index calculated by sa 2 beta centrality and 3 in degree centrality both calculated by sna actually in the presented methodology it is assumed that the sa power index is the best indicator to represent the stakeholders power to influence the dss ahmadi et al 2019a moreover two other indicators from sna have been applied to present a more accurate and multidimensional formulation for the proposed influence index the following equation demonstrates how the influence index is calculated for stakeholders 6 ii i 5 sap i n 4 bc i n 3 ic i n 5 4 3 where ii i is the influence index of the ith stakeholder sap i n bc i n and ic i n are the normalized amount of sa power index beta centrality and in degree centrality of the ith stakeholder respectively it is worth noting that since all these three indicators are positive their higher amounts are better they all are normalized using eq 4 the coefficients of the equation i e numbers 5 4 and 3 are based on the statistical analysis between the indicators table 1 based on the results of the statistical analysis presented in table 1 sa power s similarity to the in degree centrality is 3 5 and to the beta centrality is 4 5 2 4 2 criteria index in the presented methodology 9 criteria have been considered to evaluate the outcomes of implementing each management scenario as can be seen in fig 1 criteria indices are calculated as results of simulating the implementation of management scenarios by the use of the agent based model by doing so it can be understood how distinct management scenarios affect the water resources of the study area as well as the governance network and social and economic aspects the criteria indices are presented in table 2 after normalization a higher value i e closer to 1 for each criterion index shows a more preferable situation see eqs 4 and 5 as demonstrated in table 2 different water related social and economic aspects are taken into account to compare and contrast various management scenarios 2 4 3 welfare index the welfare index simply shows how each criterion is important for each stakeholder as shown in the flowchart of the presented methodology the amount of this index is obtained from sa and is as follows 7 wi i j 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 where wi i j is the welfare index of the ith criterion for the jth stakeholder in other words it represents the priority and importance of the ith criterion for the jth stakeholder the welfare index takes discrete amounts from 0 to 1 based on what stakeholders stated about the role objectives and preferences of their organizations low values of this index show that the criterion is not important for the stakeholder for example if a water quality criterion e g nitrate 1 is not important at all for a stakeholder the amount of welfare index for this stakeholder and this criterion would be 0 2 5 social choice theory after calculating all the indices we can analyze the score of each scenario using the following equation 8 s k i 1 9 j 1 11 wi i j ii j ci i k n where s k is the score of the kth scenario with respect to the stakeholders welfare wi i j their influencing power ii j and the simulated consequences of implementing this scenario ci i k n it is worth noting that there are 9 criteria evaluating the consequences of the scenarios and 11 stakeholders that influence the dss in this study there are 63 different management scenarios therefore k ranges from 1 to 63 on the contrary to classic centralized dss in the proposed formulation of this paper all the stakeholders contribute to the decision making process regarding their rate of power and institutional objectives of their organizations 3 case study 3 1 study area as depicted in fig 3 the study area of this paper is kan river basin that is located in the west part of tehran surface runoff constituted of kan river and its sub flows groundwater basin as well as reclaimed wastewater are the main water resources of the area there are a variety of land use and water demands in this area like farmlands and orchards industrial zones urban green spaces residential areas and an artificial lake fig 3 the presence of divergent water demanding stakeholders with various required levels of water quality and quantity makes this area a challenging case of urban water resources management water shortage resulted from climate change and recent droughts together with a fast population growth of the area has inversely affected the sustainability of the system moreover industrial activities and major factories e g two huge automobile manufacturing factories along with increasing urban and agricultural wastewater production have made a lot of serious environmental issues in this developing area more details about the study area can be found in darbandsari et al 2017 khorasani et al 2018 and darbandsari et al 2020 the average annual precipitation of the study area is 230 mm year table 3 presents land uses water demands and their withdrawal from surface and groundwater resources 3 2 stakeholders system the system s boundary determination is the first step toward stakeholders identification the boundary of actors indicates the management level of those actors for instance by considering the highest management level in this study considering and analyzing lower management level stakeholders like individual gardeners and farmers is not necessary to identify the main stakeholders of the study area first some pre interviews were conducted with scholars who have studied the area by conducting these pre interviews the first list of important actors was created and the original interviews were started to make sure that all the essential stakeholders are taken into account snowball sampling was applied goodman 1961 eventually eleven stakeholders at the highest management level of the study area were identified and structured interviews were conducted with them to gather required information for sa and sna table 4 based on the organizational missions and objectives stakeholders are divided into three different categories protective developing and intermediate stakeholders these categories are especially important when analyzing stakeholders interests to assign welfare indices for example regarding the nature of developing stakeholders the sustainability of the water resources are less important for them than protective agents since the main objective of developing stakeholders is to maximize their profit and productivity but the main goal of protective agents is to protect the natural resources for more information about the stakeholders and their characteristics readers may refer to ahmadi et al 2019a 4 results 4 1 comprehensive management scenarios each comprehensive management scenario consists of three categories 1 water and wastewater allocation scenarios 2 water and wastewater pricing scenarios 3 scenarios related to the collection and treatment of municipal wastewater and river aquifer recharge by the treated wastewater collection and treatment of the urban wastewater in the study area depend on the implementation of the urban wastewater collection and treatment plan uwctp that is proposed by the policy maker stakeholders of the study area mainly trw if this plan will be implemented the treated wastewater can be allocated to different demands therefore comprehensive management scenarios can be divided into two classes 1 scenarios in which uwctp is implemented and 2 scenarios in which this plan won t be implemented i e business as usual bau if uwctp won t be implemented three scenarios can be considered for pricing so the second class of comprehensive scenarios has only 3 scenarios by assuming that uwctp will be implemented there are four scenarios in the first category which are represented by numbers 1 to 4 table 5 in the second category there are 3 different scenarios represented by numbers 1 to 3 table 6 and finally in the third category there are five scenarios shown by numbers 1 to 5 table 7 therefore there are 4 3 5 60 scenarios in the first class of comprehensive scenarios and altogether there are 60 3 63 comprehensive management scenarios a three digit number is assigned to each scenario to represent its three sub scenarios for example scenario 2 3 5 is constituted of the second allocation scenario table 5 third pricing scenario table 6 and fifth recharge scenario table 7 4 2 scenarios implementation and the system s simulation after developing the management scenarios each scenario is implemented in the simulation model and the results and consequences of the implementation of that scenario for the whole simulation period i e 25 years are determined by calculating nine criteria table 2 the results of this simulation are presented in table 8 4 3 scenarios rank ordering by the dss after calculating the results of implementing each management scenario in the form of nine criteria table 8 by means of the presented dss the score of each scenario is calculated table 9 as can be seen the differences between the scores are not very sharp and it is not surprising because all these scenarios are selected from a pool of scenarios therefore basically all of them were considered suitable scenarios having merits over other ones in other words there was a pre selection process and based on that these 63 suitable scenarios have been chosen and implemented in the simulation model and eventually compared by means of the proposed dss fig 4 shows the scores of rank ordered scenarios as can be seen in table 9 the best management scenario chosen by the proposed dss is scenario 3 1 5 in this scenario the urban plants wastewater will be allocated to industries green spaces and artificial recharge respectively table 5 it is worth mentioning that in this scenario all the wastewater allocated to artificial recharge will be discharged to the kan river table 7 in scenario 3 1 5 the annual price growth rate is 30 table 6 in this scenario the priority of groundwater allocation is with drink green space industry and agriculture respectively 5 discussion the first thing that can be understood from the results of the dss is that without implementing uwctp the conditions of the water resources in the future will not be satisfactory table 9 and fig 4 in other words scenarios 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 are the worst options on the other hand by implementing uwctp urban and suburban treatment plants will produce a considerable volume of reclaimed wastewater which can be allocated to varied demands it should be noted that this result is important in particular because on the contrary to outcomes of centralized procedures it s not based on the objectives and notions of a single leader zabojnik 2002 ghodsi et al 2016b zulkafli et al 2017 as mentioned earlier the best management scenario based on the results of the presented dss is scenario 3 1 5 however as can be seen in table 9 and fig 4 the score of the best scenario is not very different from the next high ranked scenarios therefore decision makers using the dss might consider a group or family of high ranked scenarios as suitable management alternatives it is worth mentioning that these scenarios are considered the best ones because of the utilities and preferences of all of the stakeholders in other words in the selection process of the presented dss all stakeholders have the right to influence the final decision moreover this right is according to their influencing power which is calculated precisely and systematically by considering more stakeholders in the presented methodology and by evaluating their influencing power more accurately the final outcome can be more exact and reliable however since managing water resources is always dealing with inherent and complicated uncertainties it can never be claimed that a management scenario is exactly the best option nasseri et al 2011 montanari et al 2013 ahmadi et al 2019b ahmadi and nasseri 2020 nevertheless in the presented methodology of this paper the scenarios with higher values of score can be regarded as suitable scenarios more reliably since they have not been selected by a central director i e dictatorship but by a subtle consensus between all the stakeholders warner 2006 reed et al 2009 ribot 2012 basco carrera et al 2017 it should be noted that in the presented framework quantitative characteristics of the stakeholders are taken into account systematically which is not done in previous similar studies kant lee 2004 kangas et al 2006 srdjevic 2007 mahjouri abbasi 2015 chiu et al 2020 in the presented methodology to rank order management scenarios distinctive environmental social and economic criteria are employed this multidimensional selection approach is another important aspect of the presented dss by considering more criteria in distinct categories the final outcome can be assumed more trustworthy for example by implementing the best scenarios in this study e g scenario 3 1 5 all 9 criteria would have an acceptable value table 8 therefore the water resources management system will be more sustainable and the stakeholders system will be more satisfactory and cooperative employing an agent based model coupling the stakeholders actions and decisions with physical characteristics of surface and groundwater resources has resulted in a rigorous simulation of implementing different management scenarios railsback et al 2006 schlüter pahl wostl 2007 for instance in scenario 3 1 5 all the treated wastewater will be allocated to the kan river this is not surprising since in the simulation model the interaction of surface and groundwater is taken into account and by recharging the river the basin will be recharged consequently 6 conclusion in this research a novel dss based on the sct that employs the results of a systematic sa and the insights of an sna in its framework was presented this dss uses the quantitative representations of the stakeholders characteristics in its formulations to ensure that the final decision is according to the notions and objectives of all the stakeholders not just the powerful ones moreover the proposed dss consists of an abm simulation model that simulates both the behavior of the agents i e stakeholders and the physical characteristics of the water resources in separate time steps this model was employed to simulate the outcomes of implementing each management alternative i e scenario in the simulation period 25 years as depicted in the flowchart of the proposed dss fig 1 it employs a variety of tools or sub models in its structure the presented dss is appropriate for modeling decentralized and multi stakeholder management systems especially natural resources systems that inherently consist of divergent stakeholders with various and even conflicting objectives and diverse rates of influencing power the framework of the presented methodology is flexible for instance by considering more stakeholders evaluation criteria and or management scenarios the final results would be more accurate and reliable furthermore different parts of the dss s framework like sa sna and abm can get more elaborated and even replaced by more detailed alternatives due to the changing climate developing cities and societies and growing population sustainable management of urban water resources is getting more complicated every year especially in developing regions like the middle east madani 2014 hameed et al 2019 old fashioned approaches to model and manage these crucial resources are not adequate or even reliable anymore and new procedures are needed which are able to consider fundamental complications and uncertainties of the problem stakeholder based methods and agent based models are maybe some of the best options to deal with this convoluted problem and avoid a possible crisis in the future credit authorship contribution statement arman

5224,coal mining could cause drastic drop of groundwater level obvious decrease of river base flow and total runoff in dry season in addition the subsidence of coal mine goaf and water conducting fissures also could cause the loss of surface water how to quantitatively estimate the impact of coal mining activities on runoff there becomes a major challenge this study focuses on the kuye river catchment a major coal mining region in china where accumulative anomaly analysis the ordered clustering and the pettitt test are carried out two abrupt change points are identified in 1979 and 1997 therefore three stages are divided pre 1979 minimum human activities 1980 1997 the soil and water conservation and 1998 2017 the joint impacts by soil and water conservation and coal mining the effects of coal mining on runoff are further estimated using simhyd pml hydrological model that fully considers vegetation dynamics its simulation results show that from 1998 to 2017 coal mining reduced the total surface runoff by 29 35 for wangdaohengta sub catchment by 55 41 for shenmu sub catchment and by 49 44 the entire kuye river catchment the coal mine driven runoff reduction is generally large in the years and seasons with large runoff however the environmental impact process is not uniform the research ideas and methods reasonably separate the impact of dividing two human activities on the runoff process which lays a solid foundation for future research keywords coal mining impact water climate change soil and water conservation simhyd pml 1 introduction catchment runoff is not only an important form of natural water body but also an important component of hydrological processes runoff determines the evolution of water cycle system nowadays it is very important to study runoff process because of the drastic climate change and human activities arenas lago et al 2013 2014 cerqueira et al 2011 2012 civeira et al 2016a b c many catchments have experienced significant attenuation of runoff due to the influences of climate change and human activities destouni et al 2013 feng et al 2016 guo et al 2019 liu and zheng 2004 ning et al 2016 sorg et al 2012 piao et al 2007 which would cause large effects on water cycle ecosystem socio economical system and so on due to highly increasing population rate and rapid land use change many researchers have devoted to understand the runoff process under the influence of anthropogenic and human activities which involve land use change soil and water conservation engineering construction of reservoirs water diversion for agriculture coal mining domestic and industrial water consumption etc deng and chen 2017 fan et al 2010 feng et al 2018 li et al 2017 liu et al 2017 pan et al 2018 wang et al 2019 wei et al 2017 xu et al 2014 yan et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 zhao et al 2014 xia et al 2014 coal mining is one of important human activities that influences water resources by changing hydrogeological conditions and by large amount of water consumption cutruneo et al 2014 dias et al 2014 duarte et al 2019 due to the cracks formed in the roof of the coal mine the water in the aquifer is introduced into the pit which leads to the change of groundwater from horizontal runoff and drainage to vertical leakage this could cause drastic drop of groundwater level obvious decrease of river base flow and spring flow in addition the subsidence of coal mine goaf and water conducting fissures also could cause the loss of surface water therefore coal mining has obvious effects on surface runoff it is necessary to carry out quantitative research on investigating the effects of coal mining on runoff processes and to evaluate the hydrological consequences of coal mining activities gredilla et al 2017 2019 gasparotto et al 2018 table 1 summarizes some relative studies about the effects of coal mining on surface runoff in china ping et al 2017 applied the mike she model to quantitatively analyze the impact of coal mining and climate change on river runoff in the gujiao mining area shanxi province of china liang et al 2013 used the climate elasticity method and the simhyd hydrological model to research the impact of human activities and climate change on runoff during 1960 2006 in the kuye river catchment guo et al 2016 2017 2019a b used the monthly water balance model mwbm and statistical regression to quantitatively analyze the impacts of coal mining climate change and soil conservation on river runoff it was found that coal mining is the main cause of the reduction of runoff after 1997 li et al 2016 utilized swat method to analyze the causes of the reduction of streamflow since 1997 in the yellow river wang et al 2015 performed the simhyd model to study the effects of human activities on runoff in the kuye river catchment most of the studies showed that human activities mainly including soil and water conservation projects and coal mining in the kuye river catchment have significant impacts on catchment runoff the above mentioned studies used the period without strong human activities as the base period however due to the multiple impacts of different types of human activities these studies did not isolate the effects of coal mining on surface runoff additionally the process of the impact of coal mining on runoff was not explicitly investigated because most of studies only used traditional precipitation runoff modelling without considering vegetation change impacts on runoff to further clarify the effect of coal mining on surface runoff this study uses the simhyd pml model to simulate the impact of coal mining on the runoff process in the kuye river catchment and to separate the effect of coal mining from the soil and water conservation engineering assuming that vegetation change caused by the soil and water conservation can be taken as a part of simhyd pml modelling processes the specific objectives of this paper include to i separate the effect of coal mining on surface runoff from the soil and water conservation engineering ii quantitatively simulate the impact of coal mining on runoff process with the simhyd pml model and iii compare the simhyd pml model method and the double mass curve method in the estimation of the reduction of runoff 2 study region and data 2 1 study region the kuye river is a first order tributary of the middle yellow river this catchment is located between 38 22 39 50 n and 109 30 110 45 e it belongs to arid to semi arid climate wang et al 2015 it has mean precipitation of 386 mm year and mean air temperature of 7 9 c the kuye river is 242 km long with a drainage area of 8 706 km2 the catchment has two major tributaries the wulanmulun and the boniuchuan in its upper reaches the furthest downstream hydrometric station is wenjiachuan which is located in the 6 9 km upstream of the confluence of the kuye river and the yellow river three hydrological stations were used in this study wangdaohengta shenmu and wenjiachuan the locations of the three hydrological stations precipitation stations and digital elevation of the kuye river catchment are described in fig 1 similar coal mining areas were previously reported by several authors from others countries martinello et al 2014 nordin et al 2018 oliveira et al 2014 2017 ribeiro et al 2013 sehn et al 2016 silva et al 2010 2011a b in order to curb the serious soil erosion in the loess plateau large scale comprehensive management of soil and water conservation was carried out in the kuye river catchment in the 1970s and 1980s especially after 1979 the area of soil and water conservation increased significantly before 1970 human activities in this catchment was small fig 2 shows the changes of the soil and water conservation area and leaf area index lai of kuye river catchment the area involved in the soil and water conservation project increased from 598 km2 in 1979 to 1682 km2 in 1996 and increased to 3740 km2 in 2010 the forest and grass cover fraction in the catchment increased to 46 3 in 2010 the most obvious change resulting from the soil and water conservation projects is the significant increase in vegetation factional cover which lead to a significant reduction of river runoff lane et al 2005 brown et al 2013 the coal resources are rich in the kuye river catchment the famous shenfu dongsheng coalfield is located in the middle of the valley according to the geological survey data and the studies of guo et al 2017 and li et al 2017 shenfu dongsheng coalfield reserves are 2363 108 tons accounting for 1 4 of chinese coal reserves the coalfield area is 2756 km2 among of which 2482 km2 are located in the kuye river catchment the shenfu dongsheng coalfield coal mine resources are formed in the jurassic with shallow depth and many places buried less than 100 m so it is easy to exploit coal quality is excellent and coal seams are stable heavily open cut and underground mining were conducted since the launch of the western development strategy in china in 2000 guo et al 2019a 2017 fig 3 summarizes the statistics of raw coal production in the kuye river catchment which is from the statistic yearbooks for shaanxi province sysp and inner mongolia autonomous region imar it is clear that coal production has a rapid growth trend the average annual production was less than 0 1 108 tons per year in the early 1990 s and increased to 4 1 108 tons in 2017 fig 4 shows the changes of the area of the open pit mine and surface coal mines during the period of 1997 2017 which are obtained from the google earth engine the area of the open pit coal mines and the surface coal mines increased from 41 9 km2 in 1997 to 295 2 km2 in 2017 over the same period the kuye river became ephemeral as a result of excessive coal mining and increasing domestic water consumption liang et al 2013 guo et al 2019a nearby villagers now have to travel several miles to collect suitable drinking water 2 2 data daily runoff data of the three hydrological stations were collated from the hydrological yearbook of the people s republic of china runoff data for wenjiachuan and shenmu ranges from 1956 to 2017 and that for wangdaohengta ranges from 1960 to 2017 monthly precipitation data at 59 stations for the period of 1956 2017 were collated from the hydrological yearbook of the people s republic of china fig 1 which were used in the precipitation runoff double mass curve method the simhyd pml model was driven by daily meteorological data of precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature incoming solar radiation and actual vapor pressure these daily forcing data are available from 1981 to 2017 and were obtained from the climate meteorological forcing dataset cmfd http data tpdc ac cn yang and he 2018 he et al 2020 with 0 1 0 1 10 km 10 km spatial resolution the cmfd dataset was generated using the international existing princeton reanalysis data gldas data gewex srb radiation data and trmm precipitation data together with the conventional meteorological observation data of the china meteorological administration the cmfd data has better quality than the reanalyzed data in the study area chen et al 2011 yang et al 2010 except for the climate forcing data the simhyd pml model requires remote sensing lai land cover and albedo data that are used to calculate actual evapotranspiration eta with the penman monteith leuning method leuning et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 the lai data from 1981 to 2017 derived from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr were obtained from national earth system science data center xiao et al 2014 xiao et al 2016 its temporal and spatial resolutions are 8 day and 8 km respectively the land cover data required to estimate aerodynamic conductance are from the 2000 2017 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover product which were obtained from the oak ridge national laboratory distributed active archive center friedl et al 2010 its temporal and spatial resolutions are 1 year and 500 m respectively this product has 17 vegetation classes which are defined according to the international geosphere biosphere programme albedo data required to calculate net radiation were obtained from the 8 day modis mcd43b bidirectional reflectance distribution function product at 1 km resolution since the lai and albedo data are input into the model on a daily time scale like the meteorological data the sg filter algorithm is used to smooth the 8 day time scale lai and albedo data and then to generate daily data all input data were aggregated to catchment scale for hydrological simulations 3 methods 3 1 trends analysis and abrupt change detection five years moving average and the mann kendall test hamed and rao 1998 was used to analyze the trends of annual streamflow the cumulative anomaly analysis wang et al 2012 and the ordered clustering and the pettitt test martinez et al 2010 were applied to detect the abrupt change years of streamflow variables using these methods time periods without human activity with significant effects of soil water conservation engineering and with significant effects of coal mining in the kuye river catchment can be distinguished 3 2 double mass curve method after the abrupt change point of the runoff is identified the time period affected only by soil and water conservation projects is taken as the reference period and the period of joint influence of soil water conservation engineering and coal mining is taken as the impact period first a linear relationship between precipitation and runoff in the reference period is established assuming that the strength of the soil and water conservation project during the impact period is the same as that during the reference period then the linear relationship is extended to the entire impact period the difference between the measured runoff and the simulated runoff is considered as the impact of coal mining on the runoff the double mass curve dmc method is currently the simplest most intuitive and most extensively used method for the analysis of the consistency or long term evolution of hydrometeorological elements it was first used by american scholar c f merriam 1937 to analyze the consistency of precipitation data in the us susquehanna catchment the principle is that the two variables are gradually accumulated at the same time length one variable is used as the horizontal coordinate and the other variable is used as the vertical coordinate gao et al 2017 yue et al 2003 the basic method of establishing a double cumulative curve there are two variables x reference variable or benchmark variable and y tested variable during the observation period of n years there are observations xi and yi where i 1 2 3 n first the variable x and the variable y are calculated year by year to obtain respective cumulative values and a new yearly cumulative sequence xi and yi where i 1 2 3 n which is 1 x i i 1 n x i 2 y i i 1 n y i then the relationship between the cumulative values of the points corresponding to the two variables is plotted in the cartesian coordinate system generally the variable to be tested is the ordinate the y axis the reference variable or the benchmark variable is the abscissa the x axis for the double mass curve of runoff and precipitation if the slope of the straight line does not deviate significantly it indicates that human activities have marginal effect on river runoff and vice versa indicating that human activities have a noticeable effect the point at which the slope changes significantly corresponds to the year in which the runoff begins to change significantly 3 3 simhyd pml model the simhyd model is widely used in runoff simulation and forecasting zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 chiew et al 2010 li et al 2012 li et al 2013 li et al 2014 this study uses the revised version of the simhyd model simhyd pml zhang and chiew 2009 li et al 2009 li and zhang 2017 zhou et al 2013 fig 5 shows the structure and parameter meaning of the simhyd pml which replaces the original eta sub models using the penman monteith leuning eta model the advantage of the simhyd pml model over the simhyd model is that the simhyd pml model added dynamic vegetation module into the model which enhances the simulation of runoff response to the variation of land surface vegetation this feature is important because it can consider the hydrological changes caused by vegetation change assuming there is the same effect mechanism of vegetation change due to the soil and water conservation engineering on the runoff between the reference period and the impact period the simulated runoff in the impact period can be regarded as the runoff without coal mining effects comparing which with the actual runoff observations the impact of coal mining on runoff can be estimated 3 4 model calibration and simulation a global optimizer the particle swarm optimization pso toolbox in matlab is used to optimize the parameters of the simhyd pml rainfall runoff model the pso method is firstly presented by eberhart and kennedy inspired from the behavior of schools of fish or flocks of birds eberhart and kennedy 1995 in order to quantitatively distinguish the impact of coal mining and soil and water conservation projects on the runoff process in the simhyd pml model 1981 1997 was defined as the reference period and 1998 2017 was defined as the impact period simulation period based on the calculated point of abrupt change the hydrological model is calibrated for the period 1981 1997 of which the first two years 1981 1982 used for warm up the genetic algorithm used a population size of 500 and the maximum generation of 100 for searching the optimum point the objective function of the model in this study is 3 f 1 n s e 5 l n 1 b i a s 2 5 nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 is the nash sutcliffe efficiency expressed as 4 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs and bias is 5 bias i 1 n q sim i i 1 n q obs i i 1 n q obs i where qsim and qobs are the simulated and observed monthly runoff respectively q obs is the arithmetic mean of the observed monthly runoff i is the ith month and n is the total number of months in calibration period the nse value is used to evaluate the effect of the model with maximum nse 1 0 which indicates perfect agreement between all of the modelled and observed monthly runoffs the bias measures the error between the modelled and observed total runoff with bias 0 which indicates that the mean simulated monthly runoff is the same as the mean observed monthly runoff this study assumes that the same amount of bias caused during the calibration period will be transformed to the simulation period and this bias is then deducted when calculating mining impacts on runoff in this way we can minimize the impact of hydrological model error in analyzing coal mining impact on runoff in the simulation period 4 results 4 1 runoff trend analysis trend analysis of the annual runoff of three hydrological stations using the 5 years moving average method the analysis results are shown in fig 6 overall the annual runoff on the three hydrological stations shows a decreasing trend in 1956 2017 or in 1960 2017 the mann kendall test for the trends of annual streamflow shows that the z values of the three hydrological stations are 5 81 5 65 and 5 59 from a to c respectively therefore they all show a significant downward trend and the degree of decline is consistent 4 2 abrupt change detection of runoff fig 7 and fig 8 summarize the accumulative anomaly analysis the ordered clustering and the pettitt test applied to detect the abrupt change years of streamflow variables it can be seen from the figures that the two abrupt change points are consistent at the three hydrological stations the annual runoff had an increasing trend before 1979 and then fluctuated slightly from 1980 to 1997 according to the two abrupt change points the annual streamflow series are divided into 3 stages 1956 1979 1980 1997 and 1998 2017 respectively according to the start time of the soil and water conservation engineering and the coal mining the period of 1956 1979 is considered with minimum human activities the period from 1980 to 1997 is the soil and water conservation effect period the period from 1998 to 2017 is the joint impact period of soil and water conservation and coal mine development 4 3 precipitation runoff relationship in the three periods according to the result shown in section 4 2 the study period is divided into three periods 1956 1979 or 1960 1979 1980 1997 and 1998 2017 fig 9 shows the precipitation runoff relationship of the three periods for each catchment it is clear that the precipitation runoff relationship is significantly changed in the three periods and the runoff is significantly reduced especially for the period of 1998 2017 therefore it is reasonable to split the whole period into three 4 4 runoff reduction estimation with the precipitation runoff double mass curve method the abrupt characteristics of the runoff series are further verified by the precipitation runoff double mass curve fig 10 two significant abrupt changes occur in the kuye river catchment in 1979 and 1997 taking the entire kuye river catchment as an example fig 10 c the slope from 1956 to 1979 was 0 0175 the slope decreased to 0 0139 in 1980 1997 and the slope in 1998 2017 was further reduced to 0 0052 it is seen that runoff is greatly reduced in such a short period of time there were no abrupt changes in precipitation and temperature data in the kuye river catchment in 1956 2017 and therefore that natural factors were not the major cause of the abrupt decrease in runoff therefore coal mining may be the main reason for this dramatic reduction in fig 10 c if the cumulative line of 1956 1979 is extended to 1980 1997 one can get a cumulative line that is not affected by soil and water conservation projects through this line the total runoff from 1980 to 1997 was calculated to be 110 8 108m3 compared with the actual total runoff of 90 8 108m3 the total runoff was reduced by 18 0 that is to say due to the impact of soil and water conservation projects the total runoff of the entire kuye river catchment in 1980 1997 decreased by 18 0 in the same way taking 1981 1997 as the reference period the cumulative line from 1981 to 1997 was extended to 2017 through this line the total runoff of the entire kuye river catchment from 1998 to 2017 was calculated to be 111 7 108m3 and the actual total runoff was 46 7 108m3 thereby runoff decreased by 58 2 this method assumes there is the same effects of the soil and water conservation project on runoff during 1981 1997 and 1998 2017 therefore the 58 2 reduction is the amount of coal mining impact on runoff the actual total runoff of shenmu sub catchment from 1998 to 2017 was 37 8 108m3 and the calculated total runoff was 87 2 108m3 thereby the runoff decreased by 56 7 the actual total runoff of wangdaohengta sub catchment from 1998 to 2017 was 17 0 108m3 and the calculated total runoff was 35 8 108m3 thereby runoff decreased by 52 6 4 5 runoff reduction estimated with the simhyd pml model in order to quantitatively distinguish the effect of soil and water conservation and the impact of coal mining on runoff process the simhyd pml model is used to simulate the monthly runoff process in the three sub catchments table 2 shows the runoff simulation results in reference period include warm up 1981 1982 calibration 1983 1992 and validation 1993 1997 periods and impact period simulation period 1998 2017 the nse values in the calibration period were 0 58 0 53 and 0 62 for wangdaohengta shenmu and wenjiachuan respectively the bias values were 0 094 0 024 and 0 021 respectively the nse values in the validation period were 0 64 0 63 and 0 72 for wangdaohengta shenmu and wenjiachuan respectively the bias values were 0 095 0 113 and 0 063 respectively these statistical results are overall good according to the good performance metrics 0 65 nse 0 75 and 0 1 bias 0 15 given by moriasi et al 2007 therefore the simhyd pml model has a good ability for simulating hydrological processes in the three sub catchments fig 11 shows the monthly runoff time series of simulated and observed results for the three sub catchments the simhyd pml simluations show that the observed monthly runoff is smaller than the simulated for all the three sub catchments and for the period of 1998 to 2017 which indicates that coal mine exploitation reduces the surface runoff for wenjiachuan sub catchment the simulated runoff is 3 47 larger than the actual runoff in the calibration period the simulated total runoff during the simulation period was 977 3 mm and the actual runoff was 539 5 mm which was reduced by 44 80 if the effect of the model bias on the calibration period is taken into account the reduction is 49 44 similarly when the bias on the calibration period is deducted in the simulation period of 1998 2017 the coal mining has reduced the total surface runoff by 55 41 for shenmu sub catchment and by 29 35 for wangdaohengta sub catchment integrating the monthly runoff simulation into the annual scale fig 12 shows the comparisons of annual runoff between the simulated and the observations the amount of runoff reduction is related to precipitation generally the larger the annual precipitation the larger the simulated annual runoff and the greater the runoff reduction 5 discussion 5 1 comparing the double mass curve method with the simhyd pml model it is interesting to compare the simhyd pml modelling results with the lumped estimates from the double mass curve method for the latter the linear regression of precipitation runoff in the reference period is extended to the impacted period the difference between the observed runoff and the estimated from the linear regression in the impacted period is regarded as the amount of coal mine impact on runoff an assumption to use this method that the intensity and strength of the soil and water conservation project in the impact period is as same as those in the reference period furthermore the catchment runoff process cannot be simulated and calculated year by year therefore this method does not really separate the soil and water conservation effect from the coal mining activity nevertheless this method can provide reference to check simhyd pml simulated results fig 13 according to fig 4 coal mining in the kuye river catchment is basically from the shenmu sub catchment so the impact of coal mining on runoff in the shenmu sub catchment should be the largest the runoff reductions obtained by the two methods on wangdaohengta sub catchment are noticeably different from fig 4 it can be seen that coal mining activities in the wangdaohengta sub catchment are relatively small so the runoff reduction should be small these two reasonings suggest that the results obtained from the simhyd pml model are more credible than the precipitation runoff double mass curve method in addition since this study used the period of 1981 1997 as the reference period the soil and water conservation project has been affected during this period the application of precipitation runoff double mass curve method assumes that the strength of soil and water conservation projects in 1998 2017 is the same as that in 1981 1997 therefore the precipitation runoff double mass curve method cannot quantitatively separate the effects of coal mining on runoff from soil and water conservation projects another disadvantage of the precipitation runoff double mass curve method is that it cannot simulate the process of the impact of coal mining on runoff guo et al 2016 2017 2019a b applied various statistical analysis methods to study the impact of coal mining on the runoff in the kuye river catchment they also did not explain the impact of coal mining on the runoff in terms of process and mechanism the statistical method of precipitation runoff relationship can only consider all human activities together however how to quantitatively distinguish the impact of each human activity on the runoff process has become a burning issue such as land use change soil and water conservation measures construction of reservoirs water diversion for agriculture coal mining domestic and industrial water consumption therefore it is imperative to develop a hydrological model that can simulate a variety of human activities integrating the impact of various human activities on runoff into the hydrological model is the future direction of development in this paper the simhyd pml model is used to separate the coal mining from the soil and water conservation project i e vegetation dynamics impact on hydrological processes which lays a solid foundation for future research 5 2 applicability of the simhyd pml model the daily runoff process of the three sub catchments in the kuye river catchment is simulated the parameters are determined according to the nse value of the monthly runoff and the bias value the results are shown in tables 2 and 3 and fig 14 overall the performance of the simhyd pml model is satisfactory actually liang et al 2013 used the original simhyd model for modelling in kuye river catchment they took the reference period from 1960 to 1979 and regarded coal mining as all human activities nse in the calibration and validation periods was 0 80 and 0 78 respectively bias in the calibration and validation period was 1 8 and 4 6 respectively this shows that the original simhyd model is also applicable in the kuye river catchment the reason of the relatively low nse is mainly because the kuye river catchment is located in a semi arid area with less precipitation runoff in the catchment is dominated by super osmotic flow in addition the geomorphic types of the kuye river catchment are diverse and the terrain is complex and variable there are three typical types of landforms in the catchment from the upstream ordos platform to the mu us desert to the loess plateau especially in the mu us desert the process of flow and convergence is complicated it is well known that all hydrological models are relatively poor for simulating water cycle in the desert region in addition since this paper is mainly to separate the impact of coal mining on runoff from the soil and water conservation project we chose 1981 1997 as the reference period however the soil and water conservation project during this period includes not only afforestation but also the construction of terraces check dams and other human activities that changed the topographic conditions among them this study only considers vegetation impacts i e afforestation on runoff which may result in the uncertainty of calibration and low nse values overall from the upstream to the downstream the nse values of the three hydrological stations gradually increased wangdaohengta sub catchment has the worst calibration effect and wenjiachuan sub catchment has the best performance this is probably because the smaller the upstream flow the lower the precipitation and the areas within the control catchment of the wangdaohengta sub catchment and the shenmu sub catchment are located in the mu us desert since shenmu sub catchment is completely below the loess plateau wenjiachuan sub catchment has a relatively low proportion of desert area 5 3 uncertainty of the simulation and future work this study did not consider the changes of the topography due to the soil and water conservation project but assumed the topography and geomorphology conditions are constant in addition the effects of domestic water consumption and other industrial water consumption except coal mining were not considered which may result in a slightly overestimation of the runoff reduction as soil and water conservation projects and coal mining will cause changes in the underlying surface conditions our next work is to develop a distributed hydrological model that can characterize the effects of underlying surface changes on the runoff 6 conclusions under the double influence of climate change and human activities the annual runoff of the kuye river catchment showed a significant downward trend from 1956 to 2017 the main human activities in the kuye river catchment include soil and water conservation projects and coal mining three study periods are divided using the abrupt change analysis method pre 1979 minimum human activities 1980 1997 the soil and water conservation and 1998 2017 the joint impacts by soil and water conservation and coal mining for the two research periods of 1981 1997 reference period and 1998 2017 impact period the effects of coal mining on runoff process were studied by using precipitation runoff double mass curve method and simhyd pml model the simhyd pml model results are more reliable than the double mass curve method coal mining strongly reduced the total surface runoff by 29 56 for the three sub catchments in the kuye river catchment from 1998 to 2017 this paper mainly investigates the mining impact on catchment runoff without considering the changes of the topography of the soil and water conservation project integrating the impact of various human activities on runoff into the hydrological model is the future direction of development in this paper the simhyd pml model is used to separate the coal mining from the soil and water conservation project which lays a solid foundation for future research credit authorship contribution statement jinkai luan methodology

5224,coal mining could cause drastic drop of groundwater level obvious decrease of river base flow and total runoff in dry season in addition the subsidence of coal mine goaf and water conducting fissures also could cause the loss of surface water how to quantitatively estimate the impact of coal mining activities on runoff there becomes a major challenge this study focuses on the kuye river catchment a major coal mining region in china where accumulative anomaly analysis the ordered clustering and the pettitt test are carried out two abrupt change points are identified in 1979 and 1997 therefore three stages are divided pre 1979 minimum human activities 1980 1997 the soil and water conservation and 1998 2017 the joint impacts by soil and water conservation and coal mining the effects of coal mining on runoff are further estimated using simhyd pml hydrological model that fully considers vegetation dynamics its simulation results show that from 1998 to 2017 coal mining reduced the total surface runoff by 29 35 for wangdaohengta sub catchment by 55 41 for shenmu sub catchment and by 49 44 the entire kuye river catchment the coal mine driven runoff reduction is generally large in the years and seasons with large runoff however the environmental impact process is not uniform the research ideas and methods reasonably separate the impact of dividing two human activities on the runoff process which lays a solid foundation for future research keywords coal mining impact water climate change soil and water conservation simhyd pml 1 introduction catchment runoff is not only an important form of natural water body but also an important component of hydrological processes runoff determines the evolution of water cycle system nowadays it is very important to study runoff process because of the drastic climate change and human activities arenas lago et al 2013 2014 cerqueira et al 2011 2012 civeira et al 2016a b c many catchments have experienced significant attenuation of runoff due to the influences of climate change and human activities destouni et al 2013 feng et al 2016 guo et al 2019 liu and zheng 2004 ning et al 2016 sorg et al 2012 piao et al 2007 which would cause large effects on water cycle ecosystem socio economical system and so on due to highly increasing population rate and rapid land use change many researchers have devoted to understand the runoff process under the influence of anthropogenic and human activities which involve land use change soil and water conservation engineering construction of reservoirs water diversion for agriculture coal mining domestic and industrial water consumption etc deng and chen 2017 fan et al 2010 feng et al 2018 li et al 2017 liu et al 2017 pan et al 2018 wang et al 2019 wei et al 2017 xu et al 2014 yan et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 zhao et al 2014 xia et al 2014 coal mining is one of important human activities that influences water resources by changing hydrogeological conditions and by large amount of water consumption cutruneo et al 2014 dias et al 2014 duarte et al 2019 due to the cracks formed in the roof of the coal mine the water in the aquifer is introduced into the pit which leads to the change of groundwater from horizontal runoff and drainage to vertical leakage this could cause drastic drop of groundwater level obvious decrease of river base flow and spring flow in addition the subsidence of coal mine goaf and water conducting fissures also could cause the loss of surface water therefore coal mining has obvious effects on surface runoff it is necessary to carry out quantitative research on investigating the effects of coal mining on runoff processes and to evaluate the hydrological consequences of coal mining activities gredilla et al 2017 2019 gasparotto et al 2018 table 1 summarizes some relative studies about the effects of coal mining on surface runoff in china ping et al 2017 applied the mike she model to quantitatively analyze the impact of coal mining and climate change on river runoff in the gujiao mining area shanxi province of china liang et al 2013 used the climate elasticity method and the simhyd hydrological model to research the impact of human activities and climate change on runoff during 1960 2006 in the kuye river catchment guo et al 2016 2017 2019a b used the monthly water balance model mwbm and statistical regression to quantitatively analyze the impacts of coal mining climate change and soil conservation on river runoff it was found that coal mining is the main cause of the reduction of runoff after 1997 li et al 2016 utilized swat method to analyze the causes of the reduction of streamflow since 1997 in the yellow river wang et al 2015 performed the simhyd model to study the effects of human activities on runoff in the kuye river catchment most of the studies showed that human activities mainly including soil and water conservation projects and coal mining in the kuye river catchment have significant impacts on catchment runoff the above mentioned studies used the period without strong human activities as the base period however due to the multiple impacts of different types of human activities these studies did not isolate the effects of coal mining on surface runoff additionally the process of the impact of coal mining on runoff was not explicitly investigated because most of studies only used traditional precipitation runoff modelling without considering vegetation change impacts on runoff to further clarify the effect of coal mining on surface runoff this study uses the simhyd pml model to simulate the impact of coal mining on the runoff process in the kuye river catchment and to separate the effect of coal mining from the soil and water conservation engineering assuming that vegetation change caused by the soil and water conservation can be taken as a part of simhyd pml modelling processes the specific objectives of this paper include to i separate the effect of coal mining on surface runoff from the soil and water conservation engineering ii quantitatively simulate the impact of coal mining on runoff process with the simhyd pml model and iii compare the simhyd pml model method and the double mass curve method in the estimation of the reduction of runoff 2 study region and data 2 1 study region the kuye river is a first order tributary of the middle yellow river this catchment is located between 38 22 39 50 n and 109 30 110 45 e it belongs to arid to semi arid climate wang et al 2015 it has mean precipitation of 386 mm year and mean air temperature of 7 9 c the kuye river is 242 km long with a drainage area of 8 706 km2 the catchment has two major tributaries the wulanmulun and the boniuchuan in its upper reaches the furthest downstream hydrometric station is wenjiachuan which is located in the 6 9 km upstream of the confluence of the kuye river and the yellow river three hydrological stations were used in this study wangdaohengta shenmu and wenjiachuan the locations of the three hydrological stations precipitation stations and digital elevation of the kuye river catchment are described in fig 1 similar coal mining areas were previously reported by several authors from others countries martinello et al 2014 nordin et al 2018 oliveira et al 2014 2017 ribeiro et al 2013 sehn et al 2016 silva et al 2010 2011a b in order to curb the serious soil erosion in the loess plateau large scale comprehensive management of soil and water conservation was carried out in the kuye river catchment in the 1970s and 1980s especially after 1979 the area of soil and water conservation increased significantly before 1970 human activities in this catchment was small fig 2 shows the changes of the soil and water conservation area and leaf area index lai of kuye river catchment the area involved in the soil and water conservation project increased from 598 km2 in 1979 to 1682 km2 in 1996 and increased to 3740 km2 in 2010 the forest and grass cover fraction in the catchment increased to 46 3 in 2010 the most obvious change resulting from the soil and water conservation projects is the significant increase in vegetation factional cover which lead to a significant reduction of river runoff lane et al 2005 brown et al 2013 the coal resources are rich in the kuye river catchment the famous shenfu dongsheng coalfield is located in the middle of the valley according to the geological survey data and the studies of guo et al 2017 and li et al 2017 shenfu dongsheng coalfield reserves are 2363 108 tons accounting for 1 4 of chinese coal reserves the coalfield area is 2756 km2 among of which 2482 km2 are located in the kuye river catchment the shenfu dongsheng coalfield coal mine resources are formed in the jurassic with shallow depth and many places buried less than 100 m so it is easy to exploit coal quality is excellent and coal seams are stable heavily open cut and underground mining were conducted since the launch of the western development strategy in china in 2000 guo et al 2019a 2017 fig 3 summarizes the statistics of raw coal production in the kuye river catchment which is from the statistic yearbooks for shaanxi province sysp and inner mongolia autonomous region imar it is clear that coal production has a rapid growth trend the average annual production was less than 0 1 108 tons per year in the early 1990 s and increased to 4 1 108 tons in 2017 fig 4 shows the changes of the area of the open pit mine and surface coal mines during the period of 1997 2017 which are obtained from the google earth engine the area of the open pit coal mines and the surface coal mines increased from 41 9 km2 in 1997 to 295 2 km2 in 2017 over the same period the kuye river became ephemeral as a result of excessive coal mining and increasing domestic water consumption liang et al 2013 guo et al 2019a nearby villagers now have to travel several miles to collect suitable drinking water 2 2 data daily runoff data of the three hydrological stations were collated from the hydrological yearbook of the people s republic of china runoff data for wenjiachuan and shenmu ranges from 1956 to 2017 and that for wangdaohengta ranges from 1960 to 2017 monthly precipitation data at 59 stations for the period of 1956 2017 were collated from the hydrological yearbook of the people s republic of china fig 1 which were used in the precipitation runoff double mass curve method the simhyd pml model was driven by daily meteorological data of precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature incoming solar radiation and actual vapor pressure these daily forcing data are available from 1981 to 2017 and were obtained from the climate meteorological forcing dataset cmfd http data tpdc ac cn yang and he 2018 he et al 2020 with 0 1 0 1 10 km 10 km spatial resolution the cmfd dataset was generated using the international existing princeton reanalysis data gldas data gewex srb radiation data and trmm precipitation data together with the conventional meteorological observation data of the china meteorological administration the cmfd data has better quality than the reanalyzed data in the study area chen et al 2011 yang et al 2010 except for the climate forcing data the simhyd pml model requires remote sensing lai land cover and albedo data that are used to calculate actual evapotranspiration eta with the penman monteith leuning method leuning et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 the lai data from 1981 to 2017 derived from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr were obtained from national earth system science data center xiao et al 2014 xiao et al 2016 its temporal and spatial resolutions are 8 day and 8 km respectively the land cover data required to estimate aerodynamic conductance are from the 2000 2017 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover product which were obtained from the oak ridge national laboratory distributed active archive center friedl et al 2010 its temporal and spatial resolutions are 1 year and 500 m respectively this product has 17 vegetation classes which are defined according to the international geosphere biosphere programme albedo data required to calculate net radiation were obtained from the 8 day modis mcd43b bidirectional reflectance distribution function product at 1 km resolution since the lai and albedo data are input into the model on a daily time scale like the meteorological data the sg filter algorithm is used to smooth the 8 day time scale lai and albedo data and then to generate daily data all input data were aggregated to catchment scale for hydrological simulations 3 methods 3 1 trends analysis and abrupt change detection five years moving average and the mann kendall test hamed and rao 1998 was used to analyze the trends of annual streamflow the cumulative anomaly analysis wang et al 2012 and the ordered clustering and the pettitt test martinez et al 2010 were applied to detect the abrupt change years of streamflow variables using these methods time periods without human activity with significant effects of soil water conservation engineering and with significant effects of coal mining in the kuye river catchment can be distinguished 3 2 double mass curve method after the abrupt change point of the runoff is identified the time period affected only by soil and water conservation projects is taken as the reference period and the period of joint influence of soil water conservation engineering and coal mining is taken as the impact period first a linear relationship between precipitation and runoff in the reference period is established assuming that the strength of the soil and water conservation project during the impact period is the same as that during the reference period then the linear relationship is extended to the entire impact period the difference between the measured runoff and the simulated runoff is considered as the impact of coal mining on the runoff the double mass curve dmc method is currently the simplest most intuitive and most extensively used method for the analysis of the consistency or long term evolution of hydrometeorological elements it was first used by american scholar c f merriam 1937 to analyze the consistency of precipitation data in the us susquehanna catchment the principle is that the two variables are gradually accumulated at the same time length one variable is used as the horizontal coordinate and the other variable is used as the vertical coordinate gao et al 2017 yue et al 2003 the basic method of establishing a double cumulative curve there are two variables x reference variable or benchmark variable and y tested variable during the observation period of n years there are observations xi and yi where i 1 2 3 n first the variable x and the variable y are calculated year by year to obtain respective cumulative values and a new yearly cumulative sequence xi and yi where i 1 2 3 n which is 1 x i i 1 n x i 2 y i i 1 n y i then the relationship between the cumulative values of the points corresponding to the two variables is plotted in the cartesian coordinate system generally the variable to be tested is the ordinate the y axis the reference variable or the benchmark variable is the abscissa the x axis for the double mass curve of runoff and precipitation if the slope of the straight line does not deviate significantly it indicates that human activities have marginal effect on river runoff and vice versa indicating that human activities have a noticeable effect the point at which the slope changes significantly corresponds to the year in which the runoff begins to change significantly 3 3 simhyd pml model the simhyd model is widely used in runoff simulation and forecasting zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 chiew et al 2010 li et al 2012 li et al 2013 li et al 2014 this study uses the revised version of the simhyd model simhyd pml zhang and chiew 2009 li et al 2009 li and zhang 2017 zhou et al 2013 fig 5 shows the structure and parameter meaning of the simhyd pml which replaces the original eta sub models using the penman monteith leuning eta model the advantage of the simhyd pml model over the simhyd model is that the simhyd pml model added dynamic vegetation module into the model which enhances the simulation of runoff response to the variation of land surface vegetation this feature is important because it can consider the hydrological changes caused by vegetation change assuming there is the same effect mechanism of vegetation change due to the soil and water conservation engineering on the runoff between the reference period and the impact period the simulated runoff in the impact period can be regarded as the runoff without coal mining effects comparing which with the actual runoff observations the impact of coal mining on runoff can be estimated 3 4 model calibration and simulation a global optimizer the particle swarm optimization pso toolbox in matlab is used to optimize the parameters of the simhyd pml rainfall runoff model the pso method is firstly presented by eberhart and kennedy inspired from the behavior of schools of fish or flocks of birds eberhart and kennedy 1995 in order to quantitatively distinguish the impact of coal mining and soil and water conservation projects on the runoff process in the simhyd pml model 1981 1997 was defined as the reference period and 1998 2017 was defined as the impact period simulation period based on the calculated point of abrupt change the hydrological model is calibrated for the period 1981 1997 of which the first two years 1981 1982 used for warm up the genetic algorithm used a population size of 500 and the maximum generation of 100 for searching the optimum point the objective function of the model in this study is 3 f 1 n s e 5 l n 1 b i a s 2 5 nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 is the nash sutcliffe efficiency expressed as 4 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs and bias is 5 bias i 1 n q sim i i 1 n q obs i i 1 n q obs i where qsim and qobs are the simulated and observed monthly runoff respectively q obs is the arithmetic mean of the observed monthly runoff i is the ith month and n is the total number of months in calibration period the nse value is used to evaluate the effect of the model with maximum nse 1 0 which indicates perfect agreement between all of the modelled and observed monthly runoffs the bias measures the error between the modelled and observed total runoff with bias 0 which indicates that the mean simulated monthly runoff is the same as the mean observed monthly runoff this study assumes that the same amount of bias caused during the calibration period will be transformed to the simulation period and this bias is then deducted when calculating mining impacts on runoff in this way we can minimize the impact of hydrological model error in analyzing coal mining impact on runoff in the simulation period 4 results 4 1 runoff trend analysis trend analysis of the annual runoff of three hydrological stations using the 5 years moving average method the analysis results are shown in fig 6 overall the annual runoff on the three hydrological stations shows a decreasing trend in 1956 2017 or in 1960 2017 the mann kendall test for the trends of annual streamflow shows that the z values of the three hydrological stations are 5 81 5 65 and 5 59 from a to c respectively therefore they all show a significant downward trend and the degree of decline is consistent 4 2 abrupt change detection of runoff fig 7 and fig 8 summarize the accumulative anomaly analysis the ordered clustering and the pettitt test applied to detect the abrupt change years of streamflow variables it can be seen from the figures that the two abrupt change points are consistent at the three hydrological stations the annual runoff had an increasing trend before 1979 and then fluctuated slightly from 1980 to 1997 according to the two abrupt change points the annual streamflow series are divided into 3 stages 1956 1979 1980 1997 and 1998 2017 respectively according to the start time of the soil and water conservation engineering and the coal mining the period of 1956 1979 is considered with minimum human activities the period from 1980 to 1997 is the soil and water conservation effect period the period from 1998 to 2017 is the joint impact period of soil and water conservation and coal mine development 4 3 precipitation runoff relationship in the three periods according to the result shown in section 4 2 the study period is divided into three periods 1956 1979 or 1960 1979 1980 1997 and 1998 2017 fig 9 shows the precipitation runoff relationship of the three periods for each catchment it is clear that the precipitation runoff relationship is significantly changed in the three periods and the runoff is significantly reduced especially for the period of 1998 2017 therefore it is reasonable to split the whole period into three 4 4 runoff reduction estimation with the precipitation runoff double mass curve method the abrupt characteristics of the runoff series are further verified by the precipitation runoff double mass curve fig 10 two significant abrupt changes occur in the kuye river catchment in 1979 and 1997 taking the entire kuye river catchment as an example fig 10 c the slope from 1956 to 1979 was 0 0175 the slope decreased to 0 0139 in 1980 1997 and the slope in 1998 2017 was further reduced to 0 0052 it is seen that runoff is greatly reduced in such a short period of time there were no abrupt changes in precipitation and temperature data in the kuye river catchment in 1956 2017 and therefore that natural factors were not the major cause of the abrupt decrease in runoff therefore coal mining may be the main reason for this dramatic reduction in fig 10 c if the cumulative line of 1956 1979 is extended to 1980 1997 one can get a cumulative line that is not affected by soil and water conservation projects through this line the total runoff from 1980 to 1997 was calculated to be 110 8 108m3 compared with the actual total runoff of 90 8 108m3 the total runoff was reduced by 18 0 that is to say due to the impact of soil and water conservation projects the total runoff of the entire kuye river catchment in 1980 1997 decreased by 18 0 in the same way taking 1981 1997 as the reference period the cumulative line from 1981 to 1997 was extended to 2017 through this line the total runoff of the entire kuye river catchment from 1998 to 2017 was calculated to be 111 7 108m3 and the actual total runoff was 46 7 108m3 thereby runoff decreased by 58 2 this method assumes there is the same effects of the soil and water conservation project on runoff during 1981 1997 and 1998 2017 therefore the 58 2 reduction is the amount of coal mining impact on runoff the actual total runoff of shenmu sub catchment from 1998 to 2017 was 37 8 108m3 and the calculated total runoff was 87 2 108m3 thereby the runoff decreased by 56 7 the actual total runoff of wangdaohengta sub catchment from 1998 to 2017 was 17 0 108m3 and the calculated total runoff was 35 8 108m3 thereby runoff decreased by 52 6 4 5 runoff reduction estimated with the simhyd pml model in order to quantitatively distinguish the effect of soil and water conservation and the impact of coal mining on runoff process the simhyd pml model is used to simulate the monthly runoff process in the three sub catchments table 2 shows the runoff simulation results in reference period include warm up 1981 1982 calibration 1983 1992 and validation 1993 1997 periods and impact period simulation period 1998 2017 the nse values in the calibration period were 0 58 0 53 and 0 62 for wangdaohengta shenmu and wenjiachuan respectively the bias values were 0 094 0 024 and 0 021 respectively the nse values in the validation period were 0 64 0 63 and 0 72 for wangdaohengta shenmu and wenjiachuan respectively the bias values were 0 095 0 113 and 0 063 respectively these statistical results are overall good according to the good performance metrics 0 65 nse 0 75 and 0 1 bias 0 15 given by moriasi et al 2007 therefore the simhyd pml model has a good ability for simulating hydrological processes in the three sub catchments fig 11 shows the monthly runoff time series of simulated and observed results for the three sub catchments the simhyd pml simluations show that the observed monthly runoff is smaller than the simulated for all the three sub catchments and for the period of 1998 to 2017 which indicates that coal mine exploitation reduces the surface runoff for wenjiachuan sub catchment the simulated runoff is 3 47 larger than the actual runoff in the calibration period the simulated total runoff during the simulation period was 977 3 mm and the actual runoff was 539 5 mm which was reduced by 44 80 if the effect of the model bias on the calibration period is taken into account the reduction is 49 44 similarly when the bias on the calibration period is deducted in the simulation period of 1998 2017 the coal mining has reduced the total surface runoff by 55 41 for shenmu sub catchment and by 29 35 for wangdaohengta sub catchment integrating the monthly runoff simulation into the annual scale fig 12 shows the comparisons of annual runoff between the simulated and the observations the amount of runoff reduction is related to precipitation generally the larger the annual precipitation the larger the simulated annual runoff and the greater the runoff reduction 5 discussion 5 1 comparing the double mass curve method with the simhyd pml model it is interesting to compare the simhyd pml modelling results with the lumped estimates from the double mass curve method for the latter the linear regression of precipitation runoff in the reference period is extended to the impacted period the difference between the observed runoff and the estimated from the linear regression in the impacted period is regarded as the amount of coal mine impact on runoff an assumption to use this method that the intensity and strength of the soil and water conservation project in the impact period is as same as those in the reference period furthermore the catchment runoff process cannot be simulated and calculated year by year therefore this method does not really separate the soil and water conservation effect from the coal mining activity nevertheless this method can provide reference to check simhyd pml simulated results fig 13 according to fig 4 coal mining in the kuye river catchment is basically from the shenmu sub catchment so the impact of coal mining on runoff in the shenmu sub catchment should be the largest the runoff reductions obtained by the two methods on wangdaohengta sub catchment are noticeably different from fig 4 it can be seen that coal mining activities in the wangdaohengta sub catchment are relatively small so the runoff reduction should be small these two reasonings suggest that the results obtained from the simhyd pml model are more credible than the precipitation runoff double mass curve method in addition since this study used the period of 1981 1997 as the reference period the soil and water conservation project has been affected during this period the application of precipitation runoff double mass curve method assumes that the strength of soil and water conservation projects in 1998 2017 is the same as that in 1981 1997 therefore the precipitation runoff double mass curve method cannot quantitatively separate the effects of coal mining on runoff from soil and water conservation projects another disadvantage of the precipitation runoff double mass curve method is that it cannot simulate the process of the impact of coal mining on runoff guo et al 2016 2017 2019a b applied various statistical analysis methods to study the impact of coal mining on the runoff in the kuye river catchment they also did not explain the impact of coal mining on the runoff in terms of process and mechanism the statistical method of precipitation runoff relationship can only consider all human activities together however how to quantitatively distinguish the impact of each human activity on the runoff process has become a burning issue such as land use change soil and water conservation measures construction of reservoirs water diversion for agriculture coal mining domestic and industrial water consumption therefore it is imperative to develop a hydrological model that can simulate a variety of human activities integrating the impact of various human activities on runoff into the hydrological model is the future direction of development in this paper the simhyd pml model is used to separate the coal mining from the soil and water conservation project i e vegetation dynamics impact on hydrological processes which lays a solid foundation for future research 5 2 applicability of the simhyd pml model the daily runoff process of the three sub catchments in the kuye river catchment is simulated the parameters are determined according to the nse value of the monthly runoff and the bias value the results are shown in tables 2 and 3 and fig 14 overall the performance of the simhyd pml model is satisfactory actually liang et al 2013 used the original simhyd model for modelling in kuye river catchment they took the reference period from 1960 to 1979 and regarded coal mining as all human activities nse in the calibration and validation periods was 0 80 and 0 78 respectively bias in the calibration and validation period was 1 8 and 4 6 respectively this shows that the original simhyd model is also applicable in the kuye river catchment the reason of the relatively low nse is mainly because the kuye river catchment is located in a semi arid area with less precipitation runoff in the catchment is dominated by super osmotic flow in addition the geomorphic types of the kuye river catchment are diverse and the terrain is complex and variable there are three typical types of landforms in the catchment from the upstream ordos platform to the mu us desert to the loess plateau especially in the mu us desert the process of flow and convergence is complicated it is well known that all hydrological models are relatively poor for simulating water cycle in the desert region in addition since this paper is mainly to separate the impact of coal mining on runoff from the soil and water conservation project we chose 1981 1997 as the reference period however the soil and water conservation project during this period includes not only afforestation but also the construction of terraces check dams and other human activities that changed the topographic conditions among them this study only considers vegetation impacts i e afforestation on runoff which may result in the uncertainty of calibration and low nse values overall from the upstream to the downstream the nse values of the three hydrological stations gradually increased wangdaohengta sub catchment has the worst calibration effect and wenjiachuan sub catchment has the best performance this is probably because the smaller the upstream flow the lower the precipitation and the areas within the control catchment of the wangdaohengta sub catchment and the shenmu sub catchment are located in the mu us desert since shenmu sub catchment is completely below the loess plateau wenjiachuan sub catchment has a relatively low proportion of desert area 5 3 uncertainty of the simulation and future work this study did not consider the changes of the topography due to the soil and water conservation project but assumed the topography and geomorphology conditions are constant in addition the effects of domestic water consumption and other industrial water consumption except coal mining were not considered which may result in a slightly overestimation of the runoff reduction as soil and water conservation projects and coal mining will cause changes in the underlying surface conditions our next work is to develop a distributed hydrological model that can characterize the effects of underlying surface changes on the runoff 6 conclusions under the double influence of climate change and human activities the annual runoff of the kuye river catchment showed a significant downward trend from 1956 to 2017 the main human activities in the kuye river catchment include soil and water conservation projects and coal mining three study periods are divided using the abrupt change analysis method pre 1979 minimum human activities 1980 1997 the soil and water conservation and 1998 2017 the joint impacts by soil and water conservation and coal mining for the two research periods of 1981 1997 reference period and 1998 2017 impact period the effects of coal mining on runoff process were studied by using precipitation runoff double mass curve method and simhyd pml model the simhyd pml model results are more reliable than the double mass curve method coal mining strongly reduced the total surface runoff by 29 56 for the three sub catchments in the kuye river catchment from 1998 to 2017 this paper mainly investigates the mining impact on catchment runoff without considering the changes of the topography of the soil and water conservation project integrating the impact of various human activities on runoff into the hydrological model is the future direction of development in this paper the simhyd pml model is used to separate the coal mining from the soil and water conservation project which lays a solid foundation for future research credit authorship contribution statement jinkai luan methodology
