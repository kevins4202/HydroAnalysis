10095,rapid and accurate acquisition of crop coefficient kc values is essential for estimating field crop evapotranspiration et the lack of rapid access to the high resolution spatial and temporal distribution of kc values hinders obtaining a crop kc value for application in precision irrigation agriculture this study aimed to explore the potential of leaf area index lai and multispectral vegetation indices vis obtained by an unmanned aerial vehicle uav for estimating the kc value for a maize crop on a field scale and to obtain a high resolution spatial temporal map of kc values hence the performance of the estimation model for daily maize kc derived by two machine learning algorithms random forest regression rfr and multiple linear regression mlr based on the ground based lai and six types of uav based multispectral vis normalized difference vegetation index ndvi soil adjusted vegetation index savi enhanced vegetation index evi transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index tcari green normalized vegetation index gndvi and visual atmospheric resistance index vari was evaluated under multiple irrigation conditions during the entire cropping cycle maize rfr with vis lai based et was compared to soil water balance swb and fao 56 based et the results showed that the rfr algorithm effectively r2 0 65 estimated maize kc values based on ground based lai and uav based vis the uav based vis based on red edge red and green red spectral bands and ground based lai were suitable predictors in the kc prediction model under different irrigation conditions further we successfully obtained a high resolution pixel size of centimeter spatial distribution of maize kc values based on evi based lai and uav based vis furthermore the results indicated that the combination of uav multispectral remote sensing technology and the rfr algorithm provides a potential solution for the distribution of water use and precision irrigation on a field scale keywords crop water requirements fao56 approach lai evapotranspiration random forest regression remote sensing 1 introduction maize crops are often exposed drought during the growing period because of the extremely uneven precipitation patterns caused by the monsoon in the northern plains of china in agriculture water is primarily consumed as evapotranspiration et paredes et al 2017 therefore rapid and accurate monitoring of et plays a major role in designing farmland irrigation systems aimed to improve irrigation water use efficiency throughout the cropping cycle common methods currently used for estimating et on a field scale m2 km2 include the lysimeter ding et al 2010 the eddy covariance method foken et al 2012 the bowen ratio energy balance irmak et al 2014 and the soil water balance method xue et al 2013 owing to the differences in the surface and spatiotemporal scale involved in each case the applicability of the various methods to estimate et is quite diverse in an attempt to standardize the method for estimation of et in 1998 the food and agricultural organization fao proposed the use of a method based on an empirical value for the crop coefficient kc method further fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 fao 56 presented the dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 and recommended kc values for various crops under standard conditions i e non stress computation of actual et is relatively straight forward by simply multiplying the reference evapotranspiration et0 according to asce walter et al 2000 the fao 56 method has compared well with field observations for annual crops for vine and for tree crops zhang et al 2013 2011 the fao 56 method subdivides et into soil evaporation and crop transpiration phogat et al 2016 and performed well for maize in different regions of china ding et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 however typically it has to be determined on a daily basis by a kc curve which is expressed as a smooth continuous function in time or thermal units jensen and allen 2016 the kc curve functions described in fao 56 are time based and lack the flexibility to capture typical crop development and water use patterns caused by climate soil pests planting density cultivation management etc allen and pereira 2009 bausch and neale 1990 jiang et al 2014 qiu et al 2015 to improve the accuracy of time based kc curves cumulative growing degree days gdd were considered to account for the effects of climatic variability hunsaker et al 2003 the differences in water consumption that exist at the spatial and temporal scales in the field are due to non uniform water use soil water holding characteristics and micro climatic conditions therefore the spatiotemporal distribution of kc is ideally required in near real time to accurately determine the spatial and temporal pattern of water consumption remote sensing rs technology offers a method for readily obtaining the spatio temporal distribution of kc values the vegetation index vi can be used to assess crop growth status for example canopy structural parameters and physiological and biochemical properties zhang et al 2019a and can be measured either on the ground in the air or by satellite studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of vis for estimating kc dejonge et al 2012 duchemin et al 2006 ground based vis measurements have been used to estimate basal crop coefficient hunsaker et al 2003 however data collection is time consuming and labor intensive whereby it is rather challenging to estimate kc on a field or regional scale alternatively satellite based vis measurements can accurately estimate kc on a regional scale gontia and tiwari 2010 maselli et al 2014 however several features such as the low spatial and temporal resolution of satellite images the impact of cloud cover and high cost limit the application of satellite based rs technology for estimating daily kc on a field scale in recent years unmanned aerial vehicle uav based rs technology begun providing an economical way to estimate kc on a field scale owing to operational features such as easy platform construction short operating cycle high image resolution and low cost rango et al 2009 2006 multispectral bands in the visible and infrared spectral regions are utilized to obtain vis through band calculations and are generally sensitive to leaf pigments and leaf and canopy structures prey et al 2018 because vis remain saturated during the stage of full crop coverage a parameter that can reflect crop canopy structure may be useful to improve the accuracy of the kc estimation model during the stage of complete crop coverage leaf area index lai can reflect changes in crop canopy structure and quantify vegetation amount over a given area of land furthermore it can be measured by optical instrumentation qu et al 2014 or by lidar technology heiskanen et al 2015 luo et al 2015 alternatively it may be estimated by crop canopy vis information houborg et al 2009 liu et al 2012 xiao et al 2011 the leaves provide surface area for photosynthesis respiration and transpiration which control the exchange of water and energy between plants and the atmosphere lai strongly affects the amount of absorbed solar radiation which has an important influence on the short and long term course of evapotranspiration gao et al 2008 lai can also facilitate the localized application of kc accounting for the effects of planting density for example feng et al 2016 found that the crop coefficient modified by lai accurately estimated et compared with the eddy covariance method for dryland maize on the loess plateau similarly park et al 2017 used lai to estimate the kc on a regional scale in turn chen et al 2020 and fan et al 2021 recommended that lai should be included in machine learning models for daily maize transpiration estimation otherwise large errors may occur therefore lai is an essential parameter for the kc prediction model previous studies have investigated a few uav vis based methods for kc estimation for example han et al 2018 combined six types of uav based vis to establish estimation models for maize kc values under different irrigation levels at different growth stages indicating that the correlation between vi and kc was excellent under full irrigation furthermore the water stress factor had a great impact on the vi based estimation model for maize kc in turn zhang et al 2019b studied the correlation between the uav based simple ratio index sr lai surface soil moisture sm and kc using a stepwise regression algorithm under different water stress conditions during the entire growing period their analysis demonstrated that the correlation between sm and kc was acceptable under different irrigation levels owing to the variable sm introduced to the kc estimation model it was relatively difficult to obtain the spatial distribution of kc using uav multispectral rs technology further water stress can influence crop canopy structure owing to crop self regulation uav based vis have been used to assess the water stress coefficient tang et al 2019 previous studies on maize kc estimation methods based on uav multispectral rs technology exhibited problems such as low accuracy poor applicability and few methods for obtaining the kc map few studies have investigated potential of combining lai and uav based vis for maize kc prediction under different irrigation conditions on a field scale therefore the method for estimating daily kc and generating a kc distribution for maize in the field using the uav multispectral rs technology during the entire growth period warrants further investigation currently machine learning algorithms are easier to employ because of the availability of convenient programming libraries e g scikit learn library https scikit learn org stable the random forest regression rfr algorithm is an ensemble learning algorithm used to establish non parametric regression models consisting of a combination of many decision trees breiman 2001 in remote sensing studies the rfr method has been widely used as a convenient regression algorithm to combine multiple explanatory variables to estimate wheat biomass zhou et al 2016 lai srinet et al 2019 and crop yield leroux et al 2019 sakamoto 2020 therefore in this study we developed a maize kc estimation model under different irrigation levels using the rfr algorithm incorporating ground based lai and various uav based multispectral vis referring to nir red edge red green and blue spectral bands to increase the accuracy of the maize kc estimation model and to obtain a kc map on a field scale during the whole growing period in the semiarid region of the north china plain the specific objectives of the study were i to investigate the performance of a novel rfr model and a traditional mlr model for estimating maize kc and generating a high resolution centimeter pixel kc map on a field scale through the combination of ground based lai and uav based vis under different irrigation conditions ii to test the contributions of the input variables lai and uav based vis for the maize kc estimation model and iii to evaluate the applicability of the rfr based kc estimation model to derive daily et and cumulative et rapid middle and late growth stages and compare it with that derived by the fao 56 and the swb models using one year s 2017 data 2

flight plan was prepared using the mission planner ground station software for each flight path planning with 85 heading and side overlap the uav flew to the working height and manually photographed two gray boards and then took images of maize using a fixed route 2 4 ground data acquisition the experimental area included four fan shaped zones fig 1 corresponding to four experimental irrigation levels where three 6 m 6 m square plots were selected in each of the four irrigation trs the data in each square plot were monitored during the entire growing cycle ground data consisted of

the height of the maize plant 10 representative maize plants were randomly selected in each plot and measured using a measuring tape 2 5 crop coefficient and soil water balance method according to the fao 56 procedures jensen and allen 2016 the crop growth period is divided into four stages namely the early growth stage the rapid growth stage the middle growth stage and the late growth stage under

estimation method based on lai and uav based vis fig 2 shows the kc estimation method based on uav based vis ndvi savi evi tcari gndvi and vari and ground based lai using machine learning algorithms mlr and rfr uav multispectral images taken by rededge camera were processed by pre processing methods geometric correction gaussian mean filtering and splicing processing and were corrected by gray board with fixed reflectance to generate reflectance images then uav based vis were calculated using these reflectance images rfr algorithm for maize kc estimation was compared with mlr algorithm to select an optimal maize kc estimation method lai was estimated using exponential method based on uav based vi kc map were generated based on uav based vis and vi based lai using the optimal kc estimation method rfr vis lai based et values were compared with swb and fao 56 based et values to explore the applicability of using the rfr based kc estimation model to estimate maize et during different growing stages rapid middle and late 2 7 method for the calculation of vegetation indices uav vis used in this study were presented in table 2 the six kinds of vis referred to five bands nir red edge red green and blue spectral bands sampling areas fig 1 were rois regions of interest in each irrigation tr and six kinds of vis were extracted from the rois of reflectance images maize kc estimation models were developed using rfr and mlr algorithms based on ground based lai with uav based vis the parameter of tree number in the rfr algorithm was 100 meanwhile root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 values were calculated to assess the accuracy of kc estimation models a total of 854 samples were collected from 2017 to 2019 of which 768 randomly selected samples were used as the training set while the remaining 86 samples were used as the validation set for the kc estimation models 80 of all samples in 2017 2018 and 2019 were used as the training set while the remaining samples were used as the validation set the same percentages of training and validation sets were used for the vi based lai estimation model 3 results 3 1 crop coefficient kc for maize in the case of the maize kc this coefficient reflected crop transpiration and soil evaporation and was influenced by crop soil and climate factors kc gradually increased during the rapid growth period peaked at the middle growth stage and decreased thereafter and until the late growth stage owing to water stress and soil evaporation kc showed large fluctuations during the entire growing period as shown in fig 3 3 2 kc estimation models using rfr and mlr algorithms table 3 shows the accuracy of the kc estimation models obtained by the mlr algorithm r2 0 23 0 39 rmse 0 1730 0 1963 based on uav based vis and ground based lai the optimal input variables were selected using a stepwise regression algorithm meanwhile table 4 shows the accuracy of the kc values derived by the rfr algorithm r2 0 48 0 77 rmse 0 1182 0 1689 based on the combination of all the uav based vis ndvi savi evi gndvi tcari and vari and ground based lai comparing in information summarized in table 3 and table 4 the rfr algorithm estimated the kc values better based on the uav based vis and the ground based lai for the entire field using data from 2017 2018 2019 and from 2017 to 2019 respectively further fig 4 shows the scatter plots between rfr and fao 56 based kc estimations the figure also shows the scatter of the rfr based and the fao56 based kc estimates were large under deficient irrigation conditions tr3 in 2017 and 2018 tr1 in 2019 while under the maximum irrigation condition tr1 in 2017 and 2018 tr2 in 2019 the maize kc prediction model using the rfr algorithm sometimes greatly underestimated fig 4b green triangle and fig 4d green triangle and circle the value for kc during the maize rapid growing stage 4 discussion 4 1 main factors contributing to the maize kc estimation model the correlation between uav based vis ndvi savi evi gndvi and vari was high r 0 83 0 97 fig 5 indicating that there was strong multicollinearity among vis multicollinearity has a significant impact on the mlr model a stepwise regression algorithm was employed in this study to select the optimal input variable combination comparing the optimal variable combinations in kc prediction models using the mlr algorithm in the years 2017 2018 2019 and from 2017 to 2019 lai and vis tcari gndvi and ndvi had a strong influence on the prediction of maize kc values the relative importance of input variables vis and lai in kc prediction using the rfr algorithm in 2017 2018 2019 and from 2017 to 2019 varied largely fig 6 specifically the relative importance of lai tcari and gndvi was high fig 6 shows the relative importance of lai for the maize kc estimation model was highest in 2018 and 2019 and lower in 2017 overall the amount of irrigation table 1 was relatively abundant in 2017 therefore the water stress factor had a relatively weak influence on maize kc estimation model in contrast vis were the optimal input variables to estimate the maize kc in 2017 table 3 therefore uav based vis were major contributors to the maize kc prediction model among the seven input variables in 2017 as for 2018 and 2019 the amount of irrigation was relatively deficient and the water stress factor affected the growth status of maize plants pastenes et al 2005 in this case lai reflected the changes in crop canopy structure and was one of the optimal variables for estimating maize kc table 3 in 2018 and 2019 therefore lai was an important variable for the maize kc estimation model under water stress conditions and may be applied to maize deficit irrigation management practices the above results also indicated that lai and uav based vis based on red edge and red i e tcari bands with green and red i e gndvi spectral bands highly contribute to maize kc prediction using the rfr method consistently rozenstein et al 2019 also suggested vegetation indices based on the red and red edge spectral bands for predicting cotton kc values 4 2 performance of the rfr and mlr models for estimation of maize kc the correlation coefficients of uav based vis and maize kc were low r 0 018 to 0 41 and the corresponding r2 was less than 0 17 this indicated that the linear relationship of uav based vis with the maize kc was low under sufficient and under deficient irrigation conditions similarly li et al 2013 reported a similar result r2 0 15 for winter wheat kc using ground based vis however previous studies reported contrasting conclusions thus for example gontia and tiwari 2010 reported a high level of accuracy r2 0 76 for the monthly kc estimation model with vis in turn kamble et al 2013 reported a high r2 0 91 degree of accuracy for the estimation of under well watered conditions using modis based vis under such conditions kcb was shown to be the major factor influencing kc while vis reflected the changes in kcb adequately hunsaker et al 2003 pôças et al 2020 the aforementioned results demonstrated that water stress and the time scale of kc had important influences on the kc prediction model nevertheless for the purpose of this study a main focus was given to the maize kc prediction under different irrigation levels on a field scale lai and uav based vis based kc estimation models differed greatly in accuracy in 2017 2018 and 2019 tables 3 and 4 this finding demonstrated that irrigation levels water stress factor had a strong impact on vis lai based maize kc prediction model therefore this study used three years of data with various irrigation conditions to train the kc prediction model multicollinearity affects the accuracy of the kc estimation model using the mlr method whereby the optimal combination of input variables was selected for the model the rfr is insensitive to overfitting and can provide the relative importance of the input variables fig 6 this study used all vis referred to five bands table 2 and lai to establish the maize kc prediction model with the rfr method comparing the information summarized in table 4 with table 5 the accuracy of kc rfr r2 0 65 based on lai and uav based vis from 2017 2019 was higher than that for kc mlr r2 0 23 because the relationship of lai vis and kc was non linear under different water stress conditions the rfr algorithm adequately reflected the non linear relationship between kc and its influencing variables the accuracy of kc rfr prediction based on lai and uav based vis was in agreement with previous studies thus zhang et al 2019b reported similar results r2 0 63 while estimating maize kc based on the uav based sr lai and surface soil moisture content similarly er raki et al 2013 observed that the accuracy of the kc estimation model for table grape with ground based ndvi was comparable r2 0 63 however alam et al 2018 reported that the accuracy of kc prediction for pasture with ndvi under irrigated conditions was better r2 0 84 at a small scale 1 m2 in our study various irrigation conditions were included differences in the crop type may be the reason for the above different results reported herein previous studies odi lara et al 2016 pereira et al 2020 pôças et al 2020 also used the method of combining kcb vi with swb to assess crop kc however this method was relatively tedious to use the kc rfr model established in this study showed acceptable performance on a farmland scale owing to the introduction of a machine learning algorithm i e the rfr algorithm compared with previous studies the accuracy of the maize kc estimation model was relatively high using less ground data as the model input variable and irrigation conditions were more complex than in previous studies to further explore the difference in the distribution of observed and estimated kc values violin plots of fao 56 based and rfr and mlr estimated kc under four irrigation levels in 2017 are shown in fig 7 these results showed that rfr based and fao56 based kc estimates clearly showed smaller distribution differences whereas larger distribution differences were observed for mlr based and fao56 based kc estimates fig 7 further shows that distribution differences of rfr based kc estimates in tr1 l4 irrigation level table 1 and tr3 l1 irrigation level were larger and identified the results indicated that the maize kc estimation model using the rfr method based on uav based vis and ground based lai was applicable for different irrigation treatments altogether these results confirmed that the rfr algorithm was an advanced method for estimating maize kc under various irrigation conditions therefore the performance of the maize kc prediction model was acceptable 4 3 the kc map and et estimation using rfr method based on lai and uav based vis the spatial distribution of lai should also be estimated to obtain the maize kc map fig 5 shows that the correlation coefficient between uav based evi and lai was the highest r 0 81 this study established an exponential model for maize lai estimation fig 8 using uav based evi to obtain the lai map similarly xie et al 2014 reported that vis effectively estimated winter wheat lai r2 0 61 0 80 using the exponential method then distributions of the maize kc fig 9 for the entire field were mapped based on uav based vis and evi based lai using the kc rfr model established in this study vis e g ndvi exhibited low sensitivity to lai when lai was greater than 3 xie et al 2015 estimated lai with vi might introduce errors to the maize kc map during the middle and late growth stages a method such as lidar wang and fang 2020 to obtain the maize lai map under various irrigation conditions should be further investigated to improve the accuracy of kc distribution fig 9 shows striking variability for kc among the four irrigation trs with the value for kc in tr3 being smaller than that in any other tr tr1 tr2 or tr4 it is easier to obtain kc map pixel size of tens to hundreds on a regional scale with satellite based vis based on previous literature gontia and tiwari 2010 kamble et al 2013 however few studies have investigated high resolution kc maps a uav based kc map pixel size of centimeters can provide technical support for variable irrigation on a field scale it noteworthy that a lower frequency of high absolute errors and a higher frequency of small absolute errors were obtained by the rfr model for estimating daily et compared with the mlr model fig 10 this result indicated that the rfr method estimated the maize daily et more accurately fig 11 shows daily values of rfr and fao 56 based et in tr1 maximum irrigation amount and tr3 minimum irrigation amount in 2017 to evaluate the feasibility of the rfr based maize kc estimation model using ground based lai and uav based vis to estimate maize et under different irrigation conditions fig 11 shows that rfr based et prediction was similar to fao 56 based et prediction for irrigation treatments tr1 and tr3 the absolute errors in rfr and fao56 based et estimates ranged from 0 to 2 16 mm day fan et al 2021 obtained a similar accuracy 0 2 mm day for estimating daily maize transpiration the rfr based model often yielded a higher estimation of et than the fao56 based model when irrigation changed from sufficient to deficient while concomitantly often yielded a lower estimate for et than the fao56 based et when irrigation changed from deficient to sufficient this might be explained because the impact of water stress on the crop canopy structure would not be reflected by vis or lai in time due to the resistance of the crop to water stress nevertheless the rfr based kc estimates were suitable for estimating daily maize et cumulative et in the four irrigation trs was calculated by rfr fao 56 and swb methods during different growth stages rapid middle and late in 2017 as shown in fig 12 the rmse of cumulative et obtained by rfr and fao 56 methods was 4 11 mm stage and that of rfr based cumulative et and swb based cumulative et was 13 32 mm stage kullberg et al 2017 found that the cumulative seasonal error in the estimation of et was less than 19 mm these results demonstrated an acceptable level of accuracy of the maize kc prediction model using the rfr method with uav based vis and ground based lai to estimate cumulative maize et during different growth stages 4 4 limitations and future works in summary a rapid and accurate method for monitoring maize kc on a field scale based on ground based lai and uav based vis has been developed to provide suggestions for more efficient precision irrigation management on a local scale the accuracy of the maize kc calculated by the fao 56 method influenced the accuracy of the rfr vis lai based kc estimation model this study used local data to correct the fao 56 method and using lysimeter method will allow the validation of daily kc and et values which in turn will yield more reliable results uav remote sensing images have high resolution whereby weeds growing between maize rows may strongly influence the results of the maize kc estimation model proper field management in this study rendered negligible weed effects nonetheless when weeds are abundant in a field weed classification methods should be used to preprocess uav images it is difficult to cover very large areas owing to the limited range and speed of currently available uavs further high speed shooting causes blurred images zhang and kovacs 2012 and illumination conditions can affect multispectral and hyperspectral cameras whereby radiometric image calibration should be performed at each band to reduce these effects zarco tejada et al 2012 it is commonly assumed that the rfr algorithm is insensitive to overfitting belgiu and drăguţ 2016 as this may not always be the case it would be convenient to bear in mind the possibility to improve the rfr model by modifying tree depth and the number of trees additionally to further validate the rfr kc model more irrigation conditions and a range of maize genotypes and regions should be considered in this study the uav multispectral camera included five spectral bands in the visible and infrared spectral regions to obtain vis compared with this camera hyperspectral cameras have a higher spectral resolution and are more sensitive to small changes in leaf pigments and canopy structures zarco tejada et al 2018 however the cost of hyperspectral cameras is higher than that of multispectral cameras maize kc estimation was obtained relatively rapidly and accurately using uav based vis and ground based lai however lai measured on the ground can decrease the convenience of the model water stress had a significant influence on the accuracy of the kc estimation model based on uav based vis and ground based lai during the entire growing period thermal infrared bands have been used to quantify crop water stress conditions agam et al 2013 baluja et al 2012 han et al 2016 and temperature based water stress indices included crop water stress index cwsi canopy temperature ratio tcratio degrees above non stressed dans and degrees above canopy threshold dact kullberg et al 2017 at present a thermal infrared camera mounted on the uav platform is used to rapidly determine crop canopy temperature further hyperspectral and multispectral cameras can be used in combination with thermal cameras to select water stress resistant genotypes chaerle et al 2009 hassan et al 2018 therefore vis based lai or other information canopy coverage canopy temperature canopy texture and point cloud obtained by uav remote sensing should be explored for future kc estimation and kc map construction future research should employ multisensors rgb cameras multi hyperspectral cameras thermal cameras and lidar integrated on the uav system to enable adequate application of the rfr kc model using uav technology across irrigation treatments genotypes and regions recently advanced deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks cnns have been applied in hydrological and agricultural fields jiang et al 2019 a simple deep learning model that is deep neural network dnn model was recommended for regression problems alom et al 2019 fan et al 2021 these methods need to be further explored to enhance their accuracy for estimation purposes 5 conclusions to estimate maize kc in the field and generate the kc map this study developed estimation models for maize kc using two machine learning algorithms rfr and mlr algorithms based on ground based lai and uav based vis ndvi savi evi tcari gndvi and vari under different irrigation conditions over three years lai and uav based vis based on red edge red i e tcari and green red i e gndvi spectral bands were suitable predictors of maize kc values reasonable r2 0 65 accuracy of the kc estimation model was obtained using the rfr algorithm based on uav based vis and ground based lai during the entire growing stage furthermore the deviation of rfr based cumulative et with respect to swb based cumulative et was acceptable rmse 13 32 mm stage however further improvement in model accuracy may be possible by introducing water stress factors i e canopy temperature into the maize kc estimation model the maize kc estimation model developed in this study included multiple irrigation levels during the entire growing stage over three years 2017 2018 and 2019 indicating high applicability of the model as well as high potential to support decision making with respect to local irrigation scheduling the results reported herein demonstrated the feasibility of generating a high resolution pixel size of centimeter maize kc map and monitoring kc spatial variability on a field scale based on uav multispectral vis using the rfr algorithm the combination of multisensors rgb cameras multi hyperspectral cameras thermal cameras and lidar mounted on a uav platform warrants further research for the improvement of accuracy in maize kc estimation funding this study was supported by the national natural science

10095,rapid and accurate acquisition of crop coefficient kc values is essential for estimating field crop evapotranspiration et the lack of rapid access to the high resolution spatial and temporal distribution of kc values hinders obtaining a crop kc value for application in precision irrigation agriculture this study aimed to explore the potential of leaf area index lai and multispectral vegetation indices vis obtained by an unmanned aerial vehicle uav for estimating the kc value for a maize crop on a field scale and to obtain a high resolution spatial temporal map of kc values hence the performance of the estimation model for daily maize kc derived by two machine learning algorithms random forest regression rfr and multiple linear regression mlr based on the ground based lai and six types of uav based multispectral vis normalized difference vegetation index ndvi soil adjusted vegetation index savi enhanced vegetation index evi transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index tcari green normalized vegetation index gndvi and visual atmospheric resistance index vari was evaluated under multiple irrigation conditions during the entire cropping cycle maize rfr with vis lai based et was compared to soil water balance swb and fao 56 based et the results showed that the rfr algorithm effectively r2 0 65 estimated maize kc values based on ground based lai and uav based vis the uav based vis based on red edge red and green red spectral bands and ground based lai were suitable predictors in the kc prediction model under different irrigation conditions further we successfully obtained a high resolution pixel size of centimeter spatial distribution of maize kc values based on evi based lai and uav based vis furthermore the results indicated that the combination of uav multispectral remote sensing technology and the rfr algorithm provides a potential solution for the distribution of water use and precision irrigation on a field scale keywords crop water requirements fao56 approach lai evapotranspiration random forest regression remote sensing 1 introduction maize crops are often exposed drought during the growing period because of the extremely uneven precipitation patterns caused by the monsoon in the northern plains of china in agriculture water is primarily consumed as evapotranspiration et paredes et al 2017 therefore rapid and accurate monitoring of et plays a major role in designing farmland irrigation systems aimed to improve irrigation water use efficiency throughout the cropping cycle common methods currently used for estimating et on a field scale m2 km2 include the lysimeter ding et al 2010 the eddy covariance method foken et al 2012 the bowen ratio energy balance irmak et al 2014 and the soil water balance method xue et al 2013 owing to the differences in the surface and spatiotemporal scale involved in each case the applicability of the various methods to estimate et is quite diverse in an attempt to standardize the method for estimation of et in 1998 the food and agricultural organization fao proposed the use of a method based on an empirical value for the crop coefficient kc method further fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 fao 56 presented the dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 and recommended kc values for various crops under standard conditions i e non stress computation of actual et is relatively straight forward by simply multiplying the reference evapotranspiration et0 according to asce walter et al 2000 the fao 56 method has compared well with field observations for annual crops for vine and for tree crops zhang et al 2013 2011 the fao 56 method subdivides et into soil evaporation and crop transpiration phogat et al 2016 and performed well for maize in different regions of china ding et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 however typically it has to be determined on a daily basis by a kc curve which is expressed as a smooth continuous function in time or thermal units jensen and allen 2016 the kc curve functions described in fao 56 are time based and lack the flexibility to capture typical crop development and water use patterns caused by climate soil pests planting density cultivation management etc allen and pereira 2009 bausch and neale 1990 jiang et al 2014 qiu et al 2015 to improve the accuracy of time based kc curves cumulative growing degree days gdd were considered to account for the effects of climatic variability hunsaker et al 2003 the differences in water consumption that exist at the spatial and temporal scales in the field are due to non uniform water use soil water holding characteristics and micro climatic conditions therefore the spatiotemporal distribution of kc is ideally required in near real time to accurately determine the spatial and temporal pattern of water consumption remote sensing rs technology offers a method for readily obtaining the spatio temporal distribution of kc values the vegetation index vi can be used to assess crop growth status for example canopy structural parameters and physiological and biochemical properties zhang et al 2019a and can be measured either on the ground in the air or by satellite studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of vis for estimating kc dejonge et al 2012 duchemin et al 2006 ground based vis measurements have been used to estimate basal crop coefficient hunsaker et al 2003 however data collection is time consuming and labor intensive whereby it is rather challenging to estimate kc on a field or regional scale alternatively satellite based vis measurements can accurately estimate kc on a regional scale gontia and tiwari 2010 maselli et al 2014 however several features such as the low spatial and temporal resolution of satellite images the impact of cloud cover and high cost limit the application of satellite based rs technology for estimating daily kc on a field scale in recent years unmanned aerial vehicle uav based rs technology begun providing an economical way to estimate kc on a field scale owing to operational features such as easy platform construction short operating cycle high image resolution and low cost rango et al 2009 2006 multispectral bands in the visible and infrared spectral regions are utilized to obtain vis through band calculations and are generally sensitive to leaf pigments and leaf and canopy structures prey et al 2018 because vis remain saturated during the stage of full crop coverage a parameter that can reflect crop canopy structure may be useful to improve the accuracy of the kc estimation model during the stage of complete crop coverage leaf area index lai can reflect changes in crop canopy structure and quantify vegetation amount over a given area of land furthermore it can be measured by optical instrumentation qu et al 2014 or by lidar technology heiskanen et al 2015 luo et al 2015 alternatively it may be estimated by crop canopy vis information houborg et al 2009 liu et al 2012 xiao et al 2011 the leaves provide surface area for photosynthesis respiration and transpiration which control the exchange of water and energy between plants and the atmosphere lai strongly affects the amount of absorbed solar radiation which has an important influence on the short and long term course of evapotranspiration gao et al 2008 lai can also facilitate the localized application of kc accounting for the effects of planting density for example feng et al 2016 found that the crop coefficient modified by lai accurately estimated et compared with the eddy covariance method for dryland maize on the loess plateau similarly park et al 2017 used lai to estimate the kc on a regional scale in turn chen et al 2020 and fan et al 2021 recommended that lai should be included in machine learning models for daily maize transpiration estimation otherwise large errors may occur therefore lai is an essential parameter for the kc prediction model previous studies have investigated a few uav vis based methods for kc estimation for example han et al 2018 combined six types of uav based vis to establish estimation models for maize kc values under different irrigation levels at different growth stages indicating that the correlation between vi and kc was excellent under full irrigation furthermore the water stress factor had a great impact on the vi based estimation model for maize kc in turn zhang et al 2019b studied the correlation between the uav based simple ratio index sr lai surface soil moisture sm and kc using a stepwise regression algorithm under different water stress conditions during the entire growing period their analysis demonstrated that the correlation between sm and kc was acceptable under different irrigation levels owing to the variable sm introduced to the kc estimation model it was relatively difficult to obtain the spatial distribution of kc using uav multispectral rs technology further water stress can influence crop canopy structure owing to crop self regulation uav based vis have been used to assess the water stress coefficient tang et al 2019 previous studies on maize kc estimation methods based on uav multispectral rs technology exhibited problems such as low accuracy poor applicability and few methods for obtaining the kc map few studies have investigated potential of combining lai and uav based vis for maize kc prediction under different irrigation conditions on a field scale therefore the method for estimating daily kc and generating a kc distribution for maize in the field using the uav multispectral rs technology during the entire growth period warrants further investigation currently machine learning algorithms are easier to employ because of the availability of convenient programming libraries e g scikit learn library https scikit learn org stable the random forest regression rfr algorithm is an ensemble learning algorithm used to establish non parametric regression models consisting of a combination of many decision trees breiman 2001 in remote sensing studies the rfr method has been widely used as a convenient regression algorithm to combine multiple explanatory variables to estimate wheat biomass zhou et al 2016 lai srinet et al 2019 and crop yield leroux et al 2019 sakamoto 2020 therefore in this study we developed a maize kc estimation model under different irrigation levels using the rfr algorithm incorporating ground based lai and various uav based multispectral vis referring to nir red edge red green and blue spectral bands to increase the accuracy of the maize kc estimation model and to obtain a kc map on a field scale during the whole growing period in the semiarid region of the north china plain the specific objectives of the study were i to investigate the performance of a novel rfr model and a traditional mlr model for estimating maize kc and generating a high resolution centimeter pixel kc map on a field scale through the combination of ground based lai and uav based vis under different irrigation conditions ii to test the contributions of the input variables lai and uav based vis for the maize kc estimation model and iii to evaluate the applicability of the rfr based kc estimation model to derive daily et and cumulative et rapid middle and late growth stages and compare it with that derived by the fao 56 and the swb models using one year s 2017 data 2

select an optimal maize kc estimation method lai was estimated using exponential method based on uav based vi kc map were generated based on uav based vis and vi based lai using the optimal kc estimation method rfr vis lai based et values were compared with swb and fao 56 based et values to explore the applicability of using the rfr based kc estimation model to estimate maize et during different growing stages rapid middle and late 2 7 method for the calculation of vegetation indices uav vis used in this study were presented in table 2 the six kinds of vis referred to five bands nir red edge red green and blue spectral bands sampling areas fig 1 were rois regions of interest in each irrigation tr and six kinds of vis were extracted from the rois of reflectance images maize kc estimation models were developed using rfr and mlr algorithms based on ground based lai with uav based vis the parameter of tree number in the rfr algorithm was 100 meanwhile root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 values were calculated to assess the accuracy of kc estimation models a total of 854 samples were collected from 2017 to 2019 of which 768 randomly selected samples were used as the training set while the remaining 86 samples were used as the validation set for the kc estimation models 80 of all samples in 2017 2018 and 2019 were used as the

coefficient kc for maize in the case of the maize kc this coefficient reflected crop transpiration and soil evaporation and was influenced by crop soil and climate factors kc gradually increased during the rapid growth period peaked at the middle growth stage and decreased thereafter and until the late growth stage owing to water stress and soil evaporation kc showed large fluctuations during the entire growing period as shown in fig 3 3 2 kc estimation models using rfr and mlr algorithms table 3 shows the accuracy of the kc estimation models obtained by the mlr algorithm r2 0 23 0 39 rmse 0 1730 0 1963 based on uav based vis and ground based lai the optimal input variables were selected using a stepwise regression algorithm meanwhile table 4 shows the accuracy of the kc values derived

table 3 and table 4 the rfr algorithm estimated the kc values better based on the uav based vis and the ground based lai for the entire field using data from 2017 2018 2019 and from 2017 to 2019 respectively further fig 4 shows the scatter plots between rfr and fao 56 based kc estimations the figure also shows the scatter of the rfr based and the fao56 based kc estimates were large under deficient irrigation conditions tr3 in 2017 and 2018 tr1 in 2019 while under the maximum irrigation condition tr1 in 2017 and 2018 tr2 in 2019 the maize kc prediction model using the rfr algorithm sometimes greatly underestimated fig 4b green triangle and fig 4d green triangle and circle the value for kc during the maize rapid growing stage 4 discussion 4 1 main factors contributing to the maize kc estimation model the correlation between uav based vis ndvi savi evi gndvi and vari was high r 0 83 0 97 fig 5 indicating that there was strong multicollinearity among vis multicollinearity has a significant impact on the mlr model a stepwise regression algorithm was employed in this study to select the optimal input variable combination comparing the optimal variable combinations in kc prediction models using the mlr algorithm in the years 2017 2018 2019 and from 2017 to 2019 lai and vis tcari gndvi and ndvi had a strong influence on the prediction of maize kc values the relative importance of input variables vis and lai in kc prediction using the rfr algorithm in 2017 2018 2019 and from 2017 to 2019 varied largely fig 6 specifically the relative importance of lai tcari and gndvi was high fig 6 shows the relative importance of lai for the maize kc estimation model was highest in 2018 and 2019 and lower in 2017 overall the amount of irrigation table 1 was relatively abundant in 2017 therefore the water stress factor had a relatively weak influence on maize kc estimation model in contrast vis were the optimal input variables to estimate the maize kc in 2017 table 3 therefore uav based vis were major contributors to the maize kc prediction model among the seven input variables in 2017 as for 2018 and 2019 the amount of irrigation was relatively deficient and the water stress factor affected the growth status of maize plants pastenes et al 2005 in this case lai reflected the changes in crop canopy structure and was one of the optimal variables for estimating maize kc table 3 in 2018 and 2019 therefore lai was an important variable for the maize kc estimation model under water stress conditions and may be applied to maize deficit irrigation management practices the above results also indicated that lai and uav based vis based on red edge and red i e tcari bands with green and red i e gndvi spectral bands highly contribute to maize kc prediction using the rfr method consistently rozenstein et al 2019 also suggested vegetation indices based on the red and red edge spectral bands for predicting cotton kc values 4 2 performance of the rfr and mlr models for estimation of maize kc the correlation coefficients of uav based vis and maize kc were low r 0 018 to 0 41 and the corresponding r2 was less than 0 17 this indicated that the linear relationship of uav based vis with the maize kc was low under sufficient and under deficient irrigation conditions similarly li et al 2013 reported a similar result r2 0 15 for winter wheat kc using ground based vis however previous studies reported contrasting conclusions thus for example gontia and tiwari 2010 reported a high level of accuracy r2 0 76 for the monthly kc estimation model with vis in turn kamble et al 2013 reported a high r2 0 91 degree of accuracy for the estimation of under well watered conditions using modis based vis under such conditions kcb was shown to be the major factor influencing kc while vis reflected the changes in kcb adequately hunsaker et al 2003 pôças et al 2020 the aforementioned results demonstrated that water stress and the time scale of kc had important influences on the kc prediction model nevertheless for the purpose of this study a main focus was given to the maize kc prediction under different irrigation levels on a field scale lai and uav based vis based kc estimation models differed greatly in accuracy in 2017 2018 and 2019 tables 3 and 4 this finding demonstrated that irrigation levels water stress factor had a strong impact on vis lai based maize kc prediction model therefore this study used three years of data with various irrigation conditions to train the kc prediction model multicollinearity affects the accuracy of the kc estimation model using the mlr method whereby the optimal combination of input variables was selected for the model the rfr is insensitive to overfitting and can provide the relative importance of the input variables fig 6 this study used all vis referred to five bands table 2 and lai to establish the maize kc prediction model with the rfr method comparing the information summarized in table 4 with table 5 the accuracy of kc rfr r2 0 65 based on lai and uav based vis from 2017 2019 was higher than that for kc mlr r2 0 23 because the relationship of lai vis and kc was non linear under different water stress conditions the rfr algorithm adequately reflected the non linear relationship between kc and its influencing variables the accuracy of kc rfr prediction based on lai and uav based vis was in agreement with previous studies thus zhang et al 2019b reported similar results r2 0 63 while estimating maize kc based on the uav based sr lai and surface soil moisture content similarly er raki et al 2013 observed that the accuracy of the kc estimation model for table grape with ground based ndvi was comparable r2 0 63 however alam et al 2018 reported that the accuracy of kc prediction for pasture with ndvi under irrigated conditions was better r2 0 84 at a small scale 1 m2 in our study various irrigation conditions were included differences in the crop type may be the reason for the above different results reported herein previous studies odi lara et al 2016 pereira et al 2020 pôças et al 2020 also used the method of combining kcb vi with swb to assess crop kc however this method was relatively tedious to use the kc rfr model established in this study showed acceptable performance on a farmland scale owing to the introduction of a machine learning algorithm i e the rfr algorithm compared with previous studies the accuracy of the maize kc estimation model was relatively high using less ground data as the model input variable and irrigation conditions were more complex than in previous studies to further explore the difference in the distribution of observed and estimated kc values violin plots of fao 56 based and rfr and mlr estimated kc under four irrigation levels in 2017 are shown in fig 7 these results showed that rfr based and fao56 based kc estimates clearly showed smaller distribution differences whereas larger distribution differences were observed for mlr based and fao56 based kc estimates fig 7 further shows that distribution differences of rfr based kc estimates in tr1 l4 irrigation level table 1 and tr3 l1 irrigation level were larger and identified the results indicated that the maize kc estimation model using the rfr method based on uav based vis and ground based lai was applicable for different irrigation treatments altogether these results confirmed that the rfr algorithm was an advanced method for estimating maize kc under various irrigation conditions therefore the performance of the maize kc prediction model was acceptable 4 3 the kc map and et estimation using rfr method based on lai and uav based vis the spatial distribution of lai should also be estimated to obtain the maize kc map fig 5 shows that the correlation coefficient between uav based evi and lai was the highest r 0 81 this study established an exponential model for maize lai estimation fig 8 using uav based evi to obtain the lai map similarly xie et al 2014 reported that vis effectively estimated winter wheat lai r2 0 61 0 80 using the exponential method then distributions of the maize kc fig 9 for the entire field were mapped based on uav based vis and evi based lai using the kc rfr model established in this study vis e g ndvi exhibited low sensitivity to lai when lai was greater than 3 xie et al 2015 estimated lai with vi might introduce errors to the maize kc map during the middle and late growth stages a method such as lidar wang and fang 2020 to obtain the maize lai map under various irrigation conditions should be further investigated to improve the accuracy of kc distribution fig 9 shows striking variability for kc among the four irrigation trs with the value for kc in tr3 being smaller than that in any other tr tr1 tr2 or tr4 it is easier to obtain kc map pixel size of tens to hundreds on a regional scale with satellite based vis based on previous literature gontia and tiwari 2010 kamble et al 2013 however few studies have investigated high resolution kc maps a uav based kc map pixel size of centimeters can provide technical support for variable irrigation on a field scale it noteworthy that a lower frequency of high absolute errors and a higher frequency of small absolute errors were obtained by the rfr model for estimating daily et compared with the mlr model fig 10 this result indicated that the rfr method estimated the maize daily et more accurately fig 11 shows daily values of rfr and fao 56 based et in tr1 maximum irrigation amount and tr3 minimum irrigation amount in 2017 to evaluate the feasibility of the rfr based maize kc estimation model using ground based lai and uav based vis to estimate maize et under different irrigation conditions fig 11 shows that rfr based et prediction was similar to fao 56 based et prediction for irrigation treatments tr1 and tr3 the absolute errors in rfr and fao56 based et estimates ranged from 0 to 2 16 mm day fan et al 2021 obtained a similar accuracy 0 2 mm day for estimating daily maize transpiration the rfr based model often yielded a higher estimation of et than the fao56 based model when irrigation changed from sufficient to deficient while concomitantly often yielded a lower estimate for et than the fao56 based et when irrigation changed from deficient to sufficient this might be explained because the impact of water stress on the crop canopy structure would not be reflected by vis or lai in time due to the resistance of the crop to water stress nevertheless the rfr based kc estimates were suitable for estimating daily maize et cumulative et in the four irrigation trs was calculated by rfr fao 56 and swb methods during different growth stages rapid middle and late in 2017 as shown in fig 12 the rmse of cumulative et obtained by rfr and fao 56 methods was 4 11 mm stage and that of rfr based cumulative et and swb based cumulative et was 13 32 mm stage kullberg et al 2017 found that the cumulative seasonal error in the estimation of et was less than 19 mm these results demonstrated an acceptable level of accuracy of the maize kc prediction model using the rfr method with uav based vis and ground based lai to estimate cumulative maize et during different growth stages 4 4 limitations and future works in summary a rapid and accurate method for monitoring maize kc on a field scale based on ground based lai and uav based vis has been developed to provide suggestions for more efficient precision irrigation management on a local scale the accuracy of the maize kc calculated by the fao 56 method influenced the accuracy of the rfr vis lai based kc estimation model this study used local data to correct the fao 56 method and using lysimeter method will allow the validation of daily kc and et values which in turn will yield more reliable results uav remote sensing images have high resolution whereby weeds growing between maize rows may strongly influence the results of the maize kc estimation model proper field management in this study rendered negligible weed effects nonetheless when weeds are abundant in a field weed classification methods should be used to preprocess uav images it is difficult to cover very large areas owing to the limited range and speed of currently available uavs further high speed shooting causes blurred images zhang and kovacs 2012 and illumination conditions can affect multispectral and hyperspectral cameras whereby radiometric image calibration should be performed at each band to reduce these effects zarco tejada et al 2012 it is commonly assumed that the rfr algorithm is insensitive to overfitting belgiu and drăguţ 2016 as this may not always be the case it would be convenient to bear in mind the possibility to improve the rfr model by modifying tree depth and the number of trees additionally to further validate the rfr kc model more irrigation conditions and a range of maize genotypes and regions should be considered in this study the uav multispectral camera included five spectral bands in the visible and infrared spectral regions to obtain vis compared with this camera hyperspectral cameras have a higher spectral resolution and are more sensitive to small changes in leaf pigments and canopy structures zarco tejada et al 2018 however the cost of hyperspectral cameras is higher than that of multispectral cameras maize kc estimation was obtained relatively rapidly and accurately using uav based vis and ground based lai however lai measured on the ground can decrease the convenience of the model water stress had a significant influence on the accuracy of the kc estimation model based on uav based vis and ground based lai during the entire growing period thermal infrared bands have been used to quantify crop water stress conditions agam et al 2013 baluja et al 2012 han et al 2016 and temperature based water stress indices included crop water stress index cwsi canopy temperature ratio tcratio degrees above non stressed dans and degrees above canopy threshold dact kullberg et al 2017 at present a thermal infrared camera mounted on the uav platform is used to rapidly determine crop canopy temperature further hyperspectral and multispectral cameras can be used in combination with thermal cameras to select water stress resistant genotypes chaerle et al 2009 hassan et al 2018 therefore vis based lai or other information canopy coverage canopy temperature canopy texture and point cloud obtained by uav remote sensing should be explored for future kc estimation and kc map construction future research should employ multisensors rgb cameras multi hyperspectral cameras thermal cameras and lidar integrated on the uav system to enable adequate application of the rfr kc model using uav technology across irrigation treatments genotypes and regions recently advanced deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks cnns have been applied in hydrological and agricultural fields jiang et al 2019 a simple deep learning model that is deep neural network dnn model was recommended for regression problems alom et al 2019 fan et al 2021 these methods need to be further explored to enhance their accuracy for estimation purposes 5 conclusions to estimate maize kc in the field and generate the kc map this study developed estimation models for maize kc using two machine learning algorithms rfr and mlr algorithms based on ground based lai and uav based vis ndvi savi evi tcari gndvi and vari under different irrigation conditions over three years lai and uav based vis based on red edge red i e tcari and green red i e gndvi spectral bands were suitable predictors of maize kc values reasonable r2 0 65 accuracy of the kc estimation model was obtained using the rfr algorithm based on uav based vis and ground based lai during the entire growing stage furthermore the deviation of rfr based cumulative et with respect to swb based cumulative et was acceptable rmse 13 32 mm stage however further improvement in model accuracy may be possible by introducing water stress factors i e canopy temperature into the maize kc estimation model the maize kc estimation model developed in this study included multiple irrigation levels during the entire growing stage over three years 2017 2018 and 2019 indicating high applicability of the model as well as high potential to support decision making with respect to local irrigation scheduling the results reported herein demonstrated the feasibility of generating a high resolution pixel size of centimeter maize kc map and monitoring kc spatial variability on a field scale based on uav multispectral vis using the rfr algorithm the combination of multisensors rgb cameras multi hyperspectral cameras

10096,continuous monitoring of soil water content is a crucial element for sustainable agricultural water management the goal of this study was to use the cropping system model csm cropgro soybean model in conjunction with field data to determine the impact of different irrigation regimes soil texture and tillage practices on soybean glycine max l merr growth development and yield for tropical conditions field experiments were conducted at two sites i piracicaba with conventional tillage pi 1 season 2016 2017 and no tillage practices pi 2 season 2017 2018 where the experiments were irrigated with full water requirements and ii teresina under conventional tillage season 2019 with two irrigation treatments of full te 1 and 50 te 2 water requirements soil water content was measured for all experiments using an electromagnetic probe installed at several depths the results showed that the model was able to simulate soybean growth and development for the different sites with a very good agreement d statistic 0 8 between the simulated and observed data in addition the soil water content was simulated with satisfactory accuracy d statistic 0 5 following model evaluation long term hypothetical scenarios for different soil tillage practices and water management regimes were simulated for piracicaba and teresina sites the results showed that the use of no tillage could reduce the average amount of irrigation in piracicaba by 30 and in teresina by 17 achieving the same yield level as conventional tillage thus the csm cropgro soybean can be used as a tool for determining optimum water management practices for tropical environments keywords soil management practices modelling irrigated agriculture drought stress soil moisture dssat 1 introduction brazil is an important tropical agricultural region and is the second largest soybean glycine max l merr producer in the world in a tropical environment periods of drought during the rainy season or during the second cropping cycle sowing at the end of the rainy season are considered the most limiting factors for crop yield battisti et al 2018 multsch et al 2020 this happens because most tropical rainfall is characterized by irregularity and high intensity while crop water needs are generally large due to high temperatures and strong solar radiation nieuwolt 1989 therefore improved water management is an important component for increasing agricultural sustainable intensification in tropical environments evaluating the soil crop water balance is a proven approach for understanding drought stress

any published reports that have evaluated the soil water balance and associated crop growth and development with the csm cropgro soybean model with experimental data from tropical environments the objectives of this study were therefore to calibrate and evaluate the performance of the csm cropgro soybean model for simulating soybean growth and development and especially soil moisture content and to apply hypothetical scenarios using different water management and conservation tillage options for two tropical environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiments irrigation experiments

pest control see supplementary material table s3 the experiments in piracicaba were conducted with full water requirements on a eutric rhodic ferralic nitisol soil under conventional tillage for pi 1 with subsoiling 0 45 m deep and grid leveling operations and no tillage practices for pi 2 sown in wheat crop residue 4000 kg ha in teresina the experiments were conducted on a dystrophic red yellow

experiments were irrigated by center pivot sprinklers senninger model i wob up3 while at teresina a sprinkler line source technique sprinklers fabrimar model a232 was used the irrigation amounts were scheduled by potential evapotranspiration eto that was determined for both sites with the priestley taylor pt method priestley and taylor 1972 based on solar radiation and air temperature variables that were recorded with sensors that were properly calibrated and with weather data that were checked daily at the on site weather station the pt method was applied under minimum advection conditions see supplementary material fig s4 using empirical parameter α 1 26 pereira and nova 1992 the pt method showed a close performance when compared to the penman monteith method for piracicaba villa nova and pereira 2006 and teresina andrade junior et al 2018 subsequently crop evapotranspiration was computed by multiplying eto by the crop coefficient kc as described in fao 56 allen 1998 irrigation was triggered when the available water in the top 0 2 m of the soil profile dropped below 80 the irrigation schedule was i 277 mm for the total amount of irrigation applied with on average 21 mm per

see irrigation events in supplementary material fig s5 the irrigation management strategy that was adopted in this study could have overestimated water consumption according to silva et al 2019 the use of kc can overestimate crop evapotranspiration by up to 20 for tropical environment field observations and measurements for each experiment included daily phenology observations with recorded

area index lai was measured using the plant canopy analyzer li cor model lai 2200c and following the recommendations proposed by gonçalves et al 2020 biomass samples were collected at approximately 10 day intervals from 1 m of row with a row spacing of 0 5 m from each of four replications the total plot size per replicate was 54 m² biomass was separated into leaf dry matter stem dry matter total top dry matter and grain weight and the individual samples were weighed after oven drying to constant weight at 70 5 ºc at final harvest crop yield was collected from three center rows 9 m2 from each replication lai measurements were conducted at approximate 10 day intervals between v3 and r7 with four replications volumetric soil water content measurements were made using an electromagnetic probe

water content during the crop season using a modular crop model structure described by jones et al 2001 the model computes the hourly distribution of temperatures see parton and logan 1981 kimball and bellamy 1986 solar radiation and photosynthesis photon flux density considering photosynthetic irradiance split into direct and diffuse components see erbs et al 1982 spitters 1986 spitters et al 1986 the hourly canopy photosynthesis simulations are is integrated to a daily photosynthesis value following the light interception and leaf to canopy assimilation method described by boote and pickering 1994 boote et al 1998 growth and maintenance respiration depend on temperature crop photosynthesis rate and current crop biomass see wilkerson et al 1983 jones et al 1989 phenological development is calculated using linear plateau functions that describe soybean cultivars sensitivity to both photoperiod and temperature see grimm et al 1993 grimm et al 1994 boote et al 2021 the model computes evapotranspiration using two different approaches the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 which is the default option and the fao 56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 potential transpiration i e crop water demand is computed as the product of the potential reference evapotranspiration of either et method and a model computed crop coefficient that depends on daily leaf area index lai the dssat approach for crop models uses an asymptotic function for daily lai to compute a dynamic crop coefficient with solar energy extinction equal to 0 68 sau et al 2004 boote et al 2008 this coefficient partitions reference evapotranspiration to either soil water evaporation or crop transpiration based on a crop energy extinction coefficient as described by sau et al 2004 and boote et al 2008 the soil water evaporation can be calculated by two methods in dssat the suleiman ritchie method is currently the default option suleiman and ritchie 2003 while the ritchie two stage method ritchie 1972 is an older version that was previously used in dssat the soil water balance simulates the daily processes that directly affect soil water content rainfall irrigation plant transpiration soil water evaporation infiltration runoff and drainage porter et al 2004 infiltration is calculated as the difference between water entry rainfall and or irrigation and surface runoff calculated using the usda runoff curve number approach williams 1991 downward flow controls the rate of water movement between layers with a tipping bucket concept using a drainage coefficient that is defined for the entire soil profile thus drainage from one layer to the next occurs when soil water content exceeds the field capacity water holding capacity in each layer potential root water uptake is a function of root length density and fraction available soil water content in each soil layer and is integrated over all soil layers where roots are present boote et al 2008 actual root water uptake is the minimum of potential root water uptake and potential transpiration water demand under soil water limitations when potential root water uptake is less than the transpirational demand both photosynthesis growth and transpiration are reduced by a ratio i e the actual daily root water uptake divided by the daily transpirational demand to evaluate the accuracy of csm cropgro soybean model for the r1 r3 r5 and r7 development stages the predictions were compared with the observed data also the response of the model was analyzed for lai leaf and stem dry matter total tops dry matter grain weight and for soil water content for different soil layers where measurements were taken as described previously the simulations were conducted using the priestley taylor potential evapotranspiration method priestley and taylor 1972 the suleiman ritchie soil water evaporation method suleiman and ritchie 2003 and the century soil organic matter method parton et al 1992 gijsman et al 2002 as soil water content measurements were started in v3 stage fehr and caviness 1977 we set the initial soil moisture to 50 of available soil water to initiate the soil water simulations of the model at 30 days prior to sowing the soil profiles data were created using the soil granulometry texture obtained on site by gimenes 2016 for piracicaba pi 1 and pi 2 and by melo et al 2014 for teresina te 1 and te 2 the soil water holding characteristics including ll dul and sat for each soil layer as well as bulk density and drainage rate were computed with the sbuild program of dssat uryasev et al 2004 which uses a pedo transfer function to convert soil texture into soil water holding traits table 2 for both soils these initial soil water holding traits were subsequently calibrated following four steps i the first step was simulating the soil water content for different depths and adjusting the ll and sat traits ii step 2 adjusting only dul iii step 3 adjusting only the soil root growth factor srgf iv step 4 re calibration of ll dul and sat the calibration procedures for all steps were conducted by a trial and error method against observed soil water content values using data set from pi 1 for piracicaba and from te 1 for teresina to improve on the statistics computed with the graphics program subsequently the soil water content was evaluated using data set from pi 2 for piracicaba and from te 2 for teresina we also simulated daily soil water evaporation root water uptake equivalent to crop transpiration extractable water cumulative runoff drainage and mulch evaporation to analyze the water balance performance simulated by the model for the soil water content we simulated the 0 20 m 0 15 0 20 m and 0 50 m 0 40 0 50 m soil depths for piracicaba and the 0 20 0 15 0 20 m 0 30 0 20 0 30 m and 0 40 m 0 30 0 40 soil depths for teresina although the root length and depth were not measured in this study the soil depths were chosen to represent a typical root system of soybean for tropical conditions which has a higher root density in the top layers from 0 10 to 0 50 m and with a maximum depth of around 0 60 m for typical brazilian soybean fields pivetta et al 2011 battisti and sentelhas 2017 balbinot junior et al 2018 the srgf in table 2 describes the fractional hospitality of successive soil layers to root length growth the daily distribution of root mass to root length in each layer follows the srgf factor but is also dependent on the soil water status of each individual soil layer e g root growth is reduced if a soil layer is either too dry or too wet and whether the rooting front has reached that depth see boote et al 2008 in addition allocation to root growth ceases when rapid seed growth begins the cultivar coefficients for brs399 mg 6 0 for piracicaba and 8579rsf mg 8 0 for teresina were estimated following the procedures developed by boote 1999 as summarized in three phases i during the first phase the goal was to evaluate the efficiency of simulations with the default cultivar parameters m group 6 for brs399 and m group 8 for 8579rsf using observed weather soil and management ii during the second phase only the coefficients associated with crop phenology were calibrated including the following development stages compared to observed data for r1 r3 r5 and r7 and iii during the third phase the calibration of other crop growth coefficients was also considered by comparison to measured data on lai leaf dry matter total tops dry matter and grain weight table 3 specifically for te 1 it was necessary to change the ppsen to mimic the soybean cultivar types grown in low latitude regions such as northeastern brazil that has a short day length to make the cultivar less sensitive to photoperiod the soybean cultivars recommended for this region were developed to have a very low sensitivity to photoperiod through the use of the long juvenile trait campelo et al 1998 carpentieri pípolo et al 2002 viana et al 2013 abrahão and costa 2018 the calibration of the mg 6 0 was evaluated for pi 2 while the calibration of mg 8 0 cultivar was evaluated for te 2 for both cultivars we evaluated the model capacity to predict i phenology ii lai iii leaf dry matter iv stem dry matter v total tops dry matter vi grain weight and vii soil water content 2 3 hypothetical scenarios of water management and conservation tillage we applied the csm cropgro soybean after calibration and evaluation of the model to explore water and tillage practices to ask what if questions tsuji et al 1998 thornton and hoogenboom 1994 by conducting virtual simulation experiments in piracicaba and teresina this included i conventional tillage versus no tillage practices with 4000 kg ha of crop surface residue in the initial conditions ii rainfed versus irrigation triggered at 30 40 50 60 70 or 80 water soil available in the 0 30 m of the soil profile and iii irrigation application rates at 10 20 and 30 mm for these simulations we used the planting date and initial soil water conditions from the pi 1 experiment for piracicaba and from the te 1 experiment for teresina the simulations were repeated for 30 seasons using long term daily historical weather data from 1988 to 2019 for both sites supplementary material figs s6 and s7 the long term scenarios were evaluated for their response to crop yield total number of irrigation applications and the total amount of irrigation applied during the growing season 2 4 statistics for model evaluation the accuracy of simulations was evaluated by comparing daily values of simulations with the observed data from both sites as described in the previous section we used the root mean square error rmse loague and green 1991 and index of agreement d statistic willmott et al 1985 as measures of goodness of fit the values were calculated using the following equations 1 rmse i 1 n s i o i n 2 d 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n s i o o i o ² 0 d 1 where n is number of observations s i is simulated value corresponding to measurement i on each date o i is observed value for measurement i and o is the average of observed values yang et al 2014 the d statistic and rmse were used to assess the error associated with simulation in relation to observed data described in the previous session the d statistic is the degree to which the observed values are approached by the model simulated values it ranges from 0 to 1 with 0 indicating no agreement between the observed and predicted values and 1 indicating perfect agreement thus a high value for the d statistic and a low value for rmse would imply better performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulated phenology growth and development for brs 399 and 8579rsf we used pi 1 and te 1 treatments for model calibration based on the priestley taylor method for evapotranspiration and the suleiman ritchie method for soil water evaporation after the second phase of calibration the model showed a correct prediction of the r1 r3 r5 and r7 for both experiments table 4 the pi 2 and te 2 treatments were then used for evaluation we observed a good accuracy for the simulation of development for both cultivars brs 399 and 8579rsf across the phenological stages the maximum difference between the simulated and the observed values was 5 days the evaluation of the csm cropgro soybean model for predicting phenology for te 2 showed identical results for both simulated and observed r1 and r3 but with the simulated r7 earlier than the observed r7 table 4 a shorter simulated cycle time between planting to physiological maturity te 2 than observed for te 2 is possibly an indication that the real crop did not experience as much drought stress as the simulated crop there was a reduction in the simulated cycle of te 2 because the model simulates reproductive development as a function of photoperiod temperature and soil water and nitrogen deficits boote et al 1998 in this case the difference was caused by the prediction of drought stress which uses the drought stress factor for photosynthesis to account for the effect of a water deficit on the plant physiological processes boote et al 2008 resulting in an acceleration to maturity after r5 this index indicates the daily severity of drought stress during the cropping season and ranges from a value of zero well watered conditions to one maximum stress fig 1 the experiment pi 2 showed identical results for evaluation of r1 but was less accurate for the simulation of the r3 r5 and r7 stages the crop model simulated a slightly shorter cycle than was observed in the field experiment with a difference between simulated and observed data that ranged from 1 to 2 days between r3 and r7 the model was able to show a similar shortening of the cycle length between pi 1 and pi 2 in pi 2 with a later planting and successively shorter days flowering and all stages were earlier compared to pi 1 it is possible that day length sensitivity is not sufficiently parameterized based on the single case of pi 1 with a more normal sowing date phenology affects dry matter accumulation and partitioning ultimately affecting seed yield boote et al 1998 kim and schultz 2020 salmerón and purcell 2016 soltani and sinclair 2012 thus the simulated and observed shorter cycle caused the grain yield in pi 2 to be almost 20 lower than pi 1 fig 2 the model successfully simulated this lower yield associated with a shorter duration from planting to physiological maturity due to a later planting the full water requirements treatments pi 1 pi 2 te 1 did not show any drought stress because the irrigation management was sufficient to supply the evapotranspiration demand throughout the growing season fig 2 in te 2 periodic drought stresses was simulated between r5 and r7 fig 1 which resulted in a reduction in total crop and grain weight compared to te 1 drought during the r5 r7 phase induces a decrease of the grain filling period by stimulating the acceleration of senescence souza egli and bruening 1997 fig 1 the water supply for te 1 resulted in a grain yield of 3290 kg ha while for te 2 the grain yield was 1379 kg ha the model was able to successfully simulate a similar response to water deficit with a decrease in total crop weight and grain yield fig 2 for our calibration procedure for pi 1 and te 1 we minimized the rmse maximized the d statistic and visually evaluated whether the cultivar coefficient adjustments were able to provide a better description of the observed growth variables based on these indicators we obtained the best possible adjustment and the calibrated model was able to correctly simulate lai leaf dry matter stem dry matter total top dry matter and grain weight over the time compared to the observed data table 5 we evaluated the csm cropgro soybean simulations and found that all evaluated variables were well simulated with values for the d statistic that were above 0 90 for all variables except for the leaf and stem components that had values for the d statistic that were greater than 0 8 table 5 3 2 simulation of soil water dynamics we varied the soil water holding traits from the standard condition computed via the sbuild after cultivar calibration through a trial and error method for each soil with the goal to minimize the rmse and maximize d in order to improve the simulations against the observed soil water content for pi 1 and te 1 the calibrated soil water holding traits are presented in table 2 we evaluated the performance of the csm cropgro soybean model to simulate the soil water balance for different depths of the soil profile and two soil conditions under tropical soybean production systems figs 3 4 the soil water content in piracicaba was satisfactorily simulated as the d statistic values for both depths i e 0 20 m and 0 50 m ranged from 0 579 to 0 835 and the values for rmse ranged from 0 011 to 0 020 cm3 cm3 however there was a tendency of the model to over estimate soil water content in both experiments fig 3 for the teresina site the soil water content was satisfactorily simulated with values for the d statistic for the 0 20 0 30 and 0 50 m soil depths that ranged from 0 535 to 0 984 and values for rmse that ranged from 0 005 to 0 027 cm3 cm3 fig 4 the soil water content was overestimated in te 1 and underestimated in te 2 the underestimation of simulated soil water content in te 2 corroborates with the previous arguments that the model overestimated drought stress fig 1 the different soil textures at piracicaba and teresina resulted in considerable differences in the amount of water retained under no drought stress conditions pi 1 pi 2 te 1 we observed a higher soil water content for the soil with the higher clay content i e the soil at piracicaba since the clay fraction contributes to the formation of micropores dexter 2004 zaffar and sheng gao 2015 the soil at piracicaba was a clay loam soil and showed large soil water content fluctuation for the 0 20 m soil depth whereas the 0 50 m soil depth had a less variable and higher soil water content especially at the beginning of the soybean cycle fig 3 the soil water content for the 0 50 m depth remained close to the dul the model simulated a similar response by smaller amount of soil water extraction by the soybean roots during this phase the cumulative values for rainfall were 947 mm with 177 6 mm of effective irrigation for pi 1 while pi 2 the rainfall was 703 5 mm with 242 4 mm of effective irrigation the soil at teresina was a sandy loam soil in both treatments te 1 and te 2 there was a large soil water content oscillation for the 0 20 m soil depth and a moderate oscillation for the 0 30 and 0 40 m soil depths in te 1 during the growing season showing a satisfactory simulated soil water content evaluation for the deeper layers at 60 days after planting fig 4 in te 2 there was a slow decrease of the soil water content from 40 days after planting for the 0 30 and 0 40 m depths this could indicate that the roots of the soybeans penetrated more deeply when the surface layers dried out due to soil water evaporation in these two deeper layers the soil water content declined and approached ll later during the growing season which is reflected in a high value for the photosynthesis drought stress factor fig 1 and a reduction in biomass growth and yield for this treatment fig 2 csm cropgro soybean simulated a large amount of total extractable water in the soil profile during the harvest period in piracicaba pi 1 and pi 2 with runoff and drainage values increasing during tropical storms fig 5 for the drought periods between 80 and 100 days after planting in pi 1 which was supplemented with irrigation the runoff was stabilized and the drainage was less the cumulative mulch evaporation in pi 2 was computed as described by porter et al 2010 and the reduced soil plus mulch evaporation allowed the model to simulate the practice of conservation of soil water by maintaining more constant levels of extractable water and a smoother runoff curve the inclusion of crop residue in the initial conditions of the pi 2 simulation was helpful to improve the statistical indicators for both the evaluation of soil water content and for soybean growth and development the experiments in teresina te 1 and te 2 were conducted under winter conditions with a high average temperature 28 4 ºc supplementary material fig s3 and a dry season with only a total of 15 4 mm of rainfall the irrigation management was responsible for practically all the water requirements of the soybean crop while the effective irrigation amounts were 418 3 mm for te 1 and 271 6 mm for te 2 the model simulated that there was no runoff or drainage during the season while the cumulative mulch evaporation was less than 5 mm fig 5 this happened because the irrigation management was carried out with a small amount of water per irrigation application the average irrigation amount was 17 6 mm for te 1 and 11 7 mm for te 2 with 2 or 3 days irrigation intervals simulated drainage is calculated by a cascading approach in which excess water above dul from an upper layer cascades to lower layers ritchie 1985 shelia et al 2018 the soil from teresina is deeper 1 8 m depth and we did not observe a soil water content above dul in the deepest measured layer 0 4 m depth fig 4 therefore there was no drainage 3 3 simulation of soil water evaporation and root water uptake pi 1 had a higher soil water evaporation rate during the early stages of the growing season than pi 2 fig 6 the model simulated less soil water evaporation during the pi 2 season because the soil surface water dynamics were modified by the presence of crop residue under no tillage practices other studies also found a satisfactory performance of the csm model for the simulation of the impact of tillage and residue on soil water dynamics andales et al 2000 liu et al 2011 corbeels et al 2016 adhikari et al 2017 the higher soil water evaporation rate was obtained for pi 1 within the first 20 days after planting under bare soil conditions with a high soil water content for the experiments conducted in piracicaba and teresina the soil water evaporation rate decreased during the growing season until rising again near physiological maturity when the reduction in canopy coverage due to leaf senescence and abscission increased solar radiation to the soil surface and increased soil water evaporation rate fig 6 the lai is a very important trait for the simulation of the soil water balance by csm cropgro soybean because the amount of solar radiation mj m² that reaches the soil is a function of lai thus impacting soil water evaporation and plant transpiration boote et al 2008 sau et al 1999 the root water uptake is calculated using a law of the limiting approach whereby soil water and root resistance or atmospheric demand control root water uptake ritchie 1981 which depends on the available soil water and root length density of each soil layer or horizon potential root water uptake must be computed before actual plant transpiration is computed featuring an upward flow closely related to soil water evaporation and plant transpiration shelia et al 2018 as expected we observed a strong relationship between the highest lai values and the highest root water uptake rates fig 6 a good calibration of the lai is relevant to obtain a satisfactory performance for predicting yield richetti et al 2019 and soil water balance simulation the te 2 simulation of lai suggests that the model simulated more drought stress than was observed in the field experiment fig 6 which corroborates with the slightly lower simulated tops and grain weight fig 2 compared with the observed data the greater severity of the simulated drought stress may explain the 5 day gap table 2 in phenological maturity between the simulated and the observed data 3 4 simulation of long term of water management scenarios following the evaluation of the csm cropgro soybean model for simulation of soybean growth and development and the soil water balance we conducted a seasonal analysis based on what if scenarios for a tropical environment the long term simulations for soybean yield and the impact of tillage practices on water management are presented in fig 7 the rainfed condition in piracicaba presented the largest variation in the crop yield among the 30 simulated seasons and the no tillage practices increased crop yield by about 240 kg ha on average fig 7 the simulations showed that the average yield increased by 564 kg ha compared to pi rainfed if irrigation was triggered when 50 available water remained among the pi 50 to pi 80 irrigation triggering scenarios the difference in crop yield was only 50 kg ha the use of irrigation made it possible to reduce the production risk in relation to rainfed conditions because the range between highest and lowest values in pi rainfed was 3020 kg ha while the range was 1400 kg ha for the pi 50 irrigation scenarios conservation tillage practices reduced the irrigation amount on average by 43 for pi 30 and 27 for pi 80 while maintaining productivity levels very close to conventional tillage the use of no tillage reduced the number of irrigation applications on average by one application among the different scenarios the soybean grown in teresina showed a lower yield potential than in piracicaba because it was grown in low latitude region during the winter with a shorter life cycle along with less daily total solar radiation for the teresina winter environment with almost no rainfall the average yield under rainfed conditions was less than 50 kg ha yield response to irrigation was greatest for the first irrigation increments 0 30 30 40 or 40 50 triggering thresholds the highest average crop yield was 3532 kg ha in te 70 with 140 kg ha more yield than te 60 but required an additional 52 mm in seasonal applied irrigation within a given irrigation scenario such as te 40 yield was an average of 2084 kg ha under conventional tillage and 2225 kg ha with no tillage practices while saving 13 mm of water under no tillage surface residue with no tillage in teresina resulted in increased yield for triggering supplemental irrigation at 30 40 and 50 but showed little to no yield benefit at higher triggering levels of 60 70 or 80 fig 7 however no tillage practices reduced the seasonal applied irrigation on average by 20 mm for te 50 and 56 mm for te 70 fig 7 the use of a relatively high amount of irrigation per application is common in brazilian agricultural practices mainly due to a decrease in the energy costs associated with each irrigation event however in this case farmers might apply more water than is needed thus both water and energy are wasted kamienski et al 2019 marin et al 2019 silva et al 2019 in our findings with dssat as a water management tool for scheduling irrigation decreasing the amount of water per irrigation application from 30 to 10 mm for pi 50 could save 38 mm for conventional tillage and 27 mm for the no tillage practices this represents almost 40 of water saved with an increase of three irrigation applications while maintaining the same yield level fig 8 the decreased irrigation application rate from 30 to 10 mm showed the largest reduction in the total amount of water applied for pi 80 with no tillage practices at around 115 mm however as shown in fig 7 irrigation triggering above a 50 threshold level in piracicaba does not result in a yield increase despite the increase in water consumption the scenarios for teresina showed that applying irrigation triggered at 60 water remaining is most efficient showing a greater yield per seasonal applied irrigation fig 7 however reducing the irrigation amount per application from 30 to 20 mm decreased the total water requirement from 494 to 472 mm with conventional tillage and from 454 to 424 mm with no tillage practices at the expense of seven more irrigation applications fig 9 frequent light irrigations like this may work with drip irrigation but from a realistic viewpoint no farmer producer would apply an irrigation amount of 10 or 20 mm per overhead application to save 20 or 30 mm with an increase in seven applications so this argument of water savings is somewhat artificial thus the irrigation management of soybean in teresina during the winter with 30 mm of irrigation application rate with no tillage practices is potentially more appropriate because this site has a deep soil with a good water retention capacity and a small amount of water loss due to drainage and runoff table 2 fig 5 the simulations of the csm cropgro soybean model for both sites showed differences among tillage practices soil texture and irrigation amount as discussed previously the model was able to explore different scenarios combining tillage practices and water management using long term historical weather data following successful calibration of the model for crop growth and development and soil moisture soil management with the maintenance of soil mulch can contribute to reducing the amount of water required for supplemental irrigation for soybean production and contribute to sustainable intensification of agriculture in brazil however for the agricultural system analysis in the long term scenarios it is important to consider that the model showed a slight tendency to overestimate the soil water content under fully irrigated conditions pi 1 pi 2 te 1 and to underestimate the soil water content in drought conditions te 2 this may suggest the need to improve several model features 1 the simulated efficiency of applied irrigation that is infiltrating the soil 2 the soil evaporation method which may cause excessive soil water depletion under drought and 3 the transpiration method which may also cause too much soil water depletion under drought implications for the scenario analyses are that the model at present may over estimate drought stress for drought conditions however in general the csm cropgro soybean performed very well in this study and demonstrated the potential for using the model as a tool for agricultural water management under tropical conditions 4 conclusions the csm cropgro soybean model of dssat was evaluated for its ability to simulate soil water balance and soybean growth and development under a tropical environment there was a good agreement between simulated and observed soil water content over time under different soils tillage practices water requirements and tropical conditions in brazil the long term scenarios showed that the amount of irrigation for a soybean crop in a tropical environment can be reduced with the use of no tillage practices we conclude that the model was able to accurately simulate the soybean growth development and yield as well as the soil water balance for different tropical environments and that dssat can be applied to evaluate different irrigation management options to help conserve water use declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

model in conjunction with field data to determine the impact of different irrigation regimes soil texture and tillage practices on soybean glycine max l merr growth development and yield for tropical conditions field experiments were conducted at two sites i piracicaba with conventional tillage pi 1 season 2016 2017 and no tillage practices pi 2 season 2017 2018 where the experiments were irrigated with full water requirements and ii teresina under conventional tillage season 2019 with two irrigation treatments of full te 1 and 50 te 2 water requirements soil water content was measured for all experiments using an electromagnetic probe installed at several depths the results showed that the model was able to simulate soybean growth and development for the different sites with a very good agreement d statistic 0 8 between the simulated and observed data in addition the soil water content was simulated with satisfactory accuracy d statistic 0 5 following model evaluation long term hypothetical scenarios for different soil tillage practices and water management regimes were simulated for piracicaba and teresina sites the results showed that the use of no tillage could reduce the average amount of irrigation in piracicaba by 30 and in teresina by 17 achieving the same yield level as conventional tillage thus the csm cropgro soybean can be used as a tool for determining optimum water management practices for tropical environments keywords soil management practices modelling irrigated agriculture drought stress soil moisture dssat 1 introduction brazil is an important tropical agricultural region and is the second largest soybean glycine max l merr producer in the world in a tropical environment periods of drought during the rainy season or during the second cropping cycle sowing at the end of the rainy season are considered the most limiting factors for crop yield battisti et al 2018 multsch et al 2020 this happens because most tropical rainfall is characterized by irregularity and high intensity while crop water needs are generally large due to high temperatures and strong solar radiation nieuwolt 1989 therefore improved water management is an important component for increasing agricultural sustainable intensification in tropical environments evaluating the soil crop water balance is a proven approach for understanding drought stress

hoogenboom et al 2019b based on soil texture bulk density and organic carbon content data as well as soil surface and general soil profile characteristics soil water content is an essential variable for evaluating the soil water balance and is very important for water management of cropping systems an accurate estimate of the soil water balance can help with improving water use efficiency qubaja

any published reports that have evaluated the soil water balance and associated crop growth and development with the csm cropgro soybean model with experimental data from tropical environments the objectives of this study were therefore to calibrate and evaluate the performance of the csm cropgro soybean model for simulating soybean growth and development and especially soil moisture content and to apply hypothetical scenarios using different water management and conservation tillage options for two tropical environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiments irrigation experiments

experiments were irrigated by center pivot sprinklers senninger model i wob up3 while at teresina a sprinkler line source technique sprinklers fabrimar model a232 was used the irrigation amounts were scheduled by potential evapotranspiration eto that was determined for both sites with the priestley taylor pt method priestley and taylor 1972 based on solar radiation and air temperature variables that were recorded with sensors that were properly calibrated and with weather data that were checked daily at the on site weather station the pt method was applied under minimum advection conditions see supplementary material fig s4 using empirical parameter α 1 26 pereira and nova 1992 the pt method showed a close performance when compared to the penman monteith method for piracicaba villa nova and pereira 2006 and teresina andrade junior et al 2018 subsequently crop evapotranspiration was computed by multiplying eto by the crop coefficient kc as described in fao 56 allen 1998 irrigation was triggered when the available water in the top 0 2 m of the soil profile dropped below 80 the irrigation schedule was i 277 mm for the total amount of irrigation applied with on average 21 mm per

water content during the crop season using a modular crop model structure described by jones et al 2001 the model computes the hourly distribution of temperatures see parton and logan 1981 kimball and bellamy 1986 solar radiation and photosynthesis photon flux density considering photosynthetic irradiance split into direct and diffuse components see erbs et al 1982 spitters 1986 spitters et al 1986 the hourly canopy photosynthesis simulations are is integrated to a daily photosynthesis value following the light interception and leaf to canopy assimilation method described by boote and pickering 1994 boote et al 1998 growth and maintenance respiration depend on temperature crop photosynthesis rate and current crop biomass see wilkerson et al 1983 jones et al 1989 phenological development is calculated using linear plateau functions that describe soybean cultivars sensitivity to both photoperiod and temperature see grimm et al 1993 grimm et al 1994 boote et al 2021 the model computes evapotranspiration using two different approaches the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 which is the default option and the fao 56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 potential transpiration i e crop water demand is computed as the product of the potential reference evapotranspiration of either et method and a model computed crop coefficient that depends on daily leaf area index lai the dssat approach for crop models uses an asymptotic function for daily lai to compute a dynamic crop coefficient with solar energy extinction equal to 0 68 sau et al 2004 boote et al 2008 this coefficient partitions reference evapotranspiration to either soil water evaporation or crop transpiration based on a crop energy extinction coefficient as described by sau et al 2004 and boote et al 2008 the soil water evaporation can be calculated by two methods in dssat the suleiman ritchie method is currently the default option suleiman and ritchie 2003 while the ritchie two stage method ritchie 1972 is an older version that was previously used in dssat the soil water balance simulates the daily processes that directly affect soil water content rainfall irrigation plant transpiration soil water evaporation infiltration runoff and drainage porter et al 2004 infiltration is calculated as the difference between water entry rainfall and or irrigation and surface runoff calculated using the usda runoff curve number approach williams 1991 downward flow controls the rate of water movement between layers with a tipping bucket concept using a drainage coefficient that is defined for the entire soil profile thus drainage from one layer to the next occurs when soil water content exceeds the field capacity water holding capacity in each layer potential root water uptake is a function of root length density and fraction available soil water content in each soil layer and is integrated over all soil layers where roots are present boote et al 2008 actual root water uptake is the minimum of potential root water uptake and potential transpiration water demand under soil water limitations when potential root water uptake is less than the transpirational demand both photosynthesis growth and transpiration are reduced by a ratio i e the actual daily root water uptake divided by the daily transpirational demand to evaluate the accuracy of csm cropgro soybean model for the r1 r3 r5 and r7 development stages the predictions were compared with the observed data also the response of the model was analyzed for lai leaf and stem dry matter total tops dry matter grain weight and for soil water content for different soil layers where measurements were taken as described previously the simulations were conducted using the priestley taylor potential evapotranspiration method priestley and taylor 1972 the suleiman ritchie soil water evaporation method suleiman and ritchie 2003 and the century soil organic matter method parton et al 1992 gijsman et al 2002 as soil water content measurements were started in v3 stage fehr and caviness 1977 we set the initial soil moisture to 50 of available soil water to initiate the soil water simulations of the model at 30 days prior to sowing the soil profiles data were created using the soil granulometry texture obtained on site by gimenes 2016 for piracicaba pi 1 and pi 2 and by melo et al 2014 for teresina te 1 and te 2 the soil water holding characteristics including ll dul and sat for each soil layer as well as bulk density and drainage rate were computed with the sbuild program of dssat uryasev et al 2004 which uses a pedo transfer function to convert soil texture into soil water holding traits table 2 for both soils these initial soil water holding traits were subsequently calibrated following four steps i the first step was simulating the soil water content for different depths and adjusting the ll and sat traits ii step 2 adjusting only dul iii step 3 adjusting only the soil root growth factor srgf iv step 4 re calibration of ll dul and sat the calibration procedures for all steps were conducted by a trial and error method against observed soil water content values using data set from pi 1 for piracicaba and from te 1 for teresina to improve on the statistics computed with the graphics program subsequently the soil water content was evaluated using data set from pi 2 for piracicaba and from te 2 for teresina we also simulated daily soil water evaporation root water uptake equivalent to crop transpiration extractable water cumulative runoff drainage and mulch evaporation to analyze the water balance performance simulated by the model for the soil water content we simulated the 0 20 m 0 15 0 20 m and 0 50 m 0 40 0 50 m soil depths for piracicaba and the 0 20 0 15 0 20 m 0 30 0 20 0 30 m and 0 40 m 0 30 0 40 soil depths for teresina although the root length and depth were not measured in this study the soil depths were chosen to represent a typical root system of soybean for tropical conditions which has a higher root density in the top layers from 0 10 to 0 50 m and with a maximum depth of around 0 60 m for typical brazilian soybean fields pivetta et al 2011 battisti and sentelhas 2017 balbinot junior et al 2018 the srgf in table 2 describes the fractional hospitality of successive soil layers to root length growth the daily distribution of root mass to root length in each layer follows the srgf factor but is also dependent on the soil water status of each individual soil layer e g root growth is reduced if a soil layer is either too dry or too wet and whether the rooting front has reached that depth see boote et al 2008 in addition allocation to root growth ceases when rapid seed growth begins the cultivar coefficients for brs399 mg 6 0 for piracicaba and 8579rsf mg 8 0 for teresina were estimated following the procedures developed by boote 1999 as summarized in three phases i during the first phase the goal was to evaluate the efficiency of simulations with the default cultivar parameters m group 6 for brs399 and m group 8 for 8579rsf using observed weather soil and management ii during the second phase only the coefficients associated with crop phenology were calibrated including the following development stages compared to observed data for r1 r3 r5 and r7 and iii during the third phase the calibration of other crop growth coefficients was also considered by comparison to measured data on lai leaf dry matter total tops dry matter and grain weight table 3 specifically for te 1 it was necessary to change the ppsen to mimic the soybean cultivar types grown in low latitude regions such as northeastern brazil that has a short day length to make the cultivar less sensitive to photoperiod the soybean cultivars recommended for this region were developed to have a very low sensitivity to photoperiod through the use of the long juvenile trait campelo et al 1998 carpentieri pípolo et al 2002 viana et al 2013 abrahão and costa 2018 the calibration of the mg 6 0 was evaluated for pi 2 while the calibration of mg 8 0 cultivar was evaluated for te 2 for both cultivars we evaluated the model capacity to predict i phenology ii lai iii leaf dry matter iv stem dry matter v total tops dry matter vi grain weight and vii soil water content 2 3 hypothetical scenarios of water management and conservation tillage we applied the csm cropgro soybean after calibration and evaluation of the model to explore water and tillage practices to ask what if questions tsuji et al 1998 thornton and hoogenboom 1994 by conducting virtual simulation experiments in piracicaba and teresina this included i conventional tillage versus no tillage practices with 4000 kg ha of crop surface residue in the initial conditions ii rainfed versus irrigation triggered at 30 40 50 60 70 or 80 water soil available in the 0 30 m of the soil profile and iii irrigation application rates at 10 20 and 30 mm for these simulations we used the planting date and initial soil water conditions from the pi 1 experiment for piracicaba and from the te 1 experiment for teresina the simulations were repeated for 30 seasons using long term daily historical weather data from 1988 to 2019 for both sites supplementary material figs s6 and s7 the long term scenarios were evaluated for their response to crop yield total number of irrigation applications and the total amount of irrigation applied during the growing season 2 4 statistics for model evaluation the accuracy of simulations was evaluated by comparing daily values of simulations with the observed data from both sites as described in the previous section we used the root mean square error rmse loague and green 1991 and index of agreement d statistic willmott et al 1985 as measures of goodness of fit the values were calculated using the following equations 1 rmse i 1 n s i o i n 2 d 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n s i o o i o ² 0 d 1 where n is number of observations s i is simulated value corresponding to measurement i on each date o i is observed value for measurement i and o is the average of observed values yang et al 2014 the d statistic and rmse were used to assess the error associated with simulation in relation to observed data described in the previous session the d statistic is the degree to which the observed values are approached by the model simulated values it ranges from 0 to 1 with 0 indicating no agreement between the observed and predicted values and 1 indicating perfect agreement thus a high value for the d statistic and a low value for rmse would imply better performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulated phenology growth and development for brs 399 and 8579rsf we used pi 1 and te 1 treatments for model calibration based on the priestley taylor method for evapotranspiration and the suleiman ritchie method for soil water evaporation after the second phase of calibration the model showed a correct prediction of the r1 r3 r5 and r7 for both experiments table 4 the pi 2 and te 2 treatments were then used for evaluation we observed a good accuracy for the simulation of development for both cultivars brs 399 and 8579rsf across the phenological stages the maximum difference between the simulated and the observed values was 5 days the evaluation of the csm cropgro soybean model for predicting phenology for te 2 showed identical results for both simulated and observed r1 and r3 but with the simulated r7 earlier than the observed r7 table 4 a shorter simulated cycle time between planting to physiological maturity te 2 than observed for te 2 is possibly an indication that the real crop did not experience as much drought stress as the simulated crop there was a reduction in the simulated cycle of te 2 because the model simulates reproductive development as a function of photoperiod temperature and soil water and nitrogen deficits boote et al 1998 in this case the difference was caused by the prediction of drought stress which uses the drought stress factor for photosynthesis to account for the effect of a water deficit on the plant physiological processes boote et al 2008 resulting in an acceleration to maturity after r5 this index indicates the daily severity of drought stress during the cropping season and ranges from a value of zero well watered conditions to one maximum stress fig 1 the experiment pi 2 showed identical results for evaluation of r1 but was less accurate for the simulation of the r3 r5 and r7 stages the crop model simulated a slightly shorter cycle than was observed in the field experiment with a difference between simulated and observed data that ranged from 1 to 2 days between r3 and r7 the model was able to show a similar shortening of the cycle length between pi 1 and pi 2 in pi 2 with a later planting and successively shorter days flowering and all stages were earlier compared to pi 1 it is possible that day length sensitivity is not sufficiently parameterized based on the single case of pi 1 with a more normal sowing date phenology affects dry matter accumulation and partitioning ultimately affecting seed yield boote et al 1998 kim and schultz 2020 salmerón and purcell 2016 soltani and sinclair 2012 thus the simulated and observed shorter cycle caused the grain yield in pi 2 to be almost 20 lower than pi 1 fig 2 the model successfully simulated this lower yield associated with a shorter duration from planting to physiological maturity due to a later planting the full water requirements treatments pi 1 pi 2 te 1 did not show any drought stress because the irrigation management was sufficient to supply the evapotranspiration demand throughout the growing season fig 2 in te 2 periodic drought stresses was simulated between r5 and r7 fig 1 which resulted in a reduction in total crop and grain weight compared to te 1 drought during the r5 r7 phase induces a decrease of the grain filling period by stimulating the acceleration of senescence souza egli and bruening 1997 fig 1 the water supply for te 1 resulted in a grain yield of 3290 kg ha while for te 2 the grain yield was 1379 kg ha the model was able to successfully simulate a similar response to water deficit with a decrease in total crop weight and grain yield fig 2 for our calibration procedure for pi 1 and te 1 we minimized the rmse maximized the d statistic and visually evaluated whether the cultivar coefficient adjustments were able to provide a better description of the observed growth variables based on these indicators we obtained the best possible adjustment and the calibrated model was able to correctly simulate lai leaf dry matter stem dry matter total top dry matter and grain weight over the time compared to the observed data table 5 we evaluated the csm cropgro soybean simulations and found that all evaluated variables were well simulated with values for the d statistic that were above 0 90 for all variables except for the leaf and stem components that had values for the d statistic that were greater than 0 8 table 5 3 2 simulation of soil water dynamics we varied the soil water holding traits from the standard condition computed via the sbuild after cultivar calibration through a trial and error method for each soil with the goal to minimize the rmse and maximize d in order to improve the simulations against the observed soil water content for pi 1 and te 1 the calibrated soil water holding traits are presented in table 2 we evaluated the performance of the csm cropgro soybean model to simulate the soil water balance for different depths of the soil profile and two soil conditions under tropical soybean production systems figs 3 4 the soil water content in piracicaba was satisfactorily simulated as the d statistic values for both depths i e 0 20 m and 0 50 m ranged from 0 579 to 0 835 and the values for rmse ranged from 0 011 to 0 020 cm3 cm3 however there was a tendency of the model to over estimate soil water content in both experiments fig 3 for the teresina site the soil water content was satisfactorily simulated with values for the d statistic for the 0 20 0 30 and 0 50 m soil depths that ranged from 0 535 to 0 984 and values for rmse that ranged from 0 005 to 0 027 cm3 cm3 fig 4 the soil water content was overestimated in te 1 and underestimated in te 2 the underestimation of simulated soil water content in te 2 corroborates with the previous arguments that the model overestimated drought stress fig 1 the different soil textures at piracicaba and teresina resulted in considerable differences in the amount of water retained under no drought stress conditions pi 1 pi 2 te 1 we observed a higher soil water content for the soil with the higher clay content i e the soil at piracicaba since the clay fraction contributes to the formation of micropores dexter 2004 zaffar and sheng gao 2015 the soil at piracicaba was a clay loam soil and showed large soil water content fluctuation for the 0 20 m soil depth whereas the 0 50 m soil depth had a less variable and higher soil water content especially at the beginning of the soybean cycle fig 3 the soil water content for the 0 50 m depth remained close to the dul the model simulated a similar response by smaller amount of soil water extraction by the soybean roots during this phase the cumulative values for rainfall were 947 mm with 177 6 mm of effective irrigation for pi 1 while pi 2 the rainfall was 703 5 mm with 242 4 mm of effective irrigation the soil at teresina was a sandy loam soil in both treatments te 1 and te 2 there was a large soil water content oscillation for the 0 20 m soil depth and a moderate oscillation for the 0 30 and 0 40 m soil depths in te 1 during the growing season showing a satisfactory simulated soil water content evaluation for the deeper layers at 60 days after planting fig 4 in te 2 there was a slow decrease of the soil water content from 40 days after planting for the 0 30 and 0 40 m depths this could indicate that the roots of the soybeans penetrated more deeply when the surface layers dried out due to soil water evaporation in these two deeper layers the soil water content declined and approached ll later during the growing season which is reflected in a high value for the photosynthesis drought stress factor fig 1 and a reduction in biomass growth and yield for this treatment fig 2 csm cropgro soybean simulated a large amount of total extractable water in the soil profile during the harvest period in piracicaba pi 1 and pi 2 with runoff and drainage values increasing during tropical storms fig 5 for the drought periods between 80 and 100 days after planting in pi 1 which was supplemented with irrigation the runoff was stabilized and the drainage was less the cumulative mulch evaporation in pi 2 was computed as described by porter et al 2010 and the reduced soil plus mulch evaporation allowed the model to simulate the practice of conservation of soil water by maintaining more constant levels of extractable water and a smoother runoff curve the inclusion of crop residue in the initial conditions of the pi 2 simulation was helpful to improve the statistical indicators for both the evaluation of soil water content and for soybean growth and development the experiments in teresina te 1 and te 2 were conducted under winter conditions with a high average temperature 28 4 ºc supplementary material fig s3 and a dry season with only a total of 15 4 mm of rainfall the irrigation management was responsible for practically all the water requirements of the soybean crop while the effective irrigation amounts were 418 3 mm for te 1 and 271 6 mm for te 2 the model simulated that there was no runoff or drainage during the season while the cumulative mulch evaporation was less than 5 mm fig 5 this happened because the irrigation management was carried out with a small amount of water per irrigation application the average irrigation amount was 17 6 mm for te 1 and 11 7 mm for te 2 with 2 or 3 days irrigation intervals simulated drainage is calculated by a cascading approach in which excess water above dul from an upper layer cascades to lower layers ritchie 1985 shelia et al 2018 the soil from teresina is deeper 1 8 m depth and we did not observe a soil water content above dul in the deepest measured layer 0 4 m depth fig 4 therefore there was no drainage 3 3 simulation of soil water evaporation and root water uptake pi 1 had a higher soil water evaporation rate during the early stages of the growing season than pi 2 fig 6 the model simulated less soil water evaporation during the pi 2 season because the soil surface water dynamics were modified by the presence of crop residue under no tillage practices other studies also found a satisfactory performance of the csm model for the simulation of the impact of tillage and residue on soil water dynamics andales et al 2000 liu et al 2011 corbeels et al 2016 adhikari et al 2017 the higher soil water evaporation rate was obtained for pi 1 within the first 20 days after planting under bare soil conditions with a high soil water content for the experiments conducted in piracicaba and teresina the soil water evaporation rate decreased during the growing season until rising again near physiological maturity when the reduction in canopy coverage due to leaf senescence and abscission increased solar radiation to the soil surface and increased soil water evaporation rate fig 6 the lai is a very important trait for the simulation of the soil water balance by csm cropgro soybean because the amount of solar radiation mj m² that reaches the soil is a function of lai thus impacting soil water evaporation and plant transpiration boote et al 2008 sau et al 1999 the root water uptake is calculated using a law of the limiting approach whereby soil water and root resistance or atmospheric demand control root water uptake ritchie 1981 which depends on the available soil water and root length density of each soil layer or horizon potential root water uptake must be computed before actual plant transpiration is computed featuring an upward flow closely related to soil water evaporation and plant transpiration shelia et al 2018 as expected we observed a strong relationship between the highest lai values and the highest root water uptake rates fig 6 a good calibration of the lai is relevant to obtain a satisfactory performance for predicting yield richetti et al 2019 and soil water balance simulation the te 2 simulation of lai suggests that the model simulated more drought stress than was observed in the field experiment fig 6 which corroborates with the slightly lower simulated tops and grain weight fig 2 compared with the observed data the greater severity of the simulated drought stress may explain the 5 day gap table 2 in phenological maturity between the simulated and the observed data 3 4 simulation of long term of water management scenarios following the evaluation of the csm cropgro soybean model for simulation of soybean growth and development and the soil water balance we conducted a seasonal analysis based on what if scenarios for a tropical environment the long term simulations for soybean yield and the impact of tillage practices on water management are presented in fig 7 the rainfed condition in piracicaba presented the largest variation in the crop yield among the 30 simulated seasons and the no tillage practices increased crop yield by about 240 kg ha on average fig 7 the simulations showed that the average yield increased by 564 kg ha compared to pi rainfed if irrigation was triggered when 50 available water remained among the pi 50 to pi 80 irrigation triggering scenarios the difference in crop yield was only 50 kg ha the use of irrigation made it possible to reduce the production risk in relation to rainfed conditions because the range between highest and lowest values in pi rainfed was 3020 kg ha while the range was 1400 kg ha for the pi 50 irrigation scenarios conservation tillage practices reduced the irrigation amount on average by 43 for pi 30 and 27 for pi 80 while maintaining productivity levels very close to conventional tillage the use of no tillage reduced the number of irrigation applications on average by one application among the different scenarios the soybean grown in teresina showed a lower yield potential than in piracicaba because it was grown in low latitude region during the winter with a shorter life cycle along with less daily total solar radiation for the teresina winter environment with almost no rainfall the average yield under rainfed conditions was less than 50 kg ha yield response to irrigation was greatest for the first irrigation increments 0 30 30 40 or 40 50 triggering thresholds the highest average crop yield was 3532 kg ha in te 70 with 140 kg ha more yield than te 60 but required an additional 52 mm in seasonal applied irrigation within a given irrigation scenario such as te 40 yield was an average of 2084 kg ha under conventional tillage and 2225 kg ha with no tillage practices while saving 13 mm of water under no tillage surface residue with no tillage in teresina resulted in increased yield for triggering supplemental irrigation at 30 40 and 50 but showed little to no yield benefit at higher triggering levels of 60 70 or 80 fig 7 however no tillage practices reduced the seasonal applied irrigation on average by 20 mm for te 50 and 56 mm for te 70 fig 7 the use of a relatively high amount of irrigation per application is common in brazilian agricultural practices mainly due to a decrease in the energy costs associated with each irrigation event however in this case farmers might apply more water than is needed thus both water and energy are wasted kamienski et al 2019 marin et al 2019 silva et al 2019 in our findings with dssat as a water management tool for scheduling irrigation decreasing the amount of water per irrigation application from 30 to 10 mm for pi 50 could save 38 mm for conventional tillage and 27 mm for the no tillage practices this represents almost 40 of water saved with an increase of three irrigation applications while maintaining the same yield level fig 8 the decreased irrigation application rate from 30 to 10 mm showed the largest reduction in the total amount of water applied for pi 80 with no tillage practices at around 115 mm however as shown in fig 7 irrigation triggering above a 50 threshold level in piracicaba does not result in a yield increase despite the increase in water consumption the scenarios for teresina showed that applying irrigation triggered at 60 water remaining is most efficient showing a greater yield per seasonal applied irrigation fig 7 however reducing the irrigation amount per application from 30 to 20 mm decreased the total water requirement from 494 to 472 mm with conventional tillage and from 454 to 424 mm with no tillage practices at the expense of seven more irrigation applications fig 9 frequent light irrigations like this may work with drip irrigation but from a realistic viewpoint no farmer producer would apply an irrigation amount of 10 or 20 mm per overhead application to save 20 or 30 mm with an increase in seven applications so this argument of water savings is somewhat artificial thus the irrigation management of soybean in teresina during the winter with 30 mm of irrigation application rate with no tillage practices is potentially more appropriate because this site has a deep soil with a good water retention capacity and a small amount of water loss due to drainage and runoff table 2 fig 5 the simulations of the csm cropgro soybean model for both sites showed differences among tillage practices soil texture and irrigation amount as discussed previously the model was able to explore different scenarios combining tillage practices and water management using long term historical weather data following successful calibration of the model for crop growth and development and soil moisture soil management with the maintenance of soil mulch can contribute to reducing the amount of water required for supplemental irrigation for soybean production and contribute to sustainable intensification of agriculture in brazil however for the agricultural system analysis in the long term scenarios it is important to consider that the model showed a slight tendency to overestimate the soil water content under fully irrigated conditions pi 1 pi 2 te 1 and to underestimate the soil water content in drought conditions te 2 this may suggest the need to improve several model features 1 the simulated efficiency of applied irrigation that is infiltrating the soil 2 the soil evaporation method which may cause excessive soil water depletion under drought and 3 the transpiration method which may also cause too much soil water depletion under drought implications for the scenario analyses are that the model at present may over estimate drought stress for drought conditions however in general the csm cropgro soybean performed very well in this study and demonstrated the potential for using the model as a tool for agricultural water management under tropical conditions 4 conclusions the csm cropgro soybean model of dssat was evaluated for its ability to simulate soil water balance and soybean growth and development under a tropical environment there was a good agreement between simulated and observed soil water content over time under different soils tillage practices water requirements and tropical conditions in brazil the long term scenarios showed that the amount of irrigation for a soybean crop in a tropical environment can be reduced with the use of no tillage practices we conclude that the model was able to accurately simulate the soybean growth development and yield as well as the soil water balance for different tropical environments and that dssat can be applied to evaluate different irrigation management options to help conserve water use declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

components net radiation rni soil heat flux gi sensible heat flux hi and latent heat flux lei at times of landsat satellite overpasses in conjunction with the actual evapotranspiration eta and crop coefficient kc for a superintensive drip irrigated olive olea europeae l cv arbequina orchard the orchard is located in the pencahue valley maule region chile 35 23 ls 71 44 lw 96 m above sea level and the study was conducted on an experimental plot of 21 1 ha during the 2011 2012 and 2012 2013 growing seasons model performance was evaluated using measurements of lei eta and kc that were obtained from an eddy covariance ec system olive specific functions for estimating aerodynamic roughness zom leaf area index lai and gi were employed in the metric algorithm in addition submodels of rni and gi were evaluated via ground truth measurements from a fritchen type net radiometer and soil flux plates respectively the results indicated that the errors within the metric model for the seb components were between 2 and 5 of the observed values while those for eta and kc were between 4 and 6 of the ec values in addition both the root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae for the seb components were less than 46 w m 2 at the times of satellite overpass the rmse and mae values for the 24 h eta were 0 42 and 0 31 mm day 1 respectively while the corresponding values for kc were 0 09 and 0 02 respectively the coefficients of variation cvs for the seb components eta and kc were less than 15 and the largest intraorchard spatial variability occurred for lei and thus eta the errors and uncertainties in the seb and eta estimates were small enough to warrant application of the metric model with olive specific functions for zom lai and gi to superintensive drip irrigated olive orchards keywords water requirements irrigation management remote sensing olive oil spatial variability 1 introduction the olive oil industry in chile has grown significantly during the last decade especially in semiarid mediterranean regions with hot and dry summer climates that are associated with very low precipitation 50 mm during the growing season in these regions new plantations have included drip irrigation and superintensive training systems together with high plant densities 1000 trees ha 1 lópez olivari et al 2016 moreover the stability and growth of the olive oil industry will be substantially affected by future water scarcity scenarios under these conditions proper orchard irrigation management will be key to maintaining yield and quality olive oil production while limiting water consumption ahumada orellana et al 2018 2017 to achieve optimum irrigation management it is crucial to estimate orchard water requirements or the actual evapotranspiration eta according to the spatial variability of the soil cultivar and climate as well as the allowable amounts of water stress to trees lópez olivari et al 2016 ortega farias et al 2009 eta is traditionally quantified using the grass or alfalfa reference evapotranspiration etr24 multiplied by a single crop coefficient kc allen et al 1998 er raki et al 2010 and allen et al 1998 suggested using the dual crop coefficient approach to describe the ratio of eta more accurately to etr24 by separating kc into the basal crop coefficient kcb and soil evaporation coefficient ke for heteronomous canopies such as those of olive orchards the kc and kcb values require local adjustments because they vary with canopy architecture and nonlinear interactions between soils cultivars and climate cammalleri et al 2013 ortega farias et al 2009 paço et al 2014 in addition lópez olivari et al 2016 indicated that water consumption in superintensive olive orchards is dominated by the canopy which is generally nonuniform as a result of the tree geometry caused by training systems in this case energy absorbed by vegetation and by the soil surface depends on spatial variations in canopy size soil characteristics leaf area index lai and fractional cover fc thus it is necessary to incorporate methodologies that can account for the effects of intraorchard spatial variability of the soil and tree vigor on kc and eta estimations in recent decades remote sensing based energy balance rseb techniques have become a valuable tool for evaluating the spatiotemporal variability of the surface energy balance seb components eta and kc for complex canopy structures such as orchards and vineyards cammalleri et al 2013 de la fuente sáiz et al 2017 he et al 2017 jin et al 2018 kustas et al 2019 pôças et al 2014 ramírez cuesta et al 2018 rseb models estimate eta values for each pixel of a satellite image as a residual component of the surface energy balance seb at the time of satellite overpass as follows 1 le i rn i g i h i where le i is the latent heat flux w m 2 rn i is the net radiation flux w m 2 g i is the soil heat flux w m 2 h i is the sensible heat flux w m 2 the subscript i indicates instantaneous values the mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution using internalized calibration metric model has been recommended as an rseb technique for evaluating the spatial variability of both eta and kc of orchards and has shown promising results de la fuente sáiz et al 2017 he et al 2017 jin et al 2018 pôças et al 2014 paço et al 2014 metric model is a one source energy balance model that utilizes internal self calibration inverse modeling at extreme conditions cimec to remove the effects of biases related to the atmospheric corrections of reflectance surface temperature and estimations of gi and hi allen et al 2007a and 2007b 2011 cimec calibrates hi via two extreme conditions e g hot pixels and cold pixels or anchor pixels allen et al 2011 reported that the primary limitation of the metric model is that quantification of lei depends on the accuracy of the pixel specific estimates for rni gi and hi metric employs a bulk function for hi that represents the sensible heat flux in the mixed equilibrium boundary layer above the zero plane displacement height the bulk presentation simulates a blended system for both canopy and soil and is appropriate for use with bulk surface temperatures such as those measured by landsat where the bulk temperatures represent a mixture of canopy and soil allen et al 2007a the metric model was initially developed with a focus on annual crops and thus might not apply as accurately to superintensive olive orchards with heterogeneous canopies in this regard several researchers have suggested that adjusting some intermediate parameters of the standard metric algorithm such as momentum roughness length zom lai and gi can reduce the uncertainty in lei and etai estimates for specific heterogeneous woody canopies such as those of orchards and vineyards carrasco benavides et al 2014 de la fuente sáiz et al 2017 jin et al 2018 pôças et al 2014 santos et al 2012 for a nonirrigated olive orchard santos et al 2012 reported that metric based etai estimates improved when the perrier roughness function perrier 1982 was used to compute zom in this case the root mean square error rmse was reduced from 1 12 to 0 25 mm d 1 for a commercial superintensive olive orchard pôças et al 2014 indicated that the metric model performance showed a quantitative improvement in eta estimates when three source conditions for surface temperature partitioning as well as zom computation with the perrier equation were applied for a drip irrigated apple orchard de la fuente sáiz et al 2017 reported that the metric model using orchard specific functions estimated hi and lei with errors of 5 and 16 respectively while use of the original functions estimated hi and lei with errors of 29 and 26 respectively finally for microirrigated pistachio orchards jin et al 2018 observed that a recalibrated metric model simulated eta with an mae of 1 1 mm d 1 and rmse of 1 4 mm d 1 when modified parameters for zom and rni were used the rseb model has been tested extensively with positive results for several fully covered crops vineyards and orchards however very few studies have evaluated the intraorchard spatial variability of seb components and water requirements of superintensive drip irrigated olive orchards these orchards have heterogeneous or complex canopies that significantly affect partitioning of rn i into le i g i and h i thus the objective of this study is to evaluate the capability of the metric model for mapping seb components eta and kc for a superintensive drip irrigated olive orchard under mediterranean climate conditions and to explore the usefulness of applying customized vegetation index based functions for zom lai and gi this application also provided an opportunity to explore the effects of any spatial heterogeneities in a modern superintensive olive orchard 2 material and methods 2 1 study field the study was conducted during two growing seasons e g 2011 2012 and 2012 2013 in

hectare er raki et al 2008 lópez olivari et al 2016 the average fc values ranged between 0 29 and 0 31 for the two growing seasons for the same olive orchard ortega farías et al 2016 reported that fc ranged between 0 25 and 0 28 for the 2013 14 season when using a helicopter based unmanned aerial vehicle uav equipped with a multispectral camera there was occasional sparse vegetation ground cover between olive rows during september and november that received rainwater only that ground cover was generally in a dry state with a very low eta fig 1b in addition the soil surface in the interrows was maintained without cover crops or weeds during december and february summer fig 1c 2 3 energy balance component measurements a tower was installed in an experimental plot 21 1 ha and was located within the olive orchard 1400 ha to measure micrometeorological variables and orchard energy balance components at 30 min intervals air temperatures ta and relative humidity rh were measured over the olive trees using a probe model hmp45c vaisala ma usa mounted 5 m above the ground surface fig 2a and wind speed u and wind direction w were monitored with a cup anemometer and wind vane model 03101 5

campbell scientific inc logan ut usa respectively these instruments were mounted over the center of the olive row fig 2a hi and lei were measured using an eddy covariance ec system oriented toward the predominant wind direction fig 1a air temperatures wind speeds and humidity fluctuations were measured at 10 hz using a three dimensional sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa and a fast response open path infrared gas analyzer li 7500 irga li cor inc lincoln ne usa the means standard deviations and covariances were calculated over 30 min periods sensors for the ec fluxes hi and lei were installed 5 5 m above the ground surface and over the center of the tree canopy using a 6 m high tower fig 2a the upwind fetch for the prevailing wind direction ranged between 200 and 250 m which provided sufficient fetch for the source areas footprint to be used for model validation fig 1a this footprint of the turbulent fluxes corresponds to the contributing surface patches to scalar flux measurements from the ec system and was calculated according to the model proposed by kljun et al 2015 www footprint kljun net in this case footprint analysis indicated that the source areas were similar for all clear satellite dates that were evaluated in this study fig 3 the footprint size did not significantly change over time and did not substantially affect the area sampled from landsat satellite images for model validation gi was estimated using eight flux plates placed in the interrow area positions 1 2 7 and 8 and below the tree canopy positions 3 4 5 and 6 fig 2b these plates of constant thermal conductivity hft3 campbell sci logan ut usa were placed at a 0 08 m depth two averaging thermocouple probes tcav campbell scientific inc logan ut usa for measuring soil temperatures tsoil were installed above each flux plate at depths of 0 02 and 0 06 m the thermocouple probe signals were recorded at 30 min intervals by an electronic datalogger cr3000 campbell scientific logan ut usa at each position gi was estimated using the following equations oliphant et al 2004 shao et al 2008 2 gi fp s 3 s ρ b c s θ g ρ w c w δ t soil δ t d where fp is the average

the subscript g indicates measurements conducted over a clipped grass reference surface 2 4 data quality control for model validation it is necessary to avoid systematic errors in ec measurements of turbulent fluxes twine et al 2000 indicated that a systematic error that underestimates the evapotranspiration component of a crop water budget by 25 is intolerable for producing valid flux measurements for this reason days presenting an energy balance closure ebc hi lei rni gi of 0 75 or 1 25 were excluded from this study to reduce the uncertainty associated with unidentified and substantial errors in lei measurements ortega farias et al 2010 riveros burgos et al 2019 2021 these errors can be related to persistent noisy behavior due to sensor problems flow distortion through the tower or past the sonic anemometer frank et al 2013 or adverse meteorological conditions for example rainy days twine et al 2000 also suggested that the bowen ratio the ratio of hi to lei is generally measured accurately by the ec system because the different causes of error likely affect measured values for hi and lei in similar proportions thus the hi and lei values from the ec system were recalculated using the bowen ratio approach to close the energy balance er raki et al 2008 martínez cob and faci 2010 riveros burgos et al 2019 twine et al 2000 these recalculations usually increased lei values 2 5 satellite images for the two growing seasons 19 landsat 7 etm satellite scenes path 233 row 85 were available from the usgs global visualization viewer glovis http glovis usgs gov nine satellite image dates were used in this research table 1 while 10 of these were discarded because six of the image dates presented cloud cover 30 and because four image dates had ebc 0 75 or 1 25 by default all landsat scenes acquired and used in this study included systematic radiometric and geometric corrections from the usgs eros data center that considered ground control points and a digital elevation model dem for topographic accuracy standard terrain correction level 1 t precision and terrain correction the energy balance components were calculated on a pixel by pixel basis and were averaged over 15 pixels from the flux tower into the main wind direction fig 1a this area was delimited by the flux footprint prediction ffp of the turbulent fluxes using the model proposed by kljun et al 2015 2 6 theory instantaneous etai and daily eta values for the actual evapotranspiration were calculated using the following equations 7 e ta i 3 600 le i λ ρ w 8 eta e t r f e tr 24 where etai and eta are in mm h 1 and mm day 1 respectively 3600 converts from seconds to hours λ is the latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 ρ w is the water density 1000 kg m 3 etrf is the reference evapotranspiration fraction at the time of satellite overpass and etr24 is the reference evapotranspiration at 24 h mm day 1 values for etrf are computed as 9 e t r f kc e ta i e tr h where etrf is the same as kc because it is assumed that etrf is equal to the mean hourly ratios of etai to etrh for the daytime period allen et al 2007b carrasco benavides et al 2012 colaizzi et al 2006 gowda et al 2008 tasumi et al 2005 trezza 2006 lei was calculated using eq 1 and a general description of the metric algorithms is provided by allen et al 2007a 2007b and 2012 rn i for each pixel is calculated as follows allen et al 2014 bastiaanssen et al 1998 10 rn i 1 α r s r l r l 1 ε 0 r l where α is the broadband surface albedo dimensionless rs is the incoming shortwave radiation w m 2 rl and rl are the incoming and outgoing longwave radiation w m 2 respectively and εo is the surface emissivity the broadband albedo is calculated by integrating the visible and near infrared nir bands of the surface reflectance by weighting coefficients tasumi et al 2008 instantaneous pixel by pixel hi values were obtained for each scene as follows 11 h i ρ air c p δ t s r ah where ρ air is the air density kg m 3 and cp is the specific heat capacity of air 1004 j kg 1 k 1 δts is the near surface bulk air temperature gradient δts ta z1 ta z2 above each pixel where ta z1 and ta z2 are near surface air temperatures k at heights z1 and z2 above the elevation of d zom respectively where d is the zero plane displacement height the values of z1 z2 d and zom are in meters rah is the aerodynamic resistance to heat transport s m 1 between z1 and z2 bastiaanssen et al 1998 and allen et al 2007a demonstrated that δts can be spatially approximated as a simple linear function 12 δ t s β 0 β 1 t s where β0 and β1 are empirical calibration coefficients that are determined for each satellite scene ts is expressed in k an iterative process based on the selection of several well known anchor pixels wet and dry determines the unknown values for β0 and β1 for each scene the conditions for determining anchor points are represented by agricultural fields having full and active transpiring vegetation that is close to the reference conditions cold pixel and having a surfaces with little or no vegetation cover hot pixel and with little or residual evaporation from soil kjaersgaard et al 2009 in this manner the seb of the cold pixels can be computed as follows 13 h cold r n cold g cold ϕ λ e tr h where hcold rncold and gcold represent the sensible heat net radiation and soil heat fluxes respectively for each cold pixel within the image at the time of satellite overpass w m 2 e tr h is the hourly reference evapotranspiration for a cool season clipped grass mm h 1 and ϕ is the ratio of alfalfa to grass reference evapotranspiration which ranges between 1 2 and 1 4 tasumi 2003 folhes et al 2009 hot pixels were calculated by eq 13 under the assumption that ϕ λ e tr h is near zero if there has been a long period without rain or irrigation otherwise an estimate of residual ϕ λ e tr h is made by some form of hourly or daily water balance for the upper soil profile allen et al 2007a after the β0 and β1 values from the anchor pixels are obtained they are used to estimate hi for each pixel by an iterative process that involves monin obukhov similarity theory allen et al 2007a kalma et al 2008 seguin et al 1994 the cimec based inverse calibration of the seb components via the sensible heat flux that is computed by specifying the evapotranspiration at the two anchor pixels removes systematic biases embedded in the estimations of rni gi and other intermediate components of the metric algorithm 2 7 specialized functions for lai zom and gi by necessity the metric model employs general functions for lai zom and gi that represent general agricultural crops that are usually annuals thus submodels for olive orchards were obtained from the literature and were incorporated into the original metric model to better simulate the lai zom and gi values for drip irrigated olive orchards in this case lai values were estimated according to santos et al 2012 14 lai ln 0 69 savi 0 59 0 91 where lai is the leaf area index modeled for a satellite scene at each pixel m2 m 2 savi is the soil adjusted vegetation index dimensionless the perrier function has been proposed to compute the zom values in sparse canopies such as olive orchards and is usually applied in metric for tree crops and vines allen et al 2014 in this study zom values were estimated via the following equation pôças et al 2014 santos et al 2012 15 z om 1 e α lai 2 e α lai 2 h where α is an empirical coefficient α 0 83 and h is the canopy height s h 3 2 m finally gi values w m 2 were estimated according to the following linear equation ortega farías et al 2016 16 g i 0 324 rn i 51 5 eq 16 was developed using a database that was compiled for an olive orchard during the 2009 10 and 2010 11 growing seasons and was designed for application to large numbers of orchards in which gi is not measured ortega farías et al 2016 indicated that eq 16 was able to predict gi with an error of 2 when using thermal and multispectral cameras placed on a helicopter based uav fuentes peñailillo et al 2018 also reported that eq 16 predicted gi with an error of 8 when satellite images from landsat 7 etm were used 2 8 image processing a matlab script was implemented to simulate seb components eta and kc using the metric algorithm for each pixel fig 4 after the satellite images were downloaded manually from the usgs using the glovis application the scripts produced a stacked layer of the blue green red near infrared nir shortwave infrared swir and thermal bands each image was then cropped over the regional area to select the cold and hot pixels and slc off gaps for landsat 7 were filled chen et al 2011 for each cropped image finally the script ran the original metric algorithm using the automated calibration methodology of allen et al 2013 until the hot and cold pixels were identified once the β0 and β1 values were obtained and δ t s was calculated eqs 14 15 and 16 were used to estimate the seb components kc and eta for the drip irrigated olive orchard the adjustment factor ϕ was assumed to be 1 2 for estimating maximum le during the establishment of hcold carrasco benavides et al 2012 2 9 statistical comparisons satellite based estimates for rni gi hi lei etai eta and kc were computed by averaging the values from 15 30 m x 30 m pixels to avoid contamination caused by pixels lying near or outside the experimental plot a perimeter of 30 m from the edge inward was excluded when calculating field scale average seb fluxes comparisons were performed by calculating the ratios b of estimated to observed values root mean square errors rmse mean absolute errors mae and index of agreement ia values mayer and butler 1993 student s t test was used to evaluate whether b was significantly different from unity at the 95 confidence level 3 results and discussions 3 1 climatic conditions and energy balance ratios generally atmospheric conditions over the drip irrigated olive orchard were hot and dry with etr24 values ranging between 4 7and 8 9 mm day 1 table 2 at satellite overpass times the tg vpd and ug values ranged between 15 7 and 23 10 c 0 79 1 85 kpa and 0 52 2 34 m s 1 respectively the predominant wind directions ranged from 140 to 235 which resulted in frequency distributions of 89 3 and 93 4 of the total observations for the first and second seasons respectively the ψx values ranged from 1 3 to 1 80 mpa which indicated that the olive trees were under mild to moderate water stress during the two seasons ahumada orellana et al 2017 2019 gómez del campo et al 2008 moriana et al 2007 this tree water status was associated with total irrigation applications of 1830 and 2014 m3 ha 1 for the first and second growing seasons respectively over 30 minute time intervals the relationship between turbulent fluxes h le and available energy rn g from the ec system had a coefficient of determination of 0 9 while ebc was equal to 0 85 which indicated that the orchard energy balance was systematically imbalanced by approximately 15 during the two study periods fig 5 at the time of satellite overpasses the ebc values ranged between 0 75 and 1 11 table 3 studies have shown that h le is commonly lower than rn g for olive orchards with ec imbalances from 5 to 26 er raki et al 2010 2008 ezzahar et al 2007 martínez cob and faci 2010 ortega farías and lópez olivari 2012 testi et al 2006 villalobos et al 2000 these imbalances may be associated with errors in measuring rn and g lee and black 1993 leuning et al 2012 wilson et al 2002 energy storage within the olive tree biomass williams et al 2004 low wind speeds testi et al 2004 airflow distortion within the sonic anemometer geometry frank et al 2013 and heterogeneity of seb in the region foken 2008 according to several researchers the ec imbalances detected in this study are considered reasonable and appropriate for providing accurate estimates of turbulent fluxes h le by following the bowen ratio adjustments of h and le for energy balance closure er raki et al 2008 martínez cob and faci 2010 twine et al 2000 table 3 indicates that the ratios of hi to rni remained within a relatively small interval of 0 50 0 61 while the ratios of lei to rni ranged between 0 14 and 0 25 during the two growing seasons the gi rni ratios were between 0 17 and 0 36 and the bowen ratios β fluctuated between 2 3 and 4 0 these results indicated that the primary component of rni partitioning was hi over the drip irrigated olive orchard which had fc 0 3 for a superintensive drip irrigated olive orchard with fc 0 3 lópez olivari et al 2016 indicated that the daily values of le h and g were between 28 and 47 34 68 and 2 6 of rn respectively while annual mean β varied between 1 22 and 1 64 for olive orchards with fc values ranging between 0 13 and 0 47 ramírez cuesta et al 2018 reported mean ratios of lei hi and gi to rni at the time of satellite overpass to be 0 51 0 33 and 0 16 respectively when using landsat satellite images 30 m x 30 m pixels these authors observed that β varied between 0 64 and 0 83 which indicated that the main component of rni partitioning was lei ortega farías et al 2016 found lei and hi to account for 15 21 and 54 60 of rni respectively at the time of a uav overpass near solar noon finally testi et al 2004 reported β values that depended on lai values and soil water contents as expected 3 2 model evaluation comparisons between the estimated and observed values for rsi rni hi gi and lei at the times of satellite overpass 11 28 11 30 h local time are shown in fig 6 and table 4 this figure shows that there was an equal distribution of points around the 1 1 line for rsi and rni with rmse and mae values ranging between 29 and 43 w m 2 for the olive orchard which was under irrigation conditions that were intended to produce some limited water stress the t test indicated that the b value was not significantly different from unity which suggested that the simulated and measured values of rsi and rni were similar at the 95 confidence level however the b value for gi was different from unity and both rmse and mae were less than 40 w m 2 table 4 for a drip irrigated olive orchard fc between 26 and 30 fuentes peñailillo et al 2018 observed that the rni and gi values were underestimated with errors of 4 and 8 respectively when using landsat satellite images 30 m x 30 m pixels in the same olive orchard ortega farías et al 2016 reported uav based estimations of rni and gi with errors that were less than 5 of the observed values comparisons between the estimated and measured values for hi and lei at the times of satellite overpass fig 6 show that the points fell close to the 1 1 line in this case the metric model with the customized submodels for lai zom and gi underestimated hi and lei with errors less than 5 table 4 the rmse and mae values for hi were 46 and 41 w m 2 respectively while those for lei were 45 and 32 w m 2 respectively the best consistency between measured and estimated hi values occurred on doy 30 2013 when the differences between estimated and observed values were less than 15 w m 2 the greatest inconsistency was observed on doy 78 2013 with a difference of 65 w m 2 which was primarily associated with the selection of hot and cold pixels the results from this study indicate that accurate estimation of lei mainly depends on accurate computation of hi which was the main component of rni partitioning both the study of carrasco benavides et al 2014 in a vineyard and fuentes peñailillo et al 2018 in an apple orchard reported that metric estimated instantaneous hi and lei values with errors ranging between 5 and 16 when calibrated functions of lai zom and gi were used the model simulated eta with rmse 0 42 mm day 1 and mae 0 31 mm day 1 table 5 the statistical analyses indicated that the b value was significantly different from unity which suggests that the metric model overestimated the 24 h eta with an error of 6 0 of the observed values fig 7 shows that most points were evenly distributed around the 1 1 line for the study period these results are consistent with those reported by santos et al 2012 and pôças et al 2014 who indicated that the metric model using the perrier roughness function estimated eta with an rmse of 0 25 mm day 1 for rainfed olive orchards and 0 61 mm day 1 for a commercial superintensive olive orchard respectively for several drip irrigated vineyards knipper et al 2020 reported that combining the disaggregated atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi disalexi surface energy balance model and spatial temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm estimated eta with rmse and mae values of 0 88 and 0 70 mm day 1 respectively model comparisons indicated that the kc values were simulated with an error of 4 of ec values and with rmse and mae values ranging between 0 05 and 0 09 table 5 for the superintensive drip irrigated olive orchard the kc values varied between 0 14 and 0 53 for the metric model and between 0 19 and 0 45 for the ec system additionally the eta values from the metric model and ec system ranged between 1 1 and 3 5 and 1 5 3 5 mm day 1 respectively finally the ia values for the eb components were between 0 4 and 0 93 while those for eta and kc ranged between 0 87 and 0 96 3 3 spatial variability of seb components eta and kc an advantage of remotely sensed eta is the ability to evaluate the spatial characteristics of water use and vegetation maps indicating both the spatial and temporal variability of ndvi seb components e g rni gi hi and lei and olive water requirements e g eta and kc are shown in figs 8 9 and 10 respectively for the 2012 2013 growing season fig 8 suggests that the ndvi and therefore the size and density of tree canopies were relatively uniform within the olive orchard with coefficients of variation cvs for ndvi ranging between 3 80 and 7 84 during december 2012 and march 2013 the intraorchard spatial variabilities of rni fig 9a gi fig 9b hi fig 9c and lei fig 9d were also quite homogeneous with cvs less than 15 table 6 the temporal variabilities for rni gi hi and lei were significant as expected with values ranging between 452 and 642 79 134 205 368 and 122 167 w m 2 respectively within the orchard among the image dates evaluated table 6 shows that the intraorchard spatial variability of eta and kc was not significant with cvs ranging between 8 54 and 13 36 the temporal variability in these parameters was significant with daily mean values of eta and kc ranging between 2 09 and 2 89 mm day 1 and 0 31 0 48 respectively fig 10 the cv values for kc and eta were similar to those for lei because the etr24 and etrh values that were used to estimate 24 h values were assumed to be uniform over the drip irrigated orchard 4 final remarks the results from this study indicate that the metric model which used olive specific functions for lai zom and gi was useful for simulating seb components and water requirements on a pixel by pixel basis for a superintensive drip irrigated olive orchard in this case the rmse and mae values for the seb components were less than 46 w m 2 while those for the eta were less than 0 42 mm day 1 these results are within the range indicated in the literature for rseb models used for estimating seb components and water use for orchards and vineyards cammalleri et al 2013 de la fuente sáiz et al 2017 he et al 2017 jin et al 2018 knipper et al 2020 kustas et al 2019 pôças et al 2014 ramírez cuesta et al 2018 in this study the main disagreements between the eta values computed by the metric model and those measured by the ec system were associated with biases in the estimation of hi in this case the maximum absolute differences between the observed and estimated values of eta and kc were 0 9 mm day 1 and 0 21 respectively carrasco benavides 2014 indicated that the performance of metric when estimating lei strongly depends on anchor pixel selection which determines the self calibration of hi this selection requires the knowledge and skill of the operator for searching and isolating the most appropriate hot and cold pixels allen et al 2014 cuenca et al 2013 long and singh 2012 in addition selection of the appropriate cold pixel was critical in this study because non water stressed crops were difficult to find during the summer period in this period from december to february atmospheric conditions were dry and hot with a high vapor pressure deficit that was associated with moderate to severe water scarcity in the study area pencahue valley for this study the canopy size was maintained a nearly constant with fc and ndvi values ranging between 0 2 and 0 25 and 0 3 0 5 respectively during the 2011 12 and 2012 13 growing seasons in these two seasons the drip olive trees were maintained under null to moderate water stress and the soil surface between rows was maintained without cover crops or weeds however commercial olive orchards have different training systems canopy structures and water stress levels which cause the energy exchange processes over orchards to be more complicated jin et al 2018 kustas et al 2018 reported that canopy characteristics could significantly affect heat and water vapor exchange from the soil surface between rows and vine canopies in this regard pôças et al 2014 suggested that one source energy balance oseb models such as metric may not be appropriate for estimating eta for strongly clumped canopies such as those in orchards and vineyards timmermans et al 2007 suggested that two source energy balance tseb models performed better in sparse canopies than the oseb model because tseb models estimate energy balance components from the canopy and soil surface separately additionally these authors reported that errors in surface air temperature differences had the most significant impact on estimations of hi for both the oseb and tseb models this issue is critical in drip irrigated orchards and vineyards with low fc and without cover crops in interrows in this study hi generated above the soil surface between rows was generally the major contributor to the energy balance which played a crucial role in computing lei and eta when the metric model was applied in the superintensive drip irrigated orchard in this orchard hi was between 50 and 61 of rni during the study period recent studies have suggested that adjustment of the functions for zom lai and gi in the original metric algorithm can reduce uncertainty in the lei and etai estimates for heterogeneous woody canopies such as those of orchards and vineyards carrasco benavides et al 2014 de la fuente sáiz et al 2017 jin et al 2018 pôças et al 2014 santos et al 2012 in this study the performance of the metric model when using specific functions e g zom lai and gi was adequate for estimating orchard water requirements with errors less than 10 of ec values however the effects of training systems and cover crops between rows on aerodynamic properties and energy exchange need to be addressed when rseb algorithms such as metric are applied to calculate eta and kc training systems and pruning have significant effects on canopy geometries e g lai and fc which play an essential role in partitioning rni into lei hi and gi lópez olivarí et al 2016 this partitioning is also significantly affected by the percentage of wetted area aw of the soil surface which depends on the drip irrigation design further research is needed to evaluate the performance of metric and other models for drip irrigated orchards with different canopy structures irrigation management and climate conditions finally for orchards with cover crops in the interrows a two source energy balance approach may be beneficial to separate the fluxes from the canopy and interrows 5 conclusions the results of this study suggest that the metric model can be used to accurately compute the magnitudes and spatial variabilities of seb components eta and kc for a superintensive drip irrigated olive orchard under mild to moderate water stress ψx ranged between 1 3 and 1 80 mpa the estimated values for lei rni and gi at the times of satellite overpass were generally in good agreement with ground based measurements within the olive orchard for the seb components the relative error and rmse ranged between 2 and 5 of the observed values and 29 46 w m 2 respectively for daily water use the results indicate that the metric model estimated eta with an average error of 6 and rmse 0 42 mm day 1 these results are consistent with those reported in the literature and are within the acceptable range for applications of remote sensing models in heterogeneous canopies i e

components net radiation rni soil heat flux gi sensible heat flux hi and latent heat flux lei at times of landsat satellite overpasses in conjunction with the actual evapotranspiration eta and crop coefficient kc for a superintensive drip irrigated olive olea europeae l cv arbequina orchard the orchard is located in the pencahue valley maule region chile 35 23 ls 71 44 lw 96 m above sea level and the study was conducted on an experimental plot of 21 1 ha during the 2011 2012 and 2012 2013 growing seasons model performance was evaluated using measurements of lei eta and kc that were obtained from an eddy covariance ec system olive specific functions for estimating aerodynamic roughness zom leaf area index lai and gi were employed in the metric algorithm in addition submodels of rni and gi were evaluated via ground truth measurements from a fritchen type net radiometer and soil flux plates respectively the results indicated that the errors within the metric model for the seb components were between 2 and 5 of the observed values while those for eta and kc were between 4 and 6 of the ec values in addition both the root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae for the seb components were less than 46 w m 2 at the times of satellite overpass the rmse and mae values for the 24 h eta were 0 42 and 0 31 mm day 1 respectively while the corresponding values for kc were 0 09 and 0 02 respectively the coefficients of variation cvs for the seb components eta and kc were less than 15 and the largest intraorchard spatial variability occurred for lei and thus eta the errors and uncertainties in the seb and eta estimates were small enough to warrant application of the metric model with olive specific functions for zom lai and gi to superintensive drip irrigated olive orchards keywords water requirements irrigation management remote sensing olive oil spatial variability 1 introduction the olive oil industry in chile has grown significantly during the last decade especially in semiarid mediterranean regions with hot and dry summer climates that are associated with very low precipitation 50 mm during the growing season in these regions new plantations have included drip irrigation and superintensive training systems together with high plant densities 1000 trees ha 1 lópez olivari et al 2016 moreover the stability and growth of the olive oil industry will be substantially affected by future water scarcity scenarios under these conditions proper orchard irrigation management will be key to maintaining yield and quality olive oil production while limiting water consumption ahumada orellana et al 2018 2017 to achieve optimum irrigation management it is crucial to estimate orchard water requirements or the actual evapotranspiration eta according to the spatial variability of the soil cultivar and climate as well as the allowable amounts of water stress to trees lópez olivari et al 2016 ortega farias et al 2009 eta is traditionally quantified using the grass or alfalfa reference evapotranspiration etr24 multiplied by a single crop coefficient kc allen et al 1998 er raki et al 2010 and allen et al 1998 suggested using the dual crop coefficient approach to describe the ratio of eta more accurately to etr24 by separating kc into the basal crop coefficient kcb and soil evaporation coefficient ke for heteronomous canopies such as those of olive orchards the kc and kcb values require local adjustments because they vary with canopy architecture and nonlinear interactions between soils cultivars and climate cammalleri et al 2013 ortega farias et al 2009 paço et al 2014 in addition lópez olivari et al 2016 indicated that water consumption in superintensive olive orchards is dominated by the canopy which is generally nonuniform as a result of the tree geometry caused by training systems in this case energy absorbed by vegetation and by the soil surface depends on spatial variations in canopy size soil characteristics leaf area index lai and fractional cover fc thus it is necessary to incorporate methodologies that can account for the effects of intraorchard spatial variability of the soil and tree vigor on kc and eta estimations in recent decades remote sensing based energy balance rseb techniques have become a valuable tool for evaluating the spatiotemporal variability of the surface energy balance seb components eta and kc for complex canopy structures such as orchards and vineyards cammalleri et al 2013 de la fuente sáiz et al 2017 he et al 2017 jin et al 2018 kustas et al 2019 pôças et al 2014 ramírez cuesta et al 2018 rseb models estimate eta values for each pixel of a satellite image as a residual component of the surface energy balance seb at the time of satellite overpass as follows 1 le i rn i g i h i where le i is the latent heat flux w m 2 rn i is the net radiation flux w m 2 g i is the soil heat flux w m 2 h i is the sensible heat flux w m 2 the subscript i indicates instantaneous values the mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution using internalized calibration metric model has been recommended as an rseb technique for evaluating the spatial variability of both eta and kc of orchards and has shown promising results de la fuente sáiz et al 2017 he et al 2017 jin et al 2018 pôças et al 2014 paço et al 2014 metric model is a one source energy balance model that utilizes internal self calibration inverse modeling at extreme conditions cimec to remove the effects of biases related to the atmospheric corrections of reflectance surface temperature and estimations of gi and hi allen et al 2007a and 2007b 2011 cimec calibrates hi via two extreme conditions e g hot pixels and cold pixels or anchor pixels allen et al 2011 reported that the primary limitation of the metric model is that quantification of lei depends on the accuracy of the pixel specific estimates for rni gi and hi metric employs a bulk function for hi that represents the sensible heat flux in the mixed equilibrium boundary layer above the zero plane displacement height the bulk presentation simulates a blended system for both canopy and soil and is appropriate for use with bulk surface temperatures such as those measured by landsat where the bulk temperatures represent a mixture of canopy and soil allen et al 2007a the metric model was initially developed with a focus on annual crops and thus might not apply as accurately to superintensive olive orchards with heterogeneous canopies in this regard several researchers have suggested that adjusting some intermediate parameters of the standard metric algorithm such as momentum roughness length zom lai and gi can reduce the uncertainty in lei and etai estimates for specific heterogeneous woody canopies such as those of orchards and vineyards carrasco benavides et al 2014 de la fuente sáiz et al 2017 jin et al 2018 pôças et al 2014 santos et al 2012 for a nonirrigated olive orchard santos et al 2012 reported that metric based etai estimates improved when the perrier roughness function perrier 1982 was used to compute zom in this case the root mean square error rmse was reduced from 1 12 to 0 25 mm d 1 for a commercial superintensive olive orchard pôças et al 2014 indicated that the metric model performance showed a quantitative improvement in eta estimates when three source conditions for surface temperature partitioning as well as zom computation with the perrier equation were applied for a drip irrigated apple orchard de la fuente sáiz et al 2017 reported that the metric model using orchard specific functions estimated hi and lei with errors of 5 and 16 respectively while use of the original functions estimated hi and lei with errors of 29 and 26 respectively finally for microirrigated pistachio orchards jin et al 2018 observed that a recalibrated metric model simulated eta with an mae of 1 1 mm d 1 and rmse of 1 4 mm d 1 when modified parameters for zom and rni were used the rseb model has been tested extensively with positive results for several fully covered crops vineyards and orchards however very few studies have evaluated the intraorchard spatial variability of seb components and water requirements of superintensive drip irrigated olive orchards these orchards have heterogeneous or complex canopies that significantly affect partitioning of rn i into le i g i and h i thus the objective of this study is to evaluate the capability of the metric model for mapping seb components eta and kc for a superintensive drip irrigated olive orchard under mediterranean climate conditions and to explore the usefulness of applying customized vegetation index based functions for zom lai and gi this application also provided an opportunity to explore the effects of any spatial heterogeneities in a modern superintensive olive orchard 2 material and methods 2 1 study field the study was conducted during two growing seasons e g 2011 2012 and 2012 2013 in a superintensive drip irrigated olive olea europaea l cv arbequina orchard that was established in 2005 and is located in pencahue valley maule region chile 35 23 ls 71 44 lw 96 m above sea level fig 1 the climate is mediterranean with annual rainfall of 620 mm that is concentrated during the winter period ahumada orellana et al 2017 the cumulative etr24 cool season grass reference and average daily temperature are 1160 mm and 14 8 c respectively during the growing season from september to april the soil texture is a clay loam 31 clay 29 sand and 40 silt with a bulk soil density of 1 34 g cm 3 field capacity of 0 31 cm3 cm 3 and wilting point of 0 16 cm3 cm 3 within the effective rooting depth 0 60 cm olive trees for oil production were trained under a hedgerow system with a planting density of 1333 trees ha 1 1 5 5 0 m and irrigated by two drippers 2 0 l h 1 per tree fig 1a and b the wetted area of the drip irrigated orchard was only approximately 4 5 of the total area and was located beneath the canopy for the two growing seasons the tree trunk diameters ranged between 61 and 73 mm while the tree heights h and canopy widths were 3 2 and 1 55 m respectively 2 2 irrigation

instruments model 600 albany or usa measurements were collected from two shoots per tree each having five or six pairs of leaves each shoot was enclosed in a plastic bag and was wrapped in aluminum foil for at least 2 h before being cut and removed ahumada orellana et al 2019 for this study fractional cover fc at solar noon was estimated using the average canopy width and number of trees per hectare er raki et al 2008 lópez olivari et al 2016 the average fc values ranged between 0 29 and 0 31 for the two growing seasons for the same olive orchard ortega farías et al 2016 reported that fc ranged between 0 25 and 0 28 for the 2013 14 season when using a helicopter based unmanned aerial vehicle uav equipped with a multispectral camera there was occasional sparse vegetation ground cover between olive rows during september and november that received rainwater only that ground cover was generally in a dry state with a very low eta fig 1b in addition the soil surface in the interrows was maintained without cover crops or weeds during december and february summer fig 1c 2 3 energy balance component measurements a tower was installed in an experimental plot 21 1 ha and was located within the olive orchard 1400 ha to measure micrometeorological variables and orchard energy balance components at 30 min intervals air temperatures ta and relative humidity rh were measured over the olive trees using a probe model hmp45c vaisala ma usa mounted 5 m above the ground surface fig 2a and wind speed u and wind direction w were monitored with a cup anemometer and wind vane model 03101 5 young mi usa respectively at the same height net radiation rni and solar radiation rsi were measured with a fritchen type net radiometer q7 1 rebs inc bellevue wa usa and a silicon pyranometer li200x campbell scientific inc logan ut usa respectively these instruments were mounted over the center of the olive row fig 2a hi and lei were measured using an eddy covariance ec system oriented toward the predominant wind direction fig 1a air temperatures wind speeds and humidity fluctuations were measured at 10 hz using a three dimensional sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa and a fast response open path infrared gas analyzer li 7500 irga li cor inc lincoln ne usa the means standard deviations and covariances were calculated over 30 min periods sensors for the ec fluxes hi and lei were installed 5 5 m above the ground surface and over the center of the tree canopy using a 6 m high tower fig 2a the upwind fetch for the prevailing wind direction ranged between 200 and 250 m which provided sufficient fetch for the source areas footprint to be used for model validation fig 1a this footprint of the turbulent fluxes corresponds to the contributing surface patches to scalar flux measurements from the ec system and was calculated according to the model proposed by kljun et al 2015 www footprint kljun net in this case footprint analysis indicated that the source areas were similar for all clear satellite dates that were evaluated in this study fig 3 the footprint size did not significantly change over time and did not substantially affect the area sampled from landsat satellite images for model validation gi was estimated using eight flux plates placed in the interrow area positions 1 2 7 and 8 and below the tree canopy positions 3 4 5 and 6 fig 2b these plates of constant thermal conductivity hft3 campbell sci logan ut usa were placed at a 0 08 m depth two averaging thermocouple probes tcav campbell scientific inc logan ut usa for measuring soil temperatures tsoil were installed above each flux plate at depths of 0 02 and 0 06 m the thermocouple probe signals were recorded at 30 min intervals by an electronic datalogger cr3000 campbell scientific logan ut usa at each position gi was estimated using the following equations oliphant et al 2004 shao et al 2008 2 gi fp s 3 s ρ b c s θ g ρ w c w δ t soil δ t d where fp is the average

canopy areas of the orchard were weighted by the fc value measured at solar noon as follows lópez olivari et al 2016 4 g i g bc f c 1 f c g br where gbc and gbr are the average gi values w m 2 below the canopy and between rows respectively fig 2b an automatic weather station was installed 2 km from the experimental plot above a clipped reference grass area to measure meteorological variables for calculating etr24 and etrh using the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 2005 1998 5 etr h 0 408 rn g g g γ 37 u g vpd t g 273 16 γ 1 c d u g 6 etr 24 i 1 24 etr h where rng gg tg ug and vpd

the subscript g indicates measurements conducted over a clipped grass reference surface 2 4 data quality control for model validation it is necessary to avoid systematic errors in ec measurements of turbulent fluxes twine et al 2000 indicated that a systematic error that underestimates the evapotranspiration component of a crop water budget by 25 is intolerable for producing valid flux measurements for this reason days presenting an energy balance closure ebc hi lei rni gi of 0 75 or 1 25 were excluded from this study to reduce the uncertainty associated with unidentified and substantial errors in lei measurements ortega farias et al 2010 riveros burgos et al 2019 2021 these errors can be related to persistent noisy behavior due to sensor problems flow distortion through the tower or past the sonic anemometer frank et al 2013 or adverse meteorological conditions for example rainy days twine et al 2000 also suggested that the bowen ratio the ratio of hi to lei is generally measured accurately by the ec system because the different causes of error likely affect measured values for hi and lei in similar proportions thus the hi and lei values from the ec system were recalculated using the bowen ratio approach to close the energy balance er raki et al 2008 martínez cob and faci 2010 riveros burgos et al 2019 twine et al 2000 these recalculations usually increased lei values 2 5 satellite images for the two growing seasons 19 landsat 7 etm satellite scenes path 233 row 85 were available from the usgs global visualization viewer glovis http glovis usgs gov nine satellite image dates were used in this research table 1 while 10 of these were discarded because six of the image dates presented cloud cover 30 and because four image dates had ebc 0 75 or 1 25 by default all landsat scenes acquired and used in this study included systematic radiometric and geometric corrections from the usgs eros data center that considered ground control points and a digital elevation model dem for topographic accuracy standard terrain correction level 1 t precision and terrain correction the energy balance components were calculated on a pixel by pixel basis and were averaged over 15 pixels from the flux tower into the main wind direction fig 1a this area was delimited by the flux footprint prediction ffp of the turbulent fluxes using the model proposed by kljun et al 2015 2 6 theory instantaneous etai and daily eta values for the actual evapotranspiration were calculated using the following equations 7 e ta i 3 600 le i λ ρ w 8 eta e t r f e tr 24 where etai and eta are in mm h 1 and mm day 1 respectively 3600 converts from seconds to hours λ is the latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 ρ w is the water density 1000 kg m 3 etrf is the reference evapotranspiration fraction at the time of satellite overpass and etr24 is the reference evapotranspiration at 24 h mm day 1 values for etrf are computed as 9 e t r f kc e ta i e tr h where etrf is the same as kc because it is assumed that etrf is equal to the mean hourly ratios of etai to etrh for the daytime period allen et al 2007b carrasco benavides et al 2012 colaizzi et al 2006 gowda et al 2008 tasumi et al 2005 trezza 2006 lei was calculated using eq 1 and a general description of the metric algorithms is provided by allen et al 2007a 2007b and 2012 rn i for each pixel is calculated as follows allen et al 2014 bastiaanssen et al 1998 10 rn i 1 α r s r l r l 1 ε 0 r l where α is the broadband surface albedo dimensionless rs is the incoming shortwave radiation w m 2 rl and rl are the incoming and outgoing longwave radiation w m 2 respectively and εo is the surface emissivity the broadband albedo is calculated by integrating the visible and near infrared nir bands of the surface reflectance by weighting coefficients tasumi et al 2008 instantaneous pixel by pixel hi values were obtained for each scene as follows 11 h i ρ air c p δ t s r ah where ρ air is the air density kg m 3 and cp is the specific heat capacity of air 1004 j kg 1 k 1 δts is the near surface bulk air temperature gradient δts ta z1 ta z2 above each pixel where ta z1 and ta z2 are near surface air temperatures k at heights z1 and z2 above the elevation of d zom respectively where d is the zero plane displacement height the values of z1 z2 d and zom are in meters rah is the aerodynamic resistance to heat transport s m 1 between z1 and z2 bastiaanssen et al 1998 and allen et al 2007a demonstrated that δts can be spatially approximated as a simple linear function 12 δ t s β 0 β 1 t s where β0 and β1 are empirical calibration coefficients that are determined for each satellite scene ts is expressed in k an iterative process based on the selection of several well known anchor pixels wet and dry determines the unknown values for β0 and β1 for each scene the conditions for determining anchor points are represented by agricultural fields having full and active transpiring vegetation that is close to the reference conditions cold pixel and having a surfaces with little or no vegetation cover hot pixel and with little or residual evaporation from soil kjaersgaard et al 2009 in this manner the seb of the cold pixels can be computed as follows 13 h cold r n cold g cold ϕ λ e tr h where hcold rncold and gcold represent the sensible heat net radiation and soil heat fluxes respectively for each cold pixel within the image at the time of satellite overpass w m 2 e tr h is the hourly reference evapotranspiration for a cool season clipped grass mm h 1 and ϕ is the ratio of alfalfa to grass reference evapotranspiration which ranges between 1 2 and 1 4 tasumi 2003 folhes et al 2009 hot pixels were calculated by eq 13 under the assumption that ϕ λ e tr h is near zero if there has been a long period without rain or irrigation otherwise an estimate of residual ϕ λ e tr h is made by some form of hourly or daily water balance for the upper soil profile allen et al 2007a after the β0 and β1 values from the anchor pixels are obtained they are used to estimate hi for each pixel by an iterative process that involves monin obukhov similarity theory allen et al 2007a kalma et al 2008 seguin et al 1994 the cimec based inverse calibration of the seb components via the sensible heat flux that is computed by specifying the evapotranspiration at the two anchor pixels removes systematic biases embedded in the estimations of rni gi and other intermediate components of the metric algorithm 2 7 specialized functions for lai zom and gi by necessity the metric model employs general functions for lai zom and gi that represent general agricultural crops that are usually annuals thus submodels for olive orchards were obtained from the literature and were incorporated into the original metric model to better simulate the lai zom and gi values for drip irrigated olive orchards in this case lai values were estimated according to santos et al 2012 14 lai ln 0 69 savi 0 59 0 91 where lai is the leaf area index modeled for a satellite scene at each pixel m2 m 2 savi is the soil adjusted vegetation index dimensionless the perrier function has been proposed to compute the zom values in sparse canopies such as olive orchards and is usually applied in metric for tree crops and vines allen et al 2014 in this study zom values were estimated via the following equation pôças et al 2014 santos et al 2012 15 z om 1 e α lai 2 e α lai 2 h where α is an empirical coefficient α 0 83 and h is the canopy height s h 3 2 m finally gi values w m 2 were estimated according to the following linear equation ortega farías et al 2016 16 g i 0 324 rn i 51 5 eq 16 was developed using a database that was compiled for an olive orchard during the 2009 10 and 2010 11 growing seasons and was designed for application to large numbers of orchards in which gi is not measured ortega farías et al 2016 indicated that eq 16 was able to predict gi with an error of 2 when using thermal and multispectral cameras placed on a helicopter based uav fuentes peñailillo et al 2018 also reported that eq 16 predicted gi with an error of 8 when satellite images from landsat 7 etm were used 2 8 image processing a matlab script was implemented to simulate seb components eta and kc using the metric algorithm for each pixel fig 4 after the satellite images were downloaded manually from the usgs using the glovis application the scripts produced a stacked layer of the blue green red near infrared nir shortwave infrared swir and thermal bands each image was then cropped over the regional area to select the cold and hot pixels and slc off gaps for landsat 7 were filled chen et al 2011 for each cropped image finally the script ran the original metric algorithm using the automated calibration methodology of allen et al 2013 until the hot and cold pixels were identified once the β0 and β1 values were obtained and δ t s was calculated eqs 14 15 and 16 were used to estimate the seb components kc and eta for the drip irrigated olive orchard the adjustment factor ϕ was assumed to be 1 2 for estimating maximum le during the establishment of hcold carrasco benavides et al 2012 2 9 statistical comparisons satellite based estimates for rni gi hi lei etai eta and kc were computed by averaging the values from 15 30 m x 30 m pixels to avoid contamination caused by pixels lying near or outside the experimental plot a perimeter of 30 m from the edge inward was excluded when calculating field scale average seb fluxes comparisons were performed by calculating the ratios b of estimated to observed values root mean square errors rmse mean absolute errors mae and index of agreement ia values mayer and butler 1993 student s t test was used to evaluate whether b was significantly different from unity at the 95 confidence level 3 results and discussions 3 1 climatic conditions and energy balance ratios generally atmospheric conditions over the drip irrigated olive orchard were hot and dry with etr24 values ranging between 4 7and 8 9 mm day 1 table 2 at satellite overpass times the tg vpd and ug values ranged between 15 7 and 23 10 c 0 79 1 85 kpa and 0 52 2 34 m s 1 respectively the predominant wind directions ranged from 140 to 235 which resulted in frequency distributions of 89 3 and 93 4 of the total observations for the first and second seasons respectively the ψx values ranged from 1 3 to 1 80 mpa which indicated that the olive trees were under mild to moderate water stress during the two seasons ahumada orellana et al 2017 2019 gómez del campo et al 2008 moriana et al 2007 this tree water status was associated with total irrigation applications of 1830 and 2014 m3 ha 1 for the first and second growing seasons respectively over 30 minute time intervals the relationship between turbulent fluxes h le and available energy rn g from the ec system had a coefficient of determination of 0 9 while ebc was equal to 0 85 which indicated that the orchard energy balance was systematically imbalanced by approximately 15 during the two study periods fig 5 at the time of satellite overpasses the ebc values ranged between 0 75 and 1 11 table 3 studies have shown that h le is commonly lower than rn g for olive orchards with ec imbalances from 5 to 26 er raki et al 2010 2008 ezzahar et al 2007 martínez cob and faci 2010 ortega farías and lópez olivari 2012 testi et al 2006 villalobos et al 2000 these imbalances may be associated with errors in measuring rn and g lee and black 1993 leuning et al 2012 wilson et al 2002 energy storage within the olive tree biomass williams et al 2004 low wind speeds testi et al 2004 airflow distortion within the sonic anemometer geometry frank et al 2013 and heterogeneity of seb in the region foken 2008 according to several researchers the ec imbalances detected in this study are considered reasonable and appropriate for providing accurate estimates of turbulent fluxes h le by following the bowen ratio adjustments of h and le for energy balance closure er raki et al 2008 martínez cob and faci 2010 twine et al 2000 table 3 indicates that the ratios of hi to rni remained within a relatively small interval of 0 50 0 61 while the ratios of lei to rni ranged between 0 14 and 0 25 during the two growing seasons the gi rni ratios were between 0 17 and 0 36 and the bowen ratios β fluctuated between 2 3 and 4 0 these results indicated that the primary component of rni partitioning was hi over the drip irrigated olive orchard which had fc 0 3 for a superintensive drip irrigated olive orchard with fc 0 3 lópez olivari et al 2016 indicated that the daily values of le h and g were between 28 and 47 34 68 and 2 6 of rn respectively while annual mean β varied between 1 22 and 1 64 for olive orchards with fc values ranging between 0 13 and 0 47 ramírez cuesta et al 2018 reported mean ratios of lei hi and gi to rni at the time of satellite overpass to be 0 51 0 33 and 0 16 respectively when using landsat satellite images 30 m x 30 m pixels these authors observed that β varied between 0 64 and 0 83 which indicated that the main component of rni partitioning was lei ortega farías et al 2016 found lei and hi to account for 15 21 and 54 60 of rni respectively at the time of a uav overpass near solar noon finally testi et al 2004 reported β values that depended on lai values and soil water contents as expected 3 2 model evaluation comparisons between the estimated and observed values for rsi rni hi gi and lei at the times of satellite overpass 11 28 11 30 h local time are shown in fig 6 and table 4 this figure shows that there was an equal distribution of points around the 1 1 line for rsi and rni with rmse and mae values ranging between 29 and 43 w m 2 for the olive orchard which was under irrigation conditions that were intended to produce some limited water stress the t test indicated that the b value was not significantly different from unity which suggested that the simulated and measured values of rsi and rni were similar at the 95 confidence level however the b value for gi was different from unity and both rmse and mae were less than 40 w m 2 table 4 for a drip irrigated olive orchard fc between 26 and 30 fuentes peñailillo et al 2018 observed that the rni and gi values were underestimated with errors of 4 and 8 respectively when using landsat satellite images 30 m x 30 m pixels in the same olive orchard ortega farías et al 2016 reported uav based estimations of rni and gi with errors that were less than 5 of the observed values comparisons between the estimated and measured values for hi and lei at the times of satellite overpass fig 6 show that the points fell close to the 1 1 line in this case the metric model with the customized submodels for lai zom and gi underestimated hi and lei with errors less than 5 table 4 the rmse and mae values for hi were 46 and 41 w m 2 respectively while those for lei were 45 and 32 w m 2 respectively the best consistency between measured and estimated hi values occurred on doy 30 2013 when the differences between estimated and observed values were less than 15 w m 2 the greatest inconsistency was observed on doy 78 2013 with a difference of 65 w m 2 which was primarily associated with the selection of hot and cold pixels the results from this study indicate that accurate estimation of lei mainly depends on accurate computation of hi which was the main component of rni partitioning both the study of carrasco benavides et al 2014 in a vineyard and fuentes peñailillo et al 2018 in an apple orchard reported that metric estimated instantaneous hi and lei values with errors ranging between 5 and 16 when calibrated functions of lai zom and gi were used the model simulated eta with rmse 0 42 mm day 1 and mae 0 31 mm day 1 table 5 the statistical analyses indicated that the b value was significantly different from unity which suggests that the metric model overestimated the 24 h eta with an error of 6 0 of the observed values fig 7 shows that most points were evenly distributed around the 1 1 line for the study period these results are consistent with those reported by santos et al 2012 and pôças et al 2014 who indicated that the metric model using the perrier roughness function estimated eta with an rmse of 0 25 mm day 1 for rainfed olive orchards and 0 61 mm day 1 for a commercial superintensive olive orchard respectively for several drip irrigated vineyards knipper et al 2020 reported that combining the disaggregated atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi disalexi surface energy balance model and spatial temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm estimated eta with rmse and mae values of 0 88 and 0 70 mm day 1 respectively model comparisons indicated that the kc values were simulated with an error of 4 of ec values and with rmse and mae values ranging between 0 05 and 0 09 table 5 for the superintensive drip irrigated olive orchard the kc values varied between 0 14 and 0 53 for the metric model and between 0 19 and 0 45 for the ec system additionally the eta values from the metric model and ec system ranged between 1 1 and 3 5 and 1 5 3 5 mm day 1 respectively finally the ia values for the eb components were between 0 4 and 0 93 while those for eta and kc ranged between 0 87 and 0 96 3 3 spatial variability of seb components eta and kc an advantage of remotely sensed eta is the ability to evaluate the spatial characteristics of water use and vegetation maps indicating both the spatial and temporal variability of ndvi seb components e g rni gi hi and lei and olive water requirements e g eta and kc are shown in figs 8 9 and 10 respectively for the 2012 2013 growing season fig 8 suggests that the ndvi and therefore the size and density of tree canopies were relatively uniform within the olive orchard with coefficients of variation cvs for ndvi ranging between 3 80 and 7 84 during december 2012 and march 2013 the intraorchard spatial variabilities of rni fig 9a gi fig 9b hi fig 9c and lei fig 9d were also quite homogeneous with cvs less than 15 table 6 the temporal variabilities for rni gi hi and lei were significant as expected with values ranging between 452 and 642 79 134 205 368 and 122 167 w m 2 respectively within the orchard among the image dates evaluated table 6 shows that the intraorchard spatial variability of eta and kc was not significant with cvs ranging between 8 54 and 13 36 the temporal variability in these parameters was significant with daily mean values of eta and kc ranging between 2 09 and 2 89 mm day 1 and 0 31 0 48 respectively fig 10 the cv values for kc and eta were similar to those for lei because the etr24 and etrh values that were used to estimate 24 h values were assumed to be uniform over the drip irrigated orchard 4 final remarks the results from this study indicate that the metric model which used olive specific functions for lai zom and gi was useful for simulating seb components and water requirements on a pixel by pixel basis for a superintensive drip irrigated olive orchard in this case the rmse and mae values for the seb components were less than 46 w m 2 while those for the eta were less than 0 42 mm day 1 these results are within the range indicated in the literature for rseb models used for estimating seb components and water use for orchards and vineyards cammalleri et al 2013 de la fuente sáiz et al 2017 he et al 2017 jin et al 2018 knipper et al 2020 kustas et al 2019 pôças et al 2014 ramírez cuesta et al 2018 in this study the main disagreements between the eta values computed by the metric model and those measured by the ec system were associated with biases in the estimation of hi in this case the maximum absolute differences between the observed and estimated values of eta and kc were 0 9 mm day 1 and 0 21 respectively carrasco benavides 2014 indicated that the performance of metric when estimating lei strongly depends on anchor pixel selection which determines the self calibration of hi this selection requires the knowledge and skill of the operator for searching and isolating the most appropriate hot and cold pixels allen et al 2014 cuenca et al 2013 long and singh 2012 in addition selection of the appropriate cold pixel was critical in this study because non water stressed crops were difficult to find during the summer period in this period from december to february atmospheric conditions were dry and hot with a high vapor pressure deficit that was associated with moderate to severe water scarcity in the study area pencahue valley for this study the canopy size was maintained a nearly constant with fc and ndvi values ranging between 0 2 and 0 25 and 0 3 0 5 respectively during the 2011 12 and 2012 13 growing seasons in these two seasons the drip olive trees were maintained under null to moderate water stress and the soil surface between rows was maintained without cover crops or weeds however commercial olive orchards have different training systems canopy structures and water stress levels which cause the energy exchange processes over orchards to be more complicated jin et al 2018 kustas et al 2018 reported that canopy characteristics could significantly affect heat and water vapor exchange from the soil surface between rows and vine canopies in this regard pôças et al 2014 suggested that one source energy balance oseb models such as metric may not be appropriate for estimating eta for strongly clumped canopies such as those in orchards and vineyards timmermans et al 2007 suggested that two source energy balance tseb models performed better in sparse canopies than the oseb model because tseb models estimate energy balance components from the canopy and soil surface separately additionally these authors reported that errors in surface air temperature differences had the most significant impact on estimations of hi for both the oseb and tseb models this issue is critical in drip irrigated orchards and vineyards with low fc and without cover crops in interrows in this study hi generated above the soil surface between rows was generally the major contributor to the energy balance which played a crucial role in computing lei and eta when the metric model was applied in the superintensive drip irrigated orchard in this orchard hi was between 50 and 61 of rni during the study period recent studies have suggested that adjustment of the functions for zom lai and gi in the original metric algorithm can reduce uncertainty in the lei and etai estimates for heterogeneous woody canopies such as those of orchards and vineyards carrasco benavides et al 2014 de la fuente sáiz et al 2017 jin et al 2018 pôças et al 2014 santos et al 2012 in this study the performance of the metric model when using specific functions e g zom lai and gi was adequate for estimating orchard water requirements with errors less than 10 of ec values however the effects of training systems and cover crops between rows on aerodynamic properties and energy exchange need to be addressed when rseb algorithms such as metric are applied to calculate eta and kc training systems and pruning have significant effects on canopy geometries e g lai and fc which play an essential role in partitioning rni into lei hi and gi lópez olivarí et al 2016 this partitioning is also significantly affected by the percentage of wetted area aw of the soil surface which depends on the drip irrigation design further research is needed to evaluate the performance of metric and other models for drip irrigated orchards with different canopy structures irrigation management and climate conditions finally for orchards with cover crops in the interrows a two source energy balance approach may be beneficial to separate the fluxes from the canopy and interrows 5 conclusions the results of this study suggest that the metric model can be used to accurately compute the magnitudes and spatial variabilities of seb components eta and kc for a superintensive drip irrigated olive orchard under mild to moderate water stress ψx ranged between 1 3 and 1 80 mpa the estimated values for lei rni and gi at the times of satellite overpass were generally in good agreement with ground based measurements within the olive orchard for the seb components the relative error and rmse ranged between 2 and 5 of the observed values and 29 46 w m 2 respectively for daily water use the results indicate that the metric model estimated eta with an average error of 6 and rmse 0 42 mm day 1 these results are consistent with those reported in the literature and are within the acceptable range for applications of remote sensing models in heterogeneous canopies i e

10098,recent droughts and subsequent reduction of water resources in arid and semi arid regions have highlighted the necessity of altering surface irrigation techniques to modern methods of irrigation the present study compares drip irrigation tubes with 60 and 75 cm spacing with the furrow irrigation prevalent in hamedan province iran and investigates the effects of the former form of irrigation on the productivity of wheat crops with various cropping layouts this experiment was implemented as a field scale experiment in sandy clay loam texture soil and consisted of the following treatments 4 cultivated rows with 15 cm spacing on both sides of the drip tape and 75 cm spacing between tapes t1 4 cultivated rows with 20 cm row spacing and 75 cm drip tape spacing t2 3 cultivated rows with 20 cm row spacing and 60 cm drip tape spacing t3 4 cultivated rows with 15 cm row spacing and 60 cm drip tape spacing t4 2 cultivated rows with 30 cm row spacing and 60 cm drip tape spacing t5 and furrow irrigation which consisted of 4 cultivated rows with 12 cm spacing on the ridge and 60 cm furrow spacing f the results showed that the maximum and minimum value of the two year average grain yield and irrigation water productivity were those of t1 and f treatments at 7443 and 5996 kg ha 1 and 1 91 and 1 02 kg m 3 respectively the maximum and minimum values of two year average weight of 1000 kernels were also obtained from t1 and f treatments at 44 3 and 42 1 g respectively the mean irrigation water productivity obtained for drip and furrow irrigation treatments were 1 74 and 1 01 kg m 3

arid and semi arid regions have highlighted the necessity of altering surface irrigation techniques to modern methods of irrigation in order to increase water productivity li et al 2019 the ir national policy emphasizes the reduction of groundwater consumption and of the economic utilization of water while guaranteeing adequate food supplies resources as pre requisites of sustainable agricultural production the disparity between protecting groundwater resources and guarantying wheat production has rapidly transformed this issue into a scientific topic among numerous researchers li et al 2019 wang 2017 2018 xu et al 2018 with due regards to the increase in population worldwide and global weather change pressure on water resources is increasing gleick and palaniappan 2010 hanjra and qureshi 2010 yu et al 2020 the fact that the majority of global water resources are used for irrigation has resulted into numerous researchers worldwide to focus on a means to produce more food with minimum water consumption deng et al 2006 landi et al 2008 albaji et al 2008 kang et al 2017 yang et al 2020 zare abyaneh et al 2017 over the past few decades the critical condition of ground and surface water resources compounded by the ever increasing need of a growing population for food has resulted into the modification of field irrigation systems by farming communities in recent years in order to increase wheat production and retain applied irrigation water the use of drip irrigation systems has been raised and several studies have been conducted globally jha et al 2019 states that drip irrigation could be applied to wheat crops moreover chen et al 2015 studied which was carried out in china indicated that wheat yield decreased with the increasing of the lateral spacing in drip irrigation from 60 to 90 cm the results of a study by shock et al 2005 showed when tape spacing in drip irrigation is higher than 65 cm the kernel and dry biomass yields of wheat crops decrease as a result of the required water requirements not being met liao et al 2008 investigated the changes in soil moisture amount of irrigation water grain yield and the water use efficiency of wheat crops the researchers stated that to achieve high levels of crop yield the meeting of the required amount of soil moisture in the elongation and milk stages is of great importance their research further reported that by implementing drip irrigation for wheat crops greater crop yield was achieved while reducing the amount of water usage as compared to basin irrigation grabow et al 2011 conducted a field experiment to investigate the effects of lateral spacing on the yield of corn soybeans and winter wheat in clay soil and found that water usually moves at a distance of 0 38 0 5 m from drip irrigation laterals the results obtained show that compared to sprinkle irrigation yield and water use efficiency increase in subsurface drip irrigation the results of kharrou et al 2011 showed that when combined with a 20 economization in applied irrigation drip irrigation is much more effective in comparison to surface irrigation the study indicated that grain yield in drip irrigation was 28 higher than the surface irrigation treatment and 52 higher than the existing irrigation treatment the common irrigation method applied in the region moreover water use efficiency in the existing method of irrigation and surface irrigation improved at approximately 59 and 24 respectively gao et al 2014 investigated the effect of subsurface drip irrigation on yield and water use efficiency of winter wheat in northern china the results indicated that yield and water use efficiency in subsurface drip irrigation were 7780 kg ha 1 and 1 83 kg m 3 respectively chouhan et al 2015 investigated the effect of drip irrigation on yield and water productivity of wheat crops in india the results indicated that although the drip irrigation method reduced grain yield by 10 8 but by reducing water usage by 28 42 it increased water productivity rate by 24 24 as compared to the basin irrigation method the study concluded with due regards to the better capability to manage irrigation the drip irrigation system can be a suitable option for improving water productivity in crops such as wheat yan et al 2016 investigated the optimum depth of irrigation and the optimum tape spacing in drip irrigation for spring wheat three tape spacings of 60 90 and 120 cm and three irrigation depths of 35 45 and 55 cm were evaluated the results of the study indicated that the highest level of crop yield was 8964 kg ha 1 at 60 cm tape spacing and 45 cm irrigation depth mostafa et al 2018 investigated drip irrigation management on wheat crops in clay soils in egypt two lateral patterns single and double lateral and an irrigation interval 4 8 and 12 days treatments were used in this study the results indicated that mineral distribution in the double lateral pattern was more superior than the single lateral pattern in addition to conserving 65 water in comparison to surface irrigation the results further showed that the most suitable irrigation interval is an 8 day interval jha et al 2017 investigated the effect of various irrigation methods and irrigation layouts on root development and water absorption by the roots of winter wheat in northern china the treatments of commonly practiced irrigation methods sprinkle irrigation drip irrigation and surface flooding and irrigation layout 50 60 and 70 of field capacity were used in this study the results indicated that both the pressurized irrigation method and irrigation planning method affected root development and water absorption by the root whereas the highest level of water absorption through the root occurred in the drip irrigation method yet the highest level of root concentration in the upper layers of soil was that of the drip irrigation method the results also revealed that the drip irrigation method when combined with an irrigation layout based on 60 of the field capacity had the highest level of water productivity moreover the winter wheat yield for this treatment was 9 53 ton ha 1 arafa et al 2009 compared surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems with the classic fixed sprinkle irrigation system in wheat crops to increase water productivity in arid regions the results showed that wheat grain yield declined by approximately 33 33 and 26 57 in the surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems respectively in comparison to the sprinkle irrigation system however water productivity and water use economization increased by approximately 43 13 and 76 respectively when using drip irrigation they concluded that the subsurface drip irrigation system could be an effective method for field crop irrigation albeit requiring further research under similar conditions wang et al 2013 found that in northern china irrigation methods and various irrigation levels have significant impacts on plant growth and wheat grain yield they stated that drip irrigation increases crop yield and water use efficiency in wheat as compared to the basin irrigation method in low irrigation circumstances they concluded that irrespective of the investment in irrigation systems the highest level of water productivity was that of the drip irrigation system achieved when irrigation was carried out at soil moisture of 50 60 of the field capacity studies conducted in the past two decades regarding drip irrigation in wheat cultivations have shown that initially the prevalent cropping layout is based on surface irrigation methods while when changing the method of irrigation the cropping layout must also change in order to optimally utilize the existing potentials inherent in modern irrigation systems another point is that the results obtained in specific studies such as those by lv et al 2019 yan et al 2016 and chen et al 2015 indicate that in a soil with a specific texture increasing the distance between drip irrigation tubes decreases the yield which in itself subsequently decreases water productivity in wheat thus the focal question underlying the present study is whether this decreased yield and water productivity in wheat as a result of increased drip irrigation tube spacing could be compensated for by changing the cropping layout of wheat rows in between the drip irrigation tubes the present study was conducted on a field scale to investigate the effects of various drip tape spacing and various wheat row cropping layouts in sandy clay loam soil and its affect on the yield and water productivity index of wheat crops as well as a comparison with the furrow irrigation method which is the prevailing irrigation method in the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the present study was carried out on a field scale in the ekbatan station of the agriculture and natural resources research and education center of hamedan located in the west of iran with geographical coordinates of 34 52 47 6 n and 48 32 1 6 e during the cropping years of 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 according to long term meteorology statistics hamedan s mean temperature and annual precipitation during this period were 9 6 c and 314 mm respectively the average elevation from sea level is 1730 m the region s climate based on the de martonne climate classification is semi arid 2 2 soil and irrigation water properties the physical and chemical properties of the soil related to the experimental farm are presented in table 1 the results of table 1 show that the soil texture of the experimental farm was sandy clay loam the irrigation water was supplied from a well the chemical quality of the irrigation water during the two year experiment is presented in table 2 according to the wilcox classification the quality of water that was used during both years of the experiment fell in the medium class c3s1 2 3 experimental design evaluated treatments and water requirement the study was conducted in a completely randomized design on a field scale the experiment included the following treatments 1 4 cultivated rows with 15 cm spacing on both sides of the drip tape and 75 cm spacing between tapes t1 2 4 cultivated rows with 20 cm row spacing and 75 cm drip tape spacing t2 3 3 cultivated rows with 20 cm row spacing and 60 cm drip tape spacing t3 4 4 cultivated rows with 15 cm row spacing and 60 cm drip tape spacing t4 5 2 cultivated rows with 30 cm row spacing and 60 cm drip tape spacing t5 6 furrow irrigation 4 cultivated rows with 12 cm spacing on the ridge and 60 cm furrow spacing f the cropping layout of various drip irrigation treatments are illustrated in fig 1 the design was executed on a field scale and each treatment was carried out in a 12 m width and 75 m length 900 m2 area the heidari wheat cultivar was used for the experiments the number of seeds used in all treatments was 450 per square meter crop planting was carried out via a linear seeder hamedan machine barzegar co and based on the designated cropping layouts all experimental plots were sown on 31th october in 2016 and on 17th october in 2017 and they were harvested on 29th july in 2017 and on 6th july in 2018 respectively some stages of the project execution are depicted in fig 2 in order to determine the amount of irrigation water needed the evapotranspiration rate of the wheat crop was calculated through the equation below 1 et c k ci et oi where etc is the accumulative evapotranspiration by the crop in the ith day mm after the previous measurement kci is the crop coefficient in the ith day whose values were determined from the guidelines of fao 56 paper and calibrated for the study area allen et al 1998 etoi is the reference evapotranspiration in the ith day mm and estimated using the eto calculator software fao 2012 the weather data used in eq 1 were collected by the synoptic meteorological station of hamedan near the experimental area the weather data included minimum and maximum temperature minimum and maximum humidity sunshine hours and average wind speed the net depth of irrigation water was calculated from the following equation kharrou et al 2011 2 in etc pe where in is the net depth of required irrigation water mm and pe is the effective precipitation in the interval between two irrigations mm the value of which has been calculated via the scs method usda 2019 the depth of the applied irrigation water was calculated from the following equation 3 i in ea where i is the depth of applied irrigation water mm and ea is the application efficiency that was considered as being 0 9 for the drip irrigation system and 0 6 for the furrow irrigation system due to the short length and closed end of the furrows waller and yitayew 2016 the irrigation scheduling effective precipitation and total irrigation values are given in table 3 for different irrigation methods an accurate flow meter was connected to the inlet of each treatment plot to control the pre determined irrigation amount the irrigation interval was once every 12 days for the furrow irrigation method closed end furrow based on the commonly practiced irrigation interval while it was once every 6 days for the drip irrigation method other aspects such as fertilizer pesticide and micro element application and other agronomic measures were uniformly conducted in all treatments and according to the soil assessment results and common practices among the farmers in the region in the first year prior to sowing basal fertilizers consisting of pure n 46 kg ha 1 33 3 of total n required in urea p 112 5 kg ha 1 in triple super phosphate and k 50 kg ha 1 in potassium sulfate were spread manually in all treatments and mixed into the soil using a disc plough the remaining treatments required pure n i e 92 kg ha 1 66 7 of total n required in urea which was spread manually in the furrow irrigation method just before the first irrigation in the spring and by fertigation in the drip irrigation method in the second year the required amount of fertilizers was applied exactly the same as the first year except that the amount of pure p was 121 5 kg ha 1 2 4 measuring grain yield and determining the water productivity index in the present study wheat grain yield amount of water consumed irrigation water productivity and productivity of irrigation water plus effective precipitation were determined to measure grain yield after eliminating the marginal effects 25 samples were randomly taken in an area of one square meter from the middle rows of each treatment and after counting the number of ears of wheat the grains were extracted using a wheat laboratory thresher machine and the weight of the samples and one thousand kernels counted by a seed counter machine were measured using a digital scale then treatment yields were converted to kg ha 1 and the average value for the samples 25 samples of each treatment was recorded as the yield of that treatment the irrigation water productivity index wpi and the productivity of irrigation water plus effective precipitation wpi pe were calculated from eq 1 zare abyaneh et al 2020 and eq 2 albaji et al 2011 respectively 4 wpi y i 5 wpi pe y i pe in which wpi is the irrigation water productivity kg m 3 y is the grain yield kg ha 1 i is the amount of applied irrigation water during the cultivation season m3 ha 1 and wpi pe is the productivity of irrigation water plus effective precipitation kg m 3 and pe is the effective precipitation during the cultivation season m3 ha 1 2 5 economic benefit estimation the economic benefit of the different treatments was roughly calculated using eq 6 6 economic benefit us ha 1 grain yield kg ha 1 0 3883 us kg 1 straw kg ha 1 0 067 us kg 1 soil preparation

soil preparation seed and planting caring and harvesting cost were the same among different irrigation treatments the depreciation cost of the drip irrigation system was calculated using a straight line method the straight line method is expressed as eq 7 kim et al 2016 7 dc iic sv cdl where dc is the depreciation cost at a year us ha 1 year 1 iic is the initial investment cost of the drip irrigation system us ha 1 sv is the salvage value of the drip irrigation system at the end of its useful life us ha 1 and cdl is the capital depreciation life year iic at two distances of 75 cm and 60 cm of the drip tape was 1309 and 1427 usd ha 1 respectively sv was assumed 10 of iic and cdl were 15 years therefore the depreciation cost of the drip irrigation system at the two distances of 75 cm and 60 cm of the drip tape was calculated as 78 5 and 85 6 usd ha 1 year 1 respectively 2 6 data analysis to compare the difference in yield for various cropping layouts in drip irrigation and furrow irrigation systems all the obtained data was analyzed via one way analysis of variance anova using spss 16 software spss 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 applied irrigation water volume the volumes of applied irrigation water in the two methods of furrow and drip irrigation for the experimental years are presented in table 3 the average volume of applied irrigation water in 2017 and 2018 in the drip irrigation system was 4702 and 3349 m3 ha 1 and in the furrow irrigation system was 6931 and 5125 m3 ha 1 respectively the two year average of applied irrigation water volume in drip irrigation and furrow irrigation was 4026 and 6028 m3 ha 1 respectively the level of effective precipitation in 2017 and 2018 was 181 mm and 209 mm respectively table 3 the results of the present study indicate that by implementing a drip irrigation system as compared to the concurrent furrow irrigation system in sandy clay loam soil reduced applied irrigation water by 32 and 34 in 2017 and 2018 respectively this result is consistent with the results of chouhan et al 2015 and kharrou et al 2011 although the level of water economization in each of these studies differ from the level of water economization in the present study this is due to the different climatic parameters of these regions and consequently the difference of water requirement in each region mostafa et al 2018 showed that implementing a drip irrigation method results in a 65 economization of irrigation water when compared to surface irrigation in a two year study conducted in india dar et al 2017 obtained the average level of water economization through drip irrigation compared to the prevalent method of wheat irrigation as 73 and 49 in the first and second years of the research respectively 3 2 grain yield table 4 shows the comparison of the means related to the effects of experimental years on wheat grain yield thousand kernel weight number of ears of wheat per square meter and water productivity according to the results in table 4 the effect of experimental years was significant on all investigated parameters except for the number of ears of wheat the results of table 4 indicate that the average grain yield in all the experimental irrigation methods was higher in 2017 with an average value of 6932 kg ha 1 compared to 2018 with an average value of 6467 kg ha 1 which may be due to better climatic conditions for wheat growth and the higher consumption of irrigation water in 2017 4702 and 6931 m3 ha 1 in drip irrigation and furrow irrigation respectively as compared to 2018 3349 and 5125 m3 ha 1 in drip irrigation and furrow irrigation respectively lv et al 2019 have reported similar results which are consistent with the present study since the effects of the experimental years was significant on all studied parameters except for the number of ears of wheat table 4 evaluating the effects of wheat cropping layouts in the drip and furrow irrigation methods on the investigated parameters for 2017 and 2018 are separately presented and discussed in table 5 the statistical analysis presented in table 5 shows that the effect of various treatments on grain yield in 2017 and 2018 was significant at a 1 probability level p 0 01 in 2017 a significant difference was observed between the f treatment with t1 t4 and t5 treatments as well as between t1 with t2 treatments regarding grain yield table 5 the experimental results of 2017 showed that the maximum and minimum grain yields were related to the t1 treatment with 7456 kg ha 1 and the f treatment with 6216 kg ha 1 therefore applying the t1 treatment significantly increased grain yield by about 20 as compared to the f treatment control in 2018 there was a significant difference between the f treatment with the t1 and t4 treatments at a probability level of 1 p 0 01 and there was also a significant difference between the t1 treatment with t2 t3 and t5 treatments regarding grain yield at a probability level of 1 the maximum and minimum grain yields in 2018 were related to the t1 and f treatments with 7429 and 5776 kg ha 1 respectively table 5 in 2018 the t1 treatment also led to a significant increase of about 29 in grain yield as compared to the f treatment therefore drip irrigation with the cropping layout of 4 cultivated rows with 15 cm spacing on each side of the drip tape and 75 cm drip tape spacing t1 resulted in an average of 24 5 increase in grain yield compared to furrow irrigation f this result is due to the more even distribution of water and the improved ability of the root in utilizing the more suitably distributed moisture and nutrients of the soil in drip irrigation lv et al 2019 compared to furrow irrigation which is consistent with the results of liao et al 2008 the research of kharrou et al 2011 indicated that compared to surface irrigation treatments including full irrigation and the customary irrigation method of the region implementing drip irrigation increased wheat grain yield by 28 and 52 respectively the results of bai et al 2020 in the north china plain showed that in comparison to surface irrigation implementing drip irrigation led to a 4 3 increase in grain yield and a 46 6 economization of irrigation water although this increased yield was not significant enough for convincing the farmers to accept drip irrigation technology the economized applied irrigation water achieved from using this method of irrigation was quite obvious the comparison of means for both years of research showed that there is a significant difference between t1 with other treatments except for the t4 treatment regarding grain yield table 5 therefore applying the t1 and t4 treatments has priority over the other treatments moreover the comparison of means for grain yield among the treatment levels of drip irrigation in 2017 and 2018 showed a significant difference between t2 and t1 treatments table 5 minimum grain yield among the drip irrigation treatments for 2017 and 2018 related to the t2 treatment with 6584 and 6154 kg ha 1 respectively and the maximum grain yield was related to the t1 treatment with 7456 and 7429 kg ha 1 respectively this result reveals that in conditions where the drip tape spacing is 75 cm planting a row of wheat along the centerline in between two drip tapes fig 1b decreases planting density near the drip tapes compared to the t1 treatment fig 1a and increases planting density along the center line in between two drip tapes the row planted in the middle has a lower probability of using soil moisture and subsequently a lower probability of using soil nutrients which leads to reduced grain yield in this row and the subsequent reduction of total yield in the t2 treatment it is noteworthy that planting density per square meter was the same in all treatments i e 450 per meter square therefore the number of seeds used in cultivating the t1 treatment was the same as the t2 treatment but these seeds were located near the drip tape and had a higher chance of using soil moisture and nutrients which eventually led to increased grain yield in the t1 treatment similar results mentioned for the 75 cm drip tape spacing in t1 and t2 treatments also exist for the 60 cm drip tape spacing in the t3 and t4 treatments table 5 the study results of lv et al 2019 have also shown that the rows planted in the middle of the two drip tapes receive less moisture which reduces root activity and root exudates and this increases wheat grain yield in the investigated treatments thus confirming the results of the present study the results of fischer et al 2019 showed that wheat grain yield wasn t sensitive to planting density but was sensitive to row spacing as previously mentioned in both experimental years the t1 treatment had higher grain yield than the t3 t4 and t5 treatments but in both experimental years the t2 treatment had a lower yield than the t3 t4 and t5 treatments table 5 this result indicates that although by increasing drip tape spacing from 60 to 75 cm grain yield is expected to decrease due to reduced moisture reception along the center line in between two drip tapes chen et al 2015 lv et al 2019 yan et al 2016 but by selecting an optimal planting pattern such as the t1 treatment can increase grain yield therefore by increasing the distance between the drip tapes and selecting an appropriate planting pattern the yield will increase and expenses will also be lowered due to using less drip tape tubes the study results of liu et al 2016 revealed that 15 cm row spacing in wheat clearly led to maximum yield 6 9 ton ha 1 whereas by increasing row spacing to 25 and 35 cm grain yield reduced by 14 and 18 respectively also by decreasing row spacing to 5 cm grain yield reduced by 20 it is noteworthy that their study also involved a fixed plant density of 360 per square meter they attributed the reduced wheat grain yield caused by increasing row spacing from 15 cm to low photosynthetic coverage along with lower photosynthesis active radiation increased row spacing drastically increases the light transmission ratio thus improving the lighting conditions of the canopy however the excessive loss of light leaks in 25 35 cm spacing treatments was not optimal for enhancing the efficiency of radiant energy 3 3 1000 kernel weight according to table 4 the experimental years significantly affected the 1000 kernel weight table 4 results indicate that the average weight of 1000 wheat kernels in all studied irrigation methods was higher in 2017 at 43 8 g than in 2018 at 42 6 g which as previously mentioned could be due to the better climatic conditions for wheat growth and higher consumption of irrigation water in 2017 compared to 2018 the statistical analysis depicted in table 5 shows that the effect of various treatments on 1000 kernel weight of wheat was significant in 2017 and 2018 at probability levels of 5 and 1 p 0 05 and p 0 01 respectively in 2017 the 1000 kernel weight of wheat in the t3 treatment was significantly different from f and t2 treatments at a 5 probability level but the 1000 kernel weight difference was non significant among other investigated treatments table 5 the study results of 2017 have shown that the maximum and minimum 1000 kernel weight is that of the t3 and t2 treatments at 46 13 g and 41 86 g respectively 1000 kernel weight of the f treatment was 42 06 g with a non significant difference from the t2 treatment therefore study results indicate that applying the t3 treatment has significantly increased 1000 kernel weight by about 10 as compared to the f treatment moreover the difference between 1000 kernel weight in the t1 treatment 44 93 g and the t3 treatment that had the highest value of 1000 kernel weight 46 13 g was non significant thus applying the t1 treatment significantly increased the 1000 kernel weight by about 7 as compared to the f treatment in 2018 the 1000 kernel weight of the t1 treatment was significantly different from that of the f treatment at a probability level of 1 p 0 01 and there was also a significant difference between the t1 treatment with the t3 and t2 treatments regarding 1000 kernel weight the maximum and minimum 1000 kernel weight in 2018 was that of the t1 and t3 treatments at 43 64 and 41 38 g respectively 1000 kernel weight in the f treatment was 42 16 g the value of which was non significantly different from that of the t3 treatment with the lowest value of 1000 kernel weight table 5 in 2018 applying the t1 treatment significantly increased the 1000 kernel weight at about 3 5 as compared to the f treatment therefore drip irrigation with the pattern of four planting rows and 15 cm row spacing on both sides of the tape and 75 cm spacing between drip tapes t1 resulted in an average 5 25 increase in 1000 kernel weight of wheat compared to furrow irrigation f this is due to the more even distribution of water and the higher capacity of the root in using soil moisture and nutrients through drip irrigation with less spacing between cultivated rows from the drip tapes lv et al 2019 in comparison to furrow irrigation which has resulted in increased 1000 kernel weight of the t1 treatment the research of lv et al 2010 has shown that under drip irrigation the main region of root distribution moves upward in comparison to surface irrigation thus changing the root distribution pattern in the soil profile considering the optimal soil moisture and higher root density in the surface layer of soil under drip irrigation treatment the main region of water absorption is focused in the upper layer of the soil but in surface irrigation the main absorption region of the root moves further down due to water deficiency in the upper layers of the soil therefore this difference in amount and pattern of water absorption through the root results in the variations of wheat yield overall the comparison of means during 2017 and 2018 shows that the t1 treatment had the highest 1000 kernel weight however the 1000 kernel weight of the t1 treatment in 2017 was non significant compared to the t3 treatment that had the highest value of 1000 kernel weight table 5 therefore the t1 treatment is preferred to the other treatments in order to achieve the highest level of 1000 kernel weight the comparison of means for 1000 kernel weight in wheat among the drip irrigation treatments in 2017 showed that the lowest value of 1000 kernel weight was that of the t2 treatment at 41 86 g and the highest value was that of the t3 treatment with 46 13 g the t2 was significantly different from the t3 treatment but its difference with the t1 treatment was not significant table 5 in 2017 changing the planting pattern of the wheat rows with equal drip tape spacing of 60 cm i e t3 t4 and t5 treatments didn t have a significant effect on wheat s 1000 kernel weight this result is also true for the treatments with equal drip tape spacing of 75 cm i e t1 and t2 in 2017 the 1000 kernel weight was also not significantly different among these two treatments the comparison of means for 1000 kernel weight among drip irrigation treatments in 2018 showed that the lowest value of 1000 kernel weight was that of the t3 treatment at 41 38 g and its highest value is that of thet1 treatment at 43 64 g the t1 treatment was significantly different from the t2 and t3 treatments whereas its difference with the t4 and t5 treatments was non significant table 5 in 2018 changing the planting pattern of wheat rows with equal 60 cm drip tape spacing i e the t3 t4 and t5 treatments had a significant effect on the 1000 kernel weight of wheat such that the t3 treatment had the lowest value of 1000 kernel weight in wheat in the t3 treatment the middle row of cultivated wheat is located at a 30 cm distance fig 1c from the drip tape but in the t4 treatment the two middle cultivated rows are located a 22 5 cm distance fig 1d and in the t5 treatment both cultivated rows are located at a 15 cm distance fig 1e from the drip tape this reduction of row spacing in wheat compared to the drip irrigation increases the possibility of accessing soil moisture and nutrients through the root and therefore increases the 1000 kernel weight by 0 8 and 4 06 in the t5 treatment as compared to the t4 and t3 treatments respectively and also led to a 3 24 increase of the t4 treatment as compared to the t3 treatment this result is also true for the treatments with equal 75 cm drip tape spacing i e the t1 and t2 treatments in 2018 these two treatments also had a significant effect on the 1000 kernel weight of wheat such that the t2 treatment with 42 65 g had lower 1000 kernel weight compared to the t1 treatment at 43 64 g in the t2 treatment the two middle cultivated rows of wheat were located at a 27 5 cm distance fig 1b from the drip tape and in the t1 treatment both middle cultivated rows of wheat were located at a 22 5 cm distance fig 1a from the drip tape in this case reducing the distance between wheat rows and drip tapes also increased the possibility of accessing soil moisture and nutrients through the root and therefore increased the 1000 kernel weight in the t1 treatment by 2 32 compared to the t2 treatment this increased 1000 kernel weight led to greater grain yield which is consistent with the results of li et al 2019 3 4 number of ears according to the results of table 4 the experimental years had a non significant effect on the number of ears therefore evaluation of the effect of wheat planting patterns in drip and furrow irrigation methods on the number of ears are presented in fig 3 as a two year average of the treatments and further discussed furthermore the effects of the evaluated treatments in 2017 and 2018 have also been separately presented in table 5 the results of table 3 indicate that the maximum and minimum two year average number of ears belong to the t4 and f treatments at 666 and 481 ears m 2 respectively in other words implementing the t4 treatment has significantly increased the number of ears per square meter by 38 compared to the f treatment this may be due to the high level of irrigation efficiency the more even distribution of water and the improved capacity of the root in using the moisture and nutrient of the soil in drip irrigation as compared to furrow irrigation however the number of ears in the t4 treatment was also significantly high compared to the other drip irrigation treatments such that the t4 treatment had 18 18 3 15 and 7 more ears per square meter compared to the t1 t2 t3 and t5 treatments respectively the movement of nutrient elements is usually dependent on the behavior of the soil water status li et al 2004 increasing the lateral spacing of two drip tapes leads to the reduction of supply water in major parts of the soil in between two drip tubes which leads to the reduction of wheat growth and yield in further distances from the drip tubes chen et al 2015 the research of lv et al 2019 also shows that increasing the distance between drip irrigation laterals from 60 cm to 75 cm and then to 90 cm decreased the number of ears of wheat from 488 to 470 and 468 ears m 2 respectively in the first year of research and from 526 to 506 and 497ears m 2 respectively in the second year of research therefore the study results of lv et al 2019 also confirm the results of the present study however the higher number of ears in the t4 treatment compared to the t3 and t5 treatments all three treatments with equal drip tape spacing of 60 cm could be the result of a more even distribution of wheat bushes in the area between two drip tapes in the t4 treatment which gives plants greater possibility to benefit from light nutrients and moisture due to less competition between wheat bushes in the t3 and t5 treatments wheat bush density around two drip tapes is higher than that of the t4 treatment and this leads to increased competition between wheat bushes in absorbing light nutrients and soil moisture it is noteworthy that planting density per square meter was identical in all treatments 450 m 2 therefore the same number of seeds used for cultivating the t4 treatment was used in thet3 and t5 treatments however the mentioned amount of seeds in the t3 and t5 treatment was located near the drip tapes and the competition between wheat bushes for the absorption of soil moisture and nutrients increased leading to a reduction in the number of ears of wheat in these two treatments in comparison to the t4 treatment 3 5 irrigation water productivity wpi according to the results of table 4 the experimental years had a significant effect on irrigation water productivity the results of table 4 show that the average value of irrigation water productivity in all studied irrigation methods was higher in 2018 at 1 83 kg m 3 than in 2017 at 1 40 kg m 3 which is due to the less consumption of irrigation water in 2018 4237 m3 compared to 2017 5816 m3 the statistical analysis presented in table 5 indicates that in 2017 and 2018 the effect of various treatments on irrigation water productivity was significant at a probability level of 1 p 0 01 in 2017 irrigation water productivity in the t1 treatment was significantly different from the f and t2 treatments at a probability level of 1 but the difference between irrigation water productivity in the t1 treatment and the other evaluated treatments was non significant table 5 the study results of 2017 have revealed that the maximum and minimum levels of irrigation water productivity belonged to the t1 treatment at 1 59 kg m 3 and the f treatment at 0 9 kg m 3 the results of the present study indicate that implementing the t1 treatment significantly increases irrigation water productivity at about 77 as compared to the f treatment in 2018 irrigation water productivity in the t1 treatment was significantly different from the f treatment at a 1 probability level p 0 01 and the t1 treatment was also significantly different from the t2 t3 and t5 treatments regarding irrigation water productivity the maximum and minimum levels of irrigation water productivity in 2018 belonged to the t1 and f treatments at about 2 22 and 1 13 kg m 3 respectively table 5 in 2018 implementing the t1 treatment significantly increased irrigation water productivity by approximately 96 as compared to the f treatment therefore the results obtained from two years of experiment showed that drip irrigation involving 4 cultivated rows with 15 cm spacing on both sides of the drip tape and 75 cm spacing between drip tapes t1 increased irrigation water productivity by an average rate of 86 5 compared to furrow irrigation f this result is due to reduced applied irrigation water and increased grain yield in the t1 drip irrigation treatment 4026 m3 and 7443 kg ha 1 respectively compared to furrow irrigation 6028 m3 and 5996 kg ha 1 respectively which has led to greater irrigation water productivity in the t1 treatment tables 3 and 5 the study results of kharrou et al 2011 were consistent with the results of the present study the research conducted by chouhan et al 2015 also showed that compared to basin irrigation implementing a drip irrigation method increases irrigation water productivity in wheat by 24 24 the study results of bai et al 2020 in north china plain showed that applying a drip irrigation system led to a 10 5 increase in water productivity compared to surface irrigation overall the comparison of means in 2017 and 2018 showed that the t1 treatment had the highest level of irrigation water productivity table 5 therefore implementing the t1 treatment is preferred to other treatments in order to achieve maximum irrigation water productivity furthermore the comparison of means of irrigation water productivity for drip irrigation treatments in 2017 and 2018 showed a significant difference between the t1 and t2 treatments table 5 maximum irrigation water productivity among all drip irrigation treatments in 2017 and 2018 was that of the t1 treatment at 1 59 and 2 22 kg m 3 respectively and the minimum value was that of the t2 treatment at 1 40 and 1 84 kg m 3 respectively as previously discussed in the grain yield section this result indicates that in the conditions of 75 cm drip tape spacing planting a row of wheat along the center line in between two drip tapes fig 1b decreases planting density near the drip tapes as compared to the t1 treatment fig 1a and increases planting density along the center line in between two drip tapes the row planted along the center line has a lower chance of using the moisture lv et al 2019 and thus a lower chance of benefiting from soil nutrients which in turn results in reduced grain yield in the center row and the consequent reduction of total yield in the t2 treatment therefore considering that the amount of applied irrigation water was identical in the drip irrigation treatments this reduced grain yield in the t2 treatment caused an 11 9 and 17 1 decline in water productivity in 2017 and 2018 respectively as compared to the t1 treatment similar results mentioned for the treatments with 75 cm drip tape spacing t1 and t2 also apply to the treatments with 60 cm drip tape spacing between the t3 and t4 treatments table 5 such that in the t4 treatment the two center rows are located 22 5 cm fig 1d from the drip tape but in the t3 treatment the center row is located 30 cm fig 1c from the drip tape compared to the t3 treatment the small spacing between the two cultivated rows in the t4 treatment increased the chance of accessing moisture through the root and therefore increased grain yield eventually leading to greater water productivity in the t4 treatment as compared to the t3 treatment the study results of lv et al 2019 and chen et al 2015 also showed that by increasing drip tape spacing the rows planted along the centerline in between two drip tapes receive less moisture which leads to grain yield reduction and reduced water use efficiency in wheat which confirm the results of the present study 3 6 productivity of irrigation water plus effective precipitation wpi pe according to the results of table 4 the experimental years significantly affected the wpi pe table 4 results indicate that the average value of the wpi pe in all studied irrigation methods was higher in 2018 at 1 15 kg m 3 than in 2017 at 1 02 kg m 3 which is due to less consumption of the sum of irrigation water and effective precipitation in 2018 4446 m3 compared to 2017 5997 m3 the statistical analysis presented in table 5 indicates that the effect of various treatments on the wpi pe in 2017 and 2018 was significant at a probability level of 1 p 0 01 in 2017 the wpi pe in the t1 treatment was significantly different from the f and t2 treatments at a 1 probability level but its difference with the other evaluated treatments was non significant table 5 the study results of 2017 showed that the maximum and minimum levels of the wpi pe belonged to the t1 treatment at 1 14 kg m 3 and the f treatment at 0 71 kg m 3 the results of the present study indicate that in 2017 implementing the t1 treatment significantly increased the wpi pe by about 61 as compared to the f treatment in 2018 the wpi pe in the t1 treatment was significantly different from the f treatment at a 1 probability level p 0 01 and the t1 treatment was also significantly different from the t2 t3 and t5 treatments regarding the wpi pe the maximum and minimum levels of the wpi pe in 2018 belonged to the t1 and f treatments at about 1 36 and 0 8 kg m 3 respectively table 5 in 2018 implementing the t1 treatment significantly increased the wpi pe by approximately 70 as compared to the f treatment therefore the results obtained from two year experiments showed that drip irrigation involving 4 cultivated rows with 15 cm spacing on both sides of the drip tape and 75 cm spacing between drip tapes t1 increased the wpi pe by an average rate of 65 5 compared to furrow irrigation f this result is due to the reduced sum of irrigation and effective precipitation water and increased grain yield in the t1 drip irrigation treatment 4221 m3 and 7443 kg ha 1 respectively compared to furrow irrigation 6223 m3 and 5996 kg ha 1 respectively which has led to greater wpi pe in the t1 treatment tables 3 and 5 overall the comparison of means in 2017 and 2018 showed that the t1 treatment had the highest level of wpi pe table 5 therefore implementing the t1 treatment is preferred to other treatments in order to achieve maximum wpi pe furthermore the comparison of means for the wpi pe for drip irrigation treatments in 2017 and 2018 showed a significant difference between the t1 and t2 treatments table 5 the maximum sum of wpi pe among all drip irrigation treatments in 2017 and 2018 was that of the t1 treatment at 1 14 and 1 36 kg m 3 respectively and the minimum value was that of the t2 treatment at 1 01 and 1 13 kg m 3 respectively as previously discussed in the irrigation water productivity section this result indicates that in the conditions of 75 cm drip tape spacing planting a row of wheat along the centerline in between two drip tapes fig 1b decreases planting density near the drip tapes as compared to the t1 treatment fig 1a and increases planting density along the centerline in between two drip tapes the row planted along the centerline has a lower chance of using the moisture lv et al 2019 and thus a lower chance of benefiting from soil nutrients which results in reduced grain yield in the center row and the consequent reduction of total yield in the t2 treatment therefore considering that the value for the sum of irrigation and effective precipitation water was identical in the drip irrigation treatments this reduced grain yield in the t2 treatment caused an 11 4 and 16 9 decline in the wpi pe in 2017 and 2018 respectively as compared to the t1 treatment similar results mentioned for the treatments with 75 cm drip tape spacing t1 and t2 also apply to the treatments with 60 cm drip tape spacing between the t3 and t4 treatments table 5 as mentioned in the irrigation water productivity section in the t4 treatment the two center rows are located 22 5 cm fig 1d from the drip tape but in the t3 treatment the center row is located 30 cm fig 1c from the drip tape compared to the t3 treatment the small spacing between the two cultivated rows in the t4 treatment increased the chance of accessing moisture through the root and therefore increased grain yield eventually leading to a greater wpi pe in the t4 treatment as compared to the t3 treatment 3 7 economic benefit the economic benefits of different wheat irrigation treatments are presented in table 6 t1 treatment showed the highest economic benefit among the six treatments because of the lower drip tape cost and depreciation cost of t1 than t3 t4 and t5 in addition to the lower applied water cost of t1 as compared to f there was also a higher income rate as a result of higher grain yield and larger straw biomass in t1 than in f t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments table 6 it is of note that the soil preparation seed and planting caring and harvesting cost were similar in all the irrigation treatments the results showed that by changing the irrigation system from furrow to drip type the amount of yield and subsequent economic benefits can be increased in a drip irrigation system the costs are reduced by increasing the distance between the drip tapes however yield might be reduced therefore in order to prevent such an issue the planting rows should be located at a shorter distance from the drip tape to have a greater yield and economic benefit nonetheless further experiments are needed to optimize the distance between the drip tape and the row planting pattern of wheat for more water conservation and benefits 4 conclusions the results of the present study indicate that compared to furrow irrigation implementing a drip irrigation system in a sandy clay loam soil in wheat crops has resulted in a 72 increase in irrigation water productivity with approximately a 33 reduction in applied irrigation water moreover when implementing drip irrigation for wheat crops the selecting of an appropriate wheat row spacing layout between drip irrigation tapes taking an increase in the distance of drip irrigation tapes into account will increase the yield while reducing the costs as a result of a decrease in the number of drip tape tubes thus under such experimental conditions when implementing drip irrigation for wheat crops in sandy clay loam soil using a 75 cm drip tape spacing with 4 cultivated rows of 15 cm spacing on both sides of each drip tape is recommended declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

10098,recent droughts and subsequent reduction of water resources in arid and semi arid regions have highlighted the necessity of altering surface irrigation techniques to modern methods of irrigation the present study compares drip irrigation tubes with 60 and 75 cm spacing with the furrow irrigation prevalent in hamedan province iran and investigates the effects of the former form of irrigation on the productivity of wheat crops with various cropping layouts this experiment was implemented as a field scale experiment in sandy clay loam texture soil and consisted of the following treatments 4 cultivated rows with 15 cm spacing on both sides of the drip tape and 75 cm spacing between tapes t1 4 cultivated rows with 20 cm row spacing and 75 cm drip tape spacing t2 3 cultivated rows with 20 cm row spacing and 60 cm drip tape spacing t3 4 cultivated rows with 15 cm row spacing and 60 cm drip tape spacing t4 2 cultivated rows with 30 cm row spacing and 60 cm drip tape spacing t5 and furrow irrigation which consisted of 4 cultivated rows with 12 cm spacing on the ridge and 60 cm furrow spacing f the results showed that the maximum and minimum value of the two year average grain yield and irrigation water productivity were those of t1 and f treatments at 7443 and 5996 kg ha 1 and 1 91 and 1 02 kg m 3 respectively the maximum and minimum values of two year average weight of 1000 kernels were also obtained from t1 and f treatments at 44 3 and 42 1 g respectively the mean irrigation water productivity obtained for drip and furrow irrigation treatments were 1 74 and 1 01 kg m 3

arid and semi arid regions have highlighted the necessity of altering surface irrigation techniques to modern methods of irrigation in order to increase water productivity li et al 2019 the ir national policy emphasizes the reduction of groundwater consumption and of the economic utilization of water while guaranteeing adequate food supplies resources as pre requisites of sustainable agricultural production the disparity between protecting groundwater resources and guarantying wheat production has rapidly transformed this issue into a scientific topic among numerous researchers li et al 2019 wang 2017 2018 xu et al 2018 with due regards to the increase in population worldwide and global weather change pressure on water resources is increasing gleick and palaniappan 2010 hanjra and qureshi 2010 yu et al 2020 the fact that the majority of global water resources are used for irrigation has resulted into numerous researchers worldwide to focus on a means to produce more food with minimum water consumption deng et al 2006 landi et al 2008 albaji et al 2008 kang et al 2017 yang et al 2020 zare abyaneh et al 2017 over the past few decades the critical condition of ground and surface water resources compounded by the ever increasing need of a growing population for food has resulted into the modification of field irrigation systems by farming communities in recent years in order to increase wheat production and retain applied irrigation water the use of drip irrigation systems has been raised and several studies have been conducted globally jha et al 2019 states that drip irrigation could be applied to wheat crops moreover chen et al 2015 studied which was carried out in china indicated that wheat yield decreased with the increasing of the lateral spacing in drip irrigation from 60 to 90 cm the results of a study by shock et al 2005 showed when tape spacing in drip irrigation is higher than 65 cm the kernel and dry biomass yields of wheat crops decrease as a result of the required water requirements not being met liao et al 2008 investigated the changes in soil moisture amount of irrigation water grain yield and the water use efficiency of wheat crops the researchers stated that to achieve high levels of crop yield the meeting of the required amount of soil moisture in the elongation and milk stages is of great importance their research further reported that by implementing drip irrigation for wheat crops greater crop yield was achieved while reducing the amount of water usage as compared to basin irrigation grabow et al 2011 conducted a field experiment to investigate the effects of lateral spacing on the yield of corn soybeans and winter wheat in clay soil and found that water usually moves at a distance of 0 38 0 5 m from drip irrigation laterals the results obtained show that compared to sprinkle irrigation yield and water use efficiency increase in subsurface drip irrigation the results of kharrou et al 2011 showed that when combined with a 20 economization in applied irrigation drip irrigation is much more effective in comparison to surface irrigation the study indicated that grain yield in drip irrigation was 28 higher than the surface irrigation treatment and 52 higher than the existing irrigation treatment the common irrigation method applied in the region moreover water use efficiency in the existing method of irrigation and surface irrigation improved at approximately 59 and 24 respectively gao et al 2014 investigated the effect of subsurface drip irrigation on yield and water use efficiency of winter wheat in northern china the results indicated that yield and water use efficiency in subsurface drip irrigation were 7780 kg ha 1 and 1 83 kg m 3 respectively chouhan et al 2015 investigated the effect of drip irrigation on yield and water productivity of wheat crops in india the results indicated that although the drip irrigation method reduced grain yield by 10 8 but by reducing water usage by 28 42 it increased water productivity rate by 24 24 as compared to the basin irrigation method the study concluded with due regards to the better capability to manage irrigation the drip irrigation system can be a suitable option for improving water productivity in crops such as wheat yan et al 2016 investigated the optimum depth of irrigation and the optimum tape spacing in drip irrigation for spring wheat three tape spacings of 60 90 and 120 cm and three irrigation depths of 35 45 and 55 cm were evaluated the results of the study indicated that the highest level of crop yield was 8964 kg ha 1 at 60 cm tape spacing and 45 cm irrigation depth mostafa et al 2018 investigated drip irrigation management on wheat crops in clay soils in egypt two lateral patterns single and double lateral and an irrigation interval 4 8 and 12 days treatments were used in this study the results indicated that mineral distribution in the double lateral pattern was more superior than the single lateral pattern in addition to conserving 65 water in comparison to surface irrigation the results further showed that the most suitable irrigation interval is an 8 day interval jha et al 2017 investigated the effect of various irrigation methods and irrigation layouts on root development and water absorption by the roots of winter wheat in northern china the treatments of commonly practiced irrigation methods sprinkle irrigation drip irrigation and surface flooding and irrigation layout 50 60 and 70 of field capacity were used in this study the results indicated that both the pressurized irrigation method and irrigation planning method affected root development and water absorption by the root whereas the highest level of water absorption through the root occurred in the drip irrigation method yet the highest level of root concentration in the upper layers of soil was that of the drip irrigation method the results also revealed that the drip irrigation method when combined with an irrigation layout based on 60 of the field capacity had the highest level of water productivity moreover the winter wheat yield for this treatment was 9 53 ton ha 1 arafa et al 2009 compared surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems with the classic fixed sprinkle irrigation system in wheat crops to increase water productivity in arid regions the results showed that wheat grain yield declined by approximately 33 33 and 26 57 in the surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems respectively in comparison to the sprinkle irrigation system however water productivity and water use economization increased by approximately 43 13 and 76 respectively when using drip irrigation they concluded that the subsurface drip irrigation system could be an effective method for field crop irrigation albeit requiring further research under similar conditions wang et al 2013 found that in northern china irrigation methods and various irrigation levels have significant impacts on plant growth and wheat grain yield they stated that drip irrigation increases crop yield and water use efficiency in wheat as compared to the basin irrigation method in low irrigation circumstances they concluded that irrespective of the investment in irrigation systems the highest level of water productivity was that of the drip irrigation system achieved when irrigation was carried out at soil moisture of 50 60 of the field capacity studies conducted in the past two decades regarding drip irrigation in wheat cultivations have shown that initially the prevalent cropping layout is based on surface irrigation methods while when changing the method of irrigation the cropping layout must also change in order to optimally utilize the existing potentials inherent in modern irrigation systems another point is that the results obtained in specific studies such as those by lv et al 2019 yan et al 2016 and chen et al 2015 indicate that in a soil with a specific texture increasing the distance between drip irrigation tubes decreases the yield which in itself subsequently decreases water productivity in wheat thus the focal question underlying the present study is whether this decreased yield and water productivity in wheat as a result of increased drip irrigation tube spacing could be compensated for by changing the cropping layout of wheat rows in between the drip irrigation tubes the present study was conducted on a field scale to investigate the effects of various drip tape spacing and various wheat row cropping layouts in sandy clay loam soil and its affect on the yield and water productivity index of wheat crops as well as a comparison with the furrow irrigation method which is the prevailing irrigation method in the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the present study was carried out on a field scale in the ekbatan station of the agriculture and natural resources research and education center of hamedan located in the west of iran with geographical coordinates of 34 52 47 6 n and 48 32 1 6 e during the cropping years of 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 according to long term meteorology statistics hamedan s mean temperature and annual

wilcox classification the quality of water that was used during both years of the experiment fell in the medium class c3s1 2 3 experimental design evaluated treatments and water requirement the study was conducted in a completely randomized design on a field scale the experiment included the following treatments 1 4 cultivated rows with 15 cm spacing on both sides of the drip tape and 75 cm

machine barzegar co and based on the designated cropping layouts all experimental plots were sown on 31th october in 2016 and on 17th october in 2017 and they were harvested on 29th july in 2017 and on 6th july in 2018 respectively some stages of the project execution are depicted in fig 2 in order to determine the amount of irrigation water needed the evapotranspiration rate of the wheat crop was calculated through the equation below 1 et c k ci et oi where etc is the accumulative evapotranspiration by the crop in the ith day mm after the previous measurement kci is the crop coefficient in the ith day whose values were determined from the guidelines of fao 56 paper and calibrated for the study area allen et al 1998 etoi is the reference evapotranspiration in the ith day mm and estimated using the eto calculator software fao 2012 the weather data used in eq 1 were collected by the synoptic meteorological station of hamedan near the experimental area the weather data included minimum and maximum temperature minimum and maximum humidity sunshine hours and average wind speed the net depth of irrigation water was calculated from the following equation kharrou et al 2011 2 in etc pe where in is the net depth of required irrigation water mm and pe is the effective precipitation in the interval between two irrigations mm the value of which has been calculated via the scs method usda 2019 the depth of the applied irrigation water was calculated from the following equation 3 i in ea where i is the depth of applied irrigation water mm and ea is the application efficiency that was considered as being 0 9 for the drip irrigation system and 0 6 for the furrow irrigation system due to the short length and closed end of the furrows waller and yitayew 2016 the irrigation scheduling effective precipitation and total irrigation values are given in table 3 for different irrigation methods an accurate flow meter was connected to the inlet of each treatment plot to control the pre determined irrigation amount the irrigation interval was once every 12 days for the furrow irrigation method closed end furrow based on the commonly practiced irrigation interval while it was once every 6 days for the drip irrigation method other aspects such as fertilizer pesticide and micro element application and other agronomic measures were uniformly conducted in all treatments and according to the soil assessment results and common practices among the farmers in the region in the first year prior to sowing basal fertilizers consisting of pure n 46 kg ha 1 33 3 of total n required in urea p 112 5 kg ha 1 in triple super phosphate and k 50 kg ha 1 in potassium sulfate were spread manually in all treatments and mixed into the soil using a disc plough the remaining treatments required pure n i e 92 kg ha 1 66 7 of total n required in urea which was spread manually in the furrow irrigation method just before the first irrigation in the spring and by fertigation in the drip irrigation method in the second year the required amount of fertilizers was applied exactly the same as the first year except that the amount of pure p was 121 5 kg ha 1 2 4 measuring grain yield and determining the water productivity index in the present study wheat grain yield amount of water consumed irrigation water productivity and productivity of irrigation water plus effective precipitation were determined to measure grain yield after eliminating the marginal effects 25 samples were randomly taken in an area of one square meter from the middle rows of each treatment and after counting the number of ears of wheat the grains were extracted using a wheat laboratory thresher machine and the weight of the samples and one thousand kernels counted by a seed counter machine were measured using a digital scale then treatment yields were converted to kg ha 1 and the average value for the samples 25 samples of each treatment was recorded as the yield of that treatment the irrigation water productivity index wpi and the productivity of irrigation water plus effective precipitation wpi pe were calculated from eq 1 zare abyaneh et al 2020 and eq 2 albaji et al 2011 respectively 4 wpi y i 5 wpi pe y i pe in which wpi is the irrigation water productivity kg m 3 y is the grain yield kg ha 1 i is the amount of applied irrigation water during the cultivation season m3 ha 1 and wpi pe is the productivity of irrigation water plus effective precipitation kg m 3 and pe is the effective precipitation during the cultivation season m3 ha 1 2 5 economic benefit estimation the economic benefit of the different treatments was roughly calculated using eq 6 6 economic benefit us ha 1 grain yield kg ha 1 0 3883 us kg 1 straw kg ha 1 0 067 us kg 1 soil preparation

soil preparation seed and planting caring and harvesting cost were the same among different irrigation treatments the depreciation cost of the drip irrigation system was calculated using a straight line method the straight line method is expressed as eq 7 kim et al 2016 7 dc iic sv cdl where dc is the depreciation cost at a year us ha 1 year 1 iic is the initial investment cost of the drip irrigation system us ha 1 sv is the salvage value of the drip irrigation system at the end of its useful life us ha 1 and cdl is the capital depreciation life year iic at two distances of 75 cm and 60 cm of the drip tape was 1309 and 1427 usd ha 1 respectively sv was assumed 10 of iic and cdl were 15 years therefore the depreciation cost of the drip irrigation system at the two distances of 75 cm and 60 cm of the drip tape was calculated as 78 5 and 85 6 usd ha 1 year 1 respectively 2 6 data analysis to compare the difference in yield for various cropping layouts in drip irrigation and furrow irrigation systems all the obtained data was analyzed via one way analysis of variance anova using spss 16 software spss 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 applied irrigation water volume the volumes of applied irrigation water in the two methods of furrow and drip irrigation for the experimental years are presented in table 3 the average volume of applied irrigation water in 2017 and 2018 in the drip irrigation system was 4702 and 3349 m3 ha 1 and in the furrow irrigation system was 6931 and 5125 m3 ha 1 respectively the two year average of applied irrigation water volume in drip irrigation and furrow irrigation was 4026 and 6028 m3 ha 1 respectively the level of effective precipitation in 2017 and 2018 was 181 mm and 209 mm respectively table 3 the results of the present study indicate that by implementing a drip irrigation system as compared to the concurrent furrow irrigation system in sandy clay loam soil reduced applied irrigation water by 32 and 34 in 2017 and 2018 respectively this result is consistent with the results of chouhan et al 2015 and kharrou et al 2011 although the level of water economization in each of these studies differ from the level of water economization in the present study this is due to the different climatic parameters of these regions and consequently the difference of water requirement in each region mostafa et al 2018 showed that implementing a drip irrigation method results in a 65 economization of irrigation water when compared to surface irrigation in a two year study conducted in india dar et al 2017 obtained the average level of water economization through drip irrigation compared to the prevalent method of wheat irrigation as 73 and 49 in the first and second years of the research respectively 3 2 grain yield table 4 shows the comparison of the means related to the effects of experimental years on wheat grain yield thousand kernel weight number of ears of wheat per square meter and water productivity according to the results in table 4 the effect of experimental years was significant on all investigated parameters except for the number of ears of wheat the results of table 4 indicate that the average grain yield in all the experimental irrigation methods was higher in 2017 with an average value of 6932 kg ha 1 compared to 2018 with an average value of 6467 kg ha 1 which may be due to better climatic conditions for wheat growth and the higher consumption of irrigation water in 2017 4702 and 6931 m3 ha 1 in drip irrigation and furrow irrigation respectively as compared to 2018 3349 and 5125 m3 ha 1 in drip irrigation and furrow irrigation respectively lv et al 2019 have reported similar results which are consistent with the present study since the effects of the experimental years was significant on all studied parameters except for the number of ears of wheat table 4 evaluating the effects of wheat cropping layouts in the drip and furrow irrigation methods on the investigated parameters for 2017 and 2018 are separately presented and discussed in table 5 the statistical analysis presented in table 5 shows that the effect of various treatments on grain yield in 2017 and 2018 was significant at a 1 probability level p 0 01 in 2017 a significant difference was observed between the f treatment with t1 t4 and t5 treatments as well as between t1 with t2 treatments regarding grain yield table 5 the experimental results of 2017 showed that the maximum and minimum grain yields were related to the t1 treatment with 7456 kg ha 1 and the f treatment with 6216 kg ha 1 therefore applying the t1 treatment significantly increased grain yield by about 20 as compared to the f treatment control in 2018 there was a significant difference between the f treatment with the t1 and t4 treatments at a probability level of 1 p 0 01 and there was also a significant difference between the t1 treatment with t2 t3 and t5 treatments regarding grain yield at a probability level of 1 the maximum and minimum grain yields in 2018 were related to the t1 and f treatments with 7429 and 5776 kg ha 1 respectively table 5 in 2018 the t1 treatment also led to a significant increase of about 29 in grain yield as compared to the f treatment therefore drip irrigation with the cropping layout of 4 cultivated rows with 15 cm spacing on each side of the drip tape and 75 cm drip tape spacing t1 resulted in an average of 24 5 increase in grain yield compared to furrow irrigation f this result is due to the more even distribution of water and the improved ability of the root in utilizing the more suitably distributed moisture and nutrients of the soil in drip irrigation lv et al 2019 compared to furrow irrigation which is consistent with the results of liao et al 2008 the research of kharrou et al 2011 indicated that compared to surface irrigation treatments including full irrigation and the customary irrigation method of the region implementing drip irrigation increased wheat grain yield by 28 and 52 respectively the results of bai et al 2020 in the north china plain showed that in comparison to surface irrigation implementing drip irrigation led to a 4 3 increase in grain yield and a 46 6 economization of irrigation water although this increased yield was not significant enough for convincing the farmers to accept drip irrigation technology the economized applied irrigation water achieved from using this method of irrigation was quite obvious the comparison of means for both years of research showed that there is a significant difference between t1 with other treatments except for the t4 treatment regarding grain yield table 5 therefore applying the t1 and t4 treatments has priority over the other treatments moreover the comparison of means for grain yield among the treatment levels of drip irrigation in 2017 and 2018 showed a significant difference between t2 and t1 treatments table 5 minimum grain yield among the drip irrigation treatments for 2017 and 2018 related to the t2 treatment with 6584 and 6154 kg ha 1 respectively and the maximum grain yield was related to the t1 treatment with 7456 and 7429 kg ha 1 respectively this result reveals that in conditions where the drip tape spacing is 75 cm planting a row of wheat along the centerline in between two drip tapes fig 1b decreases planting density near the drip tapes compared to the t1 treatment fig 1a and increases planting density along the center line in between two drip tapes the row planted in the middle has a lower probability of using soil moisture and subsequently a lower probability of using soil nutrients which leads to reduced grain yield in this row and the subsequent reduction of total yield in the t2 treatment it is noteworthy that planting density per square meter was the same in all treatments i e 450 per meter square therefore the number of seeds used in cultivating the t1 treatment was the same as the t2 treatment but these seeds were located near the drip tape and had a higher chance of using soil moisture and nutrients which eventually led to increased grain yield in the t1 treatment similar results mentioned for the 75 cm drip tape spacing in t1 and t2 treatments also exist for the 60 cm drip tape spacing in the t3 and t4 treatments table 5 the study results of lv et al 2019 have also shown that the rows planted in the middle of the two drip tapes receive less moisture which reduces root activity and root exudates and this increases wheat grain yield in the investigated treatments thus confirming the results of the present study the results of fischer et al 2019 showed that wheat grain yield wasn t sensitive to planting density but was sensitive to row spacing as previously mentioned in both experimental years the t1 treatment had higher grain yield than the t3 t4 and t5 treatments but in both experimental years the t2 treatment had a lower yield than the t3 t4 and t5 treatments table 5 this result indicates that although by increasing drip tape spacing from 60 to 75 cm grain yield is expected to decrease due to reduced moisture reception along the center line in between two drip tapes chen et al 2015 lv et al 2019 yan et al 2016 but by selecting an optimal planting pattern such as the t1 treatment can increase grain yield therefore by increasing the distance between the drip tapes and selecting an appropriate planting pattern the yield will increase and expenses will also be lowered due to using less drip tape tubes the study results of liu et al 2016 revealed that 15 cm row spacing in wheat clearly led to maximum yield 6 9 ton ha 1 whereas by increasing row spacing to 25 and 35 cm grain yield reduced by 14 and 18 respectively also by decreasing row spacing to 5 cm grain yield reduced by 20 it is noteworthy that their study also involved a fixed plant density of 360 per square meter they attributed the reduced wheat grain yield caused by increasing row spacing from 15 cm to low photosynthetic coverage along with lower photosynthesis active radiation increased row spacing drastically increases the light transmission ratio thus improving the lighting conditions of the canopy however the excessive loss of light leaks in 25 35 cm spacing treatments was not optimal for enhancing the efficiency of radiant energy 3 3 1000 kernel weight according to table 4 the experimental years significantly affected the 1000 kernel weight table 4 results indicate that the average weight of 1000 wheat kernels in all studied irrigation methods was higher in 2017 at 43 8 g than in 2018 at 42 6 g which as previously mentioned could be due to the better climatic conditions for wheat growth and higher consumption of irrigation water in 2017 compared to 2018 the statistical analysis depicted in table 5 shows that the effect of various treatments on 1000 kernel weight of wheat was significant in 2017 and 2018 at probability levels of 5 and 1 p 0 05 and p 0 01 respectively in 2017 the 1000 kernel weight of wheat in the t3 treatment was significantly different from f and t2 treatments at a 5 probability level but the 1000 kernel weight difference was non significant among other investigated treatments table 5 the study results of 2017 have shown that the maximum and minimum 1000 kernel weight is that of the t3 and t2 treatments at 46 13 g and 41 86 g respectively 1000 kernel weight of the f treatment was 42 06 g with a non significant difference from the t2 treatment therefore study results indicate that applying the t3 treatment has significantly increased 1000 kernel weight by about 10 as compared to the f treatment moreover the difference between 1000 kernel weight in the t1 treatment 44 93 g and the t3 treatment that had the highest value of 1000 kernel weight 46 13 g was non significant thus applying the t1 treatment significantly increased the 1000 kernel weight by about 7 as compared to the f treatment in 2018 the 1000 kernel weight of the t1 treatment was significantly different from that of the f treatment at a probability level of 1 p 0 01 and there was also a significant difference between the t1 treatment with the t3 and t2 treatments regarding 1000 kernel weight the maximum and minimum 1000 kernel weight in 2018 was that of the t1 and t3 treatments at 43 64 and 41 38 g respectively 1000 kernel weight in the f treatment was 42 16 g the value of which was non significantly different from that of the t3 treatment with the lowest value of 1000 kernel weight table 5 in 2018 applying the t1 treatment significantly increased the 1000 kernel weight at about 3 5 as compared to the f treatment therefore drip irrigation with the pattern of four planting rows and 15 cm row spacing on both sides of the tape and 75 cm spacing between drip tapes t1 resulted in an average 5 25 increase in 1000 kernel weight of wheat compared to furrow irrigation f this is due to the more even distribution of water and the higher capacity of the root in using soil moisture and nutrients through drip irrigation with less spacing between cultivated rows from the drip tapes lv et al 2019 in comparison to furrow irrigation which has resulted in increased 1000 kernel weight of the t1 treatment the research of lv et al 2010 has shown that under drip irrigation the main region of root distribution moves upward in comparison to surface irrigation thus changing the root distribution pattern in the soil profile considering the optimal soil moisture and higher root density in the surface layer of soil under drip irrigation treatment the main region of water absorption is focused in the upper layer of the soil but in surface irrigation the main absorption region of the root moves further down due to water deficiency in the upper layers of the soil therefore this difference in amount and pattern of water absorption through the root results in the variations of wheat yield overall the comparison of means during 2017 and 2018 shows that the t1 treatment had the highest 1000 kernel weight however the 1000 kernel weight of the t1 treatment in 2017 was non significant compared to the t3 treatment that had the highest value of 1000 kernel weight table 5 therefore the t1 treatment is preferred to the other treatments in order to achieve the highest level of 1000 kernel weight the comparison of means for 1000 kernel weight in wheat among the drip irrigation treatments in 2017 showed that the lowest value of 1000 kernel weight was that of the t2 treatment at 41 86 g and the highest value was that of the t3 treatment with 46 13 g the t2 was significantly different from the t3 treatment but its difference with the t1 treatment was not significant table 5 in 2017 changing the planting pattern of the wheat rows with equal drip tape spacing of 60 cm i e t3 t4 and t5 treatments didn t have a significant effect on wheat s 1000 kernel weight this result is also true for the treatments with equal drip tape spacing of 75 cm i e t1 and t2 in 2017 the 1000 kernel weight was also not significantly different among these two treatments the comparison of means for 1000 kernel weight among drip irrigation treatments in 2018 showed that the lowest value of 1000 kernel weight was that of the t3 treatment at 41 38 g and its highest value is that of thet1 treatment at 43 64 g the t1 treatment was significantly different from the t2 and t3 treatments whereas its difference with the t4 and t5 treatments was non significant table 5 in 2018 changing the planting pattern of wheat rows with equal 60 cm drip tape spacing i e the t3 t4 and t5 treatments had a significant effect on the 1000 kernel weight of wheat such that the t3 treatment had the lowest value of 1000 kernel weight in wheat in the t3 treatment the middle row of cultivated wheat is located at a 30 cm distance fig 1c from the drip tape but in the t4 treatment the two middle cultivated rows are located a 22 5 cm distance fig 1d and in the t5 treatment both cultivated rows are located at a 15 cm distance fig 1e from the drip tape this reduction of row spacing in wheat compared to the drip irrigation increases the possibility of accessing soil moisture and nutrients through the root and therefore increases the 1000 kernel weight by 0 8 and 4 06 in the t5 treatment as compared to the t4 and t3 treatments respectively and also led to a 3 24 increase of the t4 treatment as compared to the t3 treatment this result is also true for the treatments with equal 75 cm drip tape spacing i e the t1 and t2 treatments in 2018 these two treatments also had a significant effect on the 1000 kernel weight of wheat such that the t2 treatment with 42 65 g had lower 1000 kernel weight compared to the t1 treatment at 43 64 g in the t2 treatment the two middle cultivated rows of wheat were located at a 27 5 cm distance fig 1b from the drip tape and in the t1 treatment both middle cultivated rows of wheat were located at a 22 5 cm distance fig 1a from the drip tape in this case reducing the distance between wheat rows and drip tapes also increased the possibility of accessing soil moisture and nutrients through the root and therefore increased the 1000 kernel weight in the t1 treatment by 2 32 compared to the t2 treatment this increased 1000 kernel weight led to greater grain yield which is consistent with the results of li et al 2019 3 4 number of ears according to the results of table 4 the experimental years had a non significant effect on the number of ears therefore evaluation of the effect of wheat planting patterns in drip and furrow irrigation methods on the number of ears are presented in fig 3 as a two year average of the treatments and further discussed furthermore the effects of the evaluated treatments in 2017 and 2018 have also been separately presented in table 5 the results of table 3 indicate that the maximum and minimum two year average number of ears belong to the t4 and f treatments at 666 and 481 ears m 2 respectively in other words implementing the t4 treatment has significantly increased the number of ears per square meter by 38 compared to the f treatment this may be due to the high level of irrigation efficiency the more even distribution of water and the improved capacity of the root in using the moisture and nutrient of the soil in drip irrigation as compared to furrow irrigation however the number of ears in the t4 treatment was also significantly high compared to the other drip irrigation treatments such that the t4 treatment had 18 18 3 15 and 7 more ears per square meter compared to the t1 t2 t3 and t5 treatments respectively the movement of nutrient elements is usually dependent on the behavior of the soil water status li et al 2004 increasing the lateral spacing of two drip tapes leads to the reduction of supply water in major parts of the soil in between two drip tubes which leads to the reduction of wheat growth and yield in further distances from the drip tubes chen et al 2015 the research of lv et al 2019 also shows that increasing the distance between drip irrigation laterals from 60 cm to 75 cm and then to 90 cm decreased the number of ears of wheat from 488 to 470 and 468 ears m 2 respectively in the first year of research and from 526 to 506 and 497ears m 2 respectively in the second year of research therefore the study results of lv et al 2019 also confirm the results of the present study however the higher number of ears in the t4 treatment compared to the t3 and t5 treatments all three treatments with equal drip tape spacing of 60 cm could be the result of a more even distribution of wheat bushes in the area between two drip tapes in the t4 treatment which gives plants greater possibility to benefit from light nutrients and moisture due to less competition between wheat bushes in the t3 and t5 treatments wheat bush density around two drip tapes is higher than that of the t4 treatment and this leads to increased competition between wheat bushes in absorbing light nutrients and soil moisture it is noteworthy that planting density per square meter was identical in all treatments 450 m 2 therefore the same number of seeds used for cultivating the t4 treatment was used in thet3 and t5 treatments however the mentioned amount of seeds in the t3 and t5 treatment was located near the drip tapes and the competition between wheat bushes for the absorption of soil moisture and nutrients increased leading to a reduction in the number of ears of wheat in these two treatments in comparison to the t4 treatment 3 5 irrigation water productivity wpi according to the results of table 4 the experimental years had a significant effect on irrigation water productivity the results of table 4 show that the average value of irrigation water productivity in all studied irrigation methods was higher in 2018 at 1 83 kg m 3 than in 2017 at 1 40 kg m 3 which is due to the less consumption of irrigation water in 2018 4237 m3 compared to 2017 5816 m3 the statistical analysis presented in table 5 indicates that in 2017 and 2018 the effect of various treatments on irrigation water productivity was significant at a probability level of 1 p 0 01 in 2017 irrigation water productivity in the t1 treatment was significantly different from the f and t2 treatments at a probability level of 1 but the difference between irrigation water productivity in the t1 treatment and the other evaluated treatments was non significant table 5 the study results of 2017 have revealed that the maximum and minimum levels of irrigation water productivity belonged to the t1 treatment at 1 59 kg m 3 and the f treatment at 0 9 kg m 3 the results of the present study indicate that implementing the t1 treatment significantly increases irrigation water productivity at about 77 as compared to the f treatment in 2018 irrigation water productivity in the t1 treatment was significantly different from the f treatment at a 1 probability level p 0 01 and the t1 treatment was also significantly different from the t2 t3 and t5 treatments regarding irrigation water productivity the maximum and minimum levels of irrigation water productivity in 2018 belonged to the t1 and f treatments at about 2 22 and 1 13 kg m 3 respectively table 5 in 2018 implementing the t1 treatment significantly increased irrigation water productivity by approximately 96 as compared to the f treatment therefore the results obtained from two years of experiment showed that drip irrigation involving 4 cultivated rows with 15 cm spacing on both sides of the drip tape and 75 cm spacing between drip tapes t1 increased irrigation water productivity by an average rate of 86 5 compared to furrow irrigation f this result is due to reduced applied irrigation water and increased grain yield in the t1 drip irrigation treatment 4026 m3 and 7443 kg ha 1 respectively compared to furrow irrigation 6028 m3 and 5996 kg ha 1 respectively which has led to greater irrigation water productivity in the t1 treatment tables 3 and 5 the study results of kharrou et al 2011 were consistent with the results of the present study the research conducted by chouhan et al 2015 also showed that compared to basin irrigation implementing a drip irrigation method increases irrigation water productivity in wheat by 24 24 the study results of bai et al 2020 in north china plain showed that applying a drip irrigation system led to a 10 5 increase in water productivity compared to surface irrigation overall the comparison of means in 2017 and 2018 showed that the t1 treatment had the highest level of irrigation water productivity table 5 therefore implementing the t1 treatment is preferred to other treatments in order to achieve maximum irrigation water productivity furthermore the comparison of means of irrigation water productivity for drip irrigation treatments in 2017 and 2018 showed a significant difference between the t1 and t2 treatments table 5 maximum irrigation water productivity among all drip irrigation treatments in 2017 and 2018 was that of the t1 treatment at 1 59 and 2 22 kg m 3 respectively and the minimum value was that of the t2 treatment at 1 40 and 1 84 kg m 3 respectively as previously discussed in the grain yield section this result indicates that in the conditions of 75 cm drip tape spacing planting a row of wheat along the center line in between two drip tapes fig 1b decreases planting density near the drip tapes as compared to the t1 treatment fig 1a and increases planting density along the center line in between two drip tapes the row planted along the center line has a lower chance of using the moisture lv et al 2019 and thus a lower chance of benefiting from soil nutrients which in turn results in reduced grain yield in the center row and the consequent reduction of total yield in the t2 treatment therefore considering that the amount of applied irrigation water was identical in the drip irrigation treatments this reduced grain yield in the t2 treatment caused an 11 9 and 17 1 decline in water productivity in 2017 and 2018 respectively as compared to the t1 treatment similar results mentioned for the treatments with 75 cm drip tape spacing t1 and t2 also apply to the treatments with 60 cm drip tape spacing between the t3 and t4 treatments table 5 such that in the t4 treatment the two center rows are located 22 5 cm fig 1d from the drip tape but in the t3 treatment the center row is located 30 cm fig 1c from the drip tape compared to the t3 treatment the small spacing between the two cultivated rows in the t4 treatment increased the chance of accessing moisture through the root and therefore increased grain yield eventually leading to greater water productivity in the t4 treatment as compared to the t3 treatment the study results of lv et al 2019 and chen et al 2015 also showed that by increasing drip tape spacing the rows planted along the centerline in between two drip tapes receive less moisture which leads to grain yield reduction and reduced water use efficiency in wheat which confirm the results of the present study 3 6 productivity of irrigation water plus effective precipitation wpi pe according to the results of table 4 the experimental years significantly affected the wpi pe table 4 results indicate that the average value of the wpi pe in all studied irrigation methods was higher in 2018 at 1 15 kg m 3 than in 2017 at 1 02 kg m 3 which is due to less consumption of the sum of irrigation water and effective precipitation in 2018 4446 m3 compared to 2017 5997 m3 the statistical analysis presented in table 5 indicates that the effect of various treatments on the wpi pe in 2017 and 2018 was significant at a probability level of 1 p 0 01 in 2017 the wpi pe in the t1 treatment was significantly different from the f and t2 treatments at a 1 probability level but its difference with the other evaluated treatments was non significant table 5 the study results of 2017 showed that the maximum and minimum levels of the wpi pe belonged to the t1 treatment at 1 14 kg m 3 and the f treatment at 0 71 kg m 3 the results of the present study indicate that in 2017 implementing the t1 treatment significantly increased the wpi pe by about 61 as compared to the f treatment in 2018 the wpi pe in the t1 treatment was significantly different from the f treatment at a 1 probability level p 0 01 and the t1 treatment was also significantly different from the t2 t3 and t5 treatments regarding the wpi pe the maximum and minimum levels of the wpi pe in 2018 belonged to the t1 and f treatments at about 1 36 and 0 8 kg m 3 respectively table 5 in 2018 implementing the t1 treatment significantly increased the wpi pe by approximately 70 as compared to the f treatment therefore the results obtained from two year experiments showed that drip irrigation involving 4 cultivated rows with 15 cm spacing on both sides of the drip tape and 75 cm spacing between drip tapes t1 increased the wpi pe by an average rate of 65 5 compared to furrow irrigation f this result is due to the reduced sum of irrigation and effective precipitation water and increased grain yield in the t1 drip irrigation treatment 4221 m3 and 7443 kg ha 1 respectively compared to furrow irrigation 6223 m3 and 5996 kg ha 1 respectively which has led to greater wpi pe in the t1 treatment tables 3 and 5 overall the comparison of means in 2017 and 2018 showed that the t1 treatment had the highest level of wpi pe table 5 therefore implementing the t1 treatment is preferred to other treatments in order to achieve maximum wpi pe furthermore the comparison of means for the wpi pe for drip irrigation treatments in 2017 and 2018 showed a significant difference between the t1 and t2 treatments table 5 the maximum sum of wpi pe among all drip irrigation treatments in 2017 and 2018 was that of the t1 treatment at 1 14 and 1 36 kg m 3 respectively and the minimum value was that of the t2 treatment at 1 01 and 1 13 kg m 3 respectively as previously discussed in the irrigation water productivity section this result indicates that in the conditions of 75 cm drip tape spacing planting a row of wheat along the centerline in between two drip tapes fig 1b decreases planting density near the drip tapes as compared to the t1 treatment fig 1a and increases planting density along the centerline in between two drip tapes the row planted along the centerline has a lower chance of using the moisture lv et al 2019 and thus a lower chance of benefiting from soil nutrients which results in reduced grain yield in the center row and the consequent reduction of total yield in the t2 treatment therefore considering that the value for the sum of irrigation and effective precipitation water was identical in the drip irrigation treatments this reduced grain yield in the t2 treatment caused an 11 4 and 16 9 decline in the wpi pe in 2017 and 2018 respectively as compared to the t1 treatment similar results mentioned for the treatments with 75 cm drip tape spacing t1 and t2 also apply to the treatments with 60 cm drip tape spacing between the t3 and t4 treatments table 5 as mentioned in the irrigation water productivity section in the t4 treatment the two center rows are located 22 5 cm fig 1d from the drip tape but in the t3 treatment the center row is located 30 cm fig 1c from the drip tape compared to the t3 treatment the small spacing between the two cultivated rows in the t4 treatment increased the chance of accessing moisture through the root and therefore increased grain yield eventually leading to a greater wpi pe in the t4 treatment as compared to the t3 treatment 3 7 economic benefit the economic benefits of different wheat irrigation treatments are presented in table 6 t1 treatment showed the highest economic benefit among the six treatments because of the lower drip tape cost and depreciation cost of t1 than t3 t4 and t5 in addition to the lower applied water cost of t1 as compared to f there was also a higher income rate as a result of higher grain yield and larger straw biomass in t1 than in f t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments table 6 it is of note that the soil preparation seed and planting caring and harvesting cost were similar in all the irrigation treatments the results showed that by changing the irrigation system from furrow to drip type the amount of yield and subsequent economic benefits can be increased in a drip irrigation system the costs are reduced by increasing the distance between the drip tapes however yield might be reduced therefore in order to prevent such an issue the planting rows should be located at a shorter distance from the drip tape to have a greater yield and economic benefit nonetheless further experiments are needed to optimize the distance between the drip tape and the row planting pattern of wheat for more water conservation and benefits 4 conclusions the results of the present study indicate that compared to furrow irrigation implementing a drip irrigation system in a sandy clay loam soil in wheat crops has resulted in a 72 increase in irrigation water productivity with approximately a 33 reduction in applied irrigation water moreover when implementing drip irrigation for wheat crops the selecting of an appropriate wheat row spacing layout between drip irrigation tapes taking an increase in the distance of drip irrigation tapes into account will increase the yield while reducing the costs as a result of a decrease in the number of drip tape tubes thus under such experimental conditions when implementing drip irrigation for wheat crops in sandy clay loam soil using a 75 cm drip tape spacing with 4 cultivated rows of 15 cm spacing on both sides of each drip tape is recommended declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

10099,over 90 of swedish agriculture is rainfed and thus future climate change can pose a risk to agricultural production in coming decades an overall increase in annual precipitation is predicted for northern europe but sweden could still face an increasing need for irrigation as shown by the drought summer of 2018 adaptation of swedish agriculture to include irrigated agriculture should thus be considered to evaluate the theoretical need for irrigation calculations were performed for different locations in sweden and for different soil crop pairs at each location in situ weather data from a projected climate dataset created by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute were used to evaluate changes in irrigation need over the period 1981 2050 the results showed an increasing need for irrigation of cereal crops during the early season may june for two main reasons i a shift to an earlier start of the cropping period leading to an earlier need for irrigation and ii a higher probability of dry spring weather substantially increasing the irrigation requirement in dry years crops for which the growing season starts later e g potatoes showed an increasing need for irrigation during july crop development stages were predicted to occur earlier leading to earlier harvesting reducing the irrigation requirement in august however the calculation approach developed for this study may have underestimated the need for irrigation which could be higher than reported here 1 introduction the occurrence of global climate change and its predicted continuation over the coming century are now largely accepted cook et al 2016 this global climate imbalance will have impacts on atmospheric components affecting e g temperature and precipitation patterns kovats et al 2014 putnam and broecker 2017 stagge et al 2015 vautard et al 2013 this will have a direct impact on human societies because changes in temperature and precipitation can cause substantial changes to the terrestrial water cycle grusson et al 2018 hartmann et al 2013 held and soden 2006 jiménez cisneros et al 2014 for instance such changes have been shown to affect evapotranspiration demand cook et al 2014 mccabe and wolock 2015 mishra et al 2017 and soil water content destouni and verrot 2014 verrot and destouni 2016 alterations in hydrological variables can also affect agriculture and food production posing risks to this strategic economic sector adaptation of agricultural practices and mitigation of climate change impacts to secure food production is a major concern for stakeholders and scientists on a global scale it has been shown that climate change can disrupt the cropping calendar destroy harvests or trigger soil erosion savo et al 2016 placing food production systems under pressure tripathi et al 2016 these potential impacts should be carefully investigated regionally and locally in order to adapt practices and polices efficiently in northern europe the drought summer of 2018 provided an example of the vulnerability of agricultural systems jrc 2018 for example sweden experienced cereal yield reductions of up to 50 and livestock numbers were reduced due to lack of affordable fodder and feed statistiska meddelanden 2018 in the scandinavian region average precipitation amounts and temperatures are predicted to increase over the coming century jacob et al 2014 strandberg et al 2015 beyond those average variations the distribution of precipitation throughout the year and the pattern of precipitation within each month could change with impacts on the balance between rainfall and evapotranspiration and therefore on water management for agriculture an early study by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi estimated that the increase in precipitation in northern europe foreseen in global projections might be concentrated mainly in autumn and winter while spring and summer could face decreases in precipitation rummukainen et al 2004 in sweden the vast majority of agricultural production is rainfed and there is a lack of data on irrigation because it has not been a major research focus in the past depending on sources and years only 1 7 eurostat 2016 to 3 8 windfäll et al 2010 of swedish arable land is irrigated most of the water used for irrigation is consumed in southern counties of sweden statistics sweden 2015 but future changes in rainfall pattern could have serious implications for food production and agricultural practices substantial loss of agricultural production due to drought could be avoided by the use of supplementary irrigation however very few studies have investigated the implications of climate change for soil water balance and irrigation practices in sweden despite the fact that systemic adaptation of nordic agriculture appears inevitable juhola et al 2017 in a review on the topic wiréhn 2018 located only 35 peer reviewed papers exploring the impact of climate change on nordic agriculture and found that most of those papers focused on crop phenology and life cycle eckersten et al 2012 kristensen et al 2011 olesen 2005 ozturk et al 2017 pulatov et al 2015 or on system vulnerability juhola et al 2017 kvalvik et al 2011 very few studies have examined the soil water relationship or the impact of climate change on agro hydrological systems the only published paper on irrigation and water circulation in swedish agricultural production focused on the previous drought summer of 2013 and noted the benefit that irrigation could bring in drought management in sweden campana et al 2018 a swedish government report pointed out the vulnerability of the swedish agricultural system to dry years in the period 1965 2014 when most years with low yield were associated with above average dry or wet periods de toro et al 2015 the few previous studies highlighting the vulnerability of swedish agriculture to changes in temperature and precipitation did not quantify the future change in terms of irrigation need induced by water deficits considering the severity of the 2018 drought it is crucial to determine whether summer droughts will become more frequent in sweden and whether the need for irrigation will increase substantially in the coming century the aim of the present study was thus to assess the future need for irrigation at different agriculture dominated locations in sweden using simple modeling of rain deficit irrigation need at each selected location the rain deficit and the theoretical need for irrigation were calculated for a past and a future period for several crops and for several types of soil in order to assess whether i the projected increase in precipitation will compensate for the increase of temperature and ii the current rainfed model in swedish agriculture is resilient to projected climate change 2 materials and methods seven different locations in sweden were selected for the study encompassing different climate regions throughout the country fig 1 differences in agricultural production in the selected counties are described in detail in supplementary materials table s1 for each location two 30 year periods were considered a recent past period 1989 2018 for which calculations were performed based on observed weather data and a future period 2021 2050 for which climate projections were used at each location the rain deficit and the potential irrigation requirement in the past and future periods were compared 2 1 rain deficit and potential irrigation need in the first step of the analysis daily potential rain deficit was calculated for each location using the formula 1 rd day r day pet day where rd day is rain deficit on a particular day r day is rainfall on that day and pet day is potential evapotranspiration on that day potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated using the hargreaves formula hargreaves and samani 1985 based on temperature and latitude the choice of this method was driven by limited availability of climate parameters within the projected dataset which includes only temperature and precipitation following rain deficit calculation for each day of the growing season the irrigation need for different crops and different soils was calculated at each location in this calculation the soil was considered a homogenous reservoir from which crops could take up water to supply evapotranspiration for each crop a development schedule was devised based on a fixed number of days for each crop development stage and a daily crop factor kc the development schedule of each crop is described in fig s1 in supplementary materials the starting date of the cropping period changes between years based on climate conditions in the calculations in the present study the starting date for crop development was constrained by a minimum date and a minimum daily average temperature over 7 days from the minimum date in each year the average temperature on each day in the previous seven day period had to be higher than the defined minimum temperature if this temperature condition was fulfilled the crop was assumed to start developing if at least one of the days had an average temperature lower than the threshold the starting growing date was considered to be the subsequent day and the temperature threshold verification operation was repeated when the seven previous days had a temperature higher than the minimum threshold temperature the crop was assumed to start growing and daily actual evapotranspiration was calculated the starting date for crop growth was also recorded and saved for every year in order to monitor possible changes induced by the future climate from the starting date of crop development daily evapotranspiration et volume was calculated based on the hargreaves equation and a daily crop factor kc 2 et day pet day k c soil water content swc for the day was then calculated as 3 swc day swc day 1 et day r day if the soil water content of the day reached the available water capacity awc the remaining rainfall on the day was considered to be lost through runoff and was not taken into consideration the point at which the crop was under hydric stress and thus required irrigation was determined by a threshold expressed as fraction α of the awc at which the crop was considered unable to take up water from the soil at a rate sufficient to support optimum evapotranspiration if the soil water content fell below this threshold irrigation was assumed to be performed during the day if 4 swc day awc α then 5 swc adj day swc day irrigation day the volume of irrigation applied to adjust adj soil water content was taken to be the volume necessary to increase the soil water content up to the soil water threshold level 6 irrigation day awc α swc day irrigation was assumed to be performed when needed throughout the cropping season up to a plant development stage at which irrigation was stopped regardless of hydrological conditions see section 2 2 and table 1 the equations described above were implemented automatically using a specially designed matlab code the overall procedure is schematized in fig 2 the different parameters affecting the calculation minimum date minimum temperature awc and α factor are described in section 2 2 the volume of water used for irrigation was recorded and was taken as the theoretical volume of irrigation needed to maintain the soil in perfect hydric conditions for crop development 2 2 data and parameters 2 2 1 crops and soils the calculation procedure described above was performed for four different crops winter cereal spring cereal grass ley and potatoes as shown in table s2 in supplementary materials the four types of crops selected for this study are the main crops cultivated in the different locations each crop has a particular development schedule and associated daily crop factor kc in each year the starting development date based on temperature was determined using a minimum temperature for crop development based on published data allen et al 1998 peña 2002 tribouillois et al 2016 or taken from the fao database http www fao org land water databases and software crop information en the daily crop factor kc associated with each crop was calculated from the equation proposed by allen et al 1998 the length of development stages for each crop were based on allen et al 1998 and the fao database all crop parameters were adapted for swedish conditions through author knowledge and through careful examination of the germination dates and harvesting dates resulting from the calculation method section 2 1 for the past 30 year period in the development schedule a specific day was set at which no more irrigation was performed because the crop had reached maturity and needed to dry before harvesting crop development parameters can be found in table 1 and more details of each crop development period and associated kc value are provided in fig s1 in supplementary materials four soil types categorized in the official swedish agricultural soil classification based on clay content eriksson 1999 were considered for the four selected crops in soil type selection the crops were associated with soils on which they are commonly cultivated the soil types were medium clay soil mcs mellanlera in swedish classification light clay soil lcs lättlera in the swedish classification clayey sandy soil css lerig sand in the swedish classification and slightly clayey sandy soil scss svagt lerig sand in the swedish classification each crop was associated with two different soils as shown in table 2 hydrological parameters associated with each soil table 3 were derived from several soil characterizations performed at the swedish university of agricultural sciences slu over recent decades the awc of each soil was calculated assuming the maximum root depth of the crop in that soil type the soil crop combinations assessed in this study can been seen as a theoretical and simplified representation of agricultural systems commonly found in southern sweden 2 2 2 climate data to perform the calculation for the past period 1989 2018 a dataset from in situ smhi stations was obtained for each location the stations considered for each of the seven locations included in the analysis are shown in table s2 in supplementary materials another set of data from smhi were used in calculations for the future period 2021 2050 for two different scenarios representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 this dataset is based on different global circulation models gcm from the euro cordex project jacob et al 2014 the smhi regional climate model rca4 was used to downscale the different gcm for northern europe to produce a dataset comprising five climate models for each scenario a bias correction step has been performed by smhi this dataset is projected on a 5 km grid and corrected against mesan reanalysis häggmark et al 2000 using the distribution based scaling dbs method yang et al 2010 for each location the closest point in the grid to the smhi station supplying the past weather dataset was selected table 4 lists the models used 2 3 analysis and kolmogorov smirnov ks statistical test an overall assessment of the variation in the projected climate parameters precipitation and temperature was first performed in order to evaluate the intrinsic distribution of the model ensemble the change in three hydro agronomical variables rain deficit irrigation need yearly starting date of crop development between the past period 1989 2018 and the future period 2021 2050 was then calculated for irrigation need the change was investigated by comparing the overall 30 year periods but also by comparing highest irrigation need higher quartile in each distribution for each of those variables kolmogorov smirnov statistical hypothesis testing was performed using the inbuilt matlab function kstest2 to assess the significance of the change between past and future periods the kolmogorov smirnov test is a non parametric test used to challenge the equality and continuity of two distributions smirnov 1939 being non parametric it can be used with freely distributed samples of reduced size the test involves comparing the distance between the cumulative distribution functions cdf of two distributions and enables comparison of the overall distributions instead of a central value the kolmogorov smirnov test was used here for the rain deficit balance and for the volume of irrigation applied for each crop soil combination tested a trend was considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 climate ensemble in order to identify triggers of change in the hydro agrological variable analyzed but also to evaluate the dispersion of the climate ensemble the future changes projected for the temperature and precipitation variables were first mapped for each location fig 3 the maximum and minimum daily temperature were considered separately and both were found to increase overall between the past and future periods the only noteworthy exception was for model 1 cnrm cerfacs cnrm cm5 smhi rca4 which gave a decrease in maximum temperature for both scenarios and for all locations from may to september for the minimum temperature model 1 did not give a negative trend but produced a visibly lower positive trend than most other models in the ensemble the average of the ensemble was positive for all locations all months and both scenarios rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 regarding the temporal re partition of temperature change june and july showed a slightly lower increasing trend in maximum temperature than other months with presence of several null or negative values for both scenarios it is interesting to note that the trend was similar for all locations except östergötland which showed a higher increasing trend in minimum temperature than the other locations regarding precipitation the ensemble seemed to produce more homogenous results than for temperature with no model giving a dissimilar trend from the rest of the ensemble however a temporal pattern emerged whereby if a global increase of precipitation was given by the ensemble this increase appear more pronounced during the early months of the cropping season april may while august was clearly impacted by a decrease in precipitation and september by a very limited increasing trend in precipitation in some few cases the models gave a very high increase of precipitation 60 but the ensemble average always showed a variation of 15 3 2 rain deficit the change in rain deficit between the past and future periods calculated from the difference in daily rainfall and potential evapotranspiration eq 1 is presented in fig 4 where a positive value reflects an increase in rain compared with etp i e a decrease in the rain deficit the difference observed between rainfall and evapotranspirative demand indicated that the rain deficit tend to decrease in the future period compared with the past period however a temporal pattern was detected fig 4 where august seemed to be the only month in the cropping season with negative values indicating an increasing rain deficit this increase can be directly related to the decrease in precipitation projected by the ensemble for august while the temperature was projected to increase and thereby the potential evapotranspiration see fig 3 some models also gave an increasing rain deficit during july but to a more limited extent than in august and positive variations appeared to be more significant than negative variations when comparing the different locations spatial homogeneity was observed for all sites except uppland for which a markedly higher number of climate models gave an increase in the rain deficit independently of the location the month or the scenario the ensemble average columns e in fig 4 showed very little variation as seen in the lower part of fig 4 the clustered distribution of the rain deficit over the entire cropping season showed little more significant variation than the monthly comparisons above this is remarkable when considering the ensemble averages which showed a significant decreasing trend in rain deficit for four locations östergötland gotland halland and skåne 3 3 irrigation needs the changes in irrigation need between the past and future periods calculated using the procedure shown in fig 2 reflected a double dichotomy spatial and temporal fig 5 from a spatial point of view some locations västergötland halland skåne seemed to be characterized by a decrease in irrigation need with a dominance of green color in fig 5 this was consistent with the significant decreasing trend in rain deficit over the cropping season observed at these locations section 3 2 on the other hand sites such as uppland gotland and småland showed a more balanced pattern between increased and decreased irrigation need at all locations the pattern seemed to be rather similar for the same crop grown on different soils a temporal pattern was apparent with an increase in irrigation need during the early cropping season may june and a decreasing trend in july and to a lesser extent in august this pattern was very clear for both cereal types studied winter spring and to a lesser extent for grass ley for potatoes more models indicated a later impact in the season with increasing irrigation need during july and august beyond these regional and temporal patterns very few variations were noted for the different climate models in order to identify the driest years in which irrigation is most necessary for the production the analysis of changes between the two periods was repeated using the higher quartile of each distribution which represented the years in which irrigation demand was highest fig 6 the findings of this second analysis reinforced those of the previous analysis and emphasized the temporal dichotomy with the future need for irrigation increasing in the first part of the cropping season on analyzing the highest quartile this trend emerged also for locations where it was not evident when considering the entire distribution such as östergötland västergötland halland and skåne however at those locations the early season increase was observed mainly for cereals winter and spring and not as much for grass ley or potato crops the change was sharper for the locations where this temporal dichotomy was already visible for the entire distribution the strong significance of the changes detected using the highest quartile of the distribution indicate the possibility of more intense extremes and their impact in increasing the overall need for irrigation during the first part of the season 3 4 date of crop development the average date at which crop development started was also investigated to see whether a future temperature increase induced a change in the starting date of crop development the results clearly showed an earlier starting date of crop development during 2021 2050 compared with 1989 2018 fig 7 this was particularly apparent for winter cereal with a shift forward of between 10 and 20 days in the growing season followed by spring cereal and grass ley for which a forward shift of 5 10 days was seen the potato season seemed to be much less impacted probably because of the later starting date for this crop 8 may by which time the minimum temperature was often already reached even in the past period 1989 2018 4 discussion a simple modeling scheme was applied to investigate how future climate change may affect the water deficit and irrigation need for different crops on different soils at different locations in sweden the climate variations projected by the model ensemble used in this study were consistent with those in other analyses for sweden for instance eklund et al 2015 used nine climate models and found an average change in summer rainfall of 8 28 with the highest increase being around 50 and a change in summer temperature of between 0 and 3 c with an ensemble average of 1 2 c depending on the scenario and period considered similar ranges have been reported by olsson et al 2016 for southern sweden i e the skåne site in this study e g an ensemble change in yearly precipitation of 6 5 13 5 depending on period with minimum and maximum values ranging from 35 9 to 25 2 the good consistency between previous studies and the present study is understandable considering that all were based on the same gcms from the euro cordex program they differed mainly in regionalization downscaling processes and the scale of the analysis the model ensemble used in this study gave projections in the same range as other similar ensembles despite the use of only one regional climate model rcm the calculation procedure developed in this study was inspired by the simple fao 56 allen et al 1998 calculation method for evapotranspiration that simple method has limitations but is still widely used to compute evapotranspiration and the input output balance of soil water content pereira et al 2015 using algorithms very similar to that developed in this study e g battude et al 2017 the approach developed here allowed us to build a tool which can be easily modified transferred to other locations and used with different crops and soils unlike other more complex irrigation modeling tools which are far more demanding in terms of input data and implementation time valipour et al 2015 however as in any attempt of hydrological modeling simplification of processes had to be performed the most important simplifications in the present study were the absence of water loss by direct evaporation from interception and surface runoff before infiltration these simplifications meant that soil recharge was considered perfect i e all water applied to the fields precipitation and irrigation was assumed to recharge the soil reservoir in reality a part of this water does not reach the ground for infiltration this simplification may have led to underestimation of the irrigation volume needed other important simplifications in the calculations concerned the fixed volume of soil considered and the available water capacity accessible to the plant the accessible soil volume was set considering the maximum rooting depth but in reality access increases as the roots grow during the early season even if some water is available deeper in the soil layers the undeveloped roots would normally not be able to access this water which would lead to a need for more frequent irrigation and a higher volume of water applied again this approximation may have led to underestimation of the irrigation volume needed the formulae and calculations presented in this study aimed more to investigate the relative variation in water deficit and the theoretical volume of irrigation needed to maintain perfect hydric conditions in the field it is important to bear in mind that the bias regarding irrigation operations induced by the simplifications was the same over the past period and the future period allowing comparison of the changes between the two periods notwithstanding those limitations some interesting results were obtained in the study during the first part of the cropping season may june rainfall amount appeared to increase but the rain deficit was found to be relatively stable despite this stability a slight increase in irrigation need was found for this period the crops with the greatest increase in irrigation need cereals were those projected to undergo the most important shift in the start date of plant development the increase in irrigation need would then derive partly from extension of the irrigation period towards the beginning of the season in may june the increase in future irrigation need appeared greater when considering only the higher part of the distribution indicating a strong influence of dry years on the general increase in irrigation need during july and august the irrigation need appeared to decrease but for different reasons in july future rainfall increased slightly resulting in a decrease in the rain deficit despite the rise in temperature and thus to a decrease in the irrigation need during august on the other hand the future rainfall decreased and the rain deficit increased but the irrigation need also decreased as for the beginning of the cropping season this finding is likely to be explained by the temporal shift forward of the cropping period through this crop development tended to start earlier and maturity was reached earlier in the season leading to a decrease in irrigation need in august irrigation stopped a few days before maturity this analysis is consistent with the few studies available over northern europe indicating an extension of the growing period in a systematic review wiréhn 2018 identified this extension of the cropping period as one of the major challenges for nordic agriculture in terms of crop selection and scheduling the present study showed that this temporal shift will also have a substantial impact on irrigation need with a shift toward the beginning of the season however in the calculations presented here the length of the crop development cycle was fixed whereas the vegetative period has also be shown to be shortened by climate change kristensen et al 2011 rötter et al 2013 a balance needs to be found between the accelerated development and water needs of crops to avoid loss of production due to water stress irrigation during the season could actually shift the harvest date and intensify the decreased irrigation need at the end of the season in the absence of irrigation there is a risk of loss of production due to water stress during the latter part of the season for instance during the dry summer of 2018 in sweden the growing season for experimental fields of rainfed wheat was shortened by 3 4 weeks due to water stress but accompanied by lower yields the increasing probability of dry spring weather as also highlighted by other studies such as rötter et al 2012 trnka et al 2014 wiréhn 2018 was shown here to be the second most influential factor for increased irrigation need during the beginning of the season considering the limitations with the calculations detailed above this early season increase could potentially be more important than shown in this study in particular the assumption that all water inputs infiltrated until maximum awc was reached reduced the impact of increasing probability of high intensity rainfall events chen et al 2015 de toro et al 2015 which would create more runoff and reduce infiltration a spatial gradient was also seen in this study with eastern sweden uppland östergötland småland and to a lesser extent the inland site of västergötland seeming to be more impacted than the south western sites of skåne and halland this spatial gradient is somewhat consistent with the data from smhi on projected future changes in temperature and precipitation where the north of sweden will be more impacted than the south and the east than the west eklund et al 2015 in addition it is important to point out that for the northern regions the need for irrigation to date has been very low so a small increase upon that level gave a statistically significant variation in sweden individual farmers or groups of farmers do not receive any support for investments related to irrigation and must bear all costs for this reason the level of irrigation and willingness to invest in irrigation are relatively low the typical irrigation system in sweden consists of medium high pressure sprinklers with 300 600 m laterals yearly cost investment plus running costs for this type of system ranges from 300 to 650 euros per ha irrigation water is withdrawn from groundwater natural lakes or streams in most cases however uptake is restricted by law a license is needed and the potential cost of obtaining this license may be 10 000 20 000 euros because of these restrictions farmers tend to invest in on farm ponds adding a cost for irrigation water of 2 3 euros per m3 cost benefit analysis based on the details in this study is relatively complicated as yield differences were not calculated a calculation was performed of the water needs for optimum yield but not loss of yield in the absence of irrigation more specific analyses on yield differences in rain fed compared with irrigated agriculture should be performed the results in the present study showed that the overall need for irrigation was highest in the beginning of the season and that irrigation seemed to influence yield most in the driest years however the number and intensity of summer drought episodes in sweden have been increasing in the past decade and this is expected to continue over the next century unless part of this problem can somehow be avoided by a shift in sowing date there is a strong probability of yield losses sweden is currently less than 50 self sufficient in crop production and a discussion on food strategies is ongoing irrigation could reduce sweden s dependence on the international market for crop supplies during particularly dry years 5 conclusions the results presented in this paper show that the future irrigation need in sweden will increase during the beginning of the season may june for two main reasons i a shift in the cropping period to earlier dates leading to an earlier need for irrigation and ii higher probability of dry spring weather substantially increasing the irrigation need during the driest years these findings apply particularly for cereals and to a lesser extent for grass ley potatoes which start to develop later in the season showed a future increasing need for water during july a shift in yearly crop development dates was projected leading to earlier harvesting date and decreasing the future irrigation need during august this decrease could be accentuated by the shorter future vegetative period predicted in the literature which was not included in the calculations in this study however the infiltration oriented calculation procedure developed for this study may have underestimated the need for irrigation by considering all rainfall as effective water input to soil and by letting crops access the full water content of the soil from the start of their development modification of the approach e g by excluding a percentage of water input to encompass interception and by simulating root growth over time

10099,over 90 of swedish agriculture is rainfed and thus future climate change can pose a risk to agricultural production in coming decades an overall increase in annual precipitation is predicted for northern europe but sweden could still face an increasing need for irrigation as shown by the drought summer of 2018 adaptation of swedish agriculture to include irrigated agriculture should thus be considered to evaluate the theoretical need for irrigation calculations were performed for different locations in sweden and for different soil crop pairs at each location in situ weather data from a projected climate dataset created by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute were used to evaluate changes in irrigation need over the period 1981 2050 the results showed an increasing need for irrigation of cereal crops during the early season may june for two main reasons i a shift to an earlier start of the cropping period leading to an earlier need for irrigation and ii a higher probability of dry spring weather substantially increasing the irrigation requirement in dry years crops for which the growing season starts later e g potatoes showed an increasing need for irrigation during july crop development stages were predicted to occur earlier leading to earlier harvesting reducing the irrigation requirement in august however the calculation approach developed for this study may have underestimated the need for irrigation which could be higher than reported here 1 introduction the occurrence of global climate change and its predicted continuation over the coming

terrestrial water cycle grusson et al 2018 hartmann et al 2013 held and soden 2006 jiménez cisneros et al 2014 for instance such changes have been shown to affect evapotranspiration demand cook et al

production posing risks to this strategic economic sector adaptation of agricultural practices and mitigation of climate change impacts to secure food production is a major concern for stakeholders and scientists on a global scale it has been shown that climate change can disrupt the cropping calendar destroy harvests or trigger soil erosion savo et al 2016 placing food production systems under pressure tripathi et al 2016 these potential impacts should be carefully investigated regionally and locally in order to adapt practices and polices efficiently in northern europe the drought summer of 2018 provided an example of the vulnerability of agricultural systems jrc 2018 for example sweden experienced cereal yield reductions of up to 50 and livestock numbers were reduced due to lack of affordable fodder and feed statistiska meddelanden 2018 in the scandinavian region average precipitation amounts and temperatures are predicted to increase over the coming century jacob et al 2014 strandberg et al 2015 beyond those average variations the distribution of precipitation throughout the year and the pattern of precipitation within each month could change with impacts on the balance between rainfall and evapotranspiration and therefore on water management for agriculture an early study by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi estimated that the increase in precipitation in northern europe foreseen in global projections might be concentrated mainly in autumn and winter while spring and summer could face decreases in precipitation rummukainen et al 2004 in sweden the vast majority of agricultural production is rainfed and there is a lack of data on irrigation because it has not been a major research focus in the past depending on sources and years only 1 7 eurostat 2016 to 3 8 windfäll et al 2010 of swedish arable land is irrigated most of the water used for irrigation is consumed in southern counties of sweden statistics sweden 2015 but future changes in rainfall pattern could have serious implications for food production and agricultural practices substantial loss of agricultural production due to drought could be avoided by the use of supplementary irrigation however very few studies have investigated the implications of climate change for soil water balance and irrigation practices in sweden despite the fact that systemic adaptation of nordic agriculture appears inevitable juhola et al 2017 in a review on the topic wiréhn 2018 located only 35 peer reviewed papers exploring the impact of climate change on nordic agriculture and found that most of those papers focused on crop phenology and life cycle eckersten et al 2012 kristensen et al 2011 olesen 2005 ozturk et al 2017 pulatov et al 2015 or on system vulnerability juhola et al 2017 kvalvik et al 2011 very few studies have examined the soil water relationship or the impact of climate change on agro hydrological systems the only published paper on irrigation and water circulation in swedish agricultural production focused on the previous drought summer of 2013 and noted the benefit that irrigation could bring in drought management in sweden campana et al 2018 a swedish government report pointed out the vulnerability of the swedish agricultural system to dry years in the period 1965 2014 when most years with low yield were associated with above average dry or wet periods de toro et al 2015 the few previous studies highlighting the vulnerability of swedish agriculture to changes in temperature and precipitation did not quantify the future change in terms of irrigation need induced by water deficits considering the severity of the 2018 drought it is crucial to determine whether summer droughts will become more frequent in sweden and whether the need for irrigation will increase substantially in the coming century the aim of the present study was thus to assess the future need for irrigation at different agriculture dominated locations in sweden using simple modeling of rain deficit irrigation need at each selected location the rain deficit and the theoretical need for irrigation were calculated for a past and a future period for several crops and for several types of soil in order to assess whether i the projected increase in precipitation will compensate for the increase of temperature and ii the current rainfed model in swedish agriculture is resilient to projected climate change 2 materials and methods seven different locations in sweden were selected for the study encompassing different climate regions throughout the country fig 1 differences in agricultural production in the selected counties are described in detail in supplementary materials table s1 for each location two 30 year periods were considered a recent past period 1989 2018 for which calculations were performed based on observed weather data and a future period 2021 2050 for which climate projections were used at each location the rain deficit and the potential irrigation requirement in the past and future periods were compared 2 1 rain deficit and potential irrigation need in the first step of the analysis daily potential rain deficit was calculated for each location using the formula 1 rd day r day pet day where rd day is rain deficit on a particular day r day is rainfall on that day and pet day is potential evapotranspiration on that day potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated using the hargreaves formula hargreaves and samani 1985 based on temperature and latitude the choice of this method was driven by limited availability of climate parameters within the projected dataset which includes only temperature and precipitation following rain deficit calculation for each day of the growing season the irrigation need for different crops and different soils was calculated at each location in this calculation the soil was considered a homogenous reservoir from which crops could take up water to supply evapotranspiration for each crop a development schedule was devised based on a fixed number of days for each crop development stage and a daily crop factor kc the development schedule of each crop is described in fig s1 in supplementary materials the starting date of the cropping period changes between years based on climate conditions in the calculations in the present study the starting date for crop development was constrained by a minimum date and a minimum daily average temperature over 7 days from the minimum date in each year the average temperature on each day in the previous seven day period had to be higher than the defined minimum temperature if this temperature condition was fulfilled the crop was assumed to start developing if at least one of the days had an average temperature lower than the threshold the starting growing date was considered to be the subsequent day and the temperature threshold verification operation was repeated when the seven previous days had a temperature higher than the minimum threshold temperature the crop was assumed to start growing and daily actual evapotranspiration was calculated the starting date for crop growth was also recorded and saved for every year in order to monitor possible changes induced by the future climate from the starting date of crop development daily evapotranspiration et volume was calculated based on the hargreaves equation and a daily crop factor kc 2 et day pet day k c soil water content swc for the day was then calculated as 3 swc day swc day 1 et day r day if the soil water content of the day reached the available water capacity awc the remaining rainfall on the day was considered to be lost through runoff and was not taken into consideration the point at which the crop was under hydric stress and thus required irrigation was determined by a threshold expressed as fraction α of the awc at which the crop was considered unable to take up water from the soil at a rate sufficient to support optimum evapotranspiration if the soil water content fell below this threshold irrigation was assumed to be performed during the day if 4 swc day awc α then 5 swc adj day swc day irrigation day the volume of irrigation applied to adjust adj soil water content was taken to be the volume necessary to increase the soil water content up to the soil water threshold level 6 irrigation day awc α swc day irrigation was assumed to be performed when needed throughout the cropping season up to a plant development stage at which irrigation was stopped regardless of hydrological conditions see section 2 2 and table 1 the equations described above were implemented automatically using a specially designed matlab code the overall procedure is schematized in fig 2 the different parameters affecting the calculation minimum date minimum temperature awc and α factor are described in section 2 2 the volume of water used for irrigation was recorded and was taken as the theoretical volume of irrigation needed to maintain the soil in perfect hydric conditions for crop development 2 2 data and parameters 2 2 1 crops and soils the calculation procedure described above was performed for four different crops winter cereal spring cereal grass ley and potatoes as shown in table s2 in supplementary materials the four types of crops selected for this study are the main crops cultivated in the different locations each crop has a particular development schedule and associated daily crop factor kc in each year the starting development date based on temperature was determined using a minimum temperature for crop development based on published data allen et al 1998 peña 2002 tribouillois et al 2016 or taken from the fao database http www fao org land water databases and software crop information en the daily crop factor kc associated with each crop was calculated from the equation proposed by allen et al 1998 the length of development stages for each crop were based on allen et al 1998 and the fao database all crop parameters were adapted for swedish conditions through author knowledge and through careful examination of the germination dates and harvesting dates resulting from the calculation method section 2 1 for the past 30 year period in the development schedule a specific day was set at which no more irrigation was performed because the crop had reached maturity and needed to dry before harvesting crop development parameters can be found in table 1 and more details of each crop development period and associated kc value are provided in fig s1 in supplementary materials four soil types categorized in the official swedish agricultural soil classification based on clay content eriksson 1999 were considered for the four selected crops in soil type selection the crops were associated with soils on which they are commonly cultivated the soil types were medium clay soil mcs mellanlera in swedish classification light clay soil lcs lättlera in the swedish classification clayey sandy soil css lerig sand in the swedish classification and slightly clayey sandy soil scss svagt lerig sand in the swedish classification each crop was associated with two different soils as shown in table 2 hydrological parameters associated with each soil table 3 were derived from several soil characterizations performed at the swedish university of agricultural sciences slu over recent decades the awc of each soil was calculated assuming the maximum root depth of the crop in that soil type the soil crop combinations assessed in this study can been seen as a theoretical and simplified representation of agricultural systems commonly found in southern sweden 2 2 2 climate data to perform the calculation for the past period 1989 2018 a dataset from in situ smhi stations was obtained for each location the stations considered for each of the seven locations included in the analysis are shown in table s2 in supplementary materials another set of data from smhi were used in calculations for the future period 2021 2050 for two different scenarios representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 this dataset is based on different global circulation models gcm from the euro cordex project jacob et al 2014 the smhi regional climate model rca4 was used to downscale the different gcm for northern europe to produce a dataset comprising five climate models for each scenario a bias correction step has been performed by smhi this dataset is projected on a 5 km grid and corrected against mesan reanalysis häggmark et al 2000 using the distribution based scaling dbs method yang et al 2010 for each location the closest point in the grid to the smhi station supplying the past weather dataset was selected table 4 lists the models used 2 3 analysis and kolmogorov smirnov ks statistical test an overall assessment of the variation in the projected climate parameters precipitation and temperature was first performed in order to evaluate the intrinsic distribution of the model ensemble the change in three hydro agronomical variables rain deficit irrigation need yearly starting date of crop development between the past period 1989 2018 and the future period 2021 2050 was then calculated for irrigation need the change was investigated by comparing the overall 30 year periods but also by comparing highest irrigation need higher quartile in each distribution for each of those variables kolmogorov smirnov statistical hypothesis testing was performed using the inbuilt matlab function kstest2 to assess the significance of the change between past and future periods the kolmogorov smirnov test is a non parametric test used to challenge the equality and continuity of two distributions smirnov 1939 being non parametric it can be used with freely distributed samples of reduced size the test involves comparing the distance between the cumulative distribution functions cdf of two distributions and enables comparison of the overall distributions instead of a central value the kolmogorov smirnov test was used here for the rain deficit balance and for the volume of irrigation applied for each crop soil combination tested a trend was considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 climate ensemble in order to identify triggers of change in the hydro agrological variable analyzed but also to evaluate the dispersion of the climate ensemble the future changes projected for the temperature and precipitation variables were first mapped for each location fig 3 the maximum and minimum daily temperature were considered separately and both were found to increase overall between the past and future periods the only noteworthy exception was for model 1 cnrm cerfacs cnrm cm5 smhi rca4 which gave a decrease in maximum temperature for both scenarios and for all locations from may to september for the minimum temperature model 1 did not give a negative trend but produced a visibly lower positive trend than most other models in the ensemble the average of the ensemble was positive for all locations all months and both scenarios rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 regarding the temporal re partition of temperature change june and july showed a slightly lower increasing trend in maximum temperature than other months with presence of several null or negative values for both scenarios it is interesting to note that the trend was similar for all locations except östergötland which showed a higher increasing trend in minimum temperature than the other locations regarding precipitation the ensemble seemed to produce more homogenous results than for temperature with no model giving a dissimilar trend from the rest of the ensemble however a temporal pattern emerged whereby if a global increase of precipitation was given by the ensemble this increase appear more pronounced during the early months of the cropping season april may while august was clearly impacted by a decrease in precipitation and september by a very limited increasing trend in precipitation in some few cases the models gave a very high increase of precipitation 60 but the ensemble average always showed a variation of 15 3 2 rain deficit the change in rain deficit between the past and future periods calculated from the difference in daily rainfall and potential evapotranspiration eq 1 is presented in fig 4 where a positive value reflects an increase in rain compared with etp i e a decrease in the rain deficit the difference observed between rainfall and evapotranspirative demand indicated that the rain deficit tend to decrease in the future period compared with the past period however a temporal pattern was detected fig 4 where august seemed to be the only month in the cropping season with negative values indicating an increasing rain deficit this increase can be directly related to the decrease in precipitation projected by the ensemble for august while the temperature was projected to increase and thereby the potential evapotranspiration see fig 3 some models also gave an increasing rain deficit during july but to a more limited extent than in august and positive variations appeared to be more significant than negative variations when comparing the different locations spatial homogeneity was observed for all sites except uppland for which a markedly higher number of climate models gave an increase in the rain deficit independently of the location the month or the scenario the ensemble average columns e in fig 4 showed very little variation as seen in the lower part of fig 4 the clustered distribution of the rain deficit over the entire cropping season showed little more significant variation than the monthly comparisons above this is remarkable when considering the ensemble averages which showed a significant decreasing trend in rain deficit for four locations östergötland gotland halland and skåne 3 3 irrigation needs the changes in irrigation need between the past and future periods calculated using the procedure shown in fig 2 reflected a double dichotomy spatial and temporal fig 5 from a spatial point of view some locations västergötland halland skåne seemed to be characterized by a decrease in irrigation need with a dominance of green color in fig 5 this was consistent with the significant decreasing trend in rain deficit over the cropping season observed at these locations section 3 2 on the other hand sites such as uppland gotland and småland showed a more balanced pattern between increased and decreased irrigation need at all locations the pattern seemed to be rather similar for the same crop grown on different soils a temporal pattern was apparent with an increase in irrigation need during the early cropping season may june and a decreasing trend in july and to a lesser extent in august this pattern was very clear for both cereal types studied winter spring and to a lesser extent for grass ley for potatoes more models indicated a later impact in the season with increasing irrigation need during july and august beyond these regional and temporal patterns very few variations were noted for the different climate models in order to identify the driest years in which irrigation is most necessary for the production the analysis of changes between the two periods was repeated using the higher quartile of each distribution which represented the years in which irrigation demand was highest fig 6 the findings of this second analysis reinforced those of the previous analysis and emphasized the temporal dichotomy with the future need for irrigation increasing in the first part of the cropping season on analyzing the highest quartile this trend emerged also for locations where it was not evident when considering the entire distribution such as östergötland västergötland halland and skåne however at those locations the early season increase was observed mainly for cereals winter and spring and not as much for grass ley or potato crops the change was sharper for the locations where this temporal dichotomy was already visible for the entire distribution the strong significance of the changes detected using the highest quartile of the distribution indicate the possibility of more intense extremes and their impact in increasing the overall need for irrigation during the first part of the season 3 4 date of crop development the average date at which crop development started was also investigated to see whether a future temperature increase induced a change in the starting date of crop development the results clearly showed an earlier starting date of crop development during 2021 2050 compared with 1989 2018 fig 7 this was particularly apparent for winter cereal with a shift forward of between 10 and 20 days in the growing season followed by spring cereal and grass ley for which a forward shift of 5 10 days was seen the potato season seemed to be much less impacted probably because of the later starting date for this crop 8 may by which time the minimum temperature was often already reached even in the past period 1989 2018 4 discussion a simple modeling scheme was applied to investigate how future climate change may affect the water deficit and irrigation need for different crops on different soils at different locations in sweden the climate variations projected by the model ensemble used in this study were consistent with those in other analyses for sweden for instance eklund et al 2015 used nine climate models and found an average change in summer rainfall of 8 28 with the highest increase being around 50 and a change in summer temperature of between 0 and 3 c with an ensemble average of 1 2 c depending on the scenario and period considered similar ranges have been reported by olsson et al 2016 for southern sweden i e the skåne site in this study e g an ensemble change in yearly precipitation of 6 5 13 5 depending on period with minimum and maximum values ranging from 35 9 to 25 2 the good consistency between previous studies and the present study is understandable considering that all were based on the same gcms from the euro cordex program they differed mainly in regionalization downscaling processes and the scale of the analysis the model ensemble used in this study gave projections in the same range as other similar ensembles despite the use of only one regional climate model rcm the calculation procedure developed in this study was inspired by the simple fao 56 allen et al 1998 calculation method for evapotranspiration that simple method has limitations but is still widely used to compute evapotranspiration and the input output balance of soil water content pereira et al 2015 using algorithms very similar to that developed in this study e g battude et al 2017 the approach developed here allowed us to build a tool which can be easily modified transferred to other locations and used with different crops and soils unlike other more complex irrigation modeling tools which are far more demanding in terms of input data and implementation time valipour et al 2015 however as in any attempt of hydrological modeling simplification of processes had to be performed the most important simplifications in the present study were the absence of water loss by direct evaporation from interception and surface runoff before infiltration these simplifications meant that soil recharge was considered perfect i e all water applied to the fields precipitation and irrigation was assumed to recharge the soil reservoir in reality a part of this water does not reach the ground for infiltration this simplification may have led to underestimation of the irrigation volume needed other important simplifications in the calculations concerned the fixed volume of soil considered and the available water capacity accessible to the plant the accessible soil volume was set considering the maximum rooting depth but in reality access increases as the roots grow during the early season even if some water is available deeper in the soil layers the undeveloped roots would normally not be able to access this water which would lead to a need for more frequent irrigation and a higher volume of water applied again this approximation may have led to underestimation of the irrigation volume needed the formulae and calculations presented in this study aimed more to investigate the relative variation in water deficit and the theoretical volume of irrigation needed to maintain perfect hydric conditions in the field it is important to bear in mind that the bias regarding irrigation operations induced by the simplifications was the same over the past period and the future period allowing comparison of the changes between the two periods notwithstanding those limitations some interesting results were obtained in the study during the first part of the cropping season may june rainfall amount appeared to increase but the rain deficit was found to be relatively stable despite this stability a slight increase in irrigation need was found for this period the crops with the greatest increase in irrigation need cereals were those projected to undergo the most important shift in the start date of plant development the increase in irrigation need would then derive partly from extension of the irrigation period towards the beginning of the season in may june the increase in future irrigation need appeared greater when considering only the higher part of the distribution indicating a strong influence of dry years on the general increase in irrigation need during july and august the irrigation need appeared to decrease but for different reasons in july future rainfall increased slightly resulting in a decrease in the rain deficit despite the rise in temperature and thus to a decrease in the irrigation need during august on the other hand the future rainfall decreased and the rain deficit increased but the irrigation need also decreased as for the beginning of the cropping season this finding is likely to be explained by the temporal shift forward of the cropping period through this crop development tended to start earlier and maturity was reached earlier in the season leading to a decrease in irrigation need in august irrigation stopped a few days before maturity this analysis is consistent with the few studies available over northern europe indicating an extension of the growing period in a systematic review wiréhn 2018 identified this extension of the cropping period as one of the major challenges for nordic agriculture in terms of crop selection and scheduling the present study showed that this temporal shift will also have a substantial impact on irrigation need with a shift toward the beginning of the season however in the calculations presented here the length of the crop development cycle was fixed whereas the vegetative period has also be shown to be shortened by climate change kristensen et al 2011 rötter et al 2013 a balance needs to be found between the accelerated development and water needs of crops to avoid loss of production due to water stress irrigation during the season could actually shift the harvest date and intensify the decreased irrigation need at the end of the season in the absence of irrigation there is a risk of loss of production due to water stress during the latter part of the season for instance during the dry summer of 2018 in sweden the growing season for experimental fields of rainfed wheat was shortened by 3 4 weeks due to water stress but accompanied by lower yields the increasing probability of dry spring weather as also highlighted by other studies such as rötter et al 2012 trnka et al 2014 wiréhn 2018 was shown here to be the second most influential factor for increased irrigation need during the beginning of the season considering the limitations with the calculations detailed above this early season increase could potentially be more important than shown in this study in particular the assumption that all water inputs infiltrated until maximum awc was reached reduced the impact of increasing probability of high intensity rainfall events chen et al 2015 de toro et al 2015 which would create more runoff and reduce infiltration a spatial gradient was also seen in this study with eastern sweden uppland östergötland småland and to a lesser extent the inland site of västergötland seeming to be more impacted than the south western sites of skåne and halland this spatial gradient is somewhat consistent with the data from smhi on projected future changes in temperature and precipitation where the north of sweden will be more impacted than the south and the east than the west eklund et al 2015 in addition it is important to point out that for the northern regions the need for irrigation to date has been very low so a small increase upon that level gave a statistically significant variation in sweden individual farmers or groups of farmers do not receive any support for investments related to irrigation and must bear all costs for this reason the level of irrigation and willingness to invest in irrigation are relatively low the typical irrigation system in sweden consists of medium high pressure sprinklers with 300 600 m laterals yearly cost investment plus running costs for this type of system ranges from 300 to 650 euros per ha irrigation water is withdrawn from groundwater natural lakes or streams in most cases however uptake is restricted by law a license is needed and the potential cost of obtaining this license may be 10 000 20 000 euros because of these restrictions farmers tend to invest in on farm ponds adding a cost for irrigation water of 2 3 euros per m3 cost benefit analysis based on the details in this study is relatively complicated as yield differences were not calculated a calculation was performed of the water needs for optimum yield but not loss of yield in the absence of irrigation more specific analyses on yield differences in rain fed compared with irrigated agriculture should be performed the results in the present study showed that the overall need for irrigation was highest in the beginning of the season and that irrigation seemed to influence yield most in the driest years however the number and intensity of summer drought episodes in sweden have been increasing in the past decade and this is expected to continue over the next century unless part of this problem can somehow be avoided by a shift in sowing date there is a strong probability of yield losses sweden is currently less than 50 self sufficient in crop production and a discussion on food strategies is ongoing irrigation could reduce sweden s dependence on the international market for crop supplies during particularly dry years 5 conclusions the results presented in this paper show that the future irrigation need in sweden will increase during the beginning of the season may june for two main reasons i a shift in the cropping period to earlier dates leading to an earlier need for irrigation and ii higher probability of dry spring weather substantially increasing the irrigation need during the driest years these findings apply particularly for cereals and to a lesser extent for grass ley potatoes which start to develop later in the season showed a future increasing need for water during july a shift in yearly crop development dates was projected leading to earlier harvesting date and decreasing the future irrigation need during august this decrease could be accentuated by the shorter future vegetative period predicted in the literature which was not included in the calculations in this study however the infiltration oriented calculation procedure developed for this study may have underestimated the need for irrigation by considering all rainfall as effective water input to soil and by letting crops access the full water content of the soil from the start of their development modification of the approach e g by excluding a percentage of water input to encompass interception and by simulating root growth over time
