14470,the aim of this work was to determine whether the effectiveness of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals to degrade carbamazepine cbz in aqueous solution is a function of the radical generator system used for this purpose an in depth analysis was conducted of cbz degradation by uv radiation uv h2o2 uv s2o8 2 fe2 h2o2 fe2 s2o8 2 uv fe2 h2o2 and uv fe2 s2o8 2 results obtained show that cbz can be degraded by direct photolysis but that the effectiveness is very low with a quantum yield near zero cbz can be effectively degraded by uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 systems with percentages close to 100 cbz degradation was 1 26 to 2 0 fold faster with so4 radicals than with ho radicals in contrast cbz degradation was 1 1 to 1 7 fold more effective with the fe2 h2o2 versus fe2 s2o8 2 system when the fenton process was applied cbz removal from water was most effective with uv fe2 h2o2 and uv fe2 s2o8 2 systems attributable to the additional generation of ho radicals resulting from the reduction in fe3 a slight decrease in percentage degradation was observed with all systems when wastewater was the aqueous matrix mainly due to the presence of organic and inorganic species that may act as radical scavengers cl no2 no3 and so4 2 finally the highest percentage mineralization was obtained with the uv fe2 h2o2 system in deionized water keywords carbamazepine advanced oxidation processes fenton process uv h2o2 uv s2o8 2 1 introduction carbamazepine cbz is an anticonvulsant used to treat epilepsy and multiple sclerosis and to alleviate neuropathic pain it also possesses mood stabilizing properties and is frequently prescribed to treat episodes of mania or bipolar affective disorder 1 because of its low biodegradability and persistence cbz has been detected in wastewater at concentrations of 4 6 21 6 μg l 1 2 3 and in surface water at concentrations between 0 3 and 1 9 μg l 1 4 advanced oxidation processes aops constitute an important class of technologies designed to destroy a wide range of persistent pollutants aops used for cbz degradation are mainly based on the production of hydroxyl radicals ho as oxidizing agents and they include ozonation at basic ph electrochemical oxidation radiolysis indirect photolysis photocatalysis and fenton and photo fenton process 5 7 there is growing interest in aops that generate sulfate radicals which are more selective and show greater reduction potential at neutral ph in comparison to hydroxyl radicals 8 besides in comparison with h2o2 that is supplied as a solution in water and its stability decreases as its concentration increases peroxodisulphate is a powder under normal environmental conditions and has good shelf life if stored properly 9 10 additionally the latest can be activated by thermal alkaline ultraviolet light activated carbon transition metal such as fe fe2 cu2 co2 ag ultrasound and hydrogen peroxide to form sulfate radical so4 11 reports have been published on the efficiency of ho and so4 radicals to degrade cbz and various aromatic compounds ali et al 12 investigated the cbz degradation using uv 254 nm uv h2o2 uvfe2 h2o2 and uv fe3 h2o2 under different operational conditions the results evidenced that cbz was highly resistant under uv condition however its degradation is improved by combination with h2o2 fe2 and uv radiation due to the generation of ho radicals the uv h2o2 fe2 was the most efficient system at acidic ph achieving a degradation percentage close to 100 rao et al 13 employed the fe2 s2o8 2 system to eliminate cbz from water the results revealed that the cbz degradation can be described as a two stage reaction consisting of a rapid initial stage followed by a retarded second stage the cbz degradation percentage after 40 min of treatment was only 45 using cbz 0 25 μm s2o8 2 fe2 250 μm at ph 3 tan et al 14 investigated antipyrine degradation by uv radiation uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 systems and obtained the fastest degradation rates with the uv s2o8 2 system followed by the uv h2o2 and uv systems however they described the uv h2o2 system as more cost effective than the uv s2o8 2 system ocampo pérez et al 15 observed that uv s2o8 2 was more effective than uv h2o2 to degrade cytarabine obtaining 2 5 fold higher percentage degradation regardless of the operating conditions similar results have been obtained with these two systems in the degradation of remazol red sodium diatrizoate amitrole and bpa in aqueous phase 16 19 according to the above data sulfate radicals are more effective than hydroxyl radicals under uv light it is of interest to determine the effectiveness of these radicals without uv radiation accordingly the objectives of this study were to compare the effectiveness of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals to eliminate carbamazepine in the presence and absence of uv light by applying uv radiation uv h2o2 uv s2o8 2 h2o2 fe2 s2o8 2 fe2 uv h2o2 fe2 and uv s2o8 2 fe2 systems to examine the effect of operating variables initial cbz concentration solution ph h2o2 and k2s2o8 concentrations type of water and h2o2 fe2 and s2o8 2 fe2 ratios and to identify degradation byproducts of each system 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all reagents used in this study carbamazepine hydrogen peroxide potassium persulfate atrazine acetic acid ammonium acetate acetonitrile methanol sodium hydroxide hydrochloric acid phosphoric acid and methanol were high purity analytical grade and supplied by sigma aldrich the physical and chemical properties of cbz are listed in table s1 and its speciation diagram is depicted in figure s1 supplementary material 2 2 carbamazepine determination in aqueous solution cbz concentrations in aqueous solution were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc using a shimadzu prominence liquid chromatograph with nova pack c18 column the mobile phase was 10 mm acetate buffer acetic acid and sodium acetate at ph 4 and acetonitrile at a ratio of 65 and 35 respectively in isocratic mode at flow of 1 2 ml min 1 the detector wavelength was 285 nm and the injection volume was 10 μl 2 3 experimental system cbz degradation experiments were conducted using uv laboratory reactor system 4 uv consulting peschl in a 1000 ml cylindrical glass contactor with a medium pressure mercury lamp tq 718 nominal power 700 w that emitted radiation at 240 320 nm the rate of energy irradiated by the lamp at 90 270 540 and 630 w was determined by actinometry with a solution of 5 μm atrazine as actinometer 20 obtaining energy rates of 1 07 10 5 7 65 10 5 17 06 10 5 and 20 19 10 5 einstein m 2 s 1 respectively 2 4 cbz degradation by uv uv h2o2 uv s2o8 2 h2o2 fe2 s2o8 2 fe2 uv h2o2 fe2 and uv s2o8 2 fe2 systems experimental data of cbz degradation by direct photolysis were obtained as follows cbz solutions at initial concentrations of 10 30 and 50 mg l 1 at ph 6 were prepared in 500 ml volumetric flasks no reagent was added during the experiment for ph control a 1 ml aliquot was drawn from each flask to confirm the initial cbz concentration the solution was then placed in a photoreactor and maintained in agitation at constant temperature the lamp and chronometer were then switched on to initiate degradation kinetics aliquots were taken at various time points to determine the cbz concentration total organic carbon and degradation byproducts the cbz degradation experiments with uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 systems were similar to the direct photolysis experiments except that an aliquot of hydrogen peroxide or potassium persulfate respectively was added to the reactor before switching on the lamp to obtain initial concentrations of 100 1000 5000 or 10 000 μm of each oxidant additional experiments were conducted at medium ph values of 3 7 and 11 adjusting the initial solution ph with naoh or hcl as required and at initial concentrations of 50 mg l 1 cbz and 5000 μm h2o2 or 5000 μm k2s2o8 experimental data were obtained with h2o2 fe2 and s2o8 2 fe2 systems at ph 3 using an initial cbz concentration of 50 mg l 1 and initial concentrations of ferrous sulfate hydrogen peroxide or potassium persulfate ranging from 100 to 1000 μm sodium nitrite was added immediately after taking the sample to stop the fenton reaction the same procedure was followed for the photo fenton process but under the action of uv light 90 w kinetic data were obtained on cbz degradation in wastewater from a treatment plant in san luis potosí mexico the physicochemical characteristics of the wastewater were determined by standard methods and are listed in table s2 finally the time course of total organic carbon procedures was determined and degradation byproducts were identified using previously published methods 21 23 3 results and discussion 3 1 carbamazepine degradation by direct photolysis fig 1 depicts cbz degradation kinetics at different lamp powers showing that cbz degradation is strongly dependent on the lamp power being almost null at 90 w power with an increase in degradation rate and percentage degradation after 120 min of gradual increments in lamp power after 120 min exposure the percentage degradation was 2 9 29 7 78 0 and 87 5 at powers of 90 270 540 and 630 w respectively these results suggest that cbz might be completely degraded by direct photolysis with longer exposure time the degradation effectiveness of uv light is defined by the quantum yield φ i e the number of degraded moles of the compound divided by the number of photons absorbed by the system the quantum yield of cbz was assessed by using eq 1 experimental data were fitted to a first order kinetic model eq 2 giving an apparent degradation rate constant value of 3 31 10 4 25 64 10 4 94 36 10 4 and 157 77 min 1 at 90 270 540 and 630 w respectively the quantum yield for each lamp power value was 2 39 10 4 2 58 10 4 4 27 10 4 6 03 10 4 einstein m 2 s 1 respectively demonstrating the low effectiveness of direct cbz photodegradation which according to deng et al 24

fraction of energy emitted at the wavelength λ ccbz is the cbz concentration at time t mg l 1 and t is the time min 3 2 cbz degradation by uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 systems because the cbz degradation rate by direct photolysis were near zero as shown in fig 1 the contribution of uv radiation to cbz indirect photolysis was discarded in degradation experiments using a 90 w power lamp fig 2 a depicts cbz degradation kinetics at different initial concentrations of the two oxidants empty symbols for uv h2o2 system and full symbols for uv s2o8 2 system it shows that cbz degradation was null at initial oxidant concentrations of 100 μm but that both the degradation rate and percentage degradation d120 rose linearly with the increase in initial oxidant concentration at 120 min of treatment as also shown higher values of d120 were obtained with the uv s2o8 2 system than with the uv h2o2 system at the same initial oxidant concentration demonstrating that cbz degradation was more effective with the uv s2o8 2 system than with the uv h2o2 system these experimental data were interpreted using eq 2 table 1 lists the kap values obtained for each system showing that except by the experiment carry out at 100 μm of oxidant the cbz degradation was between 1 26 and 2 0 fold more rapid with the uv s2o8 2 system than with the uv h2o2 system this finding may be explained by the slower recombination of sulfate radicals in comparison to hydroxyl radicals eqs 3 and 4 increasing the effectiveness of their attack against cbz 25 3 ho ho h 2 o 2 k 5 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 4 so 4 so 4 s 2 o 8 2 k 4 10 8 m 1 s 1 the effect of the initial cbz concentration was analyzed using 10 30 and 50 mg l 1 of cbz and an initial oxidant concentration of 5000 μm fig 2b depicts the cbz degradation kinetics at different initial concentrations again showing the higher degradation effectiveness of the uv s2o8 2 versus uv h2o2 system at the same initial concentration of cbz in addition as shown in table 1 kap values were 1 38 1 51 and 2 35 fold higher with the uv s2o8 2 versus uv h2o2 system at initial concentrations of 50 30 and 10 mg l respectively and that for both systems kap values decreased with increased initial cbz concentrations this may be explained by the reduced ho cbz 0 and so4 cbz 0 ratios at higher cbz concentrations due to the greater number of cbz molecules to be attacked by the radicals according to the above data the percentage cbz degradation was up to 2 35 fold higher with the uv s2o8 2 system than with the uv h2o2 system under the same conditions although the production of ho radicals is more energy efficient in comparison to the production of sulfate radicals according to the following reactions 25 5 h 2 o 2 46 4 kcal mol 2 ho 6 s 2 o 8 2 50 8 kcal mol 2s o 4 hence the greater effectiveness under uv radiation of the sulfate radicals can be explained by a their longer half life 30 40 μs by four orders of magnitude in comparison to hydroxyl radicals 10 3 μs 26 giving the sulfate radicals more time to attack cbz molecules b the higher quantum yield of the uv s2o8 2 versus uv h2o2 system 27 indicating a higher production of radicals per mol of photons absorbed by the uv s2o8 2 system as evidenced by reactions 7 and 8 and c the simultaneous generation of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals by the sulfate radical activation mechanism increasing the effectiveness of the process according to reaction 9 17 7 h 2 o 2 hν 2 ho φ 1 0 s 2 o 8 2 h υ 2s o 4 φ 1 4 deoxygenated 8 1 8 oxygen saturated 9 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 ho h k 0 36 1 0 103 m 1 s 1 fig 3 a and b depict the cbz degradation kinetics at different ph values with uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 systems respectively the effect of solution ph differed between the systems with the uv h2o2 system the highest percentage degradation was reached at ph 3 and the cbz degradation rate and the degradation percentage gradually decreased at higher initial solution ph values with the uv s2o8 2 system the highest percentage degradation and kap values were reached at ph 3 while they were virtually constant at ph 6 7 and 11 as shown in fig 3a the effectiveness of the uv h2o2 system reduced with an increase in the ph possibly because alkaline conditions favor the generation of the deprotonated form of h2o2 ho2 which inhibits the generation of ho radicals by means of reactions 10 and 11 24 it has also been reported that the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with hydroperoxide anion is approximately 100 fold more rapid than the reaction with h2o2 24 resulting in slower cbz degradation rates at higher solution ph values in addition ho radicals recombine with anion ho at basic ph values producing its conjugate base o reaction 12 which is present in a wide range of recombination reactions reactions 13 16 and gradually reduces participation of the hydroperoxide radical and other oxygenated radicals explaining the slower cbz degradation rates at basic ph values 10 h 2 o 2 h o 2 h 11 h o

predominance in the system of sulfate radicals which perform the most important function in cbz degradation hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals coexist in this system at ph values between 7 and 10 5 and their recombination reduces the cbz degradation efficacy at ph values above 10 5 reaction 19 results in the predominance of hydroxyl radicals which are also responsible for cbz degradation 24 17

fe2 s2o8 2 systems the above data show that under the action of uv radiation cbz in aqueous solution is more effectively degraded by sulfate radicals than by hydroxyl radicals in order to verify these findings utilizing other methods these radicals were also generated by fenton and photo fenton processes fig 4 a and b depict cbz degradation rates obtained with fe2 h2o2 and fe2 s2o8 2 systems at an initial cbz concentration of 50 mg l 1 and fe2 oxidant molar ratio of 1 as shown cbz degradation was more effective at higher concentrations of each reagent and the cbz degradation mechanism behavior of the fenton processes differed from that of the uv uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 systems thus they significantly reduced the cbz concentration within a short time and reached maximum degradation at 10 min followed by a virtually constant concentration at longer treatment times this behavior was also evidenced by rao et al 13 employed the fe2 s2o8 2 system for cbz degradation as shown in the figures the percentage degradation after 60 min of treatment at initial concentrations of 100 250 500 and 1000 μm were respectively 29 63 83 and 88 with the fe2 h2o2 system and 18 36 62 and 73 with the fe2 s2o8 2 system hence the percentage degradation was 1 6 1 8 1 3 and 1 2 fold higher respectively with the fe2 h2o2 system than with the fe2 s2o8 2 system in contrast to the results obtained with uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 systems the experimental data depicted in fig 5 could not be interpreted with eq 2 based on an exponential decrease in concentration as a function of time because of the asymptotic behavior of the fe2 h2o2 and fe2 s2o8 2 systems which consumed the reagents within a short time period therefore the following kinetic model was used to interpret these data 20 d c cbz dt k ap c cbz c where ccbz is the cbz concentration mg l 1 c is the cbz concentration at infinite time mg l 1 and kap is the apparent rate constant min 1 fig 4 shows that the model successfully predicts the experimental data for both systems the kap values obtained for each system are listed in table 2 showing that the kap increased at higher initial concentrations of the reagent in both systems percentage degradation d60 values after 60 min of treatment table 2 show that a gradual increase in reagent concentration does not produce an increase of the same magnitude in the d60 this indicates that high initial concentrations of fe2 and oxidant inhibit ho and so4 radical generation comparison of kap values between the fe2 h2o2 and fe2 s2o8 2 systems also displayed in table 2 shows that cbz degradation was between 1 1 and 1 7 fold more effective with the fe2 h2o2 system than with the fe2 s2o8 2 system these results were verified in cbz degradation experiments at different initial concentrations of h2o2 and s2o8 2 100 300 and 500 μm and a constant initial concentration of fe2 and cbz experiments were also conducted at different initial concentrations of fe2 100 300 and 500 μm and constant initial concentrations of h2o2 s2o8 2 and cbz fig 5 a and b depict the kap and d values for each system showing that the percentage degradation increased at higher initial concentrations of oxidant or fe2 and that the percentage degradation was significantly higher with fe2 h2o2 system than with the fe2 s2o8 2 system under these experimental conditions the kap value for the fe2 h2o2 system was independent of the initial concentration of oxidant and fe2 and was generally higher than the kap value for the fe2 s2o8 2 system these results confirm that the effectiveness of these radicals to degrade cbz is strongly dependent on the radical generator system used the above results confirm the higher effectiveness of so4 radicals than ho radicals under uv light but ho radicals proved more effective when the fenton process was used to degrade cbz the effectiveness of the radicals was also evaluated in a combined system using the photo fenton process fig 6 a and b depict the cbz photodegradation obtained with this system at a fe2 oxidant molar ratio of 1 and initial oxidant concentration of 250 μm using a 90 w lamp the figures also include graphs comparing cbz degradation between uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 systems at an initial oxidant concentration of 250 μm showing that a the highest percentage degradation values are obtained with uv fe2 h2o2 and uv fe2 s2o8 2 systems b the contribution of uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 systems is around 30 of the total percentage degradation of cbz c the cbz degradation rate is 1 2 and 4 8 fold lower with uv fe2 h2o2 and uv fe2 s2o8 2 systems than with the fe2 h2o2 and fe2 s2o8 2 systems respectively see table 2 and d the percentage degradation is higher with the uv fe2 h2o2 system than with the uv fe2 s2o8 2 system based on the above data it can be assumed that there are three main contributors to the total cbz degradation rate obtained with the uv fe2 h2o2 and uv fe2 s2o8 2 systems i direct photolysis ii indirect photolysis rfi uv h2o2 or s2o8 2 and iii the fenton process rf fe2 h2o2 or fe2 s2o8 2 however the contribution of direct photolysis is known to be negligible under these experimental conditions given that the cbz degradation rate is null at 90 w the cbz degradation rate of the photo fenton process is therefore as follows 21 r ff r fi r f if the degradation rate of the photo fenton process were additive the cbz degradation would display the behavior shown in the continuous line of fig 6a and b but this line is above the experimental data obtained with the uv fe2 h2o2 and uv fe2 s2o8 2 systems indicating that the percentage cbz degradation is higher than the sum of the contributions of indirect photolysis and the fenton process this difference would result from the additional generation of ho radicals produced by the reduction in fe3 through the photocatalytic cycle reactions 22 24 therefore although the presence of uv radiation does not improve the cbz degradation rate it causes an increase in the percentage degradation since the uv radiation produce a new ho radicals formation pathway thus fe3 is reduced to fe 2 by uv radiation inducing the formation of ho radicals reaction 23 these radicals could react with cbz producing an increase in its degradation rate 22 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 ho oh 23 fe 3 h 2 o hν fe 2 h ho 24 fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe 2 h o 2 h 3 4 effect of the chemical composition of water and the time course of total organic carbon and degradation byproducts fig 7 a and b depict the experimental data of cbz degradation kinetics with the uv uv h2o2 uv s2o8 2 fe2 h2o2 and fe2 s2o8 2 systems in treated wastewaters empty symbols and deionized water full symbols the percentage cbz degradation was slightly lower in wastewaters possibly attributable to the presence of organic matter and inorganic species cl no2 no3 and so4 2 see table s2 that act as inhibitors of radicals via the reactions listed in table s3 thereby reducing the efficacy of these processes in order to corroborate this aspect the inhibition rates of ho and so4 radicals by the species present in the wastewater was obtained by using following equation 25 r ho s o 4 k toc toc k cl c l k no2 n o 2 k no3 n o 3 k so4 2 s o 4 2 where rho so4 is the inhibition rate of ho or so4 radicals in s 1 toc cl no2 no3 and so4 2 are initial concentrations of each species present in the water in mol l and ktoc kcl kno2 kno3 and kso4 2 are the rate constant reported in table s3 substituting these values in eq 25 an inhibition rate of 1 06 106 and 9 69 105 for ho and so4 radicals is obtained these results shown that in both cases the concentration of radicals available to react with cbz is reduced additionally due to the minor light transmittance of wastewater the number of photons reaching the h2o2 or s2o8 2 is reduced confirming that the organic matter in wastewater acts as a filter of uv light reducing the effectiveness of the treatment to remove cbz from the medium fig 8 depicts the percentage mineralization at 60 min of treatment with each system using wastewaters and deionized water showing that a the percentage mineralization is higher in deionized water than in wastewater b the lowest percentage mineralization is obtained with direct photolysis and c the highest percentage mineralization is obtained with the uv fe2 h2o2 system in deionized water but is only 45 indicating the presence of recalcitrant degradation byproducts degradation byproducts generated with each system were identified by mass spectrometry using electrospray ionization in positive mode their mass was determined from the corresponding peaks m h z of the molecular ions as an example figures s2 s5 display the chromatograms obtained for cbz degradation at 30 and 60 min figure s2 shows that the retention time of cbz is 3 725 min while figures s3 s5 evidence the appearance of new peaks corresponding to the formation of degradation byproducts generally identified as oxigenated hydroxy and ceto derivatives of cbz reported in previous studies 21 23 the fact that similar byproducts are obtained with these systems suggests that the degradation pathways of the systems are also comparable the retention times and experimental m z ratios are exhibited in table 3 the structure of the identified degradation byproducts is highly similar to that of cbz because of the low percentage mineralization achieved with the paos under study 4 conclusions cbz can be degraded by direct photolysis but the quantum yields obtained show that the efficiency of photodegradation which requires a large amount of energy is very low in comparison to direct photolysis uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 systems are more effective to degrade cbz achieving a percentage degradation of around 100 and kap values ranging from 7 05 to 431 66 10 4 min 1 and from 4 7 to 658 77 10 4 min 1 respectively these results also demonstrate that in the presence of uv light cbz is degraded more effectively by so4 radicals than by ho radicals cbz degradation is between 1 1 and 1 7 fold more effective with the fe2 h2o2 system than with the fe2 s2o8 2 system showing that ho radicals are more effective than so4 radicals in these systems additionally it was evidenced that the fe h2o2 system proved to be the most efficient for the degradation of cbz in wastewater the uv fe2 h2o2 and uv fe2 s2o8 2 achieve the highest percentage degradation of cbz due to the addition generation of ho radicals acknowledgements this work was funded by the consejo nacional de ciencia y tecnologia conacyt mexico through grants 334122 cb 2013 01 221757 and pn 625 2016

fenton process was applied cbz removal from water was most effective with uv fe2 h2o2 and uv fe2 s2o8 2 systems attributable to the additional generation of ho radicals resulting from the reduction in fe3 a slight decrease in percentage degradation was observed with all systems when wastewater was the aqueous matrix mainly due to the presence of organic and inorganic species that may act as radical

more effective than uv h2o2 to degrade cytarabine obtaining 2 5 fold higher percentage degradation regardless of the operating conditions similar results have been obtained with these two systems in the degradation of remazol red sodium diatrizoate amitrole and bpa in aqueous phase 16 19 according to the above data sulfate radicals are more effective than hydroxyl radicals under uv light it is of interest to determine the effectiveness of these radicals without uv radiation accordingly the objectives of this study were to compare the effectiveness of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals to eliminate

acid and methanol were high purity analytical grade and supplied by sigma aldrich the physical and chemical properties of cbz are listed in table s1 and its speciation diagram is depicted in figure s1 supplementary material 2 2 carbamazepine determination in aqueous solution cbz concentrations in aqueous solution were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc using a shimadzu prominence liquid chromatograph with nova pack c18 column the mobile phase was 10 mm acetate buffer acetic acid and sodium acetate at ph 4 and acetonitrile at a ratio of 65 and 35 respectively in isocratic mode at flow of 1 2 ml min 1 the detector wavelength was 285 nm and the injection volume was 10 μl 2 3 experimental system cbz degradation experiments were conducted using uv laboratory reactor system 4 uv consulting peschl in a 1000 ml cylindrical glass contactor with a medium pressure mercury lamp tq 718 nominal power 700 w that emitted radiation at 240 320 nm the rate of energy irradiated by the lamp at 90 270 540 and 630 w was determined by actinometry with a solution of 5 μm atrazine as actinometer 20 obtaining energy rates of 1 07 10 5 7 65 10 5 17 06 10 5 and 20 19 10 5

obtained as follows cbz solutions at initial concentrations of 10 30 and 50 mg l 1 at ph 6 were prepared in 500 ml volumetric flasks no reagent was added during the experiment for ph control a 1 ml aliquot was drawn from each flask to confirm the initial cbz concentration the solution was then placed in a photoreactor and maintained in agitation at constant temperature the lamp and chronometer were then switched on to initiate degradation kinetics aliquots were taken at various time points to determine the cbz concentration total organic carbon and degradation byproducts the cbz degradation experiments with uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 systems were similar to the direct photolysis experiments except that an aliquot of hydrogen peroxide or potassium persulfate respectively was added to the reactor before switching on the lamp to obtain initial concentrations of 100 1000 5000 or 10 000 μm of each oxidant additional experiments were conducted at medium ph values of 3 7 and 11 adjusting the initial solution ph with naoh or hcl as required and at initial concentrations of 50 mg l 1 cbz and 5000 μm h2o2 or 5000 μm k2s2o8 experimental data were obtained with h2o2 fe2 and s2o8 2 fe2 systems at ph 3 using an initial cbz concentration of 50 mg l 1 and initial concentrations of ferrous sulfate hydrogen peroxide or potassium persulfate ranging from 100 to 1000 μm sodium nitrite was added immediately after taking the sample to stop the fenton reaction the same procedure was followed for the photo fenton process but under the action of uv light 90 w kinetic data were obtained on cbz degradation in wastewater from a treatment plant in san luis potosí mexico the physicochemical characteristics of the wastewater were determined by standard methods and are listed in table s2 finally the time course of total organic carbon procedures was determined and degradation byproducts were identified using previously published methods 21 23 3 results and discussion 3 1 carbamazepine degradation by direct photolysis fig 1 depicts cbz degradation kinetics at different lamp powers showing that cbz degradation is strongly dependent on the lamp power being almost null at 90 w power with an increase in degradation rate and percentage degradation after 120 min of gradual increments in lamp power after 120 min exposure the percentage degradation was 2 9 29 7 78 0 and 87 5 at powers of 90 270 540 and 630 w respectively these results suggest that cbz might be completely degraded by direct photolysis with longer exposure time the degradation effectiveness of uv light is defined by the quantum yield φ i e the number of degraded moles of the compound divided by the number of photons absorbed by the system the quantum yield of cbz was assessed by using eq 1 experimental data were fitted to a first order kinetic model eq 2 giving an apparent degradation rate constant value of 3 31 10 4 25 64 10 4 94 36 10 4 and 157 77 min 1 at 90 270 540 and 630 w respectively the quantum yield for each lamp power value was 2 39 10 4 2 58 10 4 4 27 10 4 6 03 10 4 einstein m 2 s 1 respectively demonstrating the low effectiveness of direct cbz photodegradation which according to deng et al 24

fraction of energy emitted at the wavelength λ ccbz is the cbz concentration at time t mg l 1 and t is the time min 3 2 cbz degradation by uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 systems because the cbz degradation rate by direct photolysis were near zero as shown in fig 1 the contribution of uv radiation to cbz indirect photolysis was discarded in degradation experiments using a 90 w power lamp fig 2 a depicts cbz degradation kinetics at different initial concentrations of the two oxidants empty symbols for uv h2o2 system and full symbols for uv s2o8 2 system it shows that cbz degradation was null at initial oxidant concentrations of 100 μm but that both the degradation rate and percentage degradation d120 rose linearly with the increase in initial oxidant concentration at 120 min of treatment as also shown higher values of d120 were obtained with the uv s2o8 2 system than with the uv h2o2 system at the same initial oxidant concentration demonstrating that cbz degradation was more effective with the uv s2o8 2 system than with the uv h2o2 system these experimental data were interpreted using eq 2 table 1 lists the kap values obtained for each system showing that except by the experiment carry out at 100 μm of oxidant the cbz degradation was between 1 26 and 2 0 fold more rapid with the uv s2o8 2 system than with the uv h2o2 system this finding may be explained by the slower recombination of sulfate radicals in comparison to hydroxyl radicals eqs 3 and 4 increasing the effectiveness of their attack against cbz 25 3 ho ho h 2 o 2 k 5 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 4 so 4 so 4 s 2 o 8 2 k 4 10 8 m 1 s 1 the effect of the initial cbz concentration was analyzed using 10 30 and 50 mg l 1 of cbz and an initial oxidant concentration of 5000 μm fig 2b depicts the cbz degradation kinetics at different initial concentrations again showing the higher degradation effectiveness of the uv s2o8 2 versus uv h2o2 system at the same initial concentration of cbz in addition as shown in table 1 kap values were 1 38 1 51 and 2 35 fold higher with the uv s2o8 2 versus uv h2o2 system at initial concentrations of 50 30 and 10 mg l respectively and that for both systems kap values decreased with increased initial cbz concentrations this may be explained by the reduced ho cbz 0 and so4 cbz 0 ratios at higher cbz concentrations due to the greater number of cbz molecules to be attacked by the radicals according to the above data the percentage cbz degradation was up to 2 35 fold higher with the uv s2o8 2 system than with the uv h2o2 system under the same conditions although the production of ho radicals is more energy efficient in comparison to the production of sulfate radicals according to the following reactions 25 5 h 2 o 2 46 4 kcal mol 2 ho 6 s 2 o 8 2 50 8 kcal mol 2s o 4 hence the greater effectiveness under uv radiation of the sulfate radicals can be explained by a their longer half life 30 40 μs by four orders of magnitude in comparison to hydroxyl radicals 10 3 μs 26 giving the sulfate radicals more time to attack cbz molecules b the higher quantum yield of the uv s2o8 2 versus uv h2o2 system 27 indicating a higher production of radicals per mol of photons absorbed by the uv s2o8 2 system as evidenced by reactions 7 and 8 and c the simultaneous generation of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals by the sulfate radical activation mechanism increasing the effectiveness of the process according to reaction 9 17 7 h 2 o 2 hν 2 ho φ 1 0 s 2 o 8 2 h υ 2s o 4 φ 1 4 deoxygenated 8 1 8 oxygen saturated 9 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 ho h k 0 36 1 0 103 m 1 s 1 fig 3 a and b depict the cbz degradation kinetics at different ph values with uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 systems respectively the effect of solution ph differed between the systems with the uv h2o2 system the highest percentage degradation was reached at ph 3 and the cbz degradation rate and the degradation percentage gradually decreased at higher initial solution ph values with the uv s2o8 2 system the highest percentage degradation and kap values were reached at ph 3 while they were virtually constant at ph 6 7 and 11 as shown in fig 3a the effectiveness of the uv h2o2 system reduced with an increase in the ph possibly because alkaline conditions favor the generation of the deprotonated form of h2o2 ho2 which inhibits the generation of ho radicals by means of reactions 10 and 11 24 it has also been reported that the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with hydroperoxide anion is approximately 100 fold more rapid than the reaction with h2o2 24 resulting in slower cbz degradation rates at higher solution ph values in addition ho radicals recombine with anion ho at basic ph values producing its conjugate base o reaction 12 which is present in a wide range of recombination reactions reactions 13 16 and gradually reduces participation of the hydroperoxide radical and other oxygenated radicals explaining the slower cbz degradation rates at basic ph values 10 h 2 o 2 h o 2 h 11 h o

predominance in the system of sulfate radicals which perform the most important function in cbz degradation hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals coexist in this system at ph values between 7 and 10 5 and their recombination reduces the cbz degradation efficacy at ph values above 10 5 reaction 19 results in the predominance of hydroxyl radicals which are also responsible for cbz degradation 24 17

fe2 s2o8 2 systems the above data show that under the action of uv radiation cbz in aqueous solution is more effectively degraded by sulfate radicals than by hydroxyl radicals in order to verify these findings utilizing other methods these radicals were also generated by fenton and photo fenton processes fig 4 a and b depict cbz degradation rates obtained with fe2 h2o2 and fe2 s2o8 2 systems at an initial cbz concentration of 50 mg l 1 and fe2 oxidant molar ratio of 1 as shown cbz degradation was more effective at higher concentrations of each reagent and the cbz degradation mechanism behavior of the fenton processes differed from that of the uv uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 systems thus they significantly reduced the cbz concentration within a short time and reached maximum degradation at 10 min followed by a virtually constant concentration at longer treatment times this behavior was also evidenced by rao et al 13 employed the fe2 s2o8 2 system for cbz degradation as shown in the figures the percentage degradation after 60 min of treatment at initial concentrations of 100 250 500 and 1000 μm were respectively 29 63 83 and 88 with the fe2 h2o2 system and 18 36 62 and 73 with the fe2 s2o8 2 system hence the percentage degradation was 1 6 1 8 1 3 and 1 2 fold higher respectively with the fe2 h2o2 system than with the fe2 s2o8 2 system in contrast to the results obtained with uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 systems the experimental data depicted in fig 5 could not be interpreted with eq 2 based on an exponential decrease in concentration as a function of time because of the asymptotic behavior of the fe2 h2o2 and fe2 s2o8 2 systems which consumed the reagents within a short time period therefore the following kinetic model was used to interpret these data 20 d c cbz dt k ap c cbz c where ccbz is the cbz concentration mg l 1 c is the cbz concentration at infinite time mg l 1 and kap is the apparent rate constant min 1 fig 4 shows that the model successfully predicts the experimental data for both systems the kap values obtained for each system are listed in table 2 showing that the kap increased at higher initial concentrations of the reagent in both systems percentage degradation d60 values after 60 min of treatment table 2 show that a gradual increase in reagent concentration does not produce an increase of the same magnitude in the d60 this indicates that high initial concentrations of fe2 and oxidant inhibit ho and so4 radical generation comparison of kap values between the fe2 h2o2 and fe2 s2o8 2 systems also displayed in table 2 shows that cbz degradation was between 1 1 and 1 7 fold more effective with the fe2 h2o2 system than with the fe2 s2o8 2 system these results were verified in cbz degradation experiments at different initial concentrations of h2o2 and s2o8 2 100 300 and 500 μm and a constant initial concentration of fe2 and cbz experiments were also conducted at different initial concentrations of fe2 100 300 and 500 μm and constant initial concentrations of h2o2 s2o8 2 and cbz fig 5 a and b depict the kap and d values for each system showing that the percentage degradation increased at higher initial concentrations of oxidant or fe2 and that the percentage degradation was significantly higher with fe2 h2o2 system than with the fe2 s2o8 2 system under these experimental conditions the kap value for the fe2 h2o2 system was independent of the initial concentration of oxidant and fe2 and was generally higher than the kap value for the fe2 s2o8 2 system these results confirm that the effectiveness of these radicals to degrade cbz is strongly dependent on the radical generator system used the above results confirm the higher effectiveness of so4 radicals than ho radicals under uv light but ho radicals proved more effective when the fenton process was used to degrade cbz the effectiveness of the radicals was also evaluated in a combined system using the photo fenton process fig 6 a and b depict the cbz photodegradation obtained with this system at a fe2 oxidant molar ratio of 1 and initial oxidant concentration of 250 μm using a 90 w lamp the figures also include graphs comparing cbz degradation between uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 systems at an initial oxidant concentration of 250 μm showing that a the highest percentage degradation values are obtained with uv fe2 h2o2 and uv fe2 s2o8 2 systems b the contribution of uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 systems is around 30 of the total percentage degradation of cbz c the cbz degradation rate is 1 2 and 4 8 fold lower with uv fe2 h2o2 and uv fe2 s2o8 2 systems than with the fe2 h2o2 and fe2 s2o8 2 systems respectively see table 2 and d the percentage degradation is higher with the uv fe2 h2o2 system than with the uv fe2 s2o8 2 system based on the above data it can be assumed that there are three main contributors to the total cbz degradation rate obtained with the uv fe2 h2o2 and uv fe2 s2o8 2 systems i direct photolysis ii indirect photolysis rfi uv h2o2 or s2o8 2 and iii the fenton process rf fe2 h2o2 or fe2 s2o8 2 however the contribution of direct photolysis is known to be negligible under these experimental conditions given that the cbz degradation rate is null at 90 w the cbz degradation rate of the photo fenton process is therefore as follows 21 r ff r fi r f if the degradation rate of the photo fenton process were additive the cbz degradation would display the behavior shown in the continuous line of fig 6a and b but this line is above the experimental data obtained with the uv fe2 h2o2 and uv fe2 s2o8 2 systems indicating that the percentage cbz degradation is higher than the sum of the contributions of indirect photolysis and the fenton process this difference would result from the additional generation of ho radicals produced by the reduction in fe3 through the photocatalytic cycle reactions 22 24 therefore although the presence of uv radiation does not improve the cbz degradation rate it causes an increase in the percentage degradation since the uv radiation produce a new ho radicals formation pathway thus fe3 is reduced to fe 2 by uv radiation inducing the formation of ho radicals reaction 23 these radicals could react with cbz producing an increase in its degradation rate 22 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 ho oh 23 fe 3 h 2 o hν fe 2 h ho 24 fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe 2 h o 2 h 3 4 effect of the chemical composition of water and the time course of total organic carbon and degradation byproducts fig 7 a and b depict the experimental data of cbz degradation kinetics with the uv uv h2o2 uv s2o8 2 fe2 h2o2 and fe2 s2o8 2 systems in treated wastewaters empty symbols and deionized water full symbols the percentage cbz degradation was slightly lower in wastewaters possibly attributable to the presence of organic matter and inorganic species cl no2 no3 and so4 2 see table s2 that act as inhibitors of radicals via the reactions listed in table s3 thereby reducing the efficacy of these processes in order to corroborate this aspect the inhibition rates of ho and so4 radicals by the species present in the wastewater was obtained by using following equation 25 r ho s o 4 k toc toc k cl c l k no2 n o 2 k no3 n o 3 k so4 2 s o 4 2 where rho so4 is the inhibition rate of ho or so4 radicals in s 1 toc cl no2 no3 and so4 2 are initial concentrations of each species present in the water in mol l and ktoc kcl kno2 kno3 and kso4 2 are the rate constant reported in table s3 substituting these values in eq 25 an inhibition rate of 1 06 106 and 9 69 105 for ho and so4 radicals is obtained these results shown that in both cases the concentration of radicals available to react with cbz is reduced additionally due to the minor light transmittance of wastewater the number of photons reaching the h2o2 or s2o8 2 is reduced confirming that the organic matter in wastewater acts as a filter of uv light reducing the effectiveness of the treatment to remove cbz from the medium fig 8 depicts the percentage mineralization at 60 min of treatment with each system using wastewaters and deionized water showing that a the percentage mineralization is higher in deionized water than in wastewater b the lowest percentage mineralization is obtained with direct photolysis and c the highest percentage mineralization is obtained with the uv fe2 h2o2 system in deionized water but is only 45 indicating the presence of recalcitrant degradation byproducts degradation byproducts generated with each system were identified by mass spectrometry using electrospray ionization in positive mode their mass was determined from the corresponding peaks m h z of the molecular ions as an example figures s2 s5 display the chromatograms obtained for cbz degradation at 30 and 60 min figure s2 shows that the retention time of cbz is 3 725 min while figures s3 s5 evidence the appearance of new peaks corresponding to the formation of degradation byproducts generally identified as oxigenated hydroxy and ceto derivatives of cbz reported in previous studies 21 23 the fact that similar byproducts are obtained with these systems suggests that the degradation pathways of the systems are also comparable the retention times and experimental m z ratios are exhibited in table 3 the structure of the identified degradation byproducts is highly similar to that of cbz because of the low percentage mineralization achieved with the paos under study 4 conclusions cbz can be degraded by direct photolysis but the quantum yields obtained show that the efficiency of photodegradation which requires a large amount of energy is very low in comparison to direct photolysis uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 systems are more effective to degrade cbz achieving a percentage degradation of around 100 and kap values ranging from 7 05 to 431 66 10 4 min 1 and from 4 7 to 658 77 10 4 min 1 respectively these results also demonstrate that in the presence of uv light cbz is degraded more effectively by so4 radicals than by ho radicals cbz degradation is between 1 1 and 1 7 fold more effective with the fe2 h2o2 system than with the fe2 s2o8 2 system showing that ho radicals are more effective than so4 radicals in these systems additionally it was evidenced that the fe h2o2 system proved to be the most efficient for the degradation of cbz in wastewater the uv fe2 h2o2 and uv fe2 s2o8 2 achieve the highest percentage degradation of cbz due to the addition generation of ho radicals acknowledgements this work was funded by the consejo nacional de ciencia y tecnologia conacyt mexico through grants 334122 cb 2013 01 221757 and pn 625 2016

agent and calcination temperature were studied the tio2 nanocrystal doped with al was characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem x ray diffraction xrd and thermogravimetric analyzer tga the photocatalytic performance of al doped nanoparticle was quantified by the degradation of methylene blue mb solution under a visible light irradiation condition its performance was compared against undoped nano tio2 the results showed that al no3 3 solution with a concentration of 0 25 and volume of 100 cm ml and calcined at 300 ๐c for 4 h was the optimum condition of al doped nano tio2 furthermore the highest pseudo first order kinetic rate was 0 096 where the doped al no3 3 of 0 75 w v was used in the batch reactor the al doped nano tio2 that was obtained has the potential for use

alone at 2 g l dosage in addition the removal of organic pollutant by tio2 doped with al was 80 at a dosage of 0 5 g l and was 85 at a dosage of 1 g l keywords titanium dioxide photo catalyst batch reactor advanced oxidation process 1 introduction titanium dioxide tio2 is a promising material which has been widely used for a broad range of applications including solar energy conversion air purification and wastewater treatment under the oxidation process it is known as an effective photo catalyst non toxic to the environment and inexpensive several studies have investigated the use of titanium as a photocatalyst to remove organic matter from water wastewater 1 characterization of tio2 can be divided into 3 phases namely anatase rutile and brookite forms 2 3 under uv irradiation e in the conduction band and h in the valence band of tio2 are produced both charges may recombine with dopants on its surface or within the crystal or they may initiate redox reactions of the adsorbed molecules 4 5 normally impregnation is divided into two methods wet impregnation and dry impregnation 6 in this study tio2 was doped by the impregnation method using a solvent as a carrier with al2no3 and di water in a recent study the adsorption of methylene blue mb onto tio2 nanoparticles from an aqueous solution was investigated by fetterolf et al 7 the langmuir adsorption isotherm was fitted for mb adsorption onto tio2 nanoparticles 7 additionally adsorption titania mesoporous was studied by using tio2 and urea aided with the sol gel process to produce h2 activity 7 the combination of treatment methods observed by nawaz and ahsan 8 using the conventional activated sludge cas treatment followed by effluent polishing with the sand filtration sf and activated carbon adsorption columns proved to be most promising with cod tss and color removal efficiencies of 81 6 88 5 and 94 5 respectively 8 the study of al doped with tio2 using ticl4 as a precursor and al so4 3 as a coagulant to remove organic matter from wastewater was studied by shon et al 9 sludge from wastewater was dry evaporated at 600 c gas chromatography was used to analyze the photocatalytic reaction of al tio2 under uv visible light the result shows that the degradation of acetaldehyde was up to 50 from its initial concentration after 60 minute of operation time 9 titanium dioxide has a band gap of 3 2 ev which can be activated only under uv light irradiation efforts have been made to discover methods of providing the photo activation of this photo catalyst under visible light doping of tio2 represents a widely used approach for developing tio2 based materials useful for the environmental application 10 non metal doped titania has been extensively studied the removal of the phenolic compound caffeic acid by photo degradation has been investigated using carbon doped titanium dioxide particles as a photo catalyst under visible light 11 it was found that photo degradation process is governed by a synergic mechanism in which adsorption and photo degradation are involved fabrication and photocatalytic performance of c n f tridoped was also studied 12 the influences of dopants calcination temperature and nh4f concentration on the catalytic performances of c n f tio2 nts under uv light and simulated sunlight were investigated by using methyl orange solution as simulant wastewater their results indicated that the c n f tio2nts exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than the c doped or n f co doped ones the c n f tio2nts showed the best photocatalytic performance when calcinated at 300 c and impregnated by 1 wt nh4f solution the c n f tri doping might have improved the electronic transition and reduced the band gap of anatase tio2 and resulted in promoting the photocatalytic performance of tio2 nanotubes 12 another study showed how highly active non metals doped mixed phase tio2 used for photo catalytic oxidation of ibuprofen under visible light could remove persistence organic pollutant by 2 8 with abh mesoporous anatase brookite heterojunction tio2 and by 95 2 with dabh c n and s co doped mesoporous anatase brookite heterojunction tio2 13 the fabrication of titanium doped with metal has been widely investigated the titanium doped with iron fe was investigated to decolorize reactive red 198 under visible light 14 it found that the band gap energy decreased from 3 0 to 2 1 ev and the 1 wt ratio of fe doped tio2 particle demonstrated the highest photocatalytic decolorization of reactive red 198 under visible light irradiation the objectives of this study were to characterize the synthesis of tio2 doped with a phase structure obtain the optimum doping conditions and its pore structure the potential performance of tio2 al was first tested for the removal of mb under uv visible light then tio2 al was tested for its removal of organic matter from synthetic wastewater using a continuous treatment process the performance was compared against tio2 p 25 when it was used alone in the same treatment processes 2 experiment materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were of analytical grade and were used as received without purification

p 25 was dried in an oven at 110 c for 1 h and ground with a ball mill nano tio2 p 25 was doped by al no3 3 and mixed and dried in the oven at 100 c for 1 h al doped nano tio2 was placed in a furnace at optimum temperature and time doped tio2 was prepared using the impregnation method un doped tio2 was synthesized with the same approach without the incorporation of al precursor 2 3

operating voltage of 15 kv and 200 kv to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of al doped tio2 uv vis spectrophotometer perkin elmer lambda 35 was used to obtain the absorbance of the catalysts over a range of 200 800 nm the powder sample was placed into the holder to analyze absorbance data transmission electron microscopy tem was carried out on a phillips tecnai 20 high tension 80 kv the photo degradation of methylene blue mb solution under different photo catalysts was carried out using a batch reactor al doped tio2 nanoparticles 0 5 g were dispersed in 100 ml mb solution with an initial concentration of 1 10 6 m before irradiation the suspension was continuously stirred with a magnetic stirrer to maintain a uniform suspension for 30 min for dark adsorption the study by erdei et al 16 used 15 min for dark adsorption doc of mb reduced to 20 after 20 min and was then nearly constant therefore 30 min of dark adsorption was used before exposure to light lampton led mr 16 4 w was used as the light source then the continuously stirred suspension was exposed to uv in a dark box in a closed system at fixed time intervals 5 ml aliquots were taken from the degraded mb solution and centrifuged to separate the photo catalyst from the media before analysis 3 5 ml of clear mb solution was diluted and analyzed using uv vis spectrophotometer model uv 160 shimadzu at a wavelength of 665 nm to measure variations of mb concentration in each degraded solution additionally the thermo gravimetric analyzer tga was used to check the mass variance by using nano tio2 10 mg and at a various temperature between 100 400 c 2 4 testing of photo catalytic activity of wastewater treatment system fig 1 showed the photo catalytic wastewater treatment system that was used to treat synthetic wastewater the lamp l1 l2 and l3 used lampton led mr 16 4 w wastewater from t1 was pumped through t2 which contained the photo catalysts tio2 and doped tio2 effluent water from q1 was filtered by a membrane and was subsequently analysed for doc removal the kinetic data at different times obtained from batch experiments were fitted to pseudo first order kinetics as follows ct co e kt where co m and ct m are the initial concentration and concentration at a given time t respectively k is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 the rate constant k was calculated from a linear plot of ln ct co vs time the half life t1 2 min was calculated using the equation t1 2 ln2 k 3 results and discussions 3 1 photo catalyst characterizations to investigate the structural features the al doped nano tio2 was calcined at 300 c for 4 h and observed under a scanning electron microscope sem fig 2 a the presence of agglomeration was distinctly observed due to the strong van de waals interaction 17 the detailed morphology and microstructure of the al doped tio2 nano particles were studied by tem after calcination at 300 c fig 2b shows the tem image of the calcinated al doped tio2 at 300 c the image shows that it consist of a spherical platelet structure in a range between 10 56 nm the tem image of al doped tio2 reveals that the prepared sample composed of fine nanoparticles fig 2c shows the typical compositions of particle doped al tio2 by using eds spectra the absorbance of tio2 p 25 is 386 band gap energy 3 2 ev nm and al doped tio2 is 420 nm band gap energy 3 0 ev fig 3 3 2 characterization tio2 al by using tga method fig 4 shows the results using a thermos gravimetric analysis tga of characterization and structure of tio2 p 25 and tio2 al with the variable concentration of al no3 3 of between 0 25 10 00 wt calcined at 300 c for 4 h it was found that at temperatures between 50 100 c the weight of tio2 p 25 reduced by 0 19 because of the humidity in the sample fig 4a it further reduced by 0 34 when temperatures between 100 250 c was applied due to the incineration of organic substances in the sample at temperatures between 250 400 c the total weight of the sample remained constant as the humidity and organic substances had been removed tio2 had the lowest weight 19 the study of tga with tio2 al at temperatures of 50 100 c showed that the weight reduced by 0 35 due to remaining humidity in the sample at temperatures of 100 250 c the weight reduced to 0 54 due to the incineration of organic substances in sample fig 4b finally when temperature were between 250 400 c the weight remained constant as humidity and organic substances were removed 3 3 the effect of calcination with doping tio2 al 3 3 1 xrd patterns with different calcinations between 200 700 c in fig 5 phase transformation occurred with doped tio2 al when it was incinerated at various temperatures between 200 700 c for 4 h at temperatures of more than 500 c the characterization transformed from anatase to rutile it meant that efficiency of photocatalyst would reduce if the temperature is 600 c or more 3 4 photo catalytic activity the study of photocatalytic activity using mb with a variety of doped al no3 3 are shown in fig 6 al no3 3 was chosen as a doping agent and varying concentration from 0 25 to 10 wt was incinerated at 300 c for 4 h based on sem and xrd results and was tested for photocatalytic activity in a photo catalytic batch reactor for 60 min fig 6 showed the photocatalytic activity of tio2 al a high mb removal of 58 and 54 were obtained with 0 25 and 0 5 wt respectively an increase in doped al of 0 75 and 1 wt resulted in an mb removal of 40 further an increase of doped al of between 2 10 had a negative effect on the degradation of mb the results of the pseudo first order kinetics data are presented in fig 6b and table 2 from table 2 it was found that the addition of 0 25 al showed faster degradation of mb k 0 0143 min 1 the half life was found to be 48 47 min further a higher amount of al 4 wt resulted in slower rates of degradation k value decreased from 0 0143 to 0 0021 min 1 at a higher loading of al a lower value of k could result because al nanoparticles that deposited on tio2 could minimize the electron and holes these results also align with the finding of a study by sornalingam et al 20 they found that increased gold concentration from 4 to 8 wt resulted in slower degradation of estrone in their study they have explained the reason as follows at 8 wt loading gold could provide sufficient recombination centres to reduce the photocatalytic activity and gold nanoparticles may agglomerate on tio2 surface due to the reduced gap between au particles 20 3 5 photo catalytic activity with al doped tio2 prepared at a different temperature the photocatalytic activity with the al tio2 prepared at a different temperature is presented in fig 7 it is found an increase of calcination temperature increased the degradation rate the highest degradation rate of 0 0142 min 1was found when the calcination temperature was 400 c at this temperature t1 2 was lower at 48 81 min table 3 a further increase in temperature resulted in a lower rate of degradation this could be due to the agglomeration of catalyst particle resulting in less efficient active sites for photo degradation the optimum temperature of calcination was 300 400 c 3 6 the use of doped metal with wastewater treatment in fig 8 shows that after dark adsorption for 30 min doc removal was between 20 30 when the lamp was turned on doc removal was 75 at a dose of tio2 2 g l and 67 at 0 8 g l however at 4 g l of tio2 the doc removal was about 40 this was because an overdose of tio2 may have caused obstructions that affected the light intrusion and obstructed the reaction that resulted in a lower photo catalytic reaction than occurred at a lower dosage of tio2 in fig 8 doc removal was 30 after dark adsorption the different dosages of tio2 al 0 25 w v of 1 g l and 0 5 g l removed doc by up to 90 and 80 respectively after 3 h of operation when calcined at 300 c the anatase form caused a higher photocatalytic reaction rate than tio2 alone as shown by xrd patterns in fig 5 the value of k in the case of al doped tio2 with a concentration of 0 5 and 1 g l was found to be 0 0257 and 0 0411 min 1 respectively this indicated an increase in the amount of al doped tio2 increased the rate of degradation significantly due to the availability of more catalyst active sites for the pollutants also a further increase of catalyst loading may have an adverse effect on degradation due to the aggregation of catalysts particles and a decrease in light penetration this may be confirmed by the results shown in fig 8 higher tio2 concentration increases the doc removal efficiency up to a tio2 loading of 2 g l further increase of tio2 loading 4 g l significantly decreased doc removal in fig 9 the higher the removal efficiency of about 78 of doc of tio2 al compared with tio2 alone was because of the lower band gap of 3 0 ev of tio2 al compared to 3 2 ev of tio2 other properties such as active sites morphology surface area play a major role in improving photo degradation 4 conclusion the study of tio2 doped al illustrated that the optimum dose of al no3 3 was 0 25 w v as a doping agent and calcined at 300 500 c for 4 h xrd pattern analysis showed that at temperatures of more than 500 c a phase transformation occurred from anatase form to rutile form the latter is less efficient in degrading organic pollutants the use of sem to study characterization and structure of tio2 al showed that the agglomeration of al no3 3 at low concentration did not affect the characterization and structure of tio2 p 25 a continuous process to treat wastewater using tio2 and tio2 doped with metal demonstrates a doc removal of 60 using tio2 at a concentration of 2 g l and 78 removal of doc using al doped tio2 0 25 w v of 1 g l the improvement of the photocatalytic activities of the tio2 doped al and tio2 alone is a result of a combined action of many factors such as their compositions sizes specific surface areas narrow band gaps morphologies dispersibility crystallinity and other crystal defects it is clear a reduction of band gap of titanium doped with al could promote photocatalytic degradation recycling of the photo catalyst in this process is less problematic and easier due to the low dosage of doped material a pilot scale to study the recovery of photo catalyst is recommended

14471,the objective of this research was to study the performance of batch and continuous recirculating reactor to photo degrade dye and synthetic wastewater here aluminium al was used as the doped metal the commercially available tio2 p 25 and al no3 3 was used as a ti precursor and doping agent respectively via the impregnation method various parameters such as the concentration of the doping agent and calcination temperature were studied the tio2 nanocrystal doped with al was characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem x ray diffraction xrd and thermogravimetric analyzer tga the photocatalytic performance of al doped nanoparticle was quantified by the degradation of methylene blue mb solution under a visible light irradiation condition its performance was compared against undoped nano tio2 the results showed that al no3 3 solution with a concentration of 0 25 and volume of 100 cm ml and calcined at 300 ๐c for 4 h was the optimum condition of al doped nano tio2 furthermore the highest pseudo first order kinetic rate was 0 096 where the doped al no3 3 of 0 75 w v was used in the batch reactor the al doped nano tio2 that was obtained has the potential for use as a photocatalyst for degradation organics pollutant from wastewater under the visible light irradiation the highest removal of organic pollutants from synthetic wastewater was 75 using tio2 p 25 alone at 2 g l dosage in addition the removal of organic pollutant by tio2 doped with al was 80 at a dosage of 0 5 g l and was 85 at a dosage of 1 g l keywords titanium dioxide photo catalyst batch reactor advanced oxidation process 1 introduction titanium dioxide tio2 is a promising material which has been widely used for a broad range of applications including solar energy conversion air purification and wastewater treatment under the oxidation process it is known as an effective photo catalyst non toxic to the environment and inexpensive several studies have investigated the use of titanium as a photocatalyst to remove organic matter from water wastewater 1 characterization of tio2 can be divided into 3 phases namely anatase rutile and brookite forms 2 3 under uv irradiation e in the conduction band and h in the valence band of tio2 are produced both charges may recombine with dopants on its surface or within the crystal or they may initiate redox reactions of the adsorbed molecules 4 5 normally impregnation is divided into two methods wet impregnation and dry impregnation 6 in this study tio2 was doped by the impregnation method using a solvent as a carrier with al2no3 and di water in a recent study the adsorption of methylene blue mb onto tio2 nanoparticles from an aqueous solution was investigated by fetterolf et al 7 the langmuir adsorption isotherm was fitted for mb adsorption onto tio2 nanoparticles 7 additionally adsorption titania mesoporous was studied by using tio2 and urea aided with the sol gel process to produce h2 activity 7 the combination of treatment methods observed by nawaz and ahsan 8 using the conventional activated sludge cas treatment followed by effluent polishing with the sand filtration sf and activated carbon adsorption columns proved to be most promising with cod tss and color removal efficiencies of 81 6 88 5 and 94 5 respectively 8 the study of al doped with tio2 using ticl4 as a precursor and al so4 3 as a coagulant to remove organic matter from wastewater was studied by shon et al 9 sludge from wastewater was dry evaporated at 600 c gas chromatography was used to analyze the photocatalytic reaction of al tio2 under uv visible light the result shows that the degradation of acetaldehyde was up to 50 from its initial concentration after 60 minute of operation time 9 titanium dioxide has a band gap of 3 2 ev which can be activated only under uv light irradiation efforts have been made to discover methods of providing the photo activation of this photo catalyst under visible light doping of tio2 represents a widely used approach for developing tio2 based materials useful for the environmental application 10 non metal doped titania has been extensively studied the removal of the phenolic compound caffeic acid by photo degradation has been investigated using carbon doped titanium dioxide particles as a photo catalyst under visible light 11 it was found that photo degradation process is governed by a synergic mechanism in which adsorption and photo degradation are involved fabrication and photocatalytic performance of c n f tridoped was also studied 12 the influences of dopants calcination temperature and nh4f concentration on the catalytic performances of c n f tio2 nts under uv light and simulated sunlight were investigated by using methyl orange solution as simulant wastewater their results indicated that the c n f tio2nts exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than the c doped or n f co doped ones the c n f tio2nts showed the best photocatalytic performance when calcinated at 300 c and impregnated by 1 wt nh4f solution the c n f tri doping might have improved the electronic transition and reduced the band gap of anatase tio2 and resulted in promoting the photocatalytic performance of tio2 nanotubes 12 another study showed how highly active non metals doped mixed phase tio2 used for photo catalytic oxidation of ibuprofen under visible light could remove persistence organic pollutant by 2 8 with abh mesoporous anatase brookite heterojunction tio2 and by 95 2 with dabh c n and s co doped mesoporous anatase brookite heterojunction tio2 13 the fabrication of titanium doped with metal has been widely investigated the titanium doped with iron fe was investigated to decolorize reactive red 198 under visible light 14 it found that the band gap energy decreased from 3 0 to 2 1 ev and the 1 wt ratio of fe doped tio2 particle demonstrated the highest photocatalytic decolorization of reactive red 198 under visible light irradiation the objectives of this study were to characterize the synthesis of tio2 doped with a phase structure obtain the optimum doping conditions and its pore structure the potential performance of tio2 al was first tested for the removal of mb under uv visible light then tio2 al was tested for its removal of organic matter from synthetic wastewater using a continuous treatment process the performance was compared against

14472,in the present research study a field scale integrated fixed film activated sludge reactor treating municipal wastewater was examined under three cyclic aeration on off periods also known as intermittent aeration applied at a aeration rate of 110 m3 h capable to maintain bulk dissolved oxygen in the range of 4 5 5 0 mg l the whole experimental campaign was divided into four operational phases continuous aeration followed by three aeration on off cycles expressed in terms of ratio of aeration on off time period i 150 30 min period ii 120 60 min period iii 90 60 min each experimental run was studied at a hydraulic retention time of 11 1 h and mixed liquor suspended solids concentrations as 2 0 2 g l the treatment performance results showed that high rate assisted in achieving the desired performance under applied intermittent aeration conditions except nitrogen removal other performance parameters such as chemical oxygen demand biological oxygen demand total suspended solids ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus were found to be least affected by on off control applied in period i and could cope up with indian discharge standards whereas period ii and iii were not found to be appropriate with respect to desired performance with respect to nutrient parameters nitrogen and phosphorus removal rates were significantly deteriorated with increasing aeration off times a statistical comparison of different operational phases using analysis of variance and turkey post hoc test was also done to check the similarity dissimilarity of applied strategies the results revealed that period i and continuous aeration phase were quite similar in terms of all performance parameters keywords cyclic aeration aeration intensity ifas reactor treatment efficacy discharge standards 1 introduction rapid urbanization growing energy needs and stringent discharge standards in developing countries have led to the development of more robust as well as resilient wastewater treatment 1 various biological systems based on different configurations combination of anaerobic aerobic and anoxic zones are already implemented across the world 2 among these aerobic treatment systems are becoming more prevalent now a days due to their remarkable efficacy and robustness 3 however some operational and maintenance needs such as energy requirement poses major barriers in the application of these systems 4 as on date various operational strategies have been practiced to make the biological treatment systems more sustainable and operationally viable intermittent aeration ia is one of successfully adopted strategies which has been received comprehensive attention in low as well as high income countries 5 2 in spite of field applications of ia strategy most of systems are not able to meet the requirements of local and national environmental regulatory bodies there are many reasons which included consistent efficiency and system potential utilization one of the important aspect of intermittent aeration is maintaining trade off between energy reduction and treatment efficiency achieved besides limitations of operational resources particularly in developing countries and simultaneous stringiness of discharge standards has also led to the search of the more robust and resilience treatment systems since last two decades research on integrated fixed film activated sludge systems has been geared up all over the world and it has become attractive option for municipal as well as industrial wastewaters treatment 6 recent advances in this technology were also reviewed from aspects of characteristics of system such as factors affecting organics and nitrogen removal microbial diversity 7 extracellular polymeric substances production 8 and energy saving 6 9 nowadays although ifas systems guaranteed a good effluent quality in terms of organics and nitrogen removal required footprint and sludge production but the greatest downside of these systems is higher energy consumption as compared to other systems another limiting factor about ifas system is that it perform well in removing suspended solids and organic matters but nutrient reduction especially phosphorus always remained low in the range of 45 60 without any chemical addition the available evidences in literature revealed that developing sequential aerobic and anoxic anaerobic conditions in a full scale biological systems can enhance biological organic and nitrogen removal with reduced operational cost however these energy saving strategies are still vulnerable to low quality effluents and the theoretical basis of the intermittent aeration process should be further investigated to ensure the field sustainability of wastewater treatment plants besides although the air supply necessary to the bioreactor decreases but it may be a hurdle in meeting stringent discharge standards as performance may go down below requirements the effluent quality achieved from our previous intermittent run under moderate aeration rate which could maintain d o 2 5 mg l was not satisfied and far above the discharge standards when compared moreover in spite of limited operational resources the most stringent indian national discharge limits for bod cod tss ammonia nitrogen tn and tp are 10 50 20 5 10 and 1 mg l respectively are set for the effective operation of wastewater treatment systems 10 bearing above considerations in mind it is very clear that emphases should be focused on mainly two aspects the first one is to comply with the latest effluent standards of respective country and second is to reduce operational costs associated mainly with aeration therefore the aim of present study was to evaluate the performance of a continuous feed and intermittently aerated ifas bioreactor under three intermittent aeration conditions applied with respect to pre set high aeration rate i e 110 m3 h corresponding to 4 5 mg l d o the results of this study will offer a reference for successful application of intermittently aerated ifas at a lower operational cost along with coping up the stringent discharge standards future studies on similar biological systems may be focussed on investigations of microbial communities as well as establishing the trade off between practical operational constraints and requisite treatment performance of target pollutants moreover fate of emerging contaminants may also be an interesting research extension in this direction it is also suggested that more field scale studies will be helpful in gaining the confidence of ifas systems 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and experimental set up the aeration tank i e hybrid stage including fixed media of pilot plant investigated in this study was built at hydrok limited uk and installed at sewage pumping station sps of rishikesh city in the uttarakhand state india the specifications are mentioned in table 1 the other operational units such as settling tank and pumps etc were procured from indian markets the actual experimental set up and treatment train of investigated pilot plant is shown in fig 1 the whole body of reactor hybrid stage aeration tank and settling tank is composed of stainless steel with a working volume capacity of 20 and 4 2 m3 respectively necessary aeration was done using submerged membrane diffusers connected to external blower via advanced electrical control panel having a power rating of 3 kilo watt two centrifugal pumps each of 1 horse power rating were used for raw water feeding and recycling of settled sludge respectively the intermittent aeration operation was done on the basis of fixed time of on off period and pre set speed of blower i e 110 m3 h the reactor was covered with a removable upper cap on which space and pockets were given for taking the mixed liquor samples and onsite monitoring of plant more details about the pilot are well described in our previous studies 2 2 experimental procedure and methodology in this research a total of three ia runs were examined just after the already running continuous aeration run stage the main experimental conditions and operational parameters under different phases are summarized in table 2 during the continuous aeration period the volumetric aeration rate was kept constant at a rate of 110 m3 h which was sufficient enough to maintain do levels in reactor in the range of 4 5 5 0 mg l the results of continuous run are well documented in our previous studies it was assumed that an acclimation period of 72 h is enough time to achieve the steady state conditions of each intermittent operational phase with ignorable variation in the process performance in terms of organics and nutrient removal efficiencies each intermittent run was continued about 14 days and samples were collected once in every two days the influent wastewater was fed continuously from the bottom of the aeration tank the typical characteristics of the influent wastewater fed to reactor were as follows cod 418 36 349 501 bod 225 18 199 261 tss 217 35 169 292 nh3 n 33 5 4 24 1 52 3 no3 n 1 8 0 9 0 3 4 4 tn 38 7 29 9 63 1 tp 4 6 0 9 2 9 6 8 mg l all the water and sludge samples were brought to environmental engineering laboratory at iit roorkee on sample collection day during whole experimental period the temperature was not regulated and was bit affected by the environmental conditions however the variation was relatively small changing from 19 to 23 c the mlss concentrations was maintained at about 2 0 2 g l during all ia phases the internal mixed liquor return ratio mixed liquor return inflow was maintained at approximately 2 i e the mixed liquor return flow is approximately 200 of the inflow rate no ph adjustment was made in this study and the ph values in all the runs varied between 6 5 and 8 7 no external mixing was provided during the non aeration periods to minimize oxygen transfer from the head space to the mixed liquor biomass settling was not significant during the non aeration periods because of a relatively short period of time max 1 h and pre set high aeration rates 2 3 analysis and methods in order to evaluate the treatment efficacy of ia phases 8 process responses indicating transformations of organics and nutrients were measured and or calculated during different experimental conditions composite influent and effluent water samples were collected for quality analysis while grab samples were used for mlss and svi measurement biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss turbidity ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were determined in duplicate by using standard methods 11 soluble components of samples were determined by filtering the samples using filter paper of 0 45 μm pore size and tested immediately in order to prevent further reaction after sampling spectrophotometer hach co ltd dr 6000 was used for all colorimetric analysis turbidity was measured by a hach turbidity meter model 52600 00 2 4 statistical analysis all statistical procedures were carried out by using the spss 20 0 statistical software package in order to test the equality of two means the difference of more than two datasets were compared in anova 12 this one way anova method was used to check the inﬂuence of different on off control strategies i e continuous aeration ia1 ia2 and ia3 for water quality parameters of the efﬂuent as well as to evaluate interactions between different aeration strategies 13 14 in case of significant differences between subgroups post hoc analyses were used based on the tukey test 15 3 results and discussion this section comprises of performance assessment results obtained under present experimental conditions with adherence to latest discharge standard of india the outcomes of continuous aeration phase presented in our previous studies are also discussed in this work at high do conditions with aeration on for 100 of the time the pilot was found to be achieve effluent cod 25 mg l bod 9 mg l tss 15 mg l tn 14 mg l tp 0 59 mg l the characterization results of influent wastewater fed to ifas reactor during whole experimental period data shown in previous section showed the great variability of characteristics as wells as mass loads of pollutants it is important to mention here that powdered alum was used to lower down the phosphorus concentration below 1 mg l indian discharge standards and the same dose i e 48 mg l was used during intermittent aeration phases 27 with respect to power energy requirement at applied ia strategies a decreasing trend i e ca 72 kw d ia1 60 kw d ia3 48 kw d ia3 43 2 kw d was observed in present study these results were quite comparable with our previous study 8 3 1 performance of organics removal it is well documented in literature that although organic matter can be degraded both aerobically and anaerobically but aerobic degradation is usually more important especially in hybrid wastewater treatment systems 16 previous studies also reported that sufficient oxygen supply can greatly enhance the performance of aerobic treatment units beside this the high aeration rates may also play important role in maintaining aerobic conditions in systems even after putting off the blower for short duration such as in intermittent aeration 17 therefore the effect of different operational cycles of intermittent aeration ia on the organics removal rates in terms of cod and bod was examined in this study fig 2 with a set airflow rate of 110 m3 h during continuous aeration experimental period the influent cod concentrations fluctuated ranging from 415 to 477 mg l and it could maintained relatively stable effluent cod concentration 26 1 8 mg l which reflected the effectiveness of present ifas system in removing organic matter the ia experimental results revealed that cod concentrations in the effluent were 28 7 1 82 41 7 3 10 and 54 42 3 81 mg l with the experimental runs ia1 ia3 after 16 days of system acclimatization under continuous aeration whereas the mean cod removal rates were 92 71 89 87 and 86 96 respectively although no significant difference p 0 05 was found between the cod removal efficiency at applied aeration on off times but 5 to 8 drop was observed in cod removal efficiencies with the increasing of aeration off times on the whole the overall cod removal efficiency was observed above 86 during intermittent aerations irrespective of applied cycle similar trends were observed for bod removal efficiency and present operating condition of the ifas system produced treated water with low average bod values as 10 15 and 21 mg l under ia1 ia3 and ia3 respectively the highest stability occurred at the experimental state 1 where the bod removal efficiency ranged from 93 71 to 97 07 with an average of 95 3 this can be attributed to rapid response of bod to aeration as compared to cod as bod represents easily decomposable organic matter whereas cod represents slowly decomposable organic matter however these values were bit higher than the values obtained in best ia phase of our previous study 7 this high organics removal efficiency may be attributed to two possible reasons the one is high holding biomass inventory in aeration tank second might be resulted from the high aeration rates maintained during aeration on time which consequently could play important role during aeration off duration this phenomenon was consistent with the previous results that sufficient and efficient oxygen supply could greatly increase the performance of aerobic degradation and improve the cod removal efficiency 18 on the other hand same intermittent aeration applied in our previous study with moderate aeration rate did not deteriorated the do environment and restricted the effluent cod up to 42 mg l however ia phase 1 was found to be least affected by applied intermittent condition in present study this means that stable treatment performance of organic matters with 30 min of aeration off time in the ifas system could be achieved this indicates that intermittent operation with an aeration rate of 110 m3 h was sufficient enough to ensure low effluent bod as compared to previously investigated aeration rate 75 m3 h 7 results revealed that although the obtained effluent cod values under ia1 and ia2 were able to cope up with latest discharge standards i e 50 mg l but these treated effluents were of no reuse without any further post treatment whereas results obtained from phase 3 suggested that aeration on off duration is not practically appropriate when cod values were compared with latest discharge standards overall the cod and bod values of effluent from ia phase i of ifas pilot could cope up with the corresponding discharge standards of india i e bod 10 mg l tss 10 mg l tn 10 mg l dissolved p 2 mg l fecal coliform 230 mpn 100 ml it is important to mention here that these values are recommended if treated sewage is being discharge into surface water to be used as source of drinking water considering the international discharge standards set by environmental protection agency bod 30 mg l tss 100 mg l tn 100 mg l dissolved p 5 mg l fecal coliform not specified the achieved results could cope up very easily and suggested that adopted strategy is practicable at field level 19 these results suggest that the present treatment configuration is able to discharge treated water in a safe manner into surface water bodies but further post treatment such as cloth media filtration or sand media filtration etc is required to reuse the treated sewage for designated uses defined by central public health and environmental engineering organisation 3 2 solids and turbidity removal in evaluation of treatment performance of bioreactors the clarity described by the mainly suspended solids and or turbidity of effluent is always considered of high importance moreover the separation of biological solids from treated effluent plays an important role in overall performance of treatment facility as these solids may cause deterioration of water bodies if high concentrations of organic solids are discharged into surface or other water bodies 20 furthermore to meet the latest discharge guidelines of tss one has to ensure that whether the set operational parameters are able to guarantee required concentration of suspended solids or not during aeration off times of ia operation no significant sludge accumulation was observed in aeration tank this may be attributed to low concentration of suspended biomass as compared to attached biomass inventory 7 fig 3 shows the time series plot of tss and turbidity from the pilot under continuous and intermittent aeration conditions it can be clearly observed from the fig 3a that there was great variations in influent quality which may be attributed to actual sewage own characteristics it is clear from the graphs that in spite of great variation in influent suspended solids concentration the average tss concentrations in the effluent differ much in all intermittent periods and amounted as 15 20 and 32 mg l for ia1 ia2 and ia3 respectively the tss value obtained in phase ia1 and ia2 were able to comply with latest discharge standards of ss i e 20 mg l these results shows that intermittent aeration with high aeration rate is affected significantly in terms of tss removal as compared to ia at moderate aeration rate corresponding to 2 5 mg l this can be also supported by high svi values obtained in this study which ranged from 223 to 248 ml g these results clearly suggest that high aeration rates with intermittent aeration are not able to guarantee low effluent tss values where similar intermittent aeration conditions at moderate aeration rate were capable to lower down tss values below 20 mg l besides turbidity levels also found to be observed in same concentration pattern and average values were found as 2 84 5 05 and 5 72 ntu among all the studied phase ia3 was not able to meet tss discharge guidelines and was not observed to be a practical strategy to run the ifas reactor the major reason behind this is fluffy quality of mixed liquor sludge which subsequently increased the effluent cod therefore some post treatment is still required to meet the guidelines of designated reuse of treated sewage these results clearly indicated that changing cycle of intermittent aeration has significant effect on overall removal of suspended solids in the system 3 3 nitrogen and phosphorus conversion 3 3 1 nitrogen removal performance one of the main environmental concerns in the developing countries is the discharge of high concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds into the water environment 21 the concentration of nitrogen compounds discharged from human activities is relatively high particularly in domestic agricultural and some of industrial wastewaters generated from food and chemical industries hence one of the attractive aspects in biological wastewater treatment is to provide appropriate conditions for nitrogen removal from wastewater in a single bioreactor nowadays 22 in this study different operational conditions for nitrogen removal were provided through intermittent aeration nitrification is an aerobic chemo autotrophic microbial process and is usually the limiting step for nitrogen removal in ifas because of insufficient oxygen supply the intermittent aeration mode with air on off control can create different environmental condition of aerobic and anoxic environment in the ifas system therefore various nitrification and denitrification activities may limit or enhance fig 4 illustrates the variation of nh3 n and no3 n in different ia conditions to determine the extent of nitrification and denitrification it is widely accepted that do concentrations above 2 5 mg l are essential for maximum nitrification 23 it can be seen from fig 4 that nitrification was well achieved in ifas systems even during ia phase 1 and 2 however ia phase 3 left some traces of nh3 n in treated effluents the average effluent nh3 n concentrations were recorded as 0 0 and 1 84 mg l under ia condition 1 2 and 3 respectively with average removal rates of 100 100 and 94 8 respectively these results can comply with the recent wastewater discharge standards in india the removal of nh3 n occurred mainly due to nitrification activity and this process required the establishment of oxygen enriched zones during intermittent aeration at present aeration rate negligible difference in ammonia removal is observed as compared to continuous aeration phase no significant differences p 0 05 were detected between the nh3 n removal of systems in ia phase 1 and 2 however phase 3 was affected bit when ratio of aeration to non aeration time decreased up to 60 90 min these results suggest that sufficient oxygen concentration was present in all ia phases even during the aeration off times overall although the aeration off time per cycle increased from ia1 to ia3 the effluent ammonia concentration remained far below the discharge standard better denitrification also leads to a greater oxygen recovery from nitrate which can reduce the oxygen demand and save aeration energy 20 when the aeration was turned off the condition gradually became anoxic after depleting the residual do and the nitrate was reduced to nitrogen gas the accumulation of ammonia during the aeration off period and the accumulation of nitrate during the aeration on period were not significant due to dilution the effluent nitrite was checked occasionally and its concentration was always found to be less than 0 1 mg n l data not shown the effluent nitrate concentration of ifas were observed to be insignificantly different from each other when switched to intermittent aeration mode i ii iii from continuous aeration mode with values noted as 13 11 4 13 3 mg l in particular ia1 and ia2 contributed significantly in denitrification activity while switching to ia3 was not observed to be a good operational strategy as ammonia concentration increased in the effluent the unsatisfying denitrification efficiency was likely due to the low abundance of denitrifying biomass due to high rates applied absence of separate anoxic zones or limited organics that affected the denitrification efficiency significantly overall the present combination of aeration rate and intermittent aeration conditions was not found to be effective in terms of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification however nitrification rate were well below the discharge standards of india regarding the tn removal different biological performances were observed during each ia period the influent tn ranged from 29 9 to 63 1 mg l during all experimental phase as shown in fig 5 as the effluent contained high concentration nitrate the tn removal rates were far from satisfactory and required discharge standards the average effluent tn concentrations were 15 14 12 and 16 3 mg l under ia condition 1 2 and 3 respectively exceeding the indian discharge standards it is clear from the fig 5 that achieved results that there is still a scope of tn reduction among all the studied ia phases phase 3 gave the lowest total nitrogen removal with an observed value as 55 whereas ia phase 2 was observed to be quite equivalent with continuous aeration phase therefore either a pre anoxic zone or duration of aeration off duration per cycle should be applied to integrate the present ifas system among all the ia phases the highest total nitrogen removal could be achieved with the experimental run ia2 with the on off aeration mode at 120 60 the average tn removal rate varied in a bell shape curve with a value trend as 58 63 55 however these rates were lower than which obtained when continuous aeration was done in ifas system i e 67 37 one of the possible reason may be aerobic denitrification or presence of facultative bacteria which preferentially use oxygen as electron acceptor due to the higher energy yield in the reactor 24 another possible reason may be current ia circumstance displacement between aerated and no aerated phase which affected the total nitrogen removal efficiency the low tn removal could also be caused by the unsatisfactory denitrification even though nitrification was performed well 25 this result indicated that intermittent aeration had negligible effect on nitrification but important effect on the nitrogen removal i e simultaneously nitrification and denitrification which is in agreement with previous reports overall the results of present study confirmed that adopting an intermittent aeration strategy at present aeration rate will not improve the overall nitrogen removal with respect to continuous aeration conditions however similar nitrification rates can be maintained even at intermittent aeration conditions as applied in present study this feature of ifas system may be beneficial for those places where nitrification is more important as compared to total nitrogen removal such as do depletion of surface water bodies 3 3 2 phosphorus removal performance biological removal of phosphorus is a process which requires two conditions with different oxidation potentials i e anaerobic and aerobic zones special species of bacteria are responsible for removing phosphorus compounds phosphorus accumulating organisms paos which accumulates phosphorus in the aerobic condition only if it already passed anaerobic zones with enough carbon source developing anaerobic and aerobic zones in a single bioreactor has been noticed by researchers recently therefore in this study tp removal efficiency was measured as a response although the ifas reactor was not designed for phosphorus removal but to meet the discharge requirements chemical precipitation was used for phosphorus removal during the whole operation period for the ifas system changes in concentration of total phosphorus in the feed and effluent are shown in fig 6 total phosphorus concentration in the feed wastewater could be found in the range of 2 9 6 8 mg l the phosphorus concentrations in the effluent from the system were 0 83 0 09 1 25 0 10 and 1 75 0 16 during experimental run ia1 ia3 respectively corresponding average phosphorus removal efficiencies were noted as 81 4 66 1 and 66 4 respectively it is clear from the figure that the effluent tp concentrations increased slightly with increase in non aeration period due to release of phosphorus again at anoxic conditions at the periods of intermittent aeration 26 highest phosphorus efficiencies could be achieved with the experimental ia1 with the on off aeration mode of 150 30 min it is important to mention here that already a set dose of alum 48 mg l was not sufficient to lower down the phosphorus concentration below 1 mg l which is indian criterion for water discharge from municipal wastewater treatment plant therefore an increased dose is required to lower down the effluent phosphorus concentration below 1 mg l contrary the same pre set dose 36 mg l worked well at lower aeration rate i e 2 5 mg l to maintain concentration below discharge standards 3 4 statistical comparison of ia phases a statistical comparison of all investigated phases was performed using analysis of variance anova test the results revealed that there was a significant effect at the p 0 05 of different aeration strategies continuous aeration ia1 ia2 and ia3 on all treatment performance parameters cod bod tss turbidity nh3n no3 n tn and tp the significance level for all the investigated parameters was observed as 0 000 which means that at least one aeration strategy is significantly differ from other as we found a statistically significant result between investigated strategies so we have also computed a tukey post hoc test as a confirmation test this analysis is quite important if a significant effect is observed in anova analysis in particular this test is designed to compare all the applied aeration strategy each one with respect to each all others i e ca ia1 ia2 and ia3 table 3 shows the post hoc significance level for the comparisons using the tukey test revealing that the mean score for the ca condition was not significantly different to ia1 which means that ca and ia1 have similar nature of treatment for all the investigated parameters however in case of comparison of ca with ia2 and ia3 it was observed that ca is not significantly different with ia2 to achieve similar levels of nh3 n and tn whereas similar no3 n and tn profiles were observed when ca is compared with ia3 phase in a similar way when ia1 and ia2 were analysed an insignificant difference was observed between nh3 n and no3 n profiles however other parameters were quite different between these two phases furthermore upon ia1 and ia3 phases an insignificant difference in concentration levels of no3 n and tn were also observed concerning the effluent turbidity levels ia2 and ia3 phase were found to be bit similar with each other overall the present statistical test results revealed that ia1 and ca phase were quite similar in terms of all performance parameters moreover one can choose and apply an appropriate aeration strategy with respect to target pollutant or desired effluent quality in terms of a particular parameter 4 conclusions in this field oriented research study conducted under actual treatment conditions the performance assessment is done for a small sized ifas system to check whether it can cop up with latest discharge standards under intermittent aeration strategies performed at high aeration rates the intermittent aeration done with different aeration on off times results revealed that ia phase 1 was most suitable and practical operational strategy which can cope up with latest discharge standards of india furthermore the intermittent aeration significantly maintained the nitrification it did not have a significant impact on nitrate removal overall high aeration set intermittent aeration could not be an effective strategy for removal of pollutants however total nitrogen removal is still to be explored or optimized to make the system appropriate for those places where nutrient discharge is a major threat the statistics analysis results anova and turkey post hoc test revealed that continuous aeration and intermittent aeration 1 have not any significant difference in treatment of all effluent parameters however a particular aeration can be used with respect to a target parameter this study provides a new outlook about the role of aeration rates in meeting the stringent discharge standards within actual constraints driven ifas system this strategy will be useful in a developing countries having limited operational resources but stringent discharge limits future studies should

14472,in the present research study a field scale integrated fixed film activated sludge reactor treating municipal wastewater was examined under three cyclic aeration on off periods also known as intermittent aeration applied at a aeration rate of 110 m3 h capable to maintain bulk dissolved oxygen in the range of 4 5 5 0 mg l the whole experimental campaign was divided into four operational phases continuous aeration followed by three aeration on off cycles expressed in terms of ratio of aeration on off time period i 150 30 min period ii 120 60 min period iii 90 60 min each experimental run was studied at a hydraulic retention time of 11 1 h and mixed liquor suspended solids concentrations as 2 0 2 g l the treatment performance results showed that high rate assisted in achieving the desired performance under applied intermittent aeration conditions except nitrogen removal other performance parameters such as chemical oxygen demand biological oxygen demand total suspended solids ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus were found to be least affected by on off control applied in period i and could cope up with indian discharge standards whereas period ii and iii were not found to be appropriate with respect to desired performance with respect to nutrient parameters nitrogen and phosphorus removal rates were significantly deteriorated with increasing aeration off times a statistical comparison of different operational phases using analysis of variance and turkey post hoc test was also done to check the similarity dissimilarity of applied strategies the results revealed that period i and continuous aeration phase were quite similar in terms of all performance parameters keywords cyclic aeration aeration intensity ifas reactor treatment efficacy discharge standards 1 introduction rapid urbanization growing energy needs and stringent discharge standards in developing countries have led to the development of more robust as well as resilient wastewater treatment 1 various biological systems based on different configurations combination of anaerobic aerobic and anoxic zones are already implemented across the world 2 among these aerobic treatment systems are becoming more prevalent now a days due to their remarkable efficacy and robustness 3 however some operational and maintenance needs such as energy requirement poses major barriers in the application of these systems 4 as on date various operational strategies have been practiced to make the biological treatment systems more sustainable and operationally viable intermittent aeration ia is one of successfully adopted strategies which has been received comprehensive attention in low as well as high income countries 5 2 in spite of field applications of ia strategy most of systems are not able to meet the requirements of local and national environmental regulatory bodies there are many reasons which included consistent efficiency and system potential utilization one of the important aspect of intermittent aeration is maintaining trade off between energy reduction and treatment efficiency achieved besides limitations of operational resources particularly in developing countries and simultaneous stringiness of discharge standards has also led to the search of the more robust and resilience treatment systems since last two decades research on integrated fixed film activated sludge systems has been geared up all over the world and it has become attractive option for municipal as well as industrial wastewaters treatment 6 recent advances in this technology were also reviewed from aspects of characteristics of system such as factors affecting organics and nitrogen removal microbial diversity 7 extracellular polymeric substances production 8 and energy saving 6 9 nowadays although ifas systems guaranteed a good effluent quality in terms of organics and nitrogen removal required footprint and sludge production but the greatest downside of these systems is higher energy consumption as compared to other systems another limiting factor about ifas system is that it perform well in removing suspended solids and organic matters but nutrient reduction especially phosphorus always remained low in the range of 45 60 without any chemical addition the available evidences in literature revealed that developing sequential aerobic and anoxic anaerobic conditions in a full scale biological systems can enhance biological organic and nitrogen removal with reduced operational cost however these energy saving strategies are still vulnerable to low quality effluents and the theoretical basis of the intermittent aeration process should be further investigated to ensure the field sustainability of wastewater treatment plants besides although the air supply necessary to the bioreactor decreases but it may be a hurdle in meeting stringent discharge standards as performance may go down below requirements the effluent quality achieved from our previous intermittent run under moderate aeration rate which could maintain d o 2 5 mg l was not satisfied and far above the discharge standards when compared moreover in spite of limited operational resources the most stringent indian national discharge limits for bod cod tss ammonia nitrogen tn and tp are 10 50 20 5 10 and 1 mg l respectively are set for the effective operation of wastewater treatment systems 10 bearing above considerations in mind it is very clear that emphases should be focused on mainly two aspects the first one is to comply with the latest effluent standards of respective country and second is to reduce operational costs associated mainly with aeration therefore the aim of present study was to evaluate the performance of a continuous feed and intermittently aerated ifas bioreactor under three intermittent aeration conditions applied with respect to pre set high aeration rate i e 110 m3 h corresponding to 4 5 mg l d o the results of this study will offer a reference for successful application of intermittently aerated ifas at a lower operational cost along with coping up the stringent discharge standards future studies on similar biological systems may be focussed on investigations of microbial communities as well as establishing the trade off between practical operational constraints and requisite treatment performance of target pollutants moreover fate of emerging contaminants may also be an interesting research extension in this direction it is also suggested that more field scale studies will be helpful in gaining the confidence of ifas systems 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and experimental set up the aeration tank i e hybrid stage including fixed media of pilot plant investigated in this study was built at hydrok limited uk and installed at sewage pumping station sps of rishikesh city in the uttarakhand state india the specifications are mentioned in table 1 the other operational units such as settling tank and pumps etc were procured from indian markets the actual experimental set up and treatment train of investigated pilot plant is shown in fig 1 the whole body of reactor hybrid stage aeration tank and settling tank is composed of stainless steel with a working volume capacity of 20 and 4 2 m3 respectively necessary aeration was done using submerged membrane diffusers connected to external blower via advanced electrical control panel having a power rating of 3 kilo watt two centrifugal pumps each of 1 horse power rating were used for raw water feeding and recycling of settled sludge respectively the intermittent aeration operation was done on the basis of fixed time of on off period and pre set speed of blower i e 110 m3 h the reactor was covered with a removable upper cap on which space and pockets were given for taking the mixed liquor samples and onsite monitoring of plant more details about the pilot are well described in our previous studies 2 2 experimental procedure and methodology in this research a total of three ia runs were examined just after the already running continuous aeration run stage the main experimental conditions and operational parameters under different phases are summarized in table 2 during the continuous aeration period the volumetric aeration rate was kept constant at a rate of 110 m3 h which was sufficient enough to maintain do levels in reactor in the range of 4 5 5 0 mg l the results of continuous run are well documented in our previous studies it was assumed that an acclimation period of 72 h is enough time to achieve the steady state conditions of each intermittent operational phase with ignorable variation in the process performance in terms of organics and nutrient removal efficiencies each intermittent run was continued about 14 days and samples were collected once in every two days the influent wastewater was fed continuously from the bottom of the aeration tank the typical characteristics of the influent wastewater fed to reactor were as follows cod 418 36 349 501 bod 225 18 199 261 tss 217 35 169 292 nh3 n 33 5 4 24 1 52 3 no3 n 1 8 0 9 0 3 4 4 tn 38 7 29 9 63 1 tp 4 6 0 9 2 9 6 8 mg l all the water and sludge samples were brought to environmental engineering laboratory at iit roorkee on sample collection day during whole experimental period the temperature was not regulated and was bit affected by the environmental conditions however the variation was relatively small changing from 19 to 23 c the mlss concentrations was maintained at about 2 0 2 g l during all ia phases the internal mixed liquor return ratio mixed liquor return inflow was maintained at approximately 2 i e the mixed liquor return flow is approximately 200 of the inflow rate no ph adjustment was made in this study and the ph values in all the runs varied between 6 5 and 8 7 no external mixing was provided during the non aeration periods to minimize oxygen transfer from the head space to the mixed liquor biomass settling was not significant during the non aeration periods because of a relatively short period of time max 1 h and pre set high aeration rates 2 3 analysis and methods in order to evaluate the treatment efficacy of ia phases 8 process responses indicating transformations of organics and nutrients were measured and or calculated during different experimental conditions composite influent and effluent water samples were collected for quality analysis while grab samples were used for mlss and svi measurement biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss turbidity ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were determined in duplicate by using standard methods 11 soluble components of samples were determined by filtering the samples using filter paper of 0 45 μm pore size and tested immediately in order to prevent further reaction after sampling spectrophotometer hach co ltd dr 6000 was used for all colorimetric analysis turbidity was measured by a hach turbidity meter model 52600 00 2 4 statistical analysis all statistical procedures were carried out by using the spss 20 0 statistical software package in order to test the equality of two means the difference of more than two datasets were compared in anova 12 this one way anova method was used to check the inﬂuence of different on off control strategies i e continuous aeration ia1 ia2 and ia3 for water quality parameters of the efﬂuent as well as to evaluate interactions between different aeration strategies 13 14 in case of significant differences between subgroups post hoc analyses were used based on the tukey test 15 3 results and discussion this section comprises of performance assessment results obtained under present experimental conditions with adherence to latest discharge standard of india the outcomes of continuous aeration phase presented in our previous studies are also discussed in this work at high do conditions with aeration on for 100 of the time the pilot was found to be achieve effluent cod 25 mg l bod 9 mg l tss 15 mg l tn 14 mg l tp 0 59 mg l the characterization results of influent wastewater fed to ifas reactor during whole experimental period data shown in previous section showed the great variability of characteristics as wells as mass loads of pollutants it is important to mention here that powdered alum was used to lower down the phosphorus concentration below 1 mg l indian discharge standards and the same dose i e 48 mg l was used during intermittent aeration phases 27 with respect to power energy requirement at applied ia strategies a decreasing trend i e ca 72 kw d ia1 60 kw d ia3 48 kw d ia3 43 2 kw d was observed in present study these results were quite comparable with our previous study 8 3 1 performance of organics removal it is well documented in literature that although organic matter can be degraded both aerobically and anaerobically but aerobic degradation is usually more important especially in hybrid wastewater treatment systems 16 previous studies also reported that sufficient oxygen supply can greatly enhance the performance of aerobic treatment units beside this the high aeration rates may also play important role in maintaining aerobic conditions in systems even after putting off the blower for short duration such as in intermittent aeration 17 therefore the effect of different operational cycles of intermittent aeration ia on the organics removal rates in terms of cod and bod was examined in this study fig 2 with a set airflow rate of 110 m3 h during continuous aeration experimental period the influent cod concentrations fluctuated ranging from 415 to 477 mg l and it could maintained relatively stable effluent cod concentration 26 1 8 mg l which reflected the effectiveness of present ifas system in removing organic matter the ia experimental results revealed that cod concentrations in the effluent were 28 7 1 82 41 7 3 10 and 54 42 3 81 mg l with the experimental runs ia1 ia3 after 16 days of system acclimatization under continuous aeration whereas the mean cod removal rates were 92 71 89 87 and 86 96 respectively although no significant difference p 0 05 was found between the cod removal efficiency at applied aeration on off times but 5 to 8 drop was observed in cod removal efficiencies with the increasing of aeration off times on the whole the overall cod removal efficiency was observed above 86 during intermittent aerations irrespective of applied cycle similar trends were observed for bod removal efficiency and present operating condition of the ifas system produced treated water with low average bod values as 10 15 and 21 mg l under ia1 ia3 and ia3 respectively the highest stability occurred at the experimental state 1 where the bod removal efficiency ranged from 93 71 to 97 07 with an average of 95 3 this can be attributed to rapid response of bod to aeration as compared to cod as bod represents easily decomposable organic matter whereas cod represents slowly decomposable organic matter however these values were bit higher than the values obtained in best ia phase of our previous study 7 this high organics removal efficiency may be attributed to two possible reasons the one is high holding biomass inventory in aeration tank second might be resulted from the high aeration rates maintained during aeration on time which consequently could play important role during aeration off duration this phenomenon was consistent with the previous results that sufficient and efficient oxygen supply could greatly increase the performance of aerobic degradation and improve the cod removal efficiency 18 on the other hand same intermittent aeration applied in our previous study with moderate aeration rate did not deteriorated the do environment and restricted the effluent cod up to 42 mg l however ia phase 1 was found to be least affected by applied intermittent condition in present study this means that stable treatment performance of organic matters with 30 min of aeration off time in the ifas system could be achieved this indicates that intermittent operation with an aeration rate of 110 m3 h was sufficient enough to ensure low effluent bod as compared to previously investigated aeration rate 75 m3 h 7 results revealed that although the obtained effluent cod values under ia1 and ia2 were able to cope up with latest discharge standards i e 50 mg l but these treated effluents were of no reuse without any further post treatment whereas results obtained from phase 3 suggested that aeration on off duration is not practically appropriate when cod values were compared with latest discharge standards overall the cod and bod values of effluent from ia phase i of ifas pilot could cope up with the corresponding discharge standards of india i e bod 10 mg l tss 10 mg l tn 10 mg l dissolved p 2 mg l fecal coliform 230 mpn 100 ml it is important to mention here that these values are recommended if treated sewage is being discharge into surface water to be used as source of drinking water considering the international discharge standards set by environmental protection agency bod 30 mg l tss 100 mg l tn 100 mg l dissolved p 5 mg l fecal coliform not specified the achieved results could cope up very easily and suggested that adopted strategy is practicable at field level 19 these results suggest that the present treatment configuration is able to discharge treated water in a safe manner into surface water bodies but further post treatment such as cloth media filtration or sand media filtration etc is required to reuse the treated sewage for designated uses defined by central public health and environmental engineering organisation 3 2 solids and turbidity removal in evaluation of treatment performance of bioreactors the clarity described by the mainly suspended solids and or turbidity of effluent is always considered of high importance moreover the separation of biological solids from treated effluent plays an important role in overall performance of treatment facility as these solids may cause deterioration of water bodies if high concentrations of organic solids are discharged into surface or other water bodies 20 furthermore to meet the latest discharge guidelines of tss one has to ensure that whether the set operational parameters are able to guarantee required concentration of suspended solids or not during aeration off times of ia operation no significant sludge accumulation was observed in aeration tank this may be attributed to low concentration of suspended biomass as compared to attached biomass inventory 7 fig 3 shows the time series plot of tss and turbidity from the pilot under continuous and intermittent aeration conditions it can be clearly observed from the fig 3a that there was great variations in influent quality which may be attributed to actual sewage own characteristics it is clear from the graphs that in spite of great variation in influent suspended solids concentration the average tss concentrations in the effluent differ much in all intermittent periods and amounted as 15 20 and 32 mg l for ia1 ia2 and ia3 respectively the tss value obtained in phase ia1 and ia2 were able to comply with latest discharge standards of ss i e 20 mg l these results shows that intermittent aeration with high aeration rate is affected significantly in terms of tss removal as compared to ia at moderate aeration rate corresponding to 2 5 mg l this can be also supported by high svi values obtained in this study which ranged from 223 to 248 ml g these results clearly suggest that high aeration rates with intermittent aeration are not able to guarantee low effluent tss values where similar intermittent aeration conditions at moderate aeration rate were capable to lower down tss values below 20 mg l besides turbidity levels also found to be observed in same concentration pattern and average values were found as 2 84 5 05 and 5 72 ntu among all the studied phase ia3 was not able to meet tss discharge guidelines and was not observed to be a practical strategy to run the ifas reactor the major reason behind this is fluffy quality of mixed liquor sludge which subsequently increased the effluent cod therefore some post treatment is still required to meet the guidelines of designated reuse of treated sewage these results clearly indicated that changing cycle of intermittent aeration has significant effect on overall removal of suspended solids in the system 3 3 nitrogen and phosphorus conversion 3 3 1 nitrogen removal performance one of the main environmental concerns in the developing countries is the discharge of high concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds into the water environment 21 the concentration of nitrogen compounds discharged from human activities is relatively high particularly in domestic agricultural and some of industrial wastewaters generated from food and chemical industries hence one of the attractive aspects in biological wastewater treatment is to provide appropriate conditions for nitrogen removal from wastewater in a single bioreactor nowadays 22 in this study different operational conditions for nitrogen removal were provided through intermittent aeration nitrification is an aerobic chemo autotrophic microbial process and is usually the limiting step for nitrogen removal in ifas because of insufficient oxygen supply the intermittent aeration mode with air on off control can create different environmental condition of aerobic and anoxic environment in the ifas system therefore various nitrification and denitrification activities may limit or enhance fig 4 illustrates the variation of nh3 n and no3 n in different ia conditions to determine the extent of nitrification and denitrification it is widely accepted that do concentrations above 2 5 mg l are essential for maximum nitrification 23 it can be seen from fig 4 that nitrification was well achieved in ifas systems even during ia phase 1 and 2 however ia phase 3 left some traces of nh3 n in treated effluents the average effluent nh3 n concentrations were recorded as 0 0 and 1 84 mg l under ia condition 1 2 and 3 respectively with average removal rates of 100 100 and 94 8 respectively these results can comply with the recent wastewater discharge standards in india the removal of nh3 n occurred mainly due to nitrification activity and this process required the establishment of oxygen enriched zones during intermittent aeration at present aeration rate negligible difference in ammonia removal is observed as compared to continuous aeration phase no significant differences p 0 05 were detected between the nh3 n removal of systems in ia phase 1 and 2 however phase 3 was affected bit when ratio of aeration to non aeration time decreased up to 60 90 min these results suggest that sufficient oxygen concentration was present in all ia phases even during the aeration off times overall although the aeration off time per cycle increased from ia1 to ia3 the effluent ammonia concentration remained far below the discharge standard better denitrification also leads to a greater oxygen recovery from nitrate which can reduce the oxygen demand and save aeration energy 20 when the aeration was turned off the condition gradually became anoxic after depleting the residual do and the nitrate was reduced to nitrogen gas the accumulation of ammonia during the aeration off period and the accumulation of nitrate during the aeration on period were not significant due to dilution the effluent nitrite was checked occasionally and its concentration was always found to be less than 0 1 mg n l data not shown the effluent nitrate concentration of ifas were observed to be insignificantly different from each other when switched to intermittent aeration mode i ii iii from continuous aeration mode with values noted as 13 11 4 13 3 mg l in particular ia1 and ia2 contributed significantly in denitrification activity while switching to ia3 was not observed to be a good operational strategy as ammonia concentration increased in the effluent the unsatisfying denitrification efficiency was likely due to the low abundance of denitrifying biomass due to high rates applied absence of separate anoxic zones or limited organics that affected the denitrification efficiency significantly overall the present combination of aeration rate and intermittent aeration conditions was not found to be effective in terms of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification however nitrification rate were well below the discharge standards of india regarding the tn removal different biological performances were observed during each ia period the influent tn ranged from 29 9 to 63 1 mg l during all experimental phase as shown in fig 5 as the effluent contained high concentration nitrate the tn removal rates were far from satisfactory and required discharge standards the average effluent tn concentrations were 15 14 12 and 16 3 mg l under ia condition 1 2 and 3 respectively exceeding the indian discharge standards it is clear from the fig 5 that achieved results that there is still a scope of tn reduction among all the studied ia phases phase 3 gave the lowest total nitrogen removal with an observed value as 55 whereas ia phase 2 was observed to be quite equivalent with continuous aeration phase therefore either a pre anoxic zone or duration of aeration off duration per cycle should be applied to integrate the present ifas system among all the ia phases the highest total nitrogen removal could be achieved with the experimental run ia2 with the on off aeration mode at 120 60 the average tn removal rate varied in a bell shape curve with a value trend as 58 63 55 however these rates were lower than which obtained when continuous aeration was done in ifas system i e 67 37 one of the possible reason may be aerobic denitrification or presence of facultative bacteria which preferentially use oxygen as electron acceptor due to the higher energy yield in the reactor 24 another possible reason may be current ia circumstance displacement between aerated and no aerated phase which affected the total nitrogen removal efficiency the low tn removal could also be caused by the unsatisfactory denitrification even though nitrification was performed well 25 this result indicated that intermittent aeration had negligible effect on nitrification but important effect on the nitrogen removal i e simultaneously nitrification and denitrification which is in agreement with previous reports overall the results of present study confirmed that adopting an intermittent aeration strategy at present aeration rate will not improve the overall nitrogen removal with respect to continuous aeration conditions however similar nitrification rates can be maintained even at intermittent aeration conditions as applied in present study this feature of ifas system may be beneficial for those places where nitrification is more important as compared to total nitrogen removal such as do depletion of surface water bodies 3 3 2 phosphorus removal performance biological removal of phosphorus is a process which requires two conditions with different oxidation potentials i e anaerobic and aerobic zones special species of bacteria are responsible for removing phosphorus compounds phosphorus accumulating organisms paos which accumulates phosphorus in the aerobic condition only if it already passed anaerobic zones with enough carbon source developing anaerobic and aerobic zones in a single bioreactor has been noticed by researchers recently therefore in this study tp removal efficiency was measured as a response although the ifas reactor was not designed for phosphorus removal but to meet the discharge requirements chemical precipitation was used for phosphorus removal during the whole operation period for the ifas system changes in concentration of total phosphorus in the feed and effluent are shown in fig 6 total phosphorus concentration in the feed wastewater could be found in the range of 2 9 6 8 mg l the phosphorus concentrations in the effluent from the system were 0 83 0 09 1 25 0 10 and 1 75 0 16 during experimental run ia1 ia3 respectively corresponding average phosphorus removal efficiencies were noted as 81 4 66 1 and 66 4 respectively it is clear from the figure that the effluent tp concentrations increased slightly with increase in non aeration period due to release of phosphorus again at anoxic conditions at the periods of intermittent aeration 26 highest phosphorus efficiencies could be achieved with the experimental ia1 with the on off aeration mode of 150 30 min it is important to mention here that already a set dose of alum 48 mg l was not sufficient to lower down the phosphorus concentration below 1 mg l which is indian criterion for water discharge from municipal wastewater treatment plant therefore an increased dose is required to lower down the effluent phosphorus concentration below 1 mg l contrary the same pre set dose 36 mg l worked well at lower aeration rate i e 2 5 mg l to maintain concentration below discharge standards 3 4 statistical comparison of ia phases a statistical comparison of all investigated phases was performed using analysis of variance anova test the results revealed that there was a significant effect at the p 0 05 of different aeration strategies continuous aeration ia1 ia2 and ia3 on all treatment performance parameters cod bod tss turbidity nh3n no3 n tn and tp the significance level for all the investigated parameters was observed as 0 000 which means that at least one aeration strategy is significantly differ from other as we found a statistically significant result between investigated strategies so we have also computed a tukey post hoc test as a confirmation test this analysis is quite important if a significant effect is observed in anova analysis in particular this test is designed to compare all the applied aeration strategy each one with respect to each all others i e ca ia1 ia2 and ia3 table 3 shows the post hoc significance level for the comparisons using the tukey test revealing that the mean score for the ca condition was not significantly different to ia1 which means that ca and ia1 have similar nature of treatment for all the investigated parameters however in case of comparison of ca with ia2 and ia3 it was observed that ca is not significantly different with ia2 to achieve similar levels of nh3 n and tn whereas similar no3 n and tn profiles were observed when ca is compared with ia3 phase in a similar way when ia1 and ia2 were analysed an insignificant difference was observed between nh3 n and no3 n profiles however other parameters were quite different between these two phases furthermore upon ia1 and ia3 phases an insignificant difference in concentration levels of no3 n and tn were also observed concerning the effluent turbidity levels ia2 and ia3 phase were found to be bit similar with each other overall the present statistical test results revealed that ia1 and ca phase were quite similar in terms of all performance parameters moreover one can choose and apply an appropriate aeration strategy with respect to target pollutant or desired effluent quality in terms of a particular parameter 4 conclusions in this field oriented research study conducted under actual treatment conditions the performance assessment is done for a small sized ifas system to check whether it can cop up with latest discharge standards under intermittent aeration strategies performed at high aeration rates the intermittent aeration done with different aeration on off times results revealed that ia phase 1 was most suitable and practical operational strategy which can cope up with latest discharge standards of india furthermore the intermittent aeration significantly maintained the nitrification it did not have a significant impact on nitrate removal overall high aeration set intermittent aeration could not be an effective strategy for removal of pollutants however total nitrogen removal is still to be explored or optimized to make the system appropriate for those places where nutrient discharge is a major threat the statistics analysis results anova and turkey post hoc test revealed that continuous aeration and intermittent aeration 1 have not any significant difference in treatment of all effluent parameters however a particular aeration can be used with respect to a target parameter this study provides a new outlook about the role of aeration rates in meeting the stringent discharge standards within actual constraints driven ifas system this strategy will be useful in a developing countries having limited operational resources but stringent discharge limits future studies should

14473,water treatment plants treat flushy raw waters and the majority use electrolytes and polyelectrolytes for the removal of the solid and organic impurities included in surface waters the dose of the used reagents depend strongly on the nature of the incoming surface water and its turbidity turbidity is due to the suspended particles in the source water and up to date is main criterion for the appropriate choice of the electrolyte and polyelectrolyte nature and dosage one of the main findings of the present work is that the selection of the appropriate dose of coagulants and flocculants as a linear function of turbidity is not right especially for the large values of turbidity the most common electrolytes aluminum sulfate and polyaluminiumchloride together with the polyelectrolyte polyacrylamide are tested for their effectiveness in the removal of suspended particles and their results discussed based on the particle s ζ potential and size distribution these common reagents have raised public health concerns due to the residual aluminium and acrylamide which remain in treated water and at produced sludge thus the present work examined and suggests the use of polymers as the natural chitosan and cminulin and the synthetic polydiallyldimethylammoniumchloride as alternative environmentally friendly coagulants for their performance on the treatment of potable water the new reagents proved to reduce the turbidity of the surface water up to 96 keywords water treatment coagulant flocculant chitosan cminulin pdadmac 1 introduction drinking water must be safe for the health of the consumers and contain all the elements that make it drinkable e g the correct ph the correct mineral concentration and the absence of any kind of micro organisms its quality shall be ensured by the authorities of municipal treatment plant since it is an indicator of the health and well being of a local society drinking water from any source lakes rivers underground water and sea should be carefully and thoroughly processing before consumption removal of turbidity from river water is a problem faced by water treatment plants for producing potable water the properties of the raw water depend on the amounts of dissolved inorganic organic materials and gases and the presence of any microbial content the most noticeable properties in the raw and treated water are inorganic and organic matter concentration ph temperature turbidity color conductivity hardness and the presence of pathogenic or non pathogenic microorganisms the selection of the appropriate treatment method for the raw water depends mainly on the nature and the origin of the water and the demands set by the end user 1 usually groundwater is clean enough and only reagents for disinfection are added for the protection from pathogenic bacteria sea water treatment is performed with reverse osmosis or nanofiltration processes to reduce the high salinity concentrations surface waters lakes or rivers are the most common sources for the production of drinking water and their effective treatment usually involves a combined scheme of physicochemical processes such as coagulation flocculation filtration in gravity or pressure filters and disinfection coagulation and flocculation occur in successive steps aimed to overcome the forces stabilizing the suspended particles in the aqueous solution in coagulation which is the most important physicochemical operation in potable water treatment coagulants are added in order to reduce the electrical charge among the suspended particles and respectively in flocculation flocculants are added to enhance the collision and the growth of flocs in this regard it should be pointed out that dosage of destabilisation reagent is a very important factor influencing the overall quality of the purified water as well as the economy of the purification process 2 in most cases the particles in natural waters have a strong negative charge on their surfaces that forces particle to remain far from each forming stable solutions with suspended particles means coagulants destabilize the colloidal particles allowing the creation of micro flocs extra addition of flocculant reagents helps the aggregation of microflocs to form larger and denser flocs that can be easier precipitated in sedimentation tanks 3 electrolytes such as alum aluminum sulfate al2so4 and pac polyaluminium chloride alncl 3n m oh m are widely used as coagulants while pam polyacrylamide c3h5no n is used as a flocculant of the formed microflocs by the electrolytes 4 5 despite the fact that alum pac and pam are quite effective in the removal of suspended particles there is a great debate on the problems caused on public health due to the amount of aluminium ions that are remained after the treatment with alum and pac and are associated with the alzheimer s disease 6 8 and the presence of acrylamide which also has been accused as a threat for human health because it causes neurological disorders 9 11 however alum and pac are still in use in many municipal and industrial plants because the cost of these electrolytes is quite low and affordable for industrial applications beyond the problems for human health the use of alum creates technical problems renault et al 12 reported that alum produces abundant sludge that is difficult to dehydrate and treated further the formed flocs are not very well resistant to external mechanical distortions and the removal efficiency depends strongly on the ph moreover the use of polyaluminum chloride and polyacrylamide in this process has more drawbacks such as the fact that it reduces water alkalinity it is strongly ph dependent and it can cause secondary pollution through the disposal of the produced sludge therefore the present work focuses on the investigation of new reagents based on natural material as the chitosan and inulin and a new synthetic polymer the polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride pdadmac that could form complexes and would harm human s health pdadmac has found to work effectively for the removal of suspended particles and part of the organic heavy load of agroindustrial wastewaters 13 14 chitosan is reported as an eco friendly approach 12 15 for the treatment of water in different application in fields such as engineering biotechnology pharmaceuticals etc chitosan is a biodegradable polymer nontoxic with high molecular weight linear cationic chain 16 ran yang et al 15 reported the use of chitosan based flocculants for the removal of different pollutants as inorganic suspended solids heavy metals humic acid microorganism raw natural water textile and paper production effluents etc according to the report of zeng et al 17 where the effectiveness of chitosan with traditional chemical flocculants was compared the required dosage of chitosan is less the process shows a faster depositing velocity a higher efficiency in the removal of cod ss and metal ions and the obtained sludge can be treated more easily compared with sludge received with classic flocculants e g pam chitosan was also reported as a reagent that is used in hybrid material which is composed of two or more different components in one polymeric matrix a second natural compound known for its extra flocculant properties is the carboxymethyl inulin cmi or cminulin the efficiency of cmi has been studied in different aqueous suspensions and is considered also as a novel flocculant for wastewater treatment 18 the potential of using biopolymers chitosan and inulin in the coagulation process has received limited attention so far 16 19 while many studies have focused on their use for industrial waste treatment apart from the natural coagulants the organic polyelectrolyte pdadmac has been studied as well for its effectiveness in the removal of suspended particles pdadmac is a high charge density polyelectrolyte which has been effective in the removal of hydrophobic natural organic matter nom 20 21 an important advantage of pdadmac is the fact that during the coagulation flocculation process smaller amounts of sludge is produced which is easier to dewater in bauer et al 22 results for flocculation and stabilization of colloidal particles are presented at very low concentrations of pdamac or other copolymers of dadmac 0 1 0 3 mg l this is a promising result that fewer polymers will be needed for the treatment of raw waters with high initial turbidity values and possible content of natural organic matter since alum and pac are still in practice in many municipal treatment plants the present work revisited the coagulation flocculation processes with alum and pac and evaluated the process for the selection of the proper concentration of electrolytes which is based so far on the turbidity value of the raw water 2 experiment methods and materials the target of the experiments in the coagulation process is to create a small flock that will consist of both the hydrophobic solids and the hydrophilic organic suspended solids the choice of the optimum dose of each flocculant was made by a combination of observations and measurements particularly based on the measurements of the ζ potential the suspended and dissolved solids particle size distribution and the uv254 absorption it was observed that the suspended solids in the test samples are characterized by a negative charge negative values of ζ potential the cationic character of the electrolytes was of vital importance in neutralizing the ζ potential so as to produce the desired effects in reducing turbidity the decrease in ph and the cod values are key factors for the selection and dose of the flocculant 2 1 methods 2 1 1 experimental arrangement jar test the experimental procedure must be representative of the water treatment unit so as to provide useful results there are several critical parameters to consider such as the intensity and duration of the mixing process as well as the settling time the jar test procedure fig 1 was followed in order to carry out the experimental series in this work so as to select and quantify an appropriate treatment schedule to remove the suspended solids from raw water the tests are carried out on the floc 6 device from raypa company where six beakers of 600 ml each were used initially a coagulant is added with fast stirring 1min 250rpm taking place followed by flocculation of the system with or without the addition of flocculant with gentle stirring 10min 50rpm taking place afterwards the system is allowed to precipitate for 90 min and finally samples were taken from the supernatant formed subsequently measurements of turbidity ph ts tss tds zeta potential uv254 conductivity hardness alkalinity particle size etc were carried out for further analysis and processing 2 1 2 turbidity measurement method turbidity is a measure of purity and therefore of the quality of water it is formed by insoluble and suspended particles organic or inorganic contained in water it was measured on the device smart3 colorimeter of lamotte company which compares the radiation scattered by the particles contained in the sample with that scattered by a reference standard sample 2 1 3 ζ or z potential measurement method the ζ potential is a measure of the electrical potential of the particles and indicates the repulsive interaction among them the charge of the particles is determined by measuring their speed as they move due to electrophoresis ζ potential with a zero value or a value near zero means that the conditions for the aggregation of particles are optimum 23 zeta potential is an indirect evaluation of particle surface charge evaluating electrokinetic properties as related to coagulant dose 24 26 so zeta analyzers represent the best available analytical technology for optimizing the coagulation of difficult to treat waters 27 therefore by monitoring the zeta potential the use of flocculants can be adjusted to determine optimal doses for the coagulation flocculation process 28 studies in the laboratory have shown that when operating in a ζ potential range between 10 mv and 5 mv the removal of particles and colloids in raw water is maximized 29 ζ potential and conductivity were measured at the zetasizer nanos device of malvern company 2 1 4 total solids ts measurement method total solids are the solid residue in a sample of water after evaporation at 105 c and weighing they are a measure of the suspended solids tss and dissolved solids tds present in water high values of total solids reduce the purity of water the total solids contained in the samples were measured by standard methods method 2540b the mlw oven and the shimadzu auw220 analytical balance were used 2 2 materials aluminum sulfate al2 so4

concentration was 1 5 w w 3 results and discussion the present paper focuses on the understanding and optimization of the various factors that govern the coagulation process by natural and synthetic polymers in the treatment of surface water of the glafkos river in patras drinking water treatment plant in achaia region therefore in the present study the effect of the doses of the already used electrolytes alum and pac and the effect of new polymers one synthetic pdadmac and two natural ch and cmi on the removal of solid content were studied with the help of parameters such as zeta potential and ph conductivity and suspended solids concentration ts today water from glafkos river is processed in the local treatment plant with polyaluminium chloride as a coagulant and polyacrylamide as a flocculant few years ago aluminium sulfate was used as coagulant but it was abandoned because of the quality and the quantity of the precipitated sludge pac reduces the amount of the precipitated sludge but the concentration of aluminium anions in water has not improved aluminium anion concentration in water according to stash 3904 1997 ics 130600 water quality 30 and european standard ec80 778 eec quality of water intended for human consumption 31 must be near the value 0 05 mg l and with the maximum allowed peak of 0 2 mg l 32 33 polyacrylamide has already reported as reagent which causes problems and its limits has been set to 0 2 ppb in drinking waters 34 because of the link between aluminium anion exposure and alzheimer s disease development 35 38 and of the link of acrylamide with health risks such as neurological disorders and male reproductive organs 39 40 it is necessary that the process of coagulation flocculation is optimized and dosages of aluminium ions al3 and of polyacrylamide in treated water are kept below the above values moreover the use of polyaluminium chloride and polyacrylamide in this process has additional drawbacks such as the fact that it reduces water alkalinity it is strongly ph dependent and it can cause secondary pollution through the disposal of the produced sludge furthermore the non optimal chemical dosing of electrolytes and or polyelectrolytes may cause more problems than the initial water turbidity 3 1 turbidity of the raw water fig 2 shows the seasonal variation of the turbidity of the raw water for the year 2017 that fed the local treatment plant in patras greece with 1000 to 2500 m3 per hour as fig 1 shows in the first quarter of the year and particularly for the months january and february the raw water that entered the treatment plant had turbidity values above 10 ntu and for some weeks the turbidity values exceeded the value of 100 ntu and in few cases reached the huge value of 1000 ntu in the second quarter of 2017 the raw water had turbidity values in the range up to 10 ntu and few peaks were appeared according to rainfalls for may and some days in june the third quarter of 2017 which includes summer months shows that the water that was coming from glafkos river had very low concentrations of particles apart from a week in july and a week in august due to storms occurred in the local area those days the most troubled period with high particle concentrations was the fourth quarter of the year due to prolonged rainfall where values for turbidity above 100 ntu were observed which in many cases reached 1000 ntu the aforementioned discussion on the turbidity of the raw water is related to the process of coagulation that is used in local and many others drinking water treatment plants the treatment of the raw water starts with the injection of electrolyte upon it arrives in the treatment station and the injection polyelectrolyte in the primary sedimentation tank the selection of the appropriate doses of both electrolyte and polyelectrolyte were based on empirical equations which linearly correlate added amount of electrolyte or polyelectrolyte with the turbidity of the raw water so for many days or even many weeks a year large concentrations of reagents were used to enhance the coagulation flocculation of the suspended particles concentrations that may not needed and probably caused problems since overact doses of aluminum remained in the residual sludge and in treated water the choice of concentration of electrolyte and polyelectrolyte were based on empirical formulas that calculates the electrolyte eq 1 and polyelectrolyte eq 2 as a function of the turbidity 1 celectrolyte 0 103113 x turbidity values 8 433543 eq 1 is used for the evaluation of the appropriate dose of alum only when the turbidity was above 8 5 ntu polyelectrolyte was added only when the turbidity value was exceeded the value of 9 5 ntu in order microflocs from coagulation process to be gathered in larger flocs and the sedimentation to be enhanced for turbidity values less than 8 5 ntu the choice of the appropriate dose is done on the experience of the trained personnel of the treatment unit the estimation of the appropriate pam dose was done using eq 2 2 cpolyelectrolyte 0 0013 x turbidity values 0 012 thus for the case of low turbidity values small or non doses of alum and pam were used in these cases the duty for the removal of the suspended particles was transferred to the sand bed filtration process which is effective for the treatment of water with relatively low concentrations of suspended particles however the problems with the use of alum pac and pam appeared for the case of high turbidity values which was typical case in days with storms or high raining days in areas that feed glafkos river fig 1 at those days treatment plant calculates high doses of alum pac and pam according to eqs 1 and 2 for example for turbidity values in the range of 100 1000 ntu the concentration of alum fluctuated in the range of 20 100 mg l which are considered as extremely high concentrations if aluminium ions are not been consumed during the coagulation process eq 1 was also used incorrectly for the evaluation of the appropriate doses of pac alum and pac are useful only for the destabilization of small charged colloidal particles and not for non colloidal particles e g particles with mean size larger than 10 μm fig 3 shows the estimated values of coagulant and of the combination of coagulant plus the flocculant pam concentrations based on the empirical correlations eqs 1 and 2 illustrated as straight lines and the used doses of coagulants square symbols or combination of coagulant and pam triangular symbols that were used in the experimental study and resulted in the reduction of the 98 of suspended particles it is obvious that the procedure that was followed up to day and was based on the linear correlation of electrolytes and or polyelectrolyte doses with turbidity were not correct the results included in the present work showed that the high quantities of electrolytes added in solutions with turbidity values higher 50 ntu did not affect the precipitation and rather caused problems to coagulation since they re stabilized the suspended particles in all experiments with initial measured turbidity value larger than 50 ntu it was found that main part of turbidity was due to large solid particles larger than 10 μm up to 100 μm these particles are not colloidal particles which need destabilization of their surface electrical charge and most of them would precipitate alone in the sedimentation tank the extravagant dose of electrolyte will change the negative charge of the suspended particles to positive far from the isoelectric point where zeta potential becomes equal to zero another negative effect of the overdosing procedure is that the extra quantity of the added electrolyte will remain in the treated water and goes to the consumption chain thus the undesired contamination of the treated water with aluminium ions is not avoided the experimental study showed that small concentrations of electrolytes and polyelectrolytes can act properly for the removal of the suspended particles from raw waters with high turbidity values since the major part of the turbidity was due to the large particles that can be precipitated alone thanks to their own gravity more results are given in the next section where the effects of other parameters related to the destabilization of the colloidal particles are taken also into the discussion 4 effect of used coagulants in raw water treatment in the first parametric series experiments were carried out with raw waters with initial turbidity values of ranging from 50 ntu to 250 ntu the calculation of the appropriate doses of coagulant and or flocculant was done according to the data of the process followed until today using the linear equations 1 2 with an account of the initial turbidity value the use of aluminum sulfate and polyaluminium chloride give good results in terms of the removal of initial turbidity at the predicted values but the used doses were quite large thus high concentrations of aluminium ions remained in the treated water and among other things a very big drop in the ph value was observed followed by a significant hardness increase especially in the case of pac the 1st experimental series was repeated with much less concentration of coagulants and flocculants where again high removal rates of the initial turbidity were observed therefore experiments with low concentrations of alum 15 mg l and pac 20 mg l were designed and the effect of pam polyelectrolyte as flocculant was examined 4 1 alum and pac dosing and performance in the 1st series of experiments the effect of the concentration of aluminum sulfate al2 so4 3 16h2o on the reduction of raw water initial turbidity was investigated doses of 3 to 65 mg l of alum were used for turbidity values of 50 to 250 ntu as fig 4 a shows it is clear that doses of alum from 10 mg l to 30 mg l removed more than 97 of the suspended particles what is interesting in fig 4a is the fact that for the raw water with initial turbidity of 227 ntu the removal efficiency was higher than in those with lower initial turbidity values 110 and 55 ntu this remark confirms the previous discussion where it was concluded that the real turbidity value is not the one that arrives at the inlet of treatment station but the turbidity that reflects the concentration of the colloidal particles which remained in the suspension and cannot be precipitated alone because of their gravity fig 4b shows the reduction of the turbidity as a function of the dose of the second electrolyte that is discussed in the present work the pac pac found to behave as a good coagulant like alum since the reduction of the initial turbidity was up to 99 for the same range of doses of electrolyte again here it is clear that a dose of electrolyte in the range of 5 20 mg l reached turbidity reduction values up to 98 the remaining turbidity is due to some colloidal particles which readily will be removed in the next processing step in the gravity filter system in the aforementioned series of experiments with alum turbidity reduction values up to 98 were obtained without the use of flocculant earning the cost of pam and avoiding the neurological problems caused by the presence of the polyacrylamide substances as table 1 shows the major part of the turbidity reflects the particles that are quite heavy and can precipitate alone without the use of a coagulant or a flocculant sand grains or silt or clay particles and suspended organic matter present in turbid water have specific gravity between 1 04 and 2 65 the particles having specific gravity more than 1 2 can precipitate more easily while the lighter particles do not settle readily and their removal becomes difficult the velocity of flow transporting a particle horizontally the viscosity of liquid offering frictional resistance and the size and shape of particles oppose the settlement of particles the process of plain sedimentation may remove about 60 of the suspended matter and 75 of bacteria thus plain sedimentation can reduce high loads on sandbed filters the high temperature correct ph value proper inlet and outlet flows large retention periods and appropriate dimensions are the favorable conditions for an effective sedimentation measurements in the jar test experiments indicated that with a pre treatment time equal to the clarification coagulation flocculation sedimentation treatment time the values of turbidity reduction ranged from 40 to 80 percent table 1 the smaller percentages correspond to smaller turbidity initial values 50 110 ntu while the larger ones in great initial turbidity 210 260 ntu having thus raw water with initial turbidity 55 ntu the user shall calculate coagulant dose for 32 ntu initial turbidity from the pre sedimentation output while respectively for turbidity of 265 ntu the user will need coagulant for just 55 ntu turbidity fig 5 shows the effect of alum and pac on some of the major parameters that influence the quality of the treated water such as the ph the conductivity and the concentration of total solids ts fig 5a and b show that doses of alum and pac over 10 mg l resulted in the substantial reduction of the ph of the treated water thus despite the fact that high turbidity reduction rates could be obtained at high concentrations 10 mg l of coagulants these doses shall be avoided because reduction of ph below 6 5 in drinking water is not recommended by the international institutions environmental protection agency world health organization 41 32 fluctuations on the conductivity of the treated water as a function of electrolyte doses are illustrated in fig 5c and d conductivity in most of potable water shall be closed to 0 6 ms cm and reduction up to 0 2 ms cm which was observed in fig 5c and d shall be avoided fig 5e and f shows the total solids concentration as a function of electrolyte doses for alum and pac again here fluctuations of ts values are observed in fig 5e and f for the case of alum fig 5e shows that for the cases of raw water with turbidity values of 55 and 110 ntu there was a reduction on solids concentration whereas for the case of experiment with 227 ntu a re stabilization of the suspended particles was observed probably of the change of the negative electrical charge to positive electrical charge that maintains the charged particles suspended in the solution the effect of the doses of alum and pac on the electrical charge of the suspended particles can be better explained by the investigation of particle s ζ potential as shown in the experiments in the second series ζ potential is a measure of the electrical surface charge of the particles and is the main index of the destabilization or the stabilization of suspended material of the solutions fig 6 a and b shows that ζ potential values are very sensible on the concentration of electrolytes again here is obvious that electrolyte doses larger than 10 mg l resulted in the reduction of ζ potential to more negative values it is known the stabilization of suspended particles occurs at high negative 20 mv or high positive values 20 mv if destabilization is intended one shall choose doses of electrolytes which limit ζ potential in the range of 2 mv to 8 mv 42 depending on the nature of the suspended particles a large variation of electrolyte may lead to the change of ζ potential from positive values to negative values case of initial turbidity of 227 ntu in fig 6a or to inverse the negative charge to positive values case of initial value of 106 ntu in fig 6b unfortunately fig 6a and b didn t show a range of electrolyte dose that will limit ζ potential to the range of 5 and 5 mv however values close to 10 mv or even close to 20 mv suggest that the solutions can be destabilized and particles will reach each other and form microflocs that subsequently will be gathered by a flocculant to form large and heavy flocs and precipitate seasonal april through may changes that occur naturally to the raw incoming water supply at this location zeta potential measurements can be used as indicators of optimal dosage for flocculating agents zeta potential as an indicator of particle stability and charge and turbidity as an indicator of optical clarity and particle presence together they are good tools for determining the effectiveness of agents as well as optimizing the efficiency and economy of the operation of a water treatment facility frequent measurements of zeta potential have replaced the need to conduct jar tests to determine alum dose 43 5 study on the performance of synthetic polymer and biocoagulants on the removal of river water turbidity polymeric flocculants were mainly selected as alternative agents for coagulation and flocculation and for the reduction of the problems that are caused using the inorganic electrolytes ph reduction conductivity and tss increase and harmful effects to human health however the flocculation mechanisms are not the same in polymeric and inorganic flocculants and shall be taken into accounts when a water treatment process is to be designed as reported in stechemesser et al 44 and bratby 11 inorganic electrolytes can form multi charged polynuclear complexes with enhanced adsorption properties when are added in colloidal aqueous suspensions these metal inorganic coagulants can rapidly be hydrolyzed and result in direct colloidal destabilization since they neutralize the negative charge of the colloids and allow forming of aggregates and consequently enhance the sedimentation however this rapid hydrolysis is carried out in an unsustainable manner and the destabilization performance depends on the effectiveness of rapid mixing dosage change in ph temperature and nature of the solution which determine which type of hydrolysis is effective this is referred to as a major disadvantage because there is inability to control the nature of the hydrolysis species formed when the coagulant is introduced into the solution on the other hand the polymeric flocculants of the various structures can act either by polymer bridging or by load neutralization or by applying both mechanisms at the same time according to elimelech 45 flocculation is a very complex process involving 5 stages a mixing the polymer with the colloidal particles b the polymer molecules adhere to the surface of the colloids c reassembling the polymer molecules on the surface of the particle d coagulation of the particles and e the degradation of the agglomerates due to the shear during the rotary mixing of the suspension all of this can be both concurrent and competitive and often compete the present study involves study of the ζ potential and polymer adsorption of the flocculated particles as a function of polymer dosage for better understanding of the flocculation mechanism operating for each charged polymer polymer charge density influences the configuration in solution since for a given molecular weight the charge density increases and stretches the polymer chains through increasing electrostatic repulsion between charged units thereby increasing the viscosity of the polymer solution 5 1 pdadmac dosing and performance in the 3rd experimental series the effect of the concentration of the inorganic synthetic polymer polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride c8h16ncl n on the main physicochemical properties of the raw water was studied doses of 0 5 to 80 mg l were tested for initial turbidity values of 50 to 350 ntu the reduction of turbidity for all electrolyte doses was over 70 while best results are obtained at turbidities over 200 ntu with small coagulant doses 0 8 8 mg l as fig 7 shows pdadmac doses over 10 mg l resulted in the deterioration of the removal of initial turbidity as it happened in the case of alum and pac values of pdadmac dose close to 0 1 mg l didn t help the removal of particles and the best performance took place at pdadmac doses close to 1 mg l while in the case of alum and pac the corresponding best performance in terms of all parameters under consideration was from 10 to 30 mg l as for the physicochemical parameters are concerned fig 8 a to 8d showed that values of pdadmac close to 1 mg l do not alter dramatically the values of those parameters fig 8a shows that the variation of the ph of the treated water was close to 7 for the entire and wide range of the tested doses of pdadmac similar conclusions can be derived from fig 8b where the conductivity of the treated water was plotted against the doses of pdadmac in all cases the conductivity remained close to 0 5 ms cm acceptable value for drinking waters apart for the case where the concentration of the polyelectrolyte reached the 100 mg l fig 8c shows the effect of pdadmac dose on the concentration of total solids that remained suspended in the treated water again the best performance in terms the lowest concentration of suspended particles was observed for low doses of pdadmac and the treatment of any kind of raw water with initial turbidity values in the range of 50 to 300 ntu shall not exceed the 10 mg l for values above 10 mg l the ts concentration increased leading to the conclusion that the destabilized particles at low concentrations were re stabilized again at high concentrations and the particles repelled each other this is also shown and explained in fig 8d where the zeta potential was plotted again the doses of pdadmac fig 8d shows that at very low concentrations close to 0 1 mg l or far from the optimum value which seemed to be the 1 mg l the electrical charge of the particles remained high positive or negative and in some cases there is inversion on mean value of the zeta potential of the suspended particles from negative values to positive high values 5 2 chitosan dosing and performance in experiments of 4th series the effect of the natural polymer chitosan was examined doses from 0 1 to 110 mg l were used for initial turbidity values of 50 to 250 ntu although the decrease in initial turbidity did not approach the values of alum and pac it was over 75 for almost all electrolyte doses and was higher at lower doses the recommended doses of chitosan are among 1 and 10 mg l for all type of raw waters that are arrived at different initial turbidity values the remaining turbidity in terms of suspended particles can be further treated in the system of sand bed filters where no chemicals are needed as for the other physicochemical parameters fig 10a d shows that values of the natural polymer chitosan among 1 and 10 mg l illustrated the best performance after two hours sedimentation fig 10a shows the ph variation on the dose of chitosan and showed that ph ranged from 6 5 to 8 0 which is according to the environmental standards the same behavior is illustrated in fig 10b where conductivity of the treated water was plotted against the dose of chitosan and few fluctuations from the initial values of conductivity were observed for all tested values of chitosan and for all type of raw waters with different initial turbidity fig 10c shows the ts concentration as a function of chitosan dose and that non important distortion in ts values were observed fig 10d where ζ potential values is plotted against chitosan doses showed that the charge of the suspended particles showed better behavior for small coagulant doses especially close to 10 mg l 5 3 cm inulin dosing and performance in 5th series experiments the effect of the natural polymer carboxymethyl inulin was examined doses of 10 120 mg l were used for initial turbidity values of 50 250 ntu as far as the decrease in turbidity is concerned fig 11 cm inulin worked better at large initial turbidity values and at higher electrolyte doses but is not so effective as the other tested natural polymer the chitosan as for the other physicochemical parameters are concerned fig 12a d showed that values of the cmi among 10 and 100 mg l gave the best performance fig 12a shows the ph variation with cminulin doses and for all tested waters at different initial turbidity values it is clear that the ph in the treated water never moved away from the range 6 5 8 0 set by the rules for drinking water fig 12b where the changes of the conductivity are shown as function of cmi doses suggested not to exceed inulin doses more than 20 mg l because the conductivity increased more than 800 μs cm which is far from the mean conductivity values in tap water 46 as for the total solids fig 12c shows that doses of inulin close to 10 20 mg l kept reasonable concentrations of solids within the treated water but for very large doses the concentration of particles increased significantly finally fig 12d where the ζ potential of the suspended particles is shown suggests that none of the tested values of inulin resulted in the reduction of the zeta potential and all values were in the range of 10 to 20 mv for all types of raw water at different initial turbidity values any action of inulin shall be addressed to the formation of clusters of particles with the polymeric chains and not due to the destabilization of the suspended particles 5 4 comparisons among the suggested polyelectrolytes and the old inorganic electrolytes as figs 4 7 9 and 11 show the turbidity reductions of polymeric flocculants were general lower than those of the case of inorganic electrolytes however the main target of the present work was not to reach a 100 reduction of the turbidity but to suggest new coagulants in order to eliminate the disadvantages of the used of the inorganic electrolyte as pointed above aluminum based electrolytes were found to cause reduction of the ph at high concentrations increase the conductivity and solids concentration and what is more important these electrolytes have accused to cause harm effects to human health as the laboratory experiments show the doses of polymeric flocculants were optimized and show that turbidity reduction values up to 90 94 the remaining turbidity could readily be removed in the sand filtration process that follows the coagulation flocculation process experiments in jar tests were implemented using pdadmac chitosan and cminulin showed that the biopolymers have the potential and the performance to substitute prior used coagulants flocculants in water treatment which were accused to harm human health alzheimer neurological problems experiments showed as we can see in fig 13 a b that their use as coagulant flocculant in potable water has proven to be beneficial because they are effective in small doses allow reduction of quantity and increase the quality of the sludge produced and at the same time their impact on ph and alkalinity is insignificant as reported also in literature concerning pdadmac it was found to be effective as both coagulant and flocculant and its best performance was obtained at very low concentrations close to 1 mg l all tests also determine that it is necessary to include ζ potential in the equitation of reagents dose evaluation since optimum coagulation chemistry is generally known as the lowest dosage of all chemicals that results in the desired removal of contaminants with the lowest total operating costs ζ potential will make the dose estimation more accurate while it evaluate the interfusion of lower coagulant flocculant doses another remarkable conclusion derived from the present study is the fact that the polymeric flocculants show more evident re stabilization at overdose than inorganic coagulants that suggest controlled injection of the polyelectrolytes into water stream and frequent measurements of the tested parameters ζ potential ph tss conductivity etc this re stabilization effect is different among the tested polymers the synthetic polymer pdadmac has high charge density than the charge of the tested water particles which may lead to increase of the factorial growth of ζ potential resulting in particle re stabilization and decrease of sedimentation performance in the case of the natural polymers chitosan and cminoulin the increase of the dose acted gentle to the value of ζ potential with re stabilization to occur mainly because of weakly coherence of flocs 6 conclusions the first scope of this study was the investigation of the effectiveness of the known electrolytes alum and pac and polyelectrolyte pam on the removal of suspended particles in raw water we found out that although they have a very good turbidity reduction response the choice of the appropriate dose based on a linear correlation of turbidity and dose of electrolyte is wrong since the most part of the high turbidity values is due to large particles that can precipitate alone because of their gravity therefore it is suggested a natural pre sedimentation process for up 1 h to take place in order large particles to be removed and then to add doses of electrolytes calculated on the real turbidity values due to the suspended colloidal particles the process of plain sedimentation may remove about 60 suspended matter and 75 bacteria measurements in the jar test experiments indicated that with a pre treatment time equal to the time needed for the coagulation flocculation and sedimentation treatment the values of turbidity reduction ranged from 41 for initial turbidity in the range of 50 100 ntu up to 83 for turbidity values 210 260 ntu as second target of the present work new natural polymers were tested for the coagulation and flocculation of suspended particles contained in river raw water with different initial turbidity values and the already applied coagulation flocculation process was revisited and evaluated for its effectiveness experiments using pdadmac chitosan and cminulin showed that the biopolymers have the potential and the performance to substitute prior used coagulants flocculants in water treatment which were accused to harm human health alzheimer neurological problems also experiments show that ζ potential measurements are key parameters to monitoring and maintaining optimal conditions in water treatment facilities this can be especially important during upsets or naturally occurring seasonal changes in water production 
14473,water treatment plants treat flushy raw waters and the majority use electrolytes and polyelectrolytes for the removal of the solid and organic impurities included in surface waters the dose of the used reagents depend strongly on the nature of the incoming surface water and its turbidity turbidity is due to the suspended particles in the source water and up to date is main criterion for the appropriate choice of the electrolyte and polyelectrolyte nature and dosage one of the main findings of the present work is that the selection of the appropriate dose of coagulants and flocculants as a linear function of turbidity is not right especially for the large values of turbidity the most common electrolytes aluminum sulfate and polyaluminiumchloride together with the polyelectrolyte polyacrylamide are tested for their effectiveness in the removal of suspended particles and their results discussed based on the particle s ζ potential and size distribution these common reagents have raised public health concerns due to the residual aluminium and acrylamide which remain in treated water and at produced sludge thus the present work examined and suggests the use of polymers as the natural chitosan and cminulin and the synthetic polydiallyldimethylammoniumchloride as alternative environmentally friendly coagulants for their performance on the treatment of potable water the new reagents proved to reduce the turbidity of the surface water up to 96 keywords water treatment coagulant flocculant chitosan cminulin pdadmac 1 introduction drinking water must be safe for the health of the consumers and contain all the elements that make it drinkable e g the correct ph the correct mineral concentration and the absence of any kind of micro organisms its quality shall be ensured by the authorities of municipal treatment plant since it is an indicator of the health and well being of a local society drinking water from any source lakes rivers underground water and sea should be carefully and thoroughly processing before consumption removal of turbidity from river water is a problem faced by water treatment plants for producing potable water the properties of the raw water depend on the amounts of dissolved inorganic organic materials and gases and the presence of any microbial content the most noticeable properties in the raw and treated water are inorganic and organic matter concentration ph temperature turbidity color conductivity hardness and the presence of pathogenic or non pathogenic microorganisms the selection of the appropriate treatment method for the raw water depends mainly on the nature and the origin of the water and the demands set by the end user 1 usually groundwater is clean enough and only reagents for disinfection are added for the protection from pathogenic bacteria sea water treatment is performed with reverse osmosis or nanofiltration processes to reduce the high salinity concentrations surface waters lakes or rivers are the most common sources for the production of drinking water and their effective treatment usually involves a combined scheme of physicochemical processes such as coagulation flocculation filtration in gravity or pressure filters and disinfection coagulation and flocculation occur in successive steps aimed to overcome the forces stabilizing the suspended particles in the aqueous solution in coagulation which is the most important physicochemical operation in potable water treatment coagulants are added in order to reduce the electrical charge among the suspended particles and respectively in flocculation flocculants are added to enhance the collision and the growth of flocs in this regard it should be pointed out that dosage of destabilisation reagent is a very important factor influencing the overall quality of the purified water as well as the economy of the purification process 2 in most cases the particles in natural waters have a strong negative charge on their surfaces that forces particle to remain far from each forming stable solutions with suspended particles means coagulants destabilize the colloidal particles allowing the creation of micro flocs extra addition of flocculant reagents helps the aggregation of microflocs to form larger and denser flocs that can be easier precipitated in sedimentation tanks 3 electrolytes such as alum aluminum sulfate al2so4 and pac polyaluminium chloride alncl 3n m oh m are widely used as coagulants while pam polyacrylamide c3h5no n is used as a flocculant of the formed microflocs by the electrolytes 4 5 despite the fact that alum pac and pam are quite effective in the removal of suspended particles there is a great debate on the problems caused on public health due to the amount of aluminium ions that are remained after the treatment with alum and pac and are associated with the alzheimer s disease 6 8 and the presence of acrylamide which also has been accused as a threat for human health because it causes neurological disorders 9 11 however alum and pac are still in use in many municipal and industrial plants because the cost of these electrolytes is quite low and affordable for industrial applications beyond the problems for human health the use of alum creates technical problems renault et al 12 reported that alum produces abundant sludge that is difficult to dehydrate and treated further the formed flocs are not very well resistant to external mechanical distortions and the removal efficiency depends strongly on the ph moreover the use of polyaluminum chloride and polyacrylamide in this process has more drawbacks such as the fact that it reduces water alkalinity it is strongly ph dependent and it can cause secondary pollution through the disposal of the produced sludge therefore the present work focuses on the investigation of new reagents based on natural material as the chitosan and inulin and a new synthetic polymer the polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride pdadmac that could form complexes and would harm human s health pdadmac has found to work effectively for the removal of suspended particles and part of the organic heavy load of agroindustrial wastewaters 13 14 chitosan is reported as an eco friendly approach 12 15 for the treatment of water in different application in fields such as engineering biotechnology pharmaceuticals etc chitosan is a biodegradable polymer nontoxic with high molecular weight linear cationic chain 16 ran yang et al 15 reported the use of chitosan based flocculants for the removal of different pollutants as inorganic suspended solids heavy metals humic acid microorganism raw natural water textile and paper production effluents etc according to the report of zeng et al 17 where the effectiveness of chitosan with traditional chemical flocculants was compared the required dosage of chitosan is less the process shows a faster depositing velocity a higher efficiency in the removal of cod ss and metal ions and the obtained sludge can be treated more easily compared with sludge received with classic flocculants e g pam chitosan was also reported as a reagent that is used in hybrid material which is composed of two or more different components in one polymeric matrix a second natural compound known for its extra flocculant properties is the carboxymethyl inulin cmi or cminulin the efficiency of cmi has been studied in different aqueous suspensions and is considered also as a novel flocculant for wastewater treatment 18 the potential of using biopolymers chitosan and inulin in the coagulation process has received limited attention so far 16 19 while many studies have focused on their use for industrial waste treatment apart from the natural coagulants the organic polyelectrolyte pdadmac has been studied as well for its effectiveness in the removal of suspended particles pdadmac is a high charge density polyelectrolyte which has been effective in the removal of hydrophobic natural organic matter nom 20 21 an important advantage of pdadmac is the fact that during the coagulation flocculation process smaller amounts of sludge is produced which is easier to dewater in bauer et al 22 results for flocculation and stabilization of colloidal particles are presented at very low concentrations of pdamac or other copolymers of dadmac 0 1 0 3 mg l this is a promising result that fewer polymers will be needed for the treatment of raw waters with high initial turbidity values and possible content of natural organic matter since alum and pac are still in practice in many municipal treatment plants the present work revisited the coagulation flocculation processes with alum and pac and evaluated the process for the selection of the proper concentration of electrolytes which is based so far on the turbidity value of the raw water 2 experiment methods and materials the target of the experiments in the coagulation process is to create a small flock that will consist of both the hydrophobic solids and the hydrophilic organic suspended solids the choice of the optimum dose of each flocculant was made by a combination of observations and measurements particularly based on the measurements of the ζ potential the suspended and dissolved solids particle size distribution and the uv254 absorption it was observed that the suspended solids in the test samples are characterized by a negative charge negative values of ζ potential the cationic character of the electrolytes was of vital importance in neutralizing the ζ potential so as to produce the desired effects in reducing turbidity the decrease in ph and the cod values are key factors for the selection and dose of the flocculant 2 1 methods 2 1 1 experimental arrangement jar test the experimental procedure must be representative of the water treatment unit so as to provide useful results there are several critical parameters to consider such as the intensity and duration of the mixing process as well as the settling time the jar test procedure fig 1 was followed in order to carry out the experimental series in this work so as to select and quantify an appropriate treatment schedule to remove the suspended solids from raw water the tests are carried out on the floc 6 device from raypa company where six beakers of 600 ml each were used initially a coagulant is added with fast stirring 1min 250rpm taking place followed by flocculation of the system with or without the addition of flocculant with gentle stirring 10min 50rpm taking place afterwards the system is allowed to precipitate for 90 min and finally samples were taken from the supernatant formed subsequently measurements of turbidity ph ts tss tds zeta potential uv254 conductivity hardness alkalinity particle size etc were carried out for further analysis and processing 2 1 2 turbidity measurement method turbidity is a measure of purity and therefore of the quality of water it is formed by insoluble and suspended particles organic or inorganic contained in water it was measured on the device smart3 colorimeter of lamotte company which compares the radiation scattered by the particles contained in the sample with that scattered by a reference standard sample 2 1 3 ζ or z potential measurement method the ζ potential is a measure of the electrical potential of the particles and indicates the repulsive interaction among them the charge of the particles is determined by measuring their speed as they move due to electrophoresis ζ potential with a zero value or a value near zero means that the conditions for the aggregation of particles are optimum 23 zeta potential is an indirect evaluation of particle surface charge evaluating electrokinetic properties as related to coagulant dose 24 26 so zeta analyzers represent the best available analytical technology for optimizing the coagulation of difficult to treat waters 27 therefore by monitoring the zeta potential the use of flocculants can be adjusted to determine optimal doses for the coagulation flocculation process 28 studies in the laboratory have shown that when operating in a ζ potential range between 10 mv and 5 mv the removal of particles and colloids in raw water is maximized 29 ζ potential and conductivity were measured at the zetasizer nanos device of malvern company 2 1 4 total solids ts measurement method total solids are the solid residue in a sample of water after evaporation at 105 c and weighing they are a measure of the suspended solids tss and dissolved solids tds present in water high values of total solids reduce the purity of water the total solids contained in the samples were measured by standard methods method 2540b the mlw oven and the shimadzu auw220 analytical balance were used 2 2 materials aluminum sulfate al2 so4

polymers in the treatment of surface water of the glafkos river in patras drinking water treatment plant in achaia region therefore in the present study the effect of the doses of the already used electrolytes alum and pac and the effect of new polymers one synthetic pdadmac and two natural ch and cmi on the removal of solid content were studied with the help of parameters such as zeta potential and ph conductivity and suspended solids concentration ts today water from glafkos river is processed in the local treatment plant with polyaluminium chloride as a coagulant and polyacrylamide as a flocculant few years ago aluminium sulfate was used as coagulant but it was abandoned because of the quality and the quantity of the precipitated sludge pac reduces the amount of the precipitated sludge but the concentration of aluminium anions in water has not improved aluminium anion concentration in water according to stash 3904 1997 ics 130600 water quality 30 and european standard ec80 778 eec quality of water intended for human consumption 31 must be near the value 0 05 mg l and with the maximum allowed peak of 0 2 mg l 32 33 polyacrylamide has already reported as reagent which causes problems and its limits has been set to 0 2 ppb in drinking waters 34 because of the link between aluminium anion exposure and alzheimer s disease development 35 38 and of the link of acrylamide with health risks such as neurological disorders and male reproductive organs 39 40 it is necessary that the process of coagulation flocculation is optimized and dosages of aluminium ions al3 and of polyacrylamide in treated water are kept below the above values moreover the use of polyaluminium chloride and polyacrylamide in this process has additional drawbacks such as the fact that it reduces water alkalinity it is strongly ph dependent and it can cause secondary pollution through the disposal of the produced sludge furthermore the non optimal chemical dosing of electrolytes and or polyelectrolytes may cause more problems than the initial water turbidity 3 1 turbidity of the raw water fig 2 shows the seasonal variation of the turbidity of the raw water for the year 2017 that fed the local treatment plant in patras greece with 1000 to 2500 m3 per hour as fig 1 shows in the first quarter of the year and particularly for the months january and february the raw water that entered the treatment plant had turbidity values above 10 ntu and for some weeks the turbidity values exceeded the value of 100 ntu and in few cases reached the huge value of 1000 ntu in the second quarter of 2017 the raw water had turbidity values in the range up to 10 ntu and few peaks were appeared according to rainfalls for may and some days in june the third quarter of 2017 which includes summer months shows that the water that was coming from glafkos river had very low concentrations of particles apart from a week in july and a week in august due to storms occurred in the local area those days the most troubled period with high particle concentrations was the fourth quarter of the year due to prolonged rainfall where values for turbidity above 100 ntu were observed which in many cases reached 1000 ntu the aforementioned discussion on the turbidity of the raw water is related to the process of coagulation that is used in local and many others drinking water treatment plants the treatment of the raw water starts with the injection of electrolyte upon it arrives in the treatment station and the injection polyelectrolyte in the primary sedimentation tank the selection of the appropriate doses of both electrolyte and polyelectrolyte were based on empirical equations which linearly correlate added amount of electrolyte or polyelectrolyte with the turbidity of the raw water so for many days or even many weeks a year large concentrations of reagents were used to enhance the coagulation flocculation of the suspended particles concentrations that may not needed and probably caused problems since overact doses of aluminum remained in the residual sludge and in treated water the choice of concentration of electrolyte and polyelectrolyte were based on empirical formulas that calculates the electrolyte eq 1 and polyelectrolyte eq 2 as a function of the turbidity 1 celectrolyte 0 103113 x turbidity values 8 433543 eq 1 is used for the evaluation of the appropriate dose of alum only when the turbidity was above 8 5 ntu polyelectrolyte was added only when the turbidity value was exceeded the value of 9 5 ntu in order microflocs from coagulation process to be gathered in larger flocs and the sedimentation to be enhanced for turbidity values less than 8 5 ntu the choice of the appropriate dose is done on the experience of the trained personnel of the treatment unit the estimation of the appropriate pam dose was done using eq 2 2 cpolyelectrolyte 0 0013 x turbidity values 0 012 thus for the case of low turbidity values small or non doses of alum and pam were used in these cases the duty for the removal of the suspended particles was transferred to the sand bed filtration process which is effective for the treatment of water with relatively low concentrations of suspended particles however the problems with the use of alum pac and pam appeared for the case of high turbidity values which was typical case in days with storms or high raining days in areas that feed glafkos river fig 1 at those days treatment plant calculates high doses of alum pac and pam according to eqs 1 and 2 for example for turbidity values in the range of 100 1000 ntu the concentration of alum fluctuated in the range of 20 100 mg l which are considered as extremely high concentrations if aluminium ions are not been consumed during the coagulation process eq 1 was also used incorrectly for the evaluation of the appropriate doses of pac alum and pac are useful only for the destabilization of small charged colloidal particles and not for non colloidal particles e g particles with mean size larger than 10 μm fig 3 shows the estimated values of coagulant and of the combination of coagulant plus the flocculant pam concentrations based on the empirical correlations eqs 1 and 2 illustrated as straight lines and the used doses of coagulants square symbols or combination of coagulant and pam triangular symbols that were used in the experimental study and resulted in the reduction of the 98 of suspended particles it is obvious that the procedure that was followed up to day and was based on the linear correlation of electrolytes and or polyelectrolyte doses with turbidity were not correct the results included in the present work showed that the high quantities of electrolytes added in solutions with turbidity values higher 50 ntu did not affect the precipitation and rather caused problems to coagulation since they re stabilized the suspended particles in all experiments with initial measured turbidity value larger than 50 ntu it was found that main part of turbidity was due to large solid particles larger than 10 μm up to 100 μm these particles are not colloidal particles which need destabilization of their surface electrical charge and most of them would precipitate alone in the sedimentation tank the extravagant dose of electrolyte will change the negative charge of the suspended particles to positive far from the isoelectric point where zeta potential becomes equal to zero another negative effect of the overdosing procedure is that the extra quantity of the added electrolyte will remain in the treated water and goes to the consumption chain thus the undesired contamination of the treated water with aluminium ions is not avoided the experimental study showed that small concentrations of electrolytes and polyelectrolytes can act properly for the removal of the suspended particles from raw waters with high turbidity values since the major part of the turbidity was due to the large particles that can be precipitated alone thanks to their own gravity more results are given in the next section where the effects of other parameters related to the destabilization of the colloidal particles are taken also into the discussion 4 effect of used coagulants in raw water treatment in the first parametric series experiments were carried out with raw waters with initial turbidity values of ranging from 50 ntu to 250 ntu the calculation of the appropriate doses of coagulant and or flocculant was done according to the data of the process followed until today using the linear equations 1 2 with an account of the initial turbidity value the use of aluminum sulfate and polyaluminium chloride give good results in terms of the removal of initial turbidity at the predicted values but the used doses were quite large thus high concentrations of aluminium ions remained in the treated water and among other things a very big drop in the ph value was observed followed by a significant hardness increase especially in the case of pac the 1st experimental series was repeated with much less concentration of coagulants and flocculants where again high removal rates of the initial turbidity were observed therefore experiments with low concentrations of alum 15 mg l and pac 20 mg l were designed and the effect of pam polyelectrolyte as flocculant was examined 4 1 alum and pac dosing and performance in the 1st series of experiments the effect of the concentration of aluminum sulfate al2 so4 3 16h2o on the reduction of raw water initial turbidity was investigated doses of 3 to 65 mg l of alum were used for turbidity values of 50 to 250 ntu as fig 4 a shows it is clear that doses of alum from 10 mg l to 30 mg l removed more than 97 of the suspended particles what is interesting in fig 4a is the fact that for the raw water with initial turbidity of 227 ntu the removal efficiency was higher than in those with lower initial turbidity values 110 and 55 ntu this remark confirms the previous discussion where it was concluded that the real turbidity value is not the one that arrives at the inlet of treatment station but the turbidity that reflects the concentration of the colloidal particles which remained in the suspension and cannot be precipitated alone because of their gravity fig 4b shows the reduction of the turbidity as a function of the dose of the second electrolyte that is discussed in the present work the pac pac found to behave as a good coagulant like alum since the reduction of the initial turbidity was up to 99 for the same range of doses of electrolyte again here it is clear that a dose of electrolyte in the range of 5 20 mg l reached turbidity reduction values up to 98 the remaining turbidity is due to some colloidal particles which readily will be removed in the next processing step in the gravity filter system in the aforementioned series of experiments with alum turbidity reduction values up to 98 were obtained without the use of flocculant earning the cost of pam and avoiding the neurological problems caused by the presence of the polyacrylamide substances as table 1 shows the major part of the turbidity reflects the particles that are quite heavy and can precipitate alone without the use of a coagulant or a flocculant sand grains or silt or clay particles and suspended organic matter present in turbid water have specific gravity between 1 04 and 2 65 the particles having specific gravity more than 1 2 can precipitate more easily while the lighter particles do not settle readily and their removal becomes difficult the velocity of flow transporting a particle horizontally the viscosity of liquid offering frictional resistance and the size and shape of particles oppose the settlement of particles the process of plain sedimentation may remove about 60 of the suspended matter and 75 of bacteria thus plain sedimentation can reduce high loads on sandbed filters the high temperature correct ph value proper inlet and outlet flows large retention periods and appropriate dimensions are the favorable conditions for an effective sedimentation measurements in the jar test experiments indicated that with a pre treatment time equal to the clarification coagulation flocculation sedimentation treatment time the values of turbidity reduction ranged from 40 to 80 percent table 1 the smaller percentages correspond to smaller turbidity initial values 50 110 ntu while the larger ones in great initial turbidity 210 260 ntu having thus raw water with initial turbidity 55 ntu the user shall calculate coagulant dose for 32 ntu initial turbidity from the pre sedimentation output while respectively for turbidity of 265 ntu the user will need coagulant for just 55 ntu turbidity fig 5 shows the effect of alum and pac on some of the major parameters that influence the quality of the treated water such as the ph the conductivity and the concentration of total solids ts fig 5a and b show that doses of alum and pac over 10 mg l resulted in the substantial reduction of the ph of the treated water thus despite the fact that high turbidity reduction rates could be obtained at high concentrations 10 mg l of coagulants these doses shall be avoided because reduction of ph below 6 5 in drinking water is not recommended by the international institutions environmental protection agency world health organization 41 32 fluctuations on the conductivity of the treated water as a function of electrolyte doses are illustrated in fig 5c and d conductivity in most of potable water shall be closed to 0 6 ms cm and reduction up to 0 2 ms cm which was observed in fig 5c and d shall be avoided fig 5e and f shows the total solids concentration as a function of electrolyte doses for alum and pac again here fluctuations of ts values are observed in fig 5e and f for the case of alum fig 5e shows that for the cases of raw water with turbidity values of 55 and 110 ntu there was a reduction on solids concentration whereas for the case of experiment with 227 ntu a re stabilization of the suspended particles was observed probably of the change of the negative electrical charge to positive electrical charge that maintains the charged particles suspended in the solution the effect of the doses of alum and pac on the electrical charge of the suspended particles can be better explained by the investigation of particle s ζ potential as shown in the experiments in the second series ζ potential is a measure of the electrical surface charge of the particles and is the main index of the destabilization or the stabilization of suspended material of the solutions fig 6 a and b shows that ζ potential values are very sensible on the concentration of electrolytes again here is obvious that electrolyte doses larger than 10 mg l resulted in the reduction of ζ potential to more negative values it is known the stabilization of suspended particles occurs at high negative 20 mv or high positive values 20 mv if destabilization is intended one shall choose doses of electrolytes which limit ζ potential in the range of 2 mv to 8 mv 42 depending on the nature of the suspended particles a large variation of electrolyte may lead to the change of ζ potential from positive values to negative values case of initial turbidity of 227 ntu in fig 6a or to inverse the negative charge to positive values case of initial value of 106 ntu in fig 6b unfortunately fig 6a and b didn t show a range of electrolyte dose that will limit ζ potential to the range of 5 and 5 mv however values close to 10 mv or even close to 20 mv suggest that the solutions can be destabilized and particles will reach each other and form microflocs that subsequently will be gathered by a flocculant to form large and heavy flocs and precipitate seasonal april through may changes that occur naturally to the raw incoming water supply at this location zeta potential measurements can be used as indicators of optimal dosage for flocculating agents zeta potential as an indicator of particle stability and charge and turbidity as an indicator of optical clarity and particle presence together they are good tools for determining the effectiveness of agents as well as optimizing the efficiency and economy of the operation of a water treatment facility frequent measurements of zeta potential have replaced the need to conduct jar tests to determine alum dose 43 5 study on the performance of synthetic polymer and biocoagulants on the removal of river water turbidity polymeric flocculants were mainly selected as alternative agents for coagulation and flocculation and for the reduction of the problems that are caused using the inorganic electrolytes ph reduction conductivity and tss increase and harmful effects to human health however the flocculation mechanisms are not the same in polymeric and inorganic flocculants and shall be taken into accounts when a water treatment process is to be designed as reported in stechemesser et al 44 and bratby 11 inorganic electrolytes can form multi charged polynuclear complexes with enhanced adsorption properties when are added in colloidal aqueous suspensions these metal inorganic coagulants can rapidly be hydrolyzed and result in direct colloidal destabilization since they neutralize the negative charge of the colloids and allow forming of aggregates and consequently enhance the sedimentation however this rapid hydrolysis is carried out in an unsustainable manner and the destabilization performance depends on the effectiveness of rapid mixing dosage change in ph temperature and nature of the solution which determine which type of hydrolysis is effective this is referred to as a major disadvantage because there is inability to control the nature of the hydrolysis species formed when the coagulant is introduced into the solution on the other hand the polymeric flocculants of the various structures can act either by polymer bridging or by load neutralization or by applying both mechanisms at the same time according to elimelech 45 flocculation is a very complex process involving 5 stages a mixing the polymer with the colloidal particles b the polymer molecules adhere to the surface of the colloids c reassembling the polymer molecules on the surface of the particle d coagulation of the particles and e the degradation of the agglomerates due to the shear during the rotary mixing of the suspension all of this can be both concurrent and competitive and often compete the present study involves study of the ζ potential and polymer adsorption of the flocculated particles as a function of polymer dosage for better understanding of the flocculation mechanism operating for each charged polymer polymer charge density influences the configuration in solution since for a given molecular weight the charge density increases and stretches the polymer chains through increasing electrostatic repulsion between charged units thereby increasing the viscosity of the polymer solution 5 1 pdadmac dosing and performance in the 3rd experimental series the effect of the concentration of the inorganic synthetic polymer polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride c8h16ncl n on the main physicochemical properties of the raw water was studied doses of 0 5 to 80 mg l were tested for initial turbidity values of 50 to 350 ntu the reduction of turbidity for all electrolyte doses was over 70 while best results are obtained at turbidities over 200 ntu with small coagulant doses 0 8 8 mg l as fig 7 shows pdadmac doses over 10 mg l resulted in the deterioration of the removal of initial turbidity as it happened in the case of alum and pac values of pdadmac dose close to 0 1 mg l didn t help the removal of particles and the best performance took place at pdadmac doses close to 1 mg l while in the case of alum and pac the corresponding best performance in terms of all parameters under consideration was from 10 to 30 mg l as for the physicochemical parameters are concerned fig 8 a to 8d showed that values of pdadmac close to 1 mg l do not alter dramatically the values of those parameters fig 8a shows that the variation of the ph of the treated water was close to 7 for the entire and wide range of the tested doses of pdadmac similar conclusions can be derived from fig 8b where the conductivity of the treated water was plotted against the doses of pdadmac in all cases the conductivity remained close to 0 5 ms cm acceptable value for drinking waters apart for the case where the concentration of the polyelectrolyte reached the 100 mg l fig 8c shows the effect of pdadmac dose on the concentration of total solids that remained suspended in the treated water again the best performance in terms the lowest concentration of suspended particles was observed for low doses of pdadmac and the treatment of any kind of raw water with initial turbidity values in the range of 50 to 300 ntu shall not exceed the 10 mg l for values above 10 mg l the ts concentration increased leading to the conclusion that the destabilized particles at low concentrations were re stabilized again at high concentrations and the particles repelled each other this is also shown and explained in fig 8d where the zeta potential was plotted again the doses of pdadmac fig 8d shows that at very low concentrations close to 0 1 mg l or far from the optimum value which seemed to be the 1 mg l the electrical charge of the particles remained high positive or negative and in some cases there is inversion on mean value of the zeta potential of the suspended particles from negative values to positive high values 5 2 chitosan dosing and performance in experiments of 4th series the effect of the natural polymer chitosan was examined doses from 0 1 to 110 mg l were used for initial turbidity values of 50 to 250 ntu although the decrease in initial turbidity did not approach the values of alum and pac it was over 75 for almost all electrolyte doses and was higher at lower doses the recommended doses of chitosan are among 1 and 10 mg l for all type of raw waters that are arrived at different initial turbidity values the remaining turbidity in terms of suspended particles can be further treated in the system of sand bed filters where no chemicals are needed as for the other physicochemical parameters fig 10a d shows that values of the natural polymer chitosan among 1 and 10 mg l illustrated the best performance after two hours sedimentation fig 10a shows the ph variation on the dose of chitosan and showed that ph ranged from 6 5 to 8 0 which is according to the environmental standards the same behavior is illustrated in fig 10b where conductivity of the treated water was plotted against the dose of chitosan and few fluctuations from the initial values of conductivity were observed for all tested values of chitosan and for all type of raw waters with different initial turbidity fig 10c shows the ts concentration as a function of chitosan dose and that non important distortion in ts values were observed fig 10d where ζ potential values is plotted against chitosan doses showed that the charge of the suspended particles showed better behavior for small coagulant doses especially close to 10 mg l 5 3 cm inulin dosing and performance in 5th series experiments the effect of the natural polymer carboxymethyl inulin was examined doses of 10 120 mg l were used for initial turbidity values of 50 250 ntu as far as the decrease in turbidity is concerned fig 11 cm inulin worked better at large initial turbidity values and at higher electrolyte doses but is not so effective as the other tested natural polymer the chitosan as for the other physicochemical parameters are concerned fig 12a d showed that values of the cmi among 10 and 100 mg l gave the best performance fig 12a shows the ph variation with cminulin doses and for all tested waters at different initial turbidity values it is clear that the ph in the treated water never moved away from the range 6 5 8 0 set by the rules for drinking water fig 12b where the changes of the conductivity are shown as function of cmi doses suggested not to exceed inulin doses more than 20 mg l because the conductivity increased more than 800 μs cm which is far from the mean conductivity values in tap water 46 as for the total solids fig 12c shows that doses of inulin close to 10 20 mg l kept reasonable concentrations of solids within the treated water but for very large doses the concentration of particles increased significantly finally fig 12d where the ζ potential of the suspended particles is shown suggests that none of the tested values of inulin resulted in the reduction of the zeta potential and all values were in the range of 10 to 20 mv for all types of raw water at different initial turbidity values any action of inulin shall be addressed to the formation of clusters of particles with the polymeric chains and not due to the destabilization of the suspended particles 5 4 comparisons among the suggested polyelectrolytes and the old inorganic electrolytes as figs 4 7 9 and 11 show the turbidity reductions of polymeric flocculants were general lower than those of the case of inorganic electrolytes however the main target of the present work was not to reach a 100 reduction of the turbidity but to suggest new coagulants in order to eliminate the disadvantages of the used of the inorganic electrolyte as pointed above aluminum based electrolytes were found to cause reduction of the ph at high concentrations increase the conductivity and solids concentration and what is more important these electrolytes have accused to cause harm effects to human health as the laboratory experiments show the doses of polymeric flocculants were optimized and show that turbidity reduction values up to 90 94 the remaining turbidity could readily be removed in the sand filtration process that follows the coagulation flocculation process experiments in jar tests were implemented using pdadmac chitosan and cminulin showed that the biopolymers have the potential and the performance to substitute prior used coagulants flocculants in water treatment which were accused to harm human health alzheimer neurological problems experiments showed as we can see in fig 13 a b that their use as coagulant flocculant in potable water has proven to be beneficial because they are effective in small doses allow reduction of quantity and increase the quality of the sludge produced and at the same time their impact on ph and alkalinity is insignificant as reported also in literature concerning pdadmac it was found to be effective as both coagulant and flocculant and its best performance was obtained at very low concentrations close to 1 mg l all tests also determine that it is necessary to include ζ potential in the equitation of reagents dose evaluation since optimum coagulation chemistry is generally known as the lowest dosage of all chemicals that results in the desired removal of contaminants with the lowest total operating costs ζ potential will make the dose estimation more accurate while it evaluate the interfusion of lower coagulant flocculant doses another remarkable conclusion derived from the present study is the fact that the polymeric flocculants show more evident re stabilization at overdose than inorganic coagulants that suggest controlled injection of the polyelectrolytes into water stream and frequent measurements of the tested parameters ζ potential ph tss conductivity etc this re stabilization effect is different among the tested polymers the synthetic polymer pdadmac has high charge density than the charge of the tested water particles which may lead to increase of the factorial growth of ζ potential resulting in particle re stabilization and decrease of sedimentation performance in the case of the natural polymers chitosan and cminoulin the increase of the dose acted gentle to the value of ζ potential with re stabilization to occur mainly because of weakly coherence of flocs 6 conclusions the first scope of this study was the investigation of the effectiveness of the known electrolytes alum and pac and polyelectrolyte pam on the removal of suspended particles in raw water we found out that although they have a very good turbidity reduction response the choice of the appropriate dose based on a linear correlation of turbidity and dose of electrolyte is wrong since the most part of the high turbidity values is due to large particles that can precipitate alone because of their gravity therefore it is suggested a natural pre sedimentation process for up 1 h to take place in order large particles to be removed and then to add doses of electrolytes calculated on the real turbidity values due to the suspended colloidal particles the process of plain sedimentation may remove about 60 suspended matter and 75 bacteria measurements in the jar test experiments indicated that with a pre treatment time equal to the time needed for the coagulation flocculation and sedimentation treatment the values of turbidity reduction ranged from 41 for initial turbidity in the range of 50 100 ntu up to 83 for turbidity values 210 260 ntu as second target of the present work new natural polymers were tested for the coagulation and flocculation of suspended particles contained in river raw water with different initial turbidity values and the already applied coagulation flocculation process was revisited and evaluated for its effectiveness experiments using pdadmac chitosan and cminulin showed that the biopolymers have the potential and the performance to substitute prior used coagulants flocculants in water treatment which were accused to harm human health alzheimer neurological problems also experiments show that ζ potential measurements are key parameters to monitoring and maintaining optimal conditions in water treatment facilities this can be especially important during upsets or naturally occurring seasonal changes in water production

commercial fe2o3 more importantly reaction intermediates e g 4 4 methylenediphenol phenol and lactic acid were confirmed by lc ms ms analysis and the rational pathway of bpa degradation was finally proposed keywords rhombohedral α fe2o3 p123 bisphenol a photocatalysis pathway 1 introduction bisphenol a bpa is a kind of endocrine system disruptor which is extremely toxic to aquatic organisms e g microorganisms planktons plants invertebrates and vertebrates even at the low concentration 1 because of the adverse influences of bpa it is urgent and challenging to explore an efficient way to remove bpa from wastewater so far different strategies have been developed for instance physical absorption 2 membrane technology 3 reverse osmosis technology 4 etc which belong to physical technique are the processes of pollutant transformation and they cannot remove bpa from wastewater completely besides later cleaning process would wash those bpa molecules out from the membrane resulting in a secondary pollution chemical method can destroy the bonds of organic compounds through a series of chemical reactions bourgin et al 5 reported the fast removal of bpa 99 by chlorination with sodium hypochlorite in short time but the chlorinated metabolites produced during the degradation process would bring some side effects other chemical methods like advanced oxidation processes e g ozonation and photocatalysis based on strong reactive oxygen species are widely developed tan et al 6 carried out a research on mno2 porous hollow microspheres as the ozonation catalysts to degrade 50 ppm bpa within 30 min reaction time although ozonation method is surely efficient there exist potential hazards of emission of carcinogenic intermediates 7 and it is extremely costly as it needs high investment for the generation of ozone among different methods photocatalysis is a very advanced strategy to selectively degrade bpa from wastewater due to its unique properties including good efficiency high mineralization non toxicity and easy accessibility wang et al 8 reported the co doping biocl via hydrothermal route and about 95 of bpa was degraded by visible light irradiation within 120 min jana et al 9 studied the rgo ag through electrostatic interaction to remove 90 of bpa in 480 min liao et al 10 synthetized the cu n codoped titanate nanotubes by microwave assisted hydrothermal method to reach a complete degradation efficiency of bpa using 180 min although these methods are advanced these fabricated composites often involve the expensive raw materials and complex synthesis process the search of facile synthesis and efficient catalyst is urgently needed in virtue of natural abundance low cost and environmental benignity hematite α fe2o3 an n type semiconductor with narrow band gap 2 0 2 2 ev has been widely used for photocatalytic degradation of pollutants 11 over the last a few decades a number of efforts have been spared to further improve the photocatalytic performance of α fe2o3 zhang et al 12 prepared α fe2o3 nanotubes by hydrothermal treatment with the help of po4 3 and so4 2 the direct band gap energy of this as prepared α fe2o3

300 k and exhibited the degradation efficiency around 50 over salicylic acid under the uv irradiation wei et al 14 fused the fe2o3 and pd into composite nanoparticles physically to enhance the photocatalytic activity it demonstrated that these composite particles can photocatalyze the formation of ag and au nanoparticles from their corresponding salts however some of the preparation processes still face the challenges from complex procedures and the morphology of α fe2o3 is still less controllable it is difficult to better understand the relationship between the structure and
