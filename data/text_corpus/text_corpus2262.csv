11310,escalations in rainfall intensity both in terms of volume and frequency are increasing the volatility associated with grassland agriculture on poorly drained soils the principal mechanism of reducing this volatility is by means of land drainage however the efficacy of drainage systems is widely variable and has not been fully quantified the excavation of soil test pits and a corresponding examination of the soil profile enables bespoke land drainage system design across heterogeneous soil scapes this leads to variations to both groundwater and shallow drainage designs in the present

production and potential for grazing utilization are restricted due to surface water logging reduced yields and low soil bearing capacity bell et al 2011 patton et al 2012 kandel et al 2013 generally grassland productivity is positively correlated with annual precipitation smit et al 2008 but in the case of poorly drained soils in temperate regions excess rainfall can result in a saturated root zone which inhibits production fitzgerald et al 2008 furthermore these soils become impassable to both machinery and livestock traffic for extended periods keane 1992 this introduces significant costs to the farm system as normal farming practices are curtailed brereton and hope cawdery 1988 shalloo et al 2004 clearly observable escalations in rainfall intensity both in terms of volume and frequency are increasing the volatility associated with grassland agriculture on poorly drained soils the impacts of climate change in ireland kiely 1999 are being felt most keenly by those farms where trafficability is marginal during periods of high rainfall increasing likelihood of adverse weather principally high rainfall is forcing landowners to invest significantly in mechanisms to increase the resilience of their grazing systems by reducing the impact of excessive rainfall effective land drainage systems provide relief of excess water and control the water table thereby improving yields and grazing conditions and reducing the volatility associated with periods of adverse weather armstrong 1985 nijland et al 2005 ibrahim et al 2013 the design of land drainage entails the specification and installation of drains in the soil at such a depth and spacing to control the water table at a predetermined depth below ground level under a particular intensity of rainfall mulqueen 1998 effective design requires that soil physical properties are fully characterized with regard to their drainage capacity and that the drainage system is tailored to optimize discharge levels from a particular soil galvin 1986 schultz et al 2007 skaggs et al 2012 a number of drainage systems and techniques have been developed to suit different soil types and conditions with associated drainage characteristics with this end in mind smedema et al 2004 tuohy et al 2016b these range from groundwater drainage designs 1 0 2 0 m deep which interact directly with groundwater by virtue of their position in a high permeability soil layer smedema and rycroft 1983 teagasc 2013 to shallow drainage designs comprised of shallow 1 0 m tile drains supplemented by mole drainage gravel mole drainage or sub soiling at spacings of 1 2 m spoor 1982 mulqueen 1985 robinson et al 1987 tuohy et al 2016a b consistent increases in rainfall levels in the south west and indeed nationally are creating a renewed enthusiasm for land drainage works particularly where grazing potential is impacted consistently in the main grazing season march november significant investments in land drainage systems are being undertaken at farm scale with little guidance on the performance capacity and potential returns achievable in a wide range of drainage design soil type dynamics the return on such investments is dependent on an increase in grass production and utilization number of grazings silage harvests and these are both factors of the hydrologic changes brought about by the installation of the drainage systems therefore to understand the agronomic and economic impacts of site specific drainage systems in a wetter climate we must examine the hydrologic impact and responses of such systems during periods of high rainfall the efficiency of a drainage system is a measure of its ability to respond to rainfall events and discharge appropriate volumes of water in a changing climate a trend towards more rainfall and or a greater number of high intensity rainfall events kiely 1999 walsh 2012a b nolan et al 2013 is putting increasing pressure on land drainage systems sloan et al 2016 and altering the dynamics with relation to efficiency the performance of drainage systems installed is hugely variable and for the most part poorly understood a review of the performance of a range of recently installed land drainage systems in terms of their response to rainfall events water table control and flow discharge behavior in a high rainfall period would add to the understanding of the capabilities and limitations of such systems and generate new knowledge with respect to the efficiency of various drainage designs and their potential usefulness in improving the agronomic value of poorly drained soils in an increasingly wet climate the objectives of this study were to a quantify the general performance and effectiveness of 9 site specific drainage systems over a number of rainfall events of varying magnitude during an extended high rainfall period b compare system responses and performance across drainage systems and drainage design types during rainfall events of like magnitude c quantify behavior characteristics of drainage systems and drainage design types and d determine the principal factors which dictate their behavior performance was measured in terms of water table control response and discharge parameters namely flow start peak and lag times peak flow rate flashiness index and total discharge and discharge hydrographs 2 materials and methods 2 1 site details the study involved 9 drainage systems across 7 farms in southwest ireland table 1 fig 1 the farms are all participants in the teagasc heavy soils program which aims to demonstrate methods to improve grassland productivity and utilization decrease volatility and sustain viable farm enterprises on poorly drained soils they were selected from within regions where poor soil drainage coupled with climate principally precipitation less evapotranspiration inhibits potential for production and on farm profitability in conjunction with each farmer an area of the farm with a history of impeded drainage was selected and a new drainage system was installed table 2 the drainage systems were designed to optimize system performance using the methods outlined in tuohy et al 2016b by tailoring design to the intrinsic soil properties in the case of both site 1 and site 7 adjustments to the site specific designs led to the installation of alternative drainage systems on equivalent areas as a result a total of 9 distinct drainage systems were installed table 2 drainage systems 1 1 1 2 2 3 and 4 are classified as groundwater drainage designs gw which interact directly with groundwater by virtue of their position in a high permeability soil layer where percolation to the water table is uninhibited smedema and rycroft 1983 teagasc 2013 while drainage systems 5 6 7 1 and 7 2 are shallow drainage designs sh installed where all layers in a soil profile are fine heavy and poorly permeable and efforts are focused on improving the hydraulic conductivity close to the surface by cracking and fissuring the soil using disruption techniques such as mole drainage rodgers et al 2003 gravel mole drainage and sub soiling at spacings of 1 2 m and being supplemented by a complimentary set of field drains at wider spacings spoor 1982 mulqueen 1985 robinson et al 1987 tuohy et al 2016a b all drainage systems were installed in the june august period of 2013 a detailed soil survey was undertaken to classify and characterize soil type in the drained area of each farm soil profile pits were delineated into horizons and described as per simo et al 2014 disturbed soil samples representative of distinct soil horizons were analyzed for organic matter content loss on ignition method brookside laboratories ohio usa and sand silt and clay content sieving and pipette sedimentation method nrm laboratories berkshire uk where appropriate samples could be collected table 2 soil types at the 7 sites include gleys surface and groundwater luvisols and peats and all are characterized as poorly drained b reidy unpublished 2 2 climate change and increasing rainfall there has been a marked increase in rainfall intensity in recent years throughout ireland an analysis of prevailing conditions in the south west of the country was carried out to illustrate this phenomenon data from three long term meteorological stations met eireann in the southwest in the vicinity of study sites were used namely cork airport ca shannon airport sa and valentia va fig 1 annual total precipitation and its moving averages 10 year at the three sites are shown in fig 2 a trend towards increasing precipitation is seen at each site in this period in agreement with the trends observed by kiely 1999 a ranking of the 30 years from 1988 to 2017 in terms of total annual rain hours 2 0 mm and total annual rain days 2 0 mm is presented in table 3 a clear trend is again evident at each of the 3 sites years in the decade from 2008 to 2017 are disproportionately represented in the highest ranking years for both annual rain hours and annual rain days taking rain day data from the 60 year period from 1958 to 2017 it is clear that this is a long term trend the increases in rainfall seem to be particularly focused in 2 three month periods namely june august and october december fig 3 by subdividing the data into 20 year time blocks and focusing on the 2 periods above a trend for increasing incidents of rainfall at each site is again evident table 4 2 3 experimental measurements 2 3 1 meteorological data an automated weather station campbell scientific ltd leicestershire uk was installed adjacent to each drainage site these recorded rainfall among other parameters at a 15 min resolution and allowed for event rainfall and 7 day and 30 antecendent rainfall to be calculated 2 3 2 water table depth fully screened observation wells eijkelkamp giesbeek the netherlands were installed at each site in the drained area s midway between adjacent drains to 2 m depth unless impeded by stones bedrock a mini diver van essen instruments delft the netherlands was installed in each well and in tandem with a baro diver measuring barometric pressure installed on site measured position of the water table every 15 min 2 3 3 subsurface drain flow flow discharge data was measured either by end of pipe flowmeters water technology limited cork ireland or by calibrated in stream flumes corbett concrete tipperary ireland in tandem with mini divers van essen instruments delft the netherlands which monitored water head passing through the flume which was then converted to an open channel flow rate the flow measuring system selected for each site was dependent on the practicalities of equipment installation particularly in relation to relative invert levels of subsurface and open drains and the geometry of the open drain flow rate was recorded automatically every 15 min 2 3 4 rainfall event delineation and event selection at each site rainfall events having at least 5 0 mm rainfall occurring between 01 10 2015 and 31 05 2016 were selected for use in this study rainfall events were defined and separated by periods of at least 12 h without rainfall ibrahim et al 2013 tuohy et al 2016a events with less than 5 0 mm total rainfall were excluded as such conditions would not consistently induce a flow response from the installed drainage systems rainfall events were categorized into event types a d depending on total rainfall amount a 5 0 9 9 mm b 10 0 19 9 mm c 20 0 39 9 mm d 40 0 mm at each site two rainfall events from within each category were randomly selected for detailed analyses of drainage system response 2 3 5 flow event delineation and response parameters the drainage system response was quantified by assessing the flow events related to the rainfall events outlined above the start of flow events was signaled by a perceptible rise in discharge while the end of an event was signaled by flow returning to pre event levels vidon and cuadra 2010 response was quantified according to a number of parameters such as start peak and lag times cumulative rain at start and peak times flashiness index peak flow rate and total discharge tuohy et al 2016a start time was defined as the time between the start of the rainfall event and the start of the related flow event peak time was defined as the time between the start of the rainfall event and the time of peak discharge lag time was defined as the time between peak rainfall and peak discharge from the drainage systems cumulative rain at start and peak times was calculated as the cumulative rainfall during the event at start and peak time respectively variations in discharge are described using a flashiness index eq 1 the flashiness index is calculated for the event as the sum of the difference between the quarter hourly discharge values divided by the sum of the average quarter hourly discharge as 1 f i i 1 n q i q i 1 i 1 n q i where qi and qi 1 are the average quarter hourly discharge values at consecutive time points deelstra 2015 2 3 6 statistical analysis rainfall events were analyzed by analysis of variance with site as a factor response parameters start peak and lag times cumulative rain at start and peak times peak flow rate total discharge and flashiness index were analyzed by analysis of variance with drainage system drainage design type and rainfall event type as factors respectively regression analysis was carried out to establish the principle factors affecting response times the cumulative rainfall at response times peak flow rate total discharge and flashiness index the independent variables assessed were total rainfall 7 and 30 day antecedent precipitation mean and maximum rainfall intensity and water table depth at the start of the rainfall event using the proc reg procedure in sas version 9 1 3 sas institute 2006 3 results 3 1 meteorological data and selected events the period from 01 10 2015 31 05 2016 was characterized by relatively high rainfall levels at all sites ranging from 965 7 mm site 1 to 1520 8 site 4 table 5 across the sites rainfall was on average 27 higher than the long term average during the same period an average of 63 4 rainfall events range 52 72 of all depths 1 0 mm were recorded across the sites table 5 having an average rainfall amount of 18 6 mm 1 0 180 4 mm duration of 41 2 h 0 50 392 00 h and mean intensity of 0 54 mm hr 0 05 3 10 mm hr the random subset of rainfall events 5 0 mm depth selected for more in depth analysis yielded a total of 56 rainfall events across the 7 farms table 6 these events had an average rainfall amount of 28 1 mm 6 0 93 4 mm duration of 58 4 h 3 75 174 25 h and mean intensity of 0 66 mm hr 0 15 2 63 mm hr mean rainfall increased with event type magnitude table 7 as did mean event duration being 17 4 35 2 71 0 and 110 9 mm for event types a b c and d respectively p 0 05 s e 5 51 h 3 2 water table depth average water table position midway between drains during the study period at each site ranged from 0 34 m below ground level bgl site 5 to 1 37 m bgl site 4 with a mean of 0 69 m bgl across the 9 sites the drainage systems were seen to control the water table below the surface during the study period fig 4 the water table was controlled below 0 30 m bgl for the entire study period at sites 1 1 2 4 and 7 2 while at site 5 the water table was controlled below 0 30 m bgl for 36 of the study period groundwater drainage designs generally maintained a deeper water table average 0 82 m than shallow designs 0 53 m bgl fig 4 the average water table depth across drainage systems immediately prior to the subset of rainfall events studied was 0 52 m bgl and 0 44 m bgl immediately after these rainfall events the largest average decrease in water table depth during events was 0 29 m system 3 while in system 2 water table depth increased during events by 0 02 m on average the water table rose by an average of 0 108 m during events in gw designs and 0 052 m in sh designs 3 3 subsurface drainage discharge and response times start time peak time lag time and cumulative rain at start time were not significantly affected by drainage system or drainage design type while cumulative rain at peak time was not affected by drainage system peak flow rate ranged from 5 5 system 6 to 90 2 system 3 m3 ha h and was significantly affected by drainage system and drainage design type table 8 the average total discharge during rainfall events was significantly higher in drainage system 2 1666 3 m3 ha and 3 1722 4 m3 ha than all other drainage systems with the exception of system 4 p 0 05 s e 114 32 m3 ha table 8 the lowest average discharge was from drainage system 6 100 1 m3 ha groundwater drainage designs 1098 4 m3 ha discharged significantly more p 0 05 s e 114 32 m3 ha than shallow drainage designs 189 6 m3 ha start time was affected by event type p 0 05 s e 0 92 h and ranged from 3 5 h a events to 10 8 h c events peak and lag times were also affected by event type table 8 peak flow rate and total discharge were seen to increase with increasing magnitude of rainfall d events had significantly higher peak and total flows than all other event types table 8 the principal factors affecting response times and drain discharge were shown by regression to be 30 day antecedent rainfall event rainfall and mean rainfall intensity table 9 higher 30 day antecedent rainfall prior to event start resulted in shorter peak times and increased peak flow rates higher rainfalls lead to increased peak and lag times as well as higher peak flow rates and total discharges greater mean rainfall intensity resulted in shorter start and peak times and higher peak flow rates 3 3 1 cumulative discharge the contrasting discharge characteristics of groundwater and shallow drainage designs is highlighted in fig 5 which presents cumulative discharge relative to rainfall from systems 1 1 gw and 5 sh during the period from 01 10 2015 to 31 05 2016 total discharge as a proportion of total rainfall was 56 1 for system 5 and 291 5 for system 1 1 3 3 2 discharge hydrographs mean flashiness index ranged from 0 07 system 4 to 0 23 system 1 1 and was significantly affected by drainage system and drainage design type table 8 these mean values obscure the true variability observed from drainage systems during individual events where a range of responses to rainfall events was apparent discharge hydrographs from drainage systems 4 gw and 7 1 sh during the 8 rainfall events selected for analysis at each site are presented in figs 6 and 7 respectively to illustrate detailed flow responses from these systems contrasts between typical behavior of gw and sh designs are again clearly observed the gw design exhibits higher average discharge rates and peak flows discharge from gw designs is comprised of a much higher element of base flow than that from sh designs 4 discussion recent evidence and future predictions are indicating an increase in the frequency and intensity of rainfall kiely 1999 walsh 2012a b and significant changes in seasonal rainfall patterns with a substantial increase in short term extreme rainfall events nolan et al 2013 barker et al 2016 increasingly volatile weather conditions principally high rainfall during the main grazing season march november is generating a greater appetite for the installation of land drainage systems on irish grassland farms the economic justification for such works is based on an adequate reduction in surface waterlogging and a corresponding increase in both grass production and utilization during adverse weather given the wide variety of land drainage problems drainage design types and specifications installed a review of drainage system performance across a number of contrasting sites is warranted this will highlight the adequacy of current land drainage techniques in reducing the volatility associated with excessive rainfall such information is likely to have greater value in an increasingly wet climate where adaption to climate change will be fundamental to farm scale sustainability 4 1 water table depth the desirable or appropriate water table depth at any time will depend on the crop grown the period of the year in relation to crop growth stage and the method of harvesting williamson and kriz 1970 allen et al 1998 kahlown et al 2005 for poorly drained irish grasslands it has been shown that trafficability is compromised when water table depth is less than 0 32 m while herbage production is restricted when water table depth is less than 0 45 m brereton and hope cawdery 1988 the mean water table depth over the study period across the drainage systems was 0 69 m and ranged from 0 34 m system 5 to 1 37 m system 4 the percentage of time each system was maintained at or above this level varied greatly resulting in some systems being hardly affected by precipitation while others were severely affected before recovering to some extent after precipitation ceased the water table depth was at least 0 45 m for an average of 65 of the study period across the drainage systems for drainage systems 2 4 and 7 2 this criteria was achieved for the entire study period while drainage systems 5 6 and 7 1 showed the poorest performance in this regard with values of 30 23 and 39 respectively overall farms with gw designs maintained water table at a suitable depth more consistently while sh designs struggled at some times to drain both infiltrating water and perched groundwater the deeper average depth of the gw drainage systems 1 54 m versus the sh drainage systems 0 90 m in the study resulted in differing capacities for water table control furthermore shallow designs are installed in finer soil textures and as such the response of the water table to rainfall events is more subtle than those soils having higher infiltration rates it is likely that in some cases the response of the water table to a particular rainfall event in sh drainage systems would not be fully apparent immediately as it would take time for equilibrium to be reached 4 2 subsurface drainage discharge and response times all drainage systems were responsive to rainfall events with a mean s d start time of 6 1 7 8 h and a mean s d lag time of 10 4 18 0 h with no significant effect of drainage system or drainage design type on these parameters showing similar responses despite variation in soil types where appropriate drainage systems are installed while no significant difference in rainfall or peak time is evident between drainage design types a higher cumulative rain at peak time p 0 05 s e m 1 64 mm was recorded for shallow drainage designs 19 6 mm versus groundwater drainage designs 15 2 mm this indicates more rainfall is required to produce peak flow rates in sh designs the intensity of discharge was greater in gw designs as evidenced by higher peak flow rates and total discharge relative to sh designs this is largely due to the contribution of groundwater which combines with infiltrating water to increase discharge levels the location of gw designs in a permeable horizon mulqueen and hendriks 1986 tuohy et al 2016b relatively deep in the profile allows for direct interaction with groundwater and a larger zone of influence therefore base flow is a major component of flow due to the nature of these designs while for sh designs flow events are almost entirely derived from the influx of surface water such that base flow is non existent mulqueen 1998 this is evidenced in the cumulative discharges from contrasting drainage design types presented in fig 5 where the gw design yields much higher discharges than the sh design and indeed total discharges amount to multiples of what is contributed directly to a given site in terms of rainfall discharges from sh designs may also have been compromised in this period due to a reduction in the level of structural fissures and macropores established during installation particularly for those systems reliant on mole drainage or sub soiling the high relative levels of rainfall during the study period would have resulted in persistently wet conditions which would have inhibited the effectiveness of shallow drainage techniques jarvis and leeds harrison 1987 tuohy et al 2016a the integrity of cracks and fissures created when these system are installed is known to reduce in time and vary with the natural wetting drying cycles of the soil jarvis and leeds harrison 1987 hallard and armstrong 1992 tuohy et al 2016a such systems are at their most effective when the soil is at its driest with a reduction in effectiveness in persistently wet conditions when connectivity between the soil surface and drainage channels becomes reduced youngs 1985 robinson et al 1987 tuohy et al 2015 2017 an increase in the efficiency of these techniques is required to maximize their performance and lifespan and improve their potential usefulness in a more intense rainfall regime the design of the implements used should be assessed to investigate whether adjustments to geometry or adaptability would allow for greater intensity of soil disturbance and system performance mean flashiness index was also greater for gw designs relative to sh designs however a consistent trend is not apparent when mean values for individual systems are considered the effect of event type on start times did not follow a specific trend for peak and lag times the trend was for increasing response times with increasing event magnitude start time was longest for c events while peak and lag times were longest for d events mean event duration was greater for higher magnitude event types as higher magnitude events tended to be the amalgamation of a series of events with short 12 h intervals rather than a single standalone episode therefore increasing peak time is related to greater accumulations of rainfall developing latterly in a longer duration event drain discharge response times and rates were shown to be dictated largely by antecedent rainfall and event rainfall magnitude and conditions these parameters impact directly on the soil moisture regime before and during the event and its capacity to store or discharge water deasy et al 2014 tuohy et al 2016a as water storage is increased the level of saturation in the vadose zone is also increased which induces more rapid movement of water to the drainage systems this is manifested in shorter response times and greater discharges where pre event and or event rainfall is of greater magnitude and intensity 4 3 discharge hydrographs the form of discharge hydrographs is dictated largely by rainfall distribution during the particular event event types are notable by differences in rainfall magnitude and intensity of discharge response a events are generally comprised of single rainfall episodes and muted discharge responses while d events are characterized by higher intensity of rainfall with a series of individual rainfall peaks being grouped together by virtue of the short interludes between them this in turn produces a series of discharge hydrographs with each receding limb being superseded by the rising limb of a subsequent flow surge contrasts in behavior of drainage design types are also evident in terms of the much greater base flow contribution in a typical gw designs fig 6 relative to a typical sh designs fig 7 and the higher peaks and greater volumes discharged by gw designs discharge from groundwater designs was consistently of much greater magnitude than that from shallow drainage designs 5 conclusions all systems were capable of discharging excess water and controlling the water table to a certain extent but effectiveness was seen to vary response times were not affected by drainage system or drainage design type showing similar responses despite variation in soil types where appropriate drainage systems are installed groundwater drainage designs were seen to discharge greater volumes of water and maintain a deeper water table relative to shallow drainage designs the direct interaction of gw designs with the groundwater table was noted both in the level of base flow apparent during flow events and the reactivity of the water table position to rain events overall gw designs performed better when compared against sh designs across the same time period future work would need to consider how agronomic performance grass yield and trafficability are affected by the imposed drainage design as direct comparison is difficult based merely on volumes of water discharged the comparison of such systems highlights the contrasting behaviors of individual drainage systems and drainage design types which is dictated largely by the hydraulic capacity of the soil within their catchment and their connectivity to different water bodies groundwater versus perched water classification of the performance of drainage systems must take account of their inherent differences performance metrics will need to allow for the contrasting responses of different drainage design types the functional capacity of each specific land drainage system was inherently different groundwater drainage designs exploit natural conditions to discharge large volumes of water and can control water table directly by means of their interaction with layers and zones of high permeability shallow drainage designs are combatting the natural state of their host soils by relying on shallow disruption techniques which are ultimately destined to revert to their original state particularly in the case of mole drainage and sub soiling techniques they have a smaller zone of influence no direct connectivity to the water table and displace lower volumes of water which is collected directly from the surface drain discharge response times and rates were shown to be dictated largely by antecedent rainfall and event rainfall magnitude and conditions as water storage is increased the level of saturation in the vadose zone is also increased which induces more rapid movement of water to the drainage systems this is manifested in shorter response times and greater discharges where pre event and or event rainfall is of greater magnitude and intensity as the study was carried out during the winter period of 2015 and early spring of 2016 when rainfall levels were well above normal performance of the sh designs may have been and inhibited due to the natural shrink swell properties of the high clay content soil in persistent wet conditions which has been shown elsewhere to drastically reduce the efficiency of such systems these systems would likely perform better during lower intensity rainfall given the extreme levels of rainfall recorded during the study period on all sites the study presents a view of these systems under exceptional conditions however given climate trends and predictions land drainage systems are increasingly likely to be subject to such extremes new technologies and strategies to increase efficiency of such systems are warranted these will be required to overcome the limitations of shallow drainage designs under current and potential future conditions all systems were shown to reduce the overall period of waterlogging and thereby improve the conditions for both the production and utilization of the grasslands they drain further work is required to quantify system integrity and performance over extended timescales and a full range of rainfall intensities acknowledgement we would like to acknowledge the farmers of the teagasc heavy soils program who have contributed time and resources to the study

reducing this volatility is by means of land drainage however the efficacy of drainage systems is widely variable and has not been fully quantified the excavation of soil test pits and a corresponding

grassland productivity is positively correlated with annual precipitation smit et al 2008 but in the case of poorly drained soils in temperate regions excess rainfall can result in a saturated root zone which inhibits production fitzgerald et al 2008 furthermore these soils become impassable to both machinery and livestock traffic for extended periods keane 1992 this introduces significant costs

frequency are increasing the volatility associated with grassland agriculture on poorly drained soils the impacts of climate change in ireland kiely 1999 are being felt most keenly by those farms where trafficability is marginal during periods of high rainfall increasing likelihood of adverse weather principally high rainfall is forcing landowners to invest significantly in mechanisms to increase the resilience of their grazing systems by reducing the impact of excessive rainfall effective land drainage systems provide relief of excess water and control the water table thereby improving yields and grazing conditions and reducing the volatility associated with periods of adverse weather armstrong 1985 nijland et al 2005 ibrahim et al 2013 the design of land drainage entails the specification and installation of drains in the soil at such a depth and spacing to control the water table at a predetermined depth below ground level under a particular intensity of rainfall

levels from a particular soil galvin 1986 schultz et al 2007 skaggs et al 2012 a number of drainage systems and techniques have been developed to suit different soil types and conditions with associated drainage characteristics with this end in mind smedema et al 2004 tuohy et al 2016b these range from groundwater drainage designs 1 0 2 0 m deep which interact directly with groundwater by virtue of their position in a high permeability soil layer smedema and rycroft 1983 teagasc 2013 to shallow drainage designs comprised of shallow 1 0 m tile drains supplemented by mole drainage gravel

creating a renewed enthusiasm for land drainage works particularly where grazing potential is impacted consistently in the main grazing season march november significant investments in land drainage systems are being undertaken at farm scale with little guidance on the performance capacity and potential returns achievable in a wide range of drainage design soil type dynamics the return on such investments is dependent on an increase in grass production and utilization number of grazings silage harvests and these are both factors of the hydrologic changes brought about by the installation of the drainage systems therefore to understand the agronomic and economic impacts of site specific drainage systems in a wetter climate we must examine the hydrologic impact and responses of such systems during periods of high rainfall the efficiency of a drainage system is a measure of its ability to respond to rainfall events and discharge appropriate volumes of water in a changing climate a trend towards more rainfall and or a greater number of high intensity rainfall events kiely 1999 walsh 2012a b nolan et al 2013 is putting increasing pressure on land drainage systems sloan et al 2016 and altering the dynamics with relation to efficiency the performance of drainage systems installed is hugely variable and for the most part poorly understood a review of the performance of a range of recently installed land drainage systems in terms of their response to rainfall events water table control and flow discharge behavior in a high rainfall period would add to the understanding of the capabilities and limitations of such systems and generate new knowledge with respect to the efficiency of various drainage designs and their potential usefulness in improving the agronomic value of poorly drained soils in an increasingly wet climate the objectives of this study were to a quantify the general performance and effectiveness of 9 site specific drainage systems over a number of rainfall events of varying magnitude during an extended high rainfall period b compare system responses and performance across drainage systems and drainage design types during rainfall events of like magnitude c quantify behavior characteristics of drainage systems and drainage design types and d determine the principal factors which dictate their behavior performance was measured in terms of water table control response and discharge parameters namely flow start peak and lag times peak flow rate flashiness index and total discharge and discharge hydrographs 2 materials and methods 2 1 site details the study involved 9 drainage systems across 7 farms in southwest ireland table 1 fig 1 the farms are all participants in the teagasc heavy soils program which aims to demonstrate methods to improve grassland productivity and utilization decrease volatility and sustain viable farm enterprises on poorly drained soils they were selected from within regions where poor soil drainage coupled with climate principally precipitation less evapotranspiration inhibits potential for production and on farm profitability in conjunction with each farmer an area of the farm with a history of impeded drainage was selected and a new drainage system was installed table 2 the drainage systems were designed to optimize system performance using the methods outlined in tuohy et al 2016b by tailoring design to the intrinsic soil properties in the case of both site 1 and site 7 adjustments to the site specific designs led to the installation of alternative drainage systems on equivalent areas as a result a total of 9 distinct drainage systems were installed table 2 drainage systems 1 1 1 2 2 3 and 4 are classified as groundwater drainage designs gw which interact directly with groundwater by virtue of their position in a high permeability soil layer where percolation to the water table is uninhibited smedema and rycroft 1983 teagasc 2013 while drainage systems 5 6 7 1 and 7 2 are shallow drainage designs sh installed where all layers in a soil profile are fine heavy and poorly permeable and efforts are focused on improving the hydraulic conductivity close to the surface by cracking and fissuring the soil using disruption techniques such as mole drainage rodgers et al 2003 gravel mole drainage and sub soiling at spacings of 1 2 m and being supplemented by a complimentary set of field drains at wider spacings spoor 1982 mulqueen 1985 robinson et al 1987 tuohy et al 2016a b all drainage systems were installed in the june august period of 2013 a detailed soil survey was undertaken to classify and characterize soil type in the drained area of each farm soil profile pits were delineated into horizons and described as per simo et al 2014 disturbed soil samples representative of distinct soil horizons were analyzed for organic matter content loss on ignition method brookside laboratories ohio usa and sand silt and clay content sieving and pipette sedimentation method nrm laboratories berkshire uk where appropriate samples could be collected table 2 soil types at the 7 sites include gleys surface and groundwater luvisols and peats and all are characterized as poorly drained b reidy unpublished 2 2 climate change and increasing rainfall there has been a marked increase in rainfall intensity in recent years throughout ireland an analysis of prevailing conditions in the south west of the country was carried out to illustrate this phenomenon data from three long term meteorological stations met eireann in the southwest in the vicinity of study sites were used namely cork airport ca shannon airport sa and valentia va fig 1 annual total precipitation and its moving averages 10 year at the three sites are shown in fig 2 a trend towards increasing precipitation is seen at each site in this period in agreement with the trends observed by kiely 1999 a ranking of the 30 years from 1988 to 2017 in terms of total annual rain hours 2 0 mm and total annual rain days 2 0 mm is presented in table 3 a clear trend is again evident at each of the 3 sites years in the decade from 2008 to 2017 are disproportionately represented in the highest ranking years for both annual rain hours and annual rain days taking rain day data from the 60 year period from 1958 to 2017 it is clear that this is a long term trend the increases in rainfall seem to be particularly focused in 2 three month periods namely june august and october december fig 3 by subdividing the data into 20 year time blocks and focusing on the 2 periods above a trend for increasing incidents of rainfall at each site is again evident table 4 2 3 experimental measurements 2 3 1 meteorological data an automated weather station campbell scientific ltd leicestershire uk was installed adjacent to each drainage site these recorded rainfall among other parameters at a 15 min resolution and allowed for event rainfall and 7 day and 30 antecendent rainfall to be calculated 2 3 2 water table depth fully screened observation wells eijkelkamp giesbeek the netherlands were installed at each site in the drained area s midway between adjacent drains to 2 m depth unless impeded by stones bedrock a mini diver van essen instruments delft the netherlands was installed in each well and in tandem with a baro diver measuring barometric pressure installed on site measured position of the water table every 15 min 2 3 3 subsurface drain flow flow discharge data was measured either by end of pipe flowmeters water technology limited cork ireland or by calibrated in stream flumes corbett concrete tipperary ireland in tandem with mini divers van essen instruments delft the netherlands which monitored water head passing through the flume which was then converted to an open channel flow rate the flow measuring system selected for each site was dependent on the practicalities of equipment installation particularly in relation to relative invert levels of subsurface and open drains and the geometry of the open drain flow rate was recorded automatically every 15 min 2 3 4 rainfall event delineation and event selection at each site rainfall events having at least 5 0 mm rainfall occurring between 01 10 2015 and 31 05 2016 were selected for use in this study rainfall events were defined and separated by periods of at least 12 h without rainfall ibrahim et al 2013 tuohy et al 2016a events with less than 5 0 mm total rainfall were excluded as such conditions would not consistently induce a flow response from the installed drainage systems rainfall events were categorized into event types a d depending on total rainfall amount a 5 0 9 9 mm b 10 0 19 9 mm c 20 0 39 9 mm d 40 0 mm at each site two rainfall events from within each category were randomly selected for detailed analyses of drainage system response 2 3 5 flow event delineation and response parameters the drainage system response was quantified by assessing the flow events related to the rainfall events outlined above the start of flow events was signaled by a perceptible rise in discharge while the end of an event was signaled by flow returning to pre event levels vidon and cuadra 2010 response was quantified according to a number of parameters such as start peak and lag times cumulative rain at start and peak times flashiness index peak flow rate and total discharge tuohy et al 2016a start time was defined as the time between the start of the rainfall event and the start of the related flow event peak time was defined as the time between the start of the rainfall event and the time of peak discharge lag time was defined as the time between peak rainfall and peak discharge from the drainage systems cumulative rain at start and peak times was calculated as the cumulative rainfall during the event at start and peak time respectively variations in discharge are described using a flashiness index eq 1 the flashiness index is calculated for the event as the sum of the difference between the quarter hourly discharge values divided by the sum of the average quarter hourly discharge as 1 f i i 1 n q i q i 1 i 1 n q i where qi and qi 1 are the average quarter hourly discharge values at consecutive time points deelstra 2015 2 3 6 statistical analysis rainfall events were analyzed by analysis of variance with site as a factor response parameters start peak and lag times cumulative rain at start and peak times peak flow rate total discharge and flashiness index were analyzed by analysis of variance with drainage system drainage design type and rainfall event type as factors respectively regression analysis was carried out to establish the principle factors affecting response times the cumulative rainfall at response times peak flow rate total discharge and flashiness index the independent variables assessed were total rainfall 7 and 30 day antecedent precipitation mean and maximum rainfall intensity and water table depth at the start of the rainfall event using the proc reg procedure in sas version 9 1 3 sas institute 2006 3 results 3 1 meteorological data and selected events the period from 01 10 2015 31 05 2016 was characterized by relatively high rainfall levels at all sites ranging from 965 7 mm site 1 to 1520 8 site 4 table 5 across the sites rainfall was on average 27 higher than the long term average during the same period an average of 63 4 rainfall events range 52 72 of all depths 1 0 mm were recorded across the sites table 5 having an average rainfall amount of 18 6 mm 1 0 180 4 mm duration of 41 2 h 0 50 392 00 h and mean intensity of 0 54 mm hr 0 05 3 10 mm hr the random subset of rainfall events 5 0 mm depth selected for more in depth analysis yielded a total of 56 rainfall events across the 7 farms table 6

during the study period at each site ranged from 0 34 m below ground level bgl site 5 to 1 37 m bgl site 4 with a mean of 0 69 m bgl across the 9 sites the drainage systems were seen to control the water table below the surface during the study period fig 4 the water table was controlled below 0 30 m bgl for the entire study period at sites 1 1 2 4 and 7 2 while at site 5 the water table was controlled below 0 30 m bgl for 36 of the study period groundwater drainage designs generally maintained a deeper water table average 0 82 m than shallow designs 0 53 m bgl fig 4 the average water table depth across drainage systems immediately prior to the subset of rainfall events studied was 0 52 m bgl and 0 44 m bgl immediately after these rainfall events the largest average decrease in water table depth during events was 0 29 m system 3 while in system 2 water table depth increased during events by 0 02 m on average the water table rose by an average of 0 108 m during events in gw designs and 0 052 m in sh designs 3 3 subsurface drainage discharge and response times start time peak time lag time and cumulative rain at start time were not significantly affected by drainage system or drainage design type while cumulative rain at peak time was not affected by drainage system peak flow rate ranged from 5 5 system 6 to 90 2 system 3 m3 ha h and was significantly affected by drainage system and drainage design type table 8 the average total discharge during rainfall events was significantly higher in drainage system 2 1666 3 m3 ha and 3 1722 4 m3 ha than all other drainage systems with the exception of system 4 p 0 05 s e 114 32 m3 ha table 8 the lowest average discharge was from drainage system 6 100 1 m3 ha groundwater drainage designs 1098 4 m3 ha discharged significantly more p 0 05 s e 114 32 m3 ha than shallow drainage designs 189 6 m3 ha start time was affected by event type p 0 05 s e 0 92 h and ranged from 3 5 h a events to 10 8 h c events peak and lag times were also affected by event type table 8 peak flow rate and total discharge were seen to increase with increasing magnitude of rainfall d events had significantly higher peak and total flows than all other event types table 8 the principal factors affecting response times and drain discharge were shown by regression to be 30 day antecedent rainfall event rainfall and mean rainfall intensity table 9 higher 30 day antecedent rainfall prior to event start resulted in shorter peak times and increased peak flow rates higher rainfalls lead to increased peak and lag times as well as higher peak flow rates and total discharges greater mean rainfall intensity resulted in shorter start and peak times and higher peak flow rates 3 3 1 cumulative discharge the contrasting discharge characteristics of groundwater and shallow drainage designs is highlighted in fig 5 which presents cumulative discharge relative to rainfall from systems 1 1 gw and 5 sh during the period from 01 10 2015 to 31 05 2016 total discharge as a proportion of total rainfall was 56 1 for system 5 and 291 5 for system 1 1 3 3 2 discharge hydrographs mean flashiness index ranged from 0 07 system 4 to 0 23 system 1 1 and was significantly affected by drainage system and drainage design type table 8 these mean values obscure the true variability observed from drainage systems during individual events where a range of responses to rainfall events was apparent discharge hydrographs from drainage systems 4 gw and 7 1 sh during the 8 rainfall events selected for analysis at each site are presented in figs 6 and 7 respectively to illustrate detailed flow responses from these systems contrasts between typical behavior of gw and sh designs are again clearly observed the gw design exhibits higher average discharge rates and peak flows discharge from gw designs is comprised of a much higher element of base flow than that from sh designs 4 discussion recent evidence and future predictions are indicating an increase in the frequency and intensity of rainfall kiely 1999 walsh 2012a b and significant changes in seasonal rainfall patterns with a substantial increase in short term extreme rainfall events nolan et al 2013 barker et al 2016 increasingly volatile weather conditions principally high rainfall during the main grazing season march november is generating a greater appetite for the installation of land drainage systems on irish grassland farms the economic justification for such works is based on an adequate reduction in surface waterlogging and a corresponding increase in both grass production and utilization during adverse weather given the wide variety of land drainage problems drainage design types and specifications installed a review of drainage system performance across a number of contrasting sites is warranted this will highlight the adequacy of current land drainage techniques in reducing the volatility associated with excessive rainfall such information is likely to have greater value in an increasingly wet climate where adaption to climate change will be fundamental to farm scale sustainability 4 1 water table depth the desirable or appropriate water table depth at any time will depend on the crop grown the period of the year in relation to crop growth stage and the method of harvesting williamson and kriz 1970 allen et al 1998 kahlown et al 2005 for poorly drained irish grasslands it has been shown that trafficability is compromised when water table depth is less than 0 32 m while herbage production is restricted when water table depth is less than 0 45 m brereton and hope cawdery 1988 the mean water table depth over the study period across the drainage systems was 0 69 m and ranged from 0 34 m system 5 to 1 37 m system 4 the percentage of time each system was maintained at or above this level varied greatly resulting in some systems being hardly affected by precipitation while others were severely affected before recovering to some extent after precipitation ceased the water table depth was at least 0 45 m for an average of 65 of the study period across the drainage systems for drainage systems 2 4 and 7 2 this criteria was achieved for the entire study period while drainage systems 5 6 and 7 1 showed the poorest performance in this regard with values of 30 23 and 39 respectively overall farms with gw designs maintained water table at a suitable depth more consistently while sh designs struggled at some times to drain both infiltrating water and perched groundwater the deeper average depth of the gw drainage systems 1 54 m versus the sh drainage systems 0 90 m in the study resulted in differing capacities for water table control furthermore shallow designs are installed in finer soil textures and as such the response of the water table to rainfall events is more subtle than those soils having higher infiltration rates it is likely that in some cases the response of the water table to a particular rainfall event in sh drainage systems would not be fully apparent immediately as it would take time for equilibrium to be reached 4 2 subsurface drainage discharge and response times all drainage systems were responsive to rainfall events with a mean s d start time of 6 1 7 8 h and a mean s d lag time of 10 4 18 0 h with no significant effect of drainage system or drainage design type on these parameters showing similar responses despite variation in soil types where appropriate drainage systems are installed while no significant difference in rainfall or peak time is evident between drainage design types a higher cumulative rain at peak time p 0 05 s e m 1 64 mm was recorded for shallow drainage designs 19 6 mm versus groundwater drainage designs 15 2 mm this indicates more rainfall is required to produce peak flow rates in sh designs the intensity of discharge was greater in gw designs as evidenced by higher peak flow rates and total discharge relative to sh designs this is largely due to the contribution of groundwater which combines with infiltrating water to increase discharge levels the location of gw designs in a permeable horizon mulqueen and hendriks 1986 tuohy et al 2016b relatively deep in the profile allows for direct interaction with groundwater and a larger zone of influence therefore base flow is a major component of flow due to the nature of these designs while for sh designs flow events are almost entirely derived from the influx of surface water such that base flow is non existent mulqueen 1998 this is evidenced in the cumulative discharges from contrasting drainage design types presented in fig 5 where the gw design yields much higher discharges than the sh design and indeed total discharges amount to multiples of what is contributed directly to a given site in terms of rainfall discharges from sh designs may also have been compromised in this period due to a reduction in the level of structural fissures and macropores established during installation particularly for those systems reliant on mole drainage or sub soiling the high relative levels of rainfall during the study period would have resulted in persistently wet conditions which would have inhibited the effectiveness of shallow drainage techniques jarvis and leeds harrison 1987 tuohy et al 2016a the integrity of cracks and fissures created when these system are installed is known to reduce in time and vary with the natural wetting drying cycles of the soil jarvis and leeds harrison 1987 hallard and armstrong 1992 tuohy et al 2016a such systems are at their most effective when the soil is at its driest with a reduction in effectiveness in persistently wet conditions when connectivity between the soil surface and drainage channels becomes reduced youngs 1985 robinson et al 1987 tuohy et al 2015 2017 an increase in the efficiency of these techniques is required to maximize their performance and lifespan and improve their potential usefulness in a more intense rainfall regime the design of the implements used should be assessed to investigate whether adjustments to geometry or adaptability would allow for greater intensity of soil disturbance and system performance mean flashiness index was also greater for gw designs relative to sh designs however a consistent trend is not apparent when mean values for individual systems are considered the effect of event type on start times did not follow a specific trend for peak and lag times the trend was for increasing response times with increasing event magnitude start time was longest for c events while peak and lag times were longest for d events mean event duration was greater for higher magnitude event types as higher magnitude events tended to be the amalgamation of a series of events with short 12 h intervals rather than a single standalone episode therefore increasing peak time is related to greater accumulations of rainfall developing latterly in a longer duration event drain discharge response times and rates were shown to be dictated largely by antecedent rainfall and event rainfall magnitude and conditions these parameters impact directly on the soil moisture regime before and during the event and its capacity to store or discharge water deasy et al 2014 tuohy et al 2016a as water storage is increased the level of saturation in the vadose zone is also increased which induces more rapid movement of water to the drainage systems this is manifested in shorter response times and greater discharges where pre event and or event rainfall is of greater magnitude and intensity 4 3 discharge hydrographs the form of discharge hydrographs is dictated largely by rainfall distribution during the particular event event types are notable by differences in rainfall magnitude and intensity of discharge response a events are generally comprised of single rainfall episodes and muted discharge responses while d events are characterized by higher intensity of rainfall with a series of individual rainfall peaks being grouped together by virtue of the short interludes between them this in turn produces a series of discharge hydrographs with each receding limb being superseded by the rising limb of a subsequent flow surge contrasts in behavior of drainage design types are also evident in terms of the much greater base flow contribution in a typical gw designs fig 6 relative to a typical sh designs fig 7 and the higher peaks and greater volumes discharged by gw designs discharge from groundwater designs was consistently of much greater magnitude than that from shallow drainage designs 5 conclusions all systems were capable of discharging excess water and controlling the water table to a certain extent but effectiveness was seen to vary response times were not affected by drainage system or drainage design type showing similar responses despite variation in soil types where appropriate drainage systems are installed groundwater drainage designs were seen to discharge greater volumes of water and maintain a deeper water table relative to shallow drainage designs the direct interaction of gw designs with the groundwater table was noted both in the level of base flow apparent during flow events and the reactivity of the water table position to rain events overall gw designs performed better when compared against sh designs across the same time period future work would need to consider how agronomic performance grass yield and trafficability are affected by the imposed drainage design as direct comparison is difficult based merely on volumes of water discharged the comparison of such systems highlights the contrasting behaviors of individual drainage systems and drainage design types which is dictated largely by the hydraulic capacity of the soil within their catchment and their connectivity to different water bodies groundwater versus perched water classification of the performance of drainage systems must take account of their inherent differences performance metrics will need to allow for the contrasting responses of different drainage design types the functional capacity of each specific land drainage system was inherently different groundwater drainage designs exploit natural conditions to discharge large volumes of water and can control water table directly by means of their interaction with layers and zones of high permeability shallow drainage designs are combatting the natural state of their host soils by relying on shallow disruption techniques which are ultimately destined to revert to their original state particularly in the case of mole drainage and sub soiling techniques they have a smaller zone of influence no direct connectivity to the water table and displace lower volumes of water which is collected directly from the surface drain discharge response times and rates were shown to be dictated largely by antecedent rainfall and event rainfall magnitude and conditions as water storage is increased the level of saturation in the vadose zone is also increased which induces more rapid movement of water to the drainage systems this is manifested in shorter response times and greater discharges where pre event and or event rainfall is of greater magnitude and intensity as the study was carried out during the winter period of 2015 and early spring of 2016 when rainfall levels were well above normal performance of the sh designs may have been and inhibited due to the natural shrink swell properties of the high clay content soil in persistent wet conditions which has been shown elsewhere to drastically reduce the efficiency of such systems these systems would likely perform better during lower intensity rainfall given the extreme levels of rainfall recorded during the study period on all sites the study presents a view of these systems under exceptional conditions however given climate trends and predictions land drainage systems are increasingly likely to be subject to such extremes new technologies and strategies to increase efficiency of such systems are warranted these will be required to overcome the limitations of shallow drainage designs under current and potential future conditions all systems were shown to reduce the overall period of waterlogging and thereby improve the conditions for both the production and utilization of the grasslands they drain further work is required to quantify system integrity and performance over extended timescales and a full range of rainfall intensities acknowledgement we would like to acknowledge the farmers of the teagasc heavy soils program who have contributed time and resources to the study 
11311,waste water is widely used for irrigation purposes in agriculture and in the case of rice it is not only a normal but a frequent practice due to the large water demands of this crop however this highly beneficial system due to its use of such a valuable resource is not entirely free from risks one of which is that recycled water may contain small quantities of heavy metals whose accumulation could prove toxic to the environment animals and humans heavy metals are usually found in higher concentrations in recycled urban and industrial waste water than in normal surface or ground irrigation water they may not only cause toxicity problems in plants but also in animals and in the people that consume them or in the people that consume the animals that feed on the plants with the associated risk of bioaccumulation as in the case of boron which can cause blindness elements that can have toxic effects on plants and animals in small concentrations include boron cadmium copper nickel molybdenum zinc and iron recycled irrigation water from urban areas does not usually contain an alarming amount of metals except in cases in which waste water is collected from certain industries this study focuses on the evolution along an irrigation line of the effects of using recycled urban waste water with secondary treatment on rice crops and on the cultivation medium its novel contribution as regards previous research on the use of urban waste water in agriculture and its effects on crops and the environment lies in the fact that we not only followed the time evolution throughout various crop cycles but also the linear spatial evolution of concentrations in specific chemical parameters of the land flooded to grow rice mapping the changes with the help of geographical information systems the study included the analysis of the evolution of five heavy metals b cu cr ni and zn in soils and rice crops on five farms along an irrigation line throughout three crop cycles in alkaline soils such as that involved in this study the metals are in general retained in the soil and do not pass into the plants to cause toxicity problems but even so with continuous long term irrigation heavy metals can accumulate and in the case of rice this situation is likely to arise in the study we always considered the possibility that this crop is a heavy metal filter that prevents toxic elements from reaching the consumer keywords heavy metals rice irrigation coastal lagoon contamination 1 introduction alarm bells recently began sounding around the world after the press publicised a warning from the swedish national food agency nfa that rice and rice products contain arsenic and that the frequent consumption of wholegrain rice could involve health risks especially the consumption of rice cakes by children and adults islam et al 2017 considering nfa s allegations the conditions in which rice is produced must be considered since the truth or falsity of these allegations will largely depend on them and especially on the quality of the water used and soil ph in fact this risk is not only associated with rice but with other agricultural products as well and arsenic is not the only heavy metal that threatens people s health neither is waste water the only source of the heavy metals found in the soil they also come from industrial and mining residues and fungicides are one of the most important sources of the heavy metals found in the soil including chromium and copper heavy metals are elements with high density and atomic numbers and naturally occur in very small concentrations most of them are toxic and harmful to humans above certain concentrations and are also bioaccumulable sufficiently high concentrations of arsenic ingested over a long period of time can considerably increase the risk of acquiring lung and bladder cancer other elements such as cadmium can accumulate in certain plants and reach dangerous concentrations for consumers for example the carcinogenic hexavalent chromium cr vi used in the chemicals industry can be absorbed by inhalation or ingestion and can cause chromosomal abnormalities in people as mentioned above boron can induce blindness and while nickel in itself is not highly toxic the nickel present in certain alloys can cause serious illnesses such as dermatitis retarded growth respiratory problems hyperglucemia and degenerative disorders arsenic copper zinc nickel and cadmium are particularly toxic milacic et al 2017 the possible consequences of using wastewater containing heavy metals for irrigation has been the subject of research for several decades e g the study carried out in 1959 in japan by asami and kumada 1959 in 1981 page et al pointed out that trace elements such as zinc nickel copper molybdenum and cadmium could be dangerous to both animals and persons in 2001 requena declared the most dangerous heavy metals for the environment and humans are lead mercury cadmium tin chromium zinc and copper due to their excessive use by industry in pesticides and medicines their toxicity and their wide distribution throughout the environment other authors have added further elements that in extremely small quantities pose a risk to animals and plants including boron nickel molybdenum manganese and iron furthermore unlike organic compounds metals do not break down either biologically or chemically and berferull and de la guardia 1984 have gone as far as to say that the biological amplification of their concentration in the trophic chain could even destroy the ecosystem da silva et al 2017 in italy barbafieri et al 1996 claim that the soil acts more or less as a barrier to heavy metals by accumulating them and avoiding their transfer to crops lai et al 2017 and thus also to human consumers simmons and pongsakul 2002 made an excellent analysis based on the comments of w van der hoek on heavy metals and cadmium in the rice food chain of the studies carried out in china and japan for many years these studies found that the long term consumption of rice contaminated with cadmium can cause acute or chronic diseases in humans such as kidney failure which is irreversible and progressive even when exposure is subsequently reduced various studies suggest that cadmium induced kidney failure interferes with vitamin d metabolism associated with the reduced absorption of calcium and causes osteopenia and osteoporosis especially in multiparous women cadmium is also a known carcinogen in humans populations that depend on rice contaminated with cadmium and whose additional food sources are low in zinc iron and calcium are at a greater risk of suffering the harmful effects of cadmium on their health it was also found that in the long term uncontrolled amounts of cd zn pb hg as cu cr 6 ni and mn in agroecosystems reduce harvests and the quality of the produce and thus have a negative influence on food safety and farmers incomes in addition high levels of heavy metals in soils significantly reduce its biodiversity and thus also the recycling of biological nutrients and plant soil symbiosis one especially interesting study due to its similarities with the present paper is that of kwun et al 2001 of the university of konkuk in south korea carried out from may to september in 1998 in which they recommend the reuse of recycled water for irrigating rice provided that its heavy metal content is controlled the study involved growing rice in 90 cm diameter plant pots through a complete rice growing cycle in which there were four different treatments plus a control watered with clean water and treated with conventional fertilizer recycled waste water was used in the four treatments one had conventional fertilizer one had half the dose of conventional fertilizer and the other two had none at all but their waste water was diluted to reduce its high total nitrogen content measurements were taken of plant height leaf surface and degree of tillering at seven day intervals starting in august after harvesting and drying the samples panicle size stem length and yield were measured and the heavy metal content of the grains was assessed before husking for which no significant results were obtained the study reached important conclusions as regards the basis of the present study on one hand the waste water had no negative effect either on the yield or growth of the crop however it should not be forgotten that in our study zone and in other similar experiences using waste water with excess nitrogen the rice plants tend to bend over or lie flat however they found that the key factor was fertilization and not the quality of the irrigation water provided that total nitrogen was not above 25 ppm it also seems that using recycled water can be beneficial since with equal amounts of fertilizers a 10 higher yield was obtained over rice irrigated with clean water with no loss of grain quality finally the results are said to suggest that the standards of irrigation water quality should be scientifically analysed and modified where necessary since if these standards are too high the water treatment cost will also be unnecessarily high mutlu and uncumusaoglu 2017 a rather ambitious study along these lines is that of fu et al 2008 carried out in china which analysed the risks to human health of 10 different heavy metals as ba cd co cr cu hg mn ni y pb in rice irrigation water the authors concluded that the daily intake of these metals via rice was much lower than the daily tolerable intake but that the bioaccumulation of mercury through the food chain and the arsenic intake from other foods should also give cause for worry liu et al 2017 the study by zhuang et al in villages in southern china in 2009 focused on the bioaccumulation of four heavy metals cu zn pb and cd in soil crops and foods and assessed the possible risks to human health they found that cadmium and lead had the highest concentrations in grains and had different concentrations in some of the vegetables studied they also found that due to their contamination by heavy metals consuming rice and vegetables represented a grave risk to the health of the local population finally the study by cao et al in 2010 dealt with the combined risk of consuming rice and other vegetables with concentrations of various heavy metals cu zn pb cr hg and cd these authors found that the individual metal contents were lower than the levels permitted in china but when the six intakes were combined when consuming rice and vegetables the potential health risks were considerably higher moreover meng et al 2016 presented a case study in tianjin china european countries have a number of approaches to define risk levels associated with different concentrations of heavy metal in soil carlon et al 2007 ferguson 1999 some of this information is included in the finnish legislation for contaminated soil ministry of the environment mef finland 2007 the finnish standard values represent a good approximation of the mean values of different national systems in europe carlon et al 2007 and they have been applied in an international context for agricultural soils as well unep 2013 this legislation sets concentration levels by each hazardous elements to identify soil contamination and remediation needs it sets lower and higher concentration levels indicating the need for different actions if exceeded higher concentration levels are defined by major land uses i e for industrial or transport sites and for other land uses the so called threshold value isequally applicable for all sites and it indicates the need for further assessment of the area in areas where background concentration is higher than the threshold value background concentration is regarded as the assessment threshold the second concentration level is the so called guideline value if this is exceeded the area has a contamination level which presents ecological or health risks different guideline values are set for industrial and transport areas higher guideline value and for all other land uses lower guideline value in other hand the spanish environmental legal framework comprises laws regulating particular industries and activities and laws protecting the environment and controlling certain contaminating agents most spanish environmental laws derive from the transposition of eu legislation the main regulated environmental fields are integrated environmental control natural heritage and biodiversity protection air quality and atmosphere protection environmental responsibility nuisance activities environmental impact assessment contaminated land waste among others the spanish local autonomous regions can develop and enforce their own environmental legislation and local authorities also have environmental protection powers accordingly enforcement of environmental law is carried out at state regional and local authority level the regulatory regime for waste is established in law 22 2011 on waste and contaminated land this regulation establishes measures to protect the environment and human health by preventing or reducing the adverse impact of generating and managing waste whenever the integrated pollution prevention and control ippc regime does not apply in the same case about the permits and regulators any operator whether individual or legal entity of waste treatment activities including waste storage and the substantial modification enlargement and relocation of relevant waste treatment facilities requires an administrative authorization issued by the environmental authority of each autonomous region a separate authorisation is required by the owner of such facilities if they are not the operator about the operator criteria they generally carrying out the activities subject to an authorization must provide certain financial guarantees obtain specific insurance policies prove to the environmental authority that they have suitable personal qualities as well as the technical means to carry out the activity there are some special rules for certain waste that is extended to the producer responsibility in order to encourage recycling certain types of products that become waste after their use are subject to extended producer responsibility rules any individual or legal entity that professionally develops manufactures processes treats sells or imports these products must comply with certain obligations for example to accept returned products and the waste produced from the use of those products the law also sets out the requirements for subsequent management re use recycling and recovery of the waste and establishes who is to be responsible for the relevant costs there are certain types of waste are not regulated by the waste regime including uncontaminated soil and other naturally occurring material excavated during construction activities to be used on site for construction purposes wastewater animal by products animal corpses and waste resulting from mineral resources or mining activities in another aspects the federal soil protection act precaution must be taken to avert harmful changes to the soil also with regard to the discharge of harmful substances into the soil by cultivation activities to comply with the precautionary principle by following the aims of preventive environmental protection problematical input of substances into the environmental media soil water and air must be prevented regarding both the outstanding importance of agricultural soil for the production of safe food it has to be ensured that there will be no accumulation of contaminants in soil especially by application of sewage sludge slurry and other farm manure artificial fertilizer and compost the federal ministry of consumer protection food and agriculture and the federal ministry for the environment nature conservation and nuclear safety introduced the german concept for the assessment of fertilizers gute qualität und sichere erträge during their joint conference in 2001 according to this resolution all affected policies in germany are currently under revision to meet the requirements in line with the federal soil protection act some results of works are located in mapping the identification of areas where heavy metal accumulation presents a hazard to health or the environment to delineate those areas which are threatened by high heavy metal concentrations assessment thresholds on each map are developed threshold values proposed by the finnish ministry of environment ministry of environment findland 2007 were used which indicate concentrations where soil contamination and remediation needs must be further assessed the threshold values of the mef represent a good approximation of the mean values of different national systems in europe carlon et al 2007 have been used in an international context for agricultural soils unep 2013 and were also successfully applied in regional assessment in europe tóth et al 2013 the standard method iso 1995 using aqua regia as an extracting agent was matched with one using microwave assisted acid digestion ecs 2010 and the same detection methods employing icp oes inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer waste management regulations such as those in the closed cycle management act of 24 february 2012 which entered into force on 1 june 2012 are also important for soil protection the sewage sludge ordinance and the ordinance on biowaste are also relevant in this context the legal regulations regarding waste contain guidelines for the environmentally sound recycling and disposal of waste there are only a few areas in europe where ambient air concentrations of cadmium cd lead pb mercury hg arsenic as and nickel ni are above the limit or target values exceedances of the limit or target values and human exposure at these locations is very much a local problem typically caused by specific industrial plants however the atmospheric deposition of toxic metals contributes to the exposure of ecosystems and organisms to toxic metals bioaccumulation can subsequently occur in the food chain thus affecting human health within the convention on long range transboundary air pollution lrtap emissions of heavy metals are controlled by the amended protocol on heavy metals which requires parties to reduce emissions of selected metals to below 1990 levels releases of hg are also controlled by the united nations environment programme minimata convention in the eea 33 region emissions of cd and hg made up approximately a third and a quarter of the corresponding total emissions in 1990 respectively emissions of pb have declined to approximately one tenth of the total 1990 emission levels a combination of targeted legislation for details see policy context and targets in the indicator specification and metadata section improved controls and abatement techniques have in general led to significant progress being made in most countries to reduce heavy metal emissions some policy context and targets are related to the context description coupled with improved control and abatement techniques targeted international and eu legislation has led to good progress being made in most eea 33 countries towards reducing heavy metal emissions such legislation includes the 1998 aarhus protocol on heavy metals to the 1979 united nations economic commission for europe unece convention on lrtap which targets three particularly harmful substances cd hg and pb eu directive 2001 80 ec on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants the lcp directive which aims to limit heavy metal emissions via dust control and absorption of heavy metals eu directive 2010 75 eu on industrial emissions integrated pollution prevention and control which aims to prevent or minimize pollution of water air and soil this directive targets certain industrial agricultural and waste treatment installations the european pollutant release and transfer register e prtr regulation 166 2006 ec under the requirements of which emissions of a number of heavy metals released from certain industrial facilities are also estimated and reported the eu directive on ambient air quality and cleaner air for europe 2008 50 ec and directive 2004 107 ec relating to heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ambient air which contain provisions and target and limit values for the further control of air pollutants in ambient air there are also a number of specific eu environmental quality and emission standards for heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants pops in coastal and inland waters drinking waters etc these have only indirect relevance to air emissions as they do not directly specify emission or precipitation quality requirements but rather specify the required quality of receiving waters other measures include restrictions on the use of heavy metals in certain consumer products such as the ec regulation on the banning of exports of metallic mercury and certain mercury compounds and mixtures and the safe storage of metallic mercury no 1102 2008 and directive 2007 51 ec amending council directive 7 769 eec relating to restrictions on the marketing of certain measuring devices containing mercury the minamata convention on mercury a global legally binding treaty was agreed by governments in january 2013 and formally adopted as international law on 10 october 2013 the aarhus protocol on heavy metals to the unece lrtap convention obliges parties to reduce their emissions of cd hg and pb from 1990 levels or an alternative year from 1985 to 1995

iceland liechtenstein norway and switzerland and turkey in 2005 and 2006 the european commission adopted seven thematic strategies on soils pesticides air pollution the marine environment waste prevention and recycling natural resources and the urban environment they are now going through the eu decision making process eu council of ministers european parliament etc in view of being implemented by the member states the thematic strategies are a new holistic approach to whole topic areas they contain measures which are destined to be integrated into existing policies and legislation only when this is not possible is it necessary to propose new legislation or other appropriate instruments they are based on a broad review of existing policy and required several years of scientific and economic analysis together with extensive consultation of stakeholders they look at pressures and impacts which often cut across those themes they examine the links between environmental impacts and sectoral policies they look at a broad range of options and a varied policy mix including the use of market based instruments technology and innovation to deal with the problems identified in a strategic and effective manner they also take a long term perspective setting the framework for eu and member state action for the next two decades they propose strategic objectives and explore short and medium term measures where appropriate thus helping to meet the eu s global commitments each strategy takes the form of a package comprising an overall approach towards the theme concerned presented in a communication that highlights issues and proposes solutions legislative proposals for some of them and an impact assessment the present spatial analysis focuses on an irrigation line to determine whether heavy metals are carried throughout the entire area or are trapped in the soil of the first fields it should be emphasized that this study focuses on basic soils in mediterranean conditions and thus may not be comparable to other local conditions 2 materials and methods the study zone to the south of the city of valencia is an extremely flat plain with a dense population containing rice fields the height of the plain is lower at the southern end where it meets the waters of la albufera which extends north south for 15 km parallel to the coast from which it is separated by a narrow sandy belt the flat regular low lying eastern coastline is washed by the mediterranean sea when choosing the farms for the soil and vegetable samples we considered their position along the irrigation line similar farms were also selected that were irrigated with different water for a comparative study the farms on the irrigation line were chosen at random considering the discriminant spatial variability of the land to be assessed since they had to be far enough apart to be able to detect possible variations in the parameters studied plus other criteria to control other parameters such as fertilizers crop varieties etc nine fields in the zone were finally selected fig 1 four of these were located on the irrigation line fields 2 5 and were watered exclusively with water from a treatment plant one was irrigated with water from the lake albufera field 9 another with low quality water from the favara irrigation channel field 1 two others fields 6 and 7 that received a mix of recycled and fresh water from the irrigation channels and finally field 8 which received three different types of water favara recycled and albufera since nutrients and metals might or might not be carried from one field to another the irrigation line was important for the study field 1 mainly received favara water field 2 received water directly from the treatment plant as did the successive fields along the line up to field 6 after which the recycled water was mixed with water from other sources in the fields on the same irrigation line one of the main aims of the study was to detect whether or not water and metals were carried from one field to another the fields chosen for this purpose fields 2 6 received water from the pineda treatment plant in fields 6 8 the exact proportions of water from different sources could not be determined in addition fields 6 8 are flooded each november with water from the lake 2 1 soil measurements six jackson type sampling points were selected in a zig zag pattern for the samples from each field and each of the six were divided into three sub points whose samples which were mixed in the field to ensure they were representative and homogenous samples were taken at depths of from 0 to 10 cm depth of rice roots each simple was analysed twice to minimise possible discrepancies in the lab results the samples were prepared for analysis in the laboratory this included the separation by hand of large clumps of soil and drying at room temperature until reaching lab ambient humidity the coarser elements were broken up by a roller during drying equilibrium was reached when the samples gave off dust the samples were then broken up first by a mallet and then in an electric roller mill sieved twice and ground to a fine powder in a blade mill the samples then weighed around 50 g with finely ground samples the extractive agents can act more efficiently and faster when analyzing heavy metals b cu cr ni and zn an extract was then obtained by 1 m ammonium acetate at neutral ph for atomic absorption spectrophotometric determination creating a calibration curve for each element with the appropriate patterns for the conditions of the samples table 1 shows the concentration ppm of the elements in the soil of the 9 experimental fields at depths from 0 to 10 cm described above 2 2 determination methods in vegetable tissues the analysis of rice plant treatments is always approached from the aspect of their heavy metal content field inspections are carried out throughout the growth cycle and at harvesting samples are collected for lab analysis table 2 entire plant samples were chosen these were arranged on a work bench with leaves and stem separated from the roots panicle and grain all of which are analysed separately there are two fundamental objectives firstly there must be a big enough sample from each field for both analyses and repetitions secondly and even more important is the aspect of representativeness which involves obtaining general information on the nutritional state and activity of the crop as a whole since the composition of the stem and leaves can vary with the position of the plant this helps to avoid deviations in the results due to the manner of sampling and position of the plants the first determination was on the mass of fresh material from all the leaves on digital scales to obtain a measure of the development of individual plants these were then washed with phosphate free soap and deionised water dried in an oven with a fan at 60 c until constant mass dried roots leaves stems and grains were homogenized in a blade mill and placed in plastic containers for analysis contents of b cu cr ni and zn were analysed in the minerals after calcinations by atomic absorption spectrophotometry in the same operative conditions as for the soil for which a calibration curve was drawn for each element with suitable patterns for the conditions of the samples 3 results and discussion the analytical results were subjected to statistical treatment in which each field was analysed to obtain the means of each one in the first step data from the six points in each field were entered in the program to find the level of interaction between the depth variables sampling date variables and mean field values that were subsequently used from the mean field values the possible linear relationship among the fields for the different factors is then determined the soil results being located on maps with the aid of gis as could be expected the irrigation water and some other basic parameters such as ph were also analysed and the soils were characterized for this type of study ph is not only important in itself but also because on it depend the greater or lesser availability of the water borne elements at the ph values obtained soils of 7 8 8 5 considered moderately alkaline most of the metals in this range are in the form of low solubility salts being soluble at acidic ph values as in the case of manganese which means that it is not very likely to encounter toxicity problems in plants caused by trace elements zinc salts have higher solubility at these ph values 3 1 boron 3 1 1 soils boron concentrations in soils were considered to be quite high although within normal limits fig 2 the high concentrations could have been due to either using fertilisers containing borax or sodium borate or to the habitual use of irrigation water containing boron whose effects that are intensified by clayey soils with enough organic material as in the case of this study higher values were found in irrigation water from the favara zone than in water from the treatment plant and boron values tended to decrease along the irrigation line in all cases values were below 2 ppm which is both the limit in spain and also below limit laid down by the fao for irrigation water and is also below the tolerable values of the us epa 0 75 ppm for continuous irrigation fig 2 shows values of 100 ppm 3 1 2 plants boron values in grains important from the consumer s point of view stems and roots were within normal limits fig 3 for example in stems and leaves they were between 7 and 18 ppm which were lower than those considered toxic in mature plants higher than 100 ppm and higher than the deficiency level 3 4 ppm as had happened in the case of water slightly higher values were found in field 1 3 2 copper 3 2 1 soils as can be seen in fig 4 copper levels in soils were high especially in field 2 possibly due to the application of a pesticide containing copper sulphate it would seem that the copper does not come mainly from the recycled water however what could have happened is that the copper in the fields gets into the irrigation channels and from there into the lake this theory is compatible with the copper concentrations found in the last fields to test this hypothesis we analysed the data supplied by the environmental authority for that year at the point where the channels studied enter the lake from this data it is clear that the highest values occur at the end of may 0 007 ppm the time of year in which pesticides may be used 3 2 2 plants copper concentrations in plants although high in roots in the stems did not reach 30 ppm the level considered to be toxic fig 5 from the data obtained copper appears to be concentrated in the roots and with difficulty reaches dangerous levels in stem and grain which seems to indicate that the roots of the rice plant can act extract copper from soils the abnormal levels in grain detected that year in field 2 are associated with the high values found in the soil but not with the levels in water this could be due to two possible causes either the fact that the water tests were not carried out continuously or to the presence of copper from an external source probably pesticide 3 3 chromium 3 3 1 soils it can be seen from the fig 6 that higher concentrations are found in the last fields as regards irrigation water since the values found in water from the treatment plant had lower chromium levels than water from other sources this seems to indicate that the possible chromium intake is not from the treatment plant in all cases the values are below the 2 ppm set by the spanish safety standards and also below the 1 ppm recommended by the us epa for short term irrigation in alkaline and neutral soils however these same standards set a value of 0 1 ppm for continuous irrigation as in the present case study and these values are exceeded in all the water studied other than that from the treatment plant these levels are confirmed by the values found in the sediment at the entry of the irrigation channels into the albufera which although they do not give cause for alarm are above those considered normal requena 2001 3 3 2 plants higher than normal chromium levels were found in field 9 3 33 ppm in stems and roots fig 7 the water in this field has higher chromium levels over the 0 1 ppm recommended by the us epa for continuous irrigation which cane from the albufera lagoon mixed with water from other fields and from the favara irrigation channel exceptionally high values have been observed in some plot for example in plot 3 the first year which could be due either to a single intake or a sampling error as occurs with other trace elements such as copper the chromium is concentrated in the roots of the plant so that it is difficult for it to reach dangerous levels in the grain this is further evidence in favour of rice being a soil purifier 3 4 nickel 3 4 1 soils the levels of nickel in soils is within normal limits for agricultural land i e between 2 and 50 ppm fig 8 the only high values were found in field 2 in one of the years but these were well below contamination levels nickel concentrations in the irrigation water used on these soils were below the 0 2 ppm recommended by the fao and us epa for continuous irrigation these low water concentrations also vary widely and so do not allow any relationships to be established although other studies carried out on cereal crops váquez et al 2001 found that nickel tends to accumulate in soils our results appear to show that it is absorbed by crops or perhaps carried away by the water since nickel concentrations diminish at higher soil depths however overall total nickel concentration in soil remains constant both before and after harvests possibly due to external sources in the form of fertilizers and pesticides 3 4 2 plants the results obtained are within the range habitually found in rice as in the case of other trace elements nickel appears to concentrate in the roots and does not often reach dangerous levels in stems or especially in the grain here again the entire plant showed an overall effect of extracting the heavy metal from soils fig 9 3 5 zinc 3 5 1 soils zinc concentrations in water are well below the fao s recommended maximum for irrigation water 2 ppm it must also be remembered that zinc toxicity declines as ph increases however in spite of the low zinc concentrations in water the hypothesis that water is the origin of the higher zinc levels in the soil seems to be confirmed this is because the soils with most zinc are those that receive water from the treatment plant which has the highest zinc content this concentration is gradually reduced in the irrigation channels and in the soil with distance from the outlet of the treatment plant zinc is located in the head fields this element has not been dragged to the fields at the end of the irrigation line this is ought to the soil retention as the others metals the effect of chelation is again very important this element hardly get into the crop the soil zinc values are thus within what could be considered normal ranges except in fields 2 and 3 whose values are higher although not alarmingly so fig 10 the higher values in fields that receive water directly from the treatment plant seem to point to the plant as the cause of this situation this view is supported by the fact that the highest zinc concentrations are found near the surface as can be seen in fig 13 as the concentrations are seen to increase with time this could mean that more zinc is received than is lost by absorption into crops by leaching or by being carried away by the water as in the case of other trace elements the total zinc content in soil does not appear to be affected by the zinc absorbed by the plants if the relationship between zinc concentrations in soil in fields that only receive water from the treatment plant and distance from the plant is considered it can be seen that for these fields nº 2 5 and the first fourvalue in fig 15 approximate to an exponential that responds to the formula y 363 98е 0 0006x with r2 0 9255 y is electrical conductivity in ds m and x is distance in metres this suggests a relationship between the water from the plant and the zinc in the soil and that as the zinc is retained in the soil the concentration along the irrigation line decreases comparing the trend lines of zinc concentrations in soil with those of copper and nickel a certain similarity can be observed in the behaviour of these elements as can be seen in fig 16 this situation is as would be expected as the elements have similar chemical properties as shown by their situation in the periodic table if the trend of zinc concentrations in soils with those of copper and nickel are compared it can be establish a similarity in the behavior of these three elements as shown in fig 16 this was expected since they are elements with similar chemical properties as their situation in the periodic table shows 3 5 2 plants the zinc values in plants are considered normal for rice and are higher in the roots than in stems and grain toxic values start at 1500 ppm in stems and the deficiency level is below 10 ppm in the grain in the case of this nutrient also the plant as a whole acts as a filter to keep most of the zinc in the ground fig 11 some variations in the concentrations of the previous cited elements have been observed in the studied fields from a temporary point of view significate changes in the crops along the three seasons were not appreciated nevertheless there is a variation among the studied experimental fields fig 12 shows the temporary evolution along three harvests for the five analyzed elements in a depth of 10 cm in all the cases the variations are minimized accordingto the increase of the depth the values are almost constant in low depth along the time fig 14 for all these microelements there are increasing after the harvest and they are decreasing with furthermore leaching this is caused to the flood of the fields with reused water this happens with the boron for this element these increasing are constants and regulars along all the seasons moreover it can be observed that there is a light increasing along the years this is not possible extrapolating as a conclusion moreover in the case of nickel a leaching along the years is observed in the case of chromium there is a certainly leaching but it is less regular nevertheless in zinc and copper an increasing with the time is appreciated during the harvest of the second year there is a strong peak this may be caused by the discharge of both elements in the irrigation water this increasing is essentially produced in field 2 that is over the average values this is the only field that is receiving water from the irrigation channel climatic data during the experimental period has been included in fig 17 4 conclusions relatively high total heavy metal content was found near the surface in soils which does not necessarily imply that the concentrations are also high in the soluble soil fraction which is where they are available to plants and where they can pose toxicity problems at the ph values of the soils studied most of the metals are not readily available in the soil solution the levels of boron chromium copper nickel and zinc found in both soils and water were not above either the values recommended by the eu s water directives or those of the us epa for soils although the long term use of this water could cause high soil contents after a considerable number of years cumulative factor this effect can be observed in the sediment in certain zones close to where the irrigation channels empty into the lake in the case of chromium chromium and zinc appear to be retained in the soil and the contents of both are seen to diminish along the length of the irrigation line this behaviour is repeated to a lesser extent in the case of nickel heavy metals are thus seen to accumulate in the upper reaches of the soil and do not leach into the lower regions in any quantity as the concentration is reduced with distance from the surface in the study reduced metal concentrations were found at the 20 30 cm depth except in the case of nickel for most of the metals studied the concentrations in roots are usually higher than in stems and stem contents are almost always higher than in the grain this means that not only the soil can act as a heavy metal filter but the plant itself can extract them from the soil without reaching significant concentrations in the grain which is the part that reaches the consumer it should always be remembered when analyzing the results that some of these elements can be passed on to people or to animals or from the latter as they are bioaccumulable to the people at the end of the trophic chain where they become toxic in small doses as in the case of boron chromium and nickel it is precisely for this reason that the use made of vegetable wastes is still an unsolved problem this means that the soil is not the only filter of heavy metals in this study basic soils in typical mediterranean conditions but the plants can also extract them from the soil without them reaching the grain which means they do not reach the consumer even though the rice crop can be considered to a certain extent a green filter of the recycled water that flows into the albufera it should not be forgotten that modern agricultural methods are in themselves a contaminating factor in a highly sensitive environment such as the albufera lake as fertilisers and pesticides are known to cause serious pollution problems we must consider reducing or eliminating some of these products that can contaminate water soil and even an entire ecosystem the results show that not all the contamination comes from the water but is partly caused by the agricultural practices of the rice growers in fact in the case of these and other heavy metals it is difficult to determine whether the concentrations in plants proceed entirely from the irrigation water or if the fertilizers and pesticides applied to the crops are another important source of these metals some of the fertilizers used to grow rice in this zone contain cd co cu zn fe and mn while cd co cu ni pb zn fe and mn are components of the habitually used pesticides as gimeno et al 2001 have pointed out based on the analyses themselves and the referenced bibliography in spite of the difficulties and with proper management the use of recycled water can not only cover the crop s water needs since rice growing areas in many cases are close to large populations and industrial centres that require abundant water supplies using recycled water also means helping to preserve the ecosystems of wetlands since using it to grow rice is a form of purifying the water and avoids the need to dispose of contaminated water in environmentally sensitive zones as has been shown in the study carried out by zulu et al 1996 of the university of niigata in the conditions in valencia unlike those in other parts of the world such as south east asia an excess of heavy metals in the soil does not necessarily mean that they are available to the plants which may even present deficiencies since the concentrations may not be present in the soluble fraction of the soil where they become available to plants and may cause toxicity problems this may happen in basic soils in which the heavy metals are adsorbed in the clay humic complex or may take the form of insoluble salts mainly carbonates bicarbonates and sulfates regulating this situation is thus complicated since the maximum thresholds of heavy metals in irrigation water vary according to the ph of the soil on which it is used and the real situation is ahead of the relevant legislation it has to be indicated that heavy metals are originated not only in the water but partially they can be originated from pesticides and herbicides these increases has been produced during the crop seasons finally it is important to emphasize that the temporary variation of the observed heavy metal quantities it not seems that they are not in relation with the crop the cause seems to be related with the basic soil capacity for promoting chelates they retain the metal in the soil and it doesn t move to the crop 
11311,waste water is widely used for irrigation purposes in agriculture and in the case of rice it is not only a normal but a frequent practice due to the large water demands of this crop however this highly beneficial system due to its use of such a valuable resource is not entirely free from risks one of which is that recycled water may contain small quantities of heavy metals whose accumulation could prove toxic to the environment animals and humans heavy metals are usually found in higher concentrations in recycled urban and industrial waste water than in normal surface or ground irrigation water they may not only cause toxicity problems in plants but also in animals and in the people that consume them or in the people that consume the animals that feed on the plants with the associated risk of bioaccumulation as in the case of boron which can cause blindness elements that can have toxic effects on plants and animals in small concentrations include boron cadmium copper nickel molybdenum zinc and iron recycled irrigation water from urban areas does not usually contain an alarming amount of metals except in cases in which waste water is collected from certain industries this study focuses on the evolution along an irrigation line of the effects of using recycled urban waste water with secondary treatment on rice crops and on the cultivation medium its novel contribution as regards previous research on the use of urban waste water in agriculture and its effects on crops and the environment lies in the fact that we not only followed the time evolution throughout various crop cycles but also the linear spatial evolution of concentrations in specific chemical parameters of the land flooded to grow rice mapping the changes with the help of geographical information systems the study included the analysis of the evolution of five heavy metals b cu cr ni and zn in soils and rice crops on five farms along an irrigation line throughout three crop cycles in alkaline soils such as that involved in this study the metals are in general retained in the soil and do not pass into the plants to cause toxicity problems but even so with continuous long term irrigation heavy metals can accumulate and in the case of rice this situation is likely to arise in the study we always considered the possibility that this crop is a heavy metal filter that prevents toxic elements from reaching the consumer keywords heavy metals rice irrigation coastal lagoon contamination 1 introduction alarm bells recently began sounding around the world after the press publicised a warning from the swedish national food agency nfa that rice and rice products contain arsenic and that the frequent consumption of wholegrain rice could involve health risks especially the consumption of rice cakes by children and adults islam et al 2017 considering nfa s allegations the conditions in which rice is produced must be considered since the truth or falsity of these allegations will largely depend on them and especially on the quality of the water used and soil ph in fact this risk is not only associated with rice but with other agricultural products as well and arsenic is not the only heavy metal that threatens people s health neither is waste water the only source of the heavy metals found in the soil they also come from industrial and mining residues and fungicides are one of the most important sources of the heavy metals found in the soil including chromium and copper heavy metals are elements with high density and atomic numbers and naturally occur in very small concentrations most of them are toxic and harmful to humans above certain concentrations and are also bioaccumulable sufficiently high concentrations of arsenic ingested over a long period of time can considerably increase the risk of acquiring lung and bladder cancer other elements such as cadmium can accumulate in certain plants and reach dangerous concentrations for consumers for example the carcinogenic hexavalent chromium cr vi used in the chemicals industry can be absorbed by inhalation or ingestion and can cause chromosomal abnormalities in people as mentioned above boron can induce blindness and while nickel in itself is not highly toxic the nickel present in certain alloys can cause serious illnesses such as dermatitis retarded growth respiratory problems hyperglucemia and degenerative disorders arsenic copper zinc nickel and cadmium are particularly toxic milacic et al 2017 the possible consequences of using wastewater containing heavy metals for irrigation has been the subject of research for several decades e g the study carried out in 1959 in japan by asami and kumada 1959 in 1981 page et al pointed out that trace elements such as zinc nickel copper molybdenum and cadmium could be dangerous to both animals and persons in 2001 requena declared the most dangerous heavy metals for the environment and humans are lead mercury cadmium tin chromium zinc and copper due to their excessive use by industry in pesticides and medicines their toxicity and their wide distribution throughout the environment other authors have added further elements that in extremely small quantities pose a risk to animals and plants including boron nickel molybdenum manganese and iron furthermore unlike organic compounds metals do not break down either biologically or chemically and berferull and de la guardia 1984 have gone as far as to say that the biological amplification of their concentration in the trophic chain could even destroy the ecosystem da silva et al 2017 in italy barbafieri et al 1996 claim that the soil acts more or less as a barrier to heavy metals by accumulating them and avoiding their transfer to crops lai et al 2017 and thus also to human consumers simmons and pongsakul 2002 made an excellent analysis based on the comments of w van der hoek on heavy metals and cadmium in the rice food chain of the studies carried out in china and japan for many years these studies found that the long term consumption of rice contaminated with cadmium can cause acute or chronic diseases in humans such as kidney failure which is irreversible and progressive even when exposure is subsequently reduced various studies suggest that cadmium induced kidney failure interferes with vitamin d metabolism associated with the reduced absorption of calcium and causes osteopenia and osteoporosis especially in multiparous women cadmium is also a known carcinogen in humans populations that depend on rice contaminated with cadmium and whose additional food sources are low in zinc iron and calcium are at a greater risk of suffering the harmful effects of cadmium on their health it was also found that in the long term uncontrolled amounts of cd zn pb hg as cu cr 6 ni and mn in agroecosystems reduce harvests and the quality of the produce and thus have a negative influence on food safety and farmers incomes in addition high levels of heavy metals in soils significantly reduce its biodiversity and thus also the recycling of biological nutrients and plant soil symbiosis one especially interesting study due to its similarities with the present paper is that of kwun et al 2001 of the university of konkuk in south korea carried out from may to september in 1998 in which they recommend the reuse of recycled water for irrigating rice provided that its heavy metal content is controlled the study involved growing rice in 90 cm diameter plant pots through a complete rice growing cycle in which there were four different treatments plus a control watered with clean water and treated with conventional fertilizer recycled waste water was used in the four treatments one had conventional fertilizer one had half the dose of conventional fertilizer and the other two had none at all but their waste water was diluted to reduce its high total nitrogen content measurements were taken of plant height leaf surface and degree of tillering at seven day intervals starting in august after harvesting and drying the samples panicle size stem length and yield were measured and the heavy metal content of the grains was assessed before husking for which no significant results were obtained the study reached important conclusions as regards the basis of the present study on one hand the waste water had no negative effect either on the yield or growth of the crop however it should not be forgotten that in our study zone and in other similar experiences using waste water with excess nitrogen the rice plants tend to bend over or lie flat however they found that the key factor was fertilization and not the quality of the irrigation water provided that total nitrogen was not above 25 ppm it also seems that using recycled water can be beneficial since with equal amounts of fertilizers a 10 higher yield was obtained over rice irrigated with clean water with no loss of grain quality finally the results are said to suggest that the standards of irrigation water quality should be scientifically analysed and modified where necessary since if these standards are too high the water treatment cost will also be unnecessarily high mutlu and uncumusaoglu 2017 a rather ambitious study along these lines is that of fu et al 2008 carried out in china which analysed the risks to human health of 10 different heavy metals as ba cd co cr cu hg mn ni y pb in rice irrigation water the authors concluded that the daily intake of these metals via rice was much lower than the daily tolerable intake but that the bioaccumulation of mercury through the food chain and the arsenic intake from other foods should also give cause for worry liu et al 2017 the study by zhuang et al in villages in southern china in 2009 focused on the bioaccumulation of four heavy metals cu zn pb and cd in soil crops and foods and assessed the possible risks to human health they found that cadmium and lead had the highest concentrations in grains and had different concentrations in some of the vegetables studied they also found that due to their contamination by heavy metals consuming rice and vegetables represented a grave risk to the health of the local population finally the study by cao et al in 2010 dealt with the combined risk of consuming rice and other vegetables with concentrations of various heavy metals cu zn pb cr hg and cd these authors found that the individual metal contents were lower than the levels permitted in china but when the six intakes were combined when consuming rice and vegetables the potential health risks were considerably higher moreover meng et al 2016 presented a case study in tianjin china european countries have a number of approaches to define risk levels associated with different concentrations of heavy metal in soil carlon et al 2007 ferguson 1999 some of this information is included in the finnish legislation for contaminated soil ministry of the environment mef finland 2007 the finnish standard values represent a good approximation of the mean values of different national systems in europe carlon et al 2007 and they have been applied in an international context for agricultural soils as well unep 2013 this legislation sets concentration levels by each hazardous elements to identify soil contamination and remediation needs it sets lower and higher concentration levels indicating the need for different actions if exceeded higher concentration levels are defined by major land uses i e for industrial or transport sites and for other land uses the so called threshold value isequally applicable for all sites and it indicates the need for further assessment of the area in areas where background concentration is higher than the threshold value background concentration is regarded as the assessment threshold the second concentration level is the so called guideline value if this is exceeded the area has a contamination level which presents ecological or health risks different guideline values are set for industrial and transport areas higher guideline value and for all other land uses lower guideline value in other hand the spanish environmental legal framework comprises laws regulating particular industries and activities and laws protecting the environment and controlling certain contaminating agents most spanish environmental laws derive from the transposition of eu legislation the main regulated environmental fields are integrated environmental control natural heritage and biodiversity protection air quality and atmosphere protection environmental responsibility nuisance activities environmental impact assessment contaminated land waste among others the spanish local autonomous regions can develop and enforce their own environmental legislation and local authorities also have environmental protection powers accordingly enforcement of environmental law is carried out at state regional and local authority level the regulatory regime for waste is established in law 22 2011 on waste and contaminated land this regulation establishes measures to protect the environment and human health by preventing or reducing the adverse impact of generating and managing waste whenever the integrated pollution prevention and control ippc regime does not apply in the same case about the permits and regulators any operator whether individual or legal entity of waste treatment activities including waste storage and the substantial modification enlargement and relocation of relevant waste treatment facilities requires an administrative authorization issued by the environmental authority of each autonomous region a separate authorisation is required by the owner of such facilities if they are not the operator about the operator criteria they generally carrying out the activities subject to an authorization must provide certain financial guarantees obtain specific insurance policies prove to the environmental authority that they have suitable personal qualities as well as the technical means to carry out the activity there are some special rules for certain waste that is extended to the producer responsibility in order to encourage recycling certain types of products that become waste after their use are subject to extended producer responsibility rules any individual or legal entity that professionally develops manufactures processes treats sells or imports these products must comply with certain obligations for example to accept returned products and the waste produced from the use of those products the law also sets out the requirements for subsequent management re use recycling and recovery of the waste and establishes who is to be responsible for the relevant costs there are certain types of waste are not regulated by the waste regime including uncontaminated soil and other naturally occurring material excavated during construction activities to be used on site for construction purposes wastewater animal by products animal corpses and waste resulting from mineral resources or mining activities in another aspects the federal soil protection act precaution must be taken to avert harmful changes to the soil also with regard to the discharge of harmful substances into the soil by cultivation activities to comply with the precautionary principle by following the aims of preventive environmental protection problematical input of substances into the environmental media soil water and air must be prevented regarding both the outstanding importance of agricultural soil for the production of safe food it has to be ensured that there will be no accumulation of contaminants in soil especially by application of sewage sludge slurry and other farm manure artificial fertilizer and compost the federal ministry of consumer protection food and agriculture and the federal ministry for the environment nature conservation and nuclear safety introduced the german concept for the assessment of fertilizers gute qualität und sichere erträge during their joint conference in 2001 according to this resolution all affected policies in germany are currently under revision to meet the requirements in line with the federal soil protection act some results of works are located in mapping the identification of areas where heavy metal accumulation presents a hazard to health or the environment to delineate those areas which are threatened by high heavy metal concentrations assessment thresholds on each map are developed threshold values proposed by the finnish ministry of environment ministry of environment findland 2007 were used which indicate concentrations where soil contamination and remediation needs must be further assessed the threshold values of the mef represent a good approximation of the mean values of different national systems in europe carlon et al 2007 have been used in an international context for agricultural soils unep 2013 and were also successfully applied in regional assessment in europe tóth et al 2013 the standard method iso 1995 using aqua regia as an extracting agent was matched with one using microwave assisted acid digestion ecs 2010 and the same detection methods employing icp oes inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer waste management regulations such as those in the closed cycle management act of 24 february 2012 which entered into force on 1 june 2012 are also important for soil protection the sewage sludge ordinance and the ordinance on biowaste are also relevant in this context the legal regulations regarding waste contain guidelines for the environmentally sound recycling and disposal of waste there are only a few areas in europe where ambient air concentrations of cadmium cd lead pb mercury hg arsenic as and nickel ni are above the limit or target values exceedances of the limit or target values and human exposure at these locations is very much a local problem typically caused by specific industrial plants however the atmospheric deposition of toxic metals contributes to the exposure of ecosystems and organisms to toxic metals bioaccumulation can subsequently occur in the food chain thus affecting human health within the convention on long range transboundary air pollution lrtap emissions of heavy metals are controlled by the amended protocol on heavy metals which requires parties to reduce emissions of selected metals to below 1990 levels releases of hg are also controlled by the united nations environment programme minimata convention in the eea 33 region emissions of cd and hg made up approximately a third and a quarter of the corresponding total emissions in 1990 respectively emissions of pb have declined to approximately one tenth of the total 1990 emission levels a combination of targeted legislation for details see policy context and targets in the indicator specification and metadata section improved controls and abatement techniques have in general led to significant progress being made in most countries to reduce heavy metal emissions some policy context and targets are related to the context description coupled with improved control and abatement techniques targeted international and eu legislation has led to good progress being made in most eea 33 countries towards reducing heavy metal emissions such legislation includes the 1998 aarhus protocol on heavy metals to the 1979 united nations economic commission for europe unece convention on lrtap which targets three particularly harmful substances cd hg and pb eu directive 2001 80 ec on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants the lcp directive which aims to limit heavy metal emissions via dust control and absorption of heavy metals eu directive 2010 75 eu on industrial emissions integrated pollution prevention and control which aims to prevent or minimize pollution of water air and soil this directive targets certain industrial agricultural and waste treatment installations the european pollutant release and transfer register e prtr regulation 166 2006 ec under the requirements of which emissions of a number of heavy metals released from certain industrial facilities are also estimated and reported the eu directive on ambient air quality and cleaner air for europe 2008 50 ec and directive 2004 107 ec relating to heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ambient air which contain provisions and target and limit values for the further control of air pollutants in ambient air there are also a number of specific eu environmental quality and emission standards for heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants pops in coastal and inland waters drinking waters etc these have only indirect relevance to air emissions as they do not directly specify emission or precipitation quality requirements but rather specify the required quality of receiving waters other measures include restrictions on the use of heavy metals in certain consumer products such as the ec regulation on the banning of exports of metallic mercury and certain mercury compounds and mixtures and the safe storage of metallic mercury no 1102 2008 and directive 2007 51 ec amending council directive 7 769 eec relating to restrictions on the marketing of certain measuring devices containing mercury the minamata convention on mercury a global legally binding treaty was agreed by governments in january 2013 and formally adopted as international law on 10 october 2013 the aarhus protocol on heavy metals to the unece lrtap convention obliges parties to reduce their emissions of cd hg and pb from 1990 levels or an alternative year from 1985 to 1995

iceland liechtenstein norway and switzerland and turkey in 2005 and 2006 the european commission adopted seven thematic strategies on soils pesticides air pollution the marine environment waste prevention and recycling natural resources and the urban environment they are now going through the eu decision making process eu council of ministers european parliament etc in view of being implemented by the member states the thematic strategies are a new holistic approach to whole topic areas they contain measures which are destined to be integrated into existing policies and legislation only when this is not possible is it necessary to propose new legislation or other appropriate instruments they are based on a broad review of existing policy and required several years of scientific and economic analysis together with extensive consultation of stakeholders they look at pressures and impacts which often cut across those themes they examine the links between environmental impacts and sectoral policies they look at a broad range of options and a varied policy mix including the use of market based instruments technology and innovation to deal with the problems identified in a strategic and effective manner they also take a long term perspective setting the framework for eu and member state action for the next two decades they propose strategic objectives and explore short and medium term measures where appropriate thus helping to meet the eu s global commitments each strategy takes the form of a package comprising an overall approach towards the theme concerned presented in a communication that highlights issues and proposes solutions legislative proposals for some of them and an impact assessment the present spatial analysis focuses on an irrigation line to determine whether heavy metals are carried throughout the entire area or are trapped in the soil of the first fields it should be emphasized that this study focuses on basic soils in mediterranean conditions and thus may not be comparable to other local conditions 2 materials and methods the study zone to the south of the city of valencia is an extremely flat plain with a dense population containing rice fields the height of the plain is lower at the southern end where it meets the waters of la albufera which extends north south for 15 km parallel to the coast from which it is separated by a narrow sandy belt the flat regular low lying eastern coastline is washed by the mediterranean sea when choosing the farms for the soil and vegetable samples we considered their position along the irrigation line similar farms were also selected that were irrigated with different water for a comparative study the farms on the irrigation line were chosen at random considering the discriminant spatial variability of the land to be assessed since they had to be far enough apart to be able to detect possible variations in the parameters studied plus other criteria to control other parameters such as fertilizers crop varieties etc nine fields in the zone were finally selected fig 1 four of these were located on the irrigation line fields 2 5 and were watered exclusively with water from a treatment plant one was irrigated with water from the lake albufera field 9 another with low quality water from the favara irrigation channel field 1 two others fields 6 and 7 that received a mix of recycled and fresh water from the irrigation channels and finally field 8 which received three different types of water favara recycled and albufera since nutrients and metals might or might not be carried from one field to another the irrigation line was important for the study field 1 mainly received favara water field 2 received water directly from the treatment plant as did the successive fields along the line up to field 6 after which the recycled water was mixed with water from other sources in the fields on the same irrigation line one of the main aims of the study was to detect whether or not water and metals were carried from one field to another the fields chosen for this purpose fields 2 6 received water from the pineda treatment plant in fields 6 8 the exact proportions of water from different sources could not be determined in addition fields 6 8 are flooded each november with water from the lake 2 1 soil measurements six jackson type sampling points were selected in a zig zag pattern for the samples from each field and each of the six were divided into three sub points whose samples which were mixed in the field to ensure they were representative and homogenous samples were taken at depths of from 0 to 10 cm depth of rice roots each simple was analysed twice to minimise possible discrepancies in the lab results the samples were prepared for analysis in the laboratory this included the separation by hand of large clumps of soil and drying at room temperature until reaching lab ambient humidity the coarser elements were broken up by a roller during drying equilibrium was reached when the samples gave off dust the samples were then broken up first by a mallet and then in an electric roller mill sieved twice and ground to a fine powder in a blade mill the samples then weighed around 50 g with finely ground samples the extractive agents can act more efficiently and faster when analyzing heavy metals b cu cr ni and zn an extract was then obtained by 1 m ammonium acetate at neutral ph for atomic absorption spectrophotometric determination creating a calibration curve for each element with the appropriate patterns for the conditions of the samples table 1 shows the concentration ppm of the elements in the soil of the 9 experimental fields at depths from 0 to 10 cm described above 2 2 determination methods in vegetable tissues the analysis of rice plant treatments is always approached from the aspect of their heavy metal content field inspections are carried out throughout the growth cycle and at harvesting samples are collected for lab analysis table 2 entire plant samples were chosen these were arranged on a work bench with leaves and stem separated from the roots panicle and grain all of which are analysed separately there are two fundamental objectives firstly there must be a big enough sample from each field for both analyses and repetitions secondly and even more important is the aspect of representativeness which involves obtaining general information on the nutritional state and activity of the crop as a whole since the composition of the stem and leaves can vary with the position of the plant this helps to avoid deviations in the results due to the manner of sampling and position of the plants the first determination was on the mass of fresh material from all the leaves on digital scales to obtain a measure of the development of individual plants these were then washed with phosphate free soap and deionised water dried in an oven with a fan at 60 c until constant mass dried roots leaves stems and grains were homogenized in a blade mill and placed in plastic containers for analysis contents of b cu cr ni and zn were analysed in the minerals after calcinations by atomic absorption spectrophotometry in the same operative conditions as for the soil for which a calibration curve was drawn for each element with suitable patterns for the conditions of the samples 3 results and discussion the analytical results were subjected to statistical treatment in which each field was analysed to obtain the means of each one in the first step data from the six points in each field were entered in the program to find the level of interaction between the depth variables sampling date variables and mean field values that were subsequently used from the mean field values the possible linear relationship among the fields for the different factors is then determined the soil results being located on maps with the aid of gis as could be expected the irrigation water and some other basic parameters such as ph were also analysed and the soils were characterized for this type of study ph is not only important in itself but also because on it depend the greater or lesser availability of the water borne elements at the ph values obtained soils of 7 8 8 5 considered moderately alkaline most of the metals in this range are in the form of low solubility salts being soluble at acidic ph values as in the case of manganese which means that it is not very likely to encounter toxicity problems in plants caused by trace elements zinc salts have higher solubility at these ph values 3 1 boron 3 1 1 soils boron concentrations in soils were considered to be quite high although within normal limits fig 2 the high concentrations could have been due to either using fertilisers containing borax or sodium borate or to the habitual use of irrigation water containing boron whose effects that are intensified by clayey soils with enough organic material as in the case of this study higher values were found in irrigation water from the favara zone than in water from the treatment plant and boron values tended to decrease along the irrigation line in all cases values were below 2 ppm which is both the limit in spain and also below limit laid down by the fao for irrigation water and is also below the tolerable values of the us epa 0 75 ppm for continuous irrigation fig 2 shows values of 100 ppm 3 1 2 plants boron values in grains important from the consumer s point of view stems and roots were within normal limits fig 3 for example in stems and leaves they were between 7 and 18 ppm which were lower than those considered toxic in mature plants higher than 100 ppm and higher than the deficiency level 3 4 ppm as had happened in the case of water slightly higher values were found in field 1 3 2 copper 3 2 1 soils as can be seen in fig 4 copper levels in soils were high especially in field 2 possibly due to the application of a pesticide containing copper sulphate it would seem that the copper does not come mainly from the recycled water however what could have happened is that the copper in the fields gets into the irrigation channels and from there into the lake this theory is compatible with the copper concentrations found in the last fields to test this hypothesis we analysed the data supplied by the environmental authority for that year at the point where the channels studied enter the lake from this data it is clear that the highest values occur at the end of may 0 007 ppm the time of year in which pesticides may be used 3 2 2 plants copper concentrations in plants although high in roots in the stems did not reach 30 ppm the level considered to be toxic fig 5 from the data obtained copper appears to be concentrated in the roots and with difficulty reaches dangerous levels in stem and grain which seems to indicate that the roots of the rice plant can act extract copper from soils the abnormal levels in grain detected that year in field 2 are associated with the high values found in the soil but not with the levels in water this could be due to two possible causes either the fact that the water tests were not carried out continuously or to the presence of copper from an external source probably pesticide 3 3 chromium 3 3 1 soils it can be seen from the fig 6 that higher concentrations are found in the last fields as regards irrigation water since the values found in water from the treatment plant had lower chromium levels than water from other sources this seems to indicate that the possible chromium intake is not from the treatment plant in all cases the values are below the 2 ppm set by the spanish safety standards and also below the 1 ppm recommended by the us epa for short term irrigation in alkaline and neutral soils however these same standards set a value of 0 1 ppm for continuous irrigation as in the present case study and these values are exceeded in all the water studied other than that from the treatment plant these levels are confirmed by the values found in the sediment at the entry of the irrigation channels into the albufera which although they do not give cause for alarm are above those considered normal requena 2001 3 3 2 plants higher than normal chromium levels were found in field 9 3 33 ppm in stems and roots fig 7 the water in this field has higher chromium levels over the 0 1 ppm recommended by the us epa for continuous irrigation which cane from the albufera lagoon mixed with water from other fields and from the favara irrigation channel exceptionally high values have been observed in some plot for example in plot 3 the first year which could be due either to a single intake or a sampling error as occurs with other trace elements such as copper the chromium is concentrated in the roots of the plant so that it is difficult for it to reach dangerous levels in the grain this is further evidence in favour of rice being a soil purifier 3 4 nickel 3 4 1 soils the levels of nickel in soils is within normal limits for agricultural land i e between 2 and 50 ppm fig 8 the only high values were found in field 2 in one of the years but these were well below contamination levels nickel concentrations in the irrigation water used on these soils were below the 0 2 ppm recommended by the fao and us epa for continuous irrigation these low water concentrations also vary widely and so do not allow any relationships to be established although other studies carried out on cereal crops váquez et al 2001 found that nickel tends to accumulate in soils our results appear to show that it is absorbed by crops or perhaps carried away by the water since nickel concentrations diminish at higher soil depths however overall total nickel concentration in soil remains constant both before and after harvests possibly due to external sources in the form of fertilizers and pesticides 3 4 2 plants the results obtained are within the range habitually found in rice as in the case of other trace elements nickel appears to concentrate in the roots and does not often reach dangerous levels in stems or especially in the grain here again the entire plant showed an overall effect of extracting the heavy metal from soils fig 9 3 5 zinc 3 5 1 soils zinc concentrations in water are well below the fao s recommended maximum for irrigation water 2 ppm it must also be remembered that zinc toxicity declines as ph increases however in spite of the low zinc concentrations in water the hypothesis that water is the origin of the higher zinc levels in the soil seems to be confirmed this is because the soils with most zinc are those that receive water from the treatment plant which has the highest zinc content this concentration is gradually reduced in the irrigation channels and in the soil with distance from the outlet of the treatment plant zinc is located in the head fields this element has not been dragged to the fields at the end of the irrigation line this is ought to the soil retention as the others metals the effect of chelation is again very important this element hardly get into the crop the soil zinc values are thus within what could be considered normal ranges except in fields 2 and 3 whose values are higher although not alarmingly so fig 10 the higher values in fields that receive water directly from the treatment plant seem to point to the plant as the cause of this situation this view is supported by the fact that the highest zinc concentrations are found near the surface as can be seen in fig 13 as the concentrations are seen to increase with time this could mean that more zinc is received than is lost by absorption into crops by leaching or by being carried away by the water as in the case of other trace elements the total zinc content in soil does not appear to be affected by the zinc absorbed by the plants if the relationship between zinc concentrations in soil in fields that only receive water from the treatment plant and distance from the plant is considered it can be seen that for these fields nº 2 5 and the first fourvalue in fig 15 approximate to an exponential that responds to the formula y 363 98е 0 0006x with r2 0 9255 y is electrical conductivity in ds m and x is distance in metres this suggests a relationship between the water from the plant and the zinc in the soil and that as the zinc is retained in the soil the concentration along the irrigation line decreases comparing the trend lines of zinc concentrations in soil with those of copper and nickel a certain similarity can be observed in the behaviour of these elements as can be seen in fig 16 this situation is as would be expected as the elements have similar chemical properties as shown by their situation in the periodic table if the trend of zinc concentrations in soils with those of copper and nickel are compared it can be establish a similarity in the behavior of these three elements as shown in fig 16 this was expected since they are elements with similar chemical properties as their situation in the periodic table shows 3 5 2 plants the zinc values in plants are considered normal for rice and are higher in the roots than in stems and grain toxic values start at 1500 ppm in stems and the deficiency level is below 10 ppm in the grain in the case of this nutrient also the plant as a whole acts as a filter to keep most of the zinc in the ground fig 11 some variations in the concentrations of the previous cited elements have been observed in the studied fields from a temporary point of view significate changes in the crops along the three seasons were not appreciated nevertheless there is a variation among the studied experimental fields fig 12 shows the temporary evolution along three harvests for the five analyzed elements in a depth of 10 cm in all the cases the variations are minimized accordingto the increase of the depth the values are almost constant in low depth along the time fig 14 for all these microelements there are increasing after the harvest and they are decreasing with furthermore leaching this is caused to the flood of the fields with reused water this happens with the boron for this element these increasing are constants and regulars along all the seasons moreover it can be observed that there is a light increasing along the years this is not possible extrapolating as a conclusion moreover in the case of nickel a leaching along the years is observed in the case of chromium there is a certainly leaching but it is less regular nevertheless in zinc and copper an increasing with the time is appreciated during the harvest of the second year there is a strong peak this may be caused by the discharge of both elements in the irrigation water this increasing is essentially produced in field 2 that is over the average values this is the only field that is receiving water from the irrigation channel climatic data during the experimental period has been included in fig 17 4 conclusions relatively high total heavy metal content was found near the surface in soils which does not necessarily imply that the concentrations are also high in the soluble soil fraction which is where they are available to plants and where they can pose toxicity problems at the ph values of the soils studied most of the metals are not readily available in the soil solution the levels of boron chromium copper nickel and zinc found in both soils and water were not above either the values recommended by the eu s water directives or those of the us epa for soils although the long term use of this water could cause high soil contents after a considerable number of years cumulative factor this effect can be observed in the sediment in certain zones close to where the irrigation channels empty into the lake in the case of chromium chromium and zinc appear to be retained in the soil and the contents of both are seen to diminish along the length of the irrigation line this behaviour is repeated to a lesser extent in the case of nickel heavy metals are thus seen to accumulate in the upper reaches of the soil and do not leach into the lower regions in any quantity as the concentration is reduced with distance from the surface in the study reduced metal concentrations were found at the 20 30 cm depth except in the case of nickel for most of the metals studied the concentrations in roots are usually higher than in stems and stem contents are almost always higher than in the grain this means that not only the soil can act as a heavy metal filter but the plant itself can extract them from the soil without reaching significant concentrations in the grain which is the part that reaches the consumer it should always be remembered when analyzing the results that some of these elements can be passed on to people or to animals or from the latter as they are bioaccumulable to the people at the end of the trophic chain where they become toxic in small doses as in the case of boron chromium and nickel it is precisely for this reason that the use made of vegetable wastes is still an unsolved problem this means that the soil is not the only filter of heavy metals in this study basic soils in typical mediterranean conditions but the plants can also extract them from the soil without them reaching the grain which means they do not reach the consumer even though the rice crop can be considered to a certain extent a green filter of the recycled water that flows into the albufera it should not be forgotten that modern agricultural methods are in themselves a contaminating factor in a highly sensitive environment such as the albufera lake as fertilisers and pesticides are known to cause serious pollution problems we must consider reducing or eliminating some of these products that can contaminate water soil and even an entire ecosystem the results show that not all the contamination comes from the water but is partly caused by the agricultural practices of the rice growers in fact in the case of these and other heavy metals it is difficult to determine whether the concentrations in plants proceed entirely from the irrigation water or if the fertilizers and pesticides applied to the crops are another important source of these metals some of the fertilizers used to grow rice in this zone contain cd co cu zn fe and mn while cd co cu ni pb zn fe and mn are components of the habitually used pesticides as gimeno et al 2001 have pointed out based on the analyses themselves and the referenced bibliography in spite of the difficulties and with proper management the use of recycled water can not only cover the crop s water needs since rice growing areas in many cases are close to large populations and industrial centres that require abundant water supplies using recycled water also means helping to preserve the ecosystems of wetlands since using it to grow rice is a form of purifying the water and avoids the need to dispose of contaminated water in environmentally sensitive zones as has been shown in the study carried out by zulu et al 1996 of the university of niigata in the conditions in valencia unlike those in other parts of the world such as south east asia an excess of heavy metals in the soil does not necessarily mean that they are available to the plants which may even present deficiencies since the concentrations may not be present in the soluble fraction of the soil where they become available to plants and may cause toxicity problems this may happen in basic soils in which the heavy metals are adsorbed in the clay humic complex or may take the form of insoluble salts mainly carbonates bicarbonates and sulfates regulating this situation is thus complicated since the maximum thresholds of heavy metals in irrigation water vary according to the ph of the soil on which it is used and the real situation is ahead of the relevant legislation it has to be indicated that heavy metals are originated not only in the water but partially they can be originated from pesticides and herbicides these increases has been produced during the crop seasons finally it is important to emphasize that the temporary variation of the observed heavy metal quantities it not seems that they are not in relation with the crop the cause seems to be related with the basic soil capacity for promoting chelates they retain the metal in the soil and it doesn t move to the crop 
11312,reducing nitrogen n fertilizer input into the soil is needed by a crop production and environmental pollution control a field experiment using a wheat maize rotation system was conducted in

planted in mid june the resin coated urea was provided by kingenta shandong china the release period of the crf was 180 days and 90 days when it was applied to the wheat in winter and to the maize in

before planting the conventional urea was applied with two applications for the rec 80 rec dm and cf treatments half at planting and the other half around the stem elongation stage fertilizers and manures were uniformly broadcast onto the soil surface and immediately incorporated into the soil 0 20 cm depth by tillage prior to sowing there was no irrigation applied during the growing period in

harvested manually in early june and the maize plants were harvested in early october stem biomass stem and leaves and grain yield were determined after oven drying at 60 c subsamples of the stem and grain were taken to determine n content using the kjeldahl procedure horwitz 1980 soil samples were collected from each crop four times the returning green stage stem elongation stage before

soil nmin at harvest crop n uptake soil nmin initial apparent n loss was estimated as the difference between n input n fertilizer applied plus initial soil nmin before planting plus apparent n mineralization and n output aboveground n uptake plus residual soil nmin zhao et al 2006 3 apparent n loss soil nmin initial nmineralized nfer soil nmin harvest crop n uptake where soil nmin initial and nmin harvest are the inorganic n contents within the top 100 cm soil profile before planting and after harvest respectively crop n uptake represents n accumulation in aboveground biomass nfer is n application rate and n mineralized is apparent n mineralization rate during the crop growing season in the north china plain the grain and the straw of the crop aboveground are removed but the plant roots remain in the soil the roots are broken up into the soil by rotary tillage before the next crop planting as the roots decompose the nutrients contained in the roots are released gradually into the soil in this study we calculated the mineralization of nitrogen in the control treatment without nitrogen application before planting and after harvest for each crop growth season and this was taken into account when we calculated the apparent loss eq 3 so the nutrients retained in the roots would not affect the results in this study a relative growth rate formula was used to estimate relative nitrate n accumulation rate rnar in soil layers during the crop growing season rnar was estimated by calculating the rnar of nitrate n in the 20 cm soil layer during different growing periods and then extrapolating this to the whole growth season this information is now included in the text 4 rnar n 2 n 1 t 2 t 1 n 1 where rnar is relative nitrate n accumulation rate the n1 and n2 are the nitrate n contents in the soil layers at the first t1 and the second t2 sampling time respectively 3 results 3 1 grain yield and nitrogen uptake the grain yield responded to the different treatments was shown in table 1 the winter wheat yields from the treatments ranged from 5 to 8 mg ha 1 in the 2008 2009 season from 5 8 to 8 3 mg ha 1 from the maize in the 2009 season and from 2 2 to 6 4 mg ha 1 from the wheat in the 2009 2010 season the mean yield was calculated for the three growing seasons to assess the impact of the n treatments on grain yield the yield from the crf treatment was similar to the rec treatment and averaged 37 higher than the control treatment and 17 higher than the cf treatment the yield from the 80 rec dm treatment was less than from the rec treatment in the first two growing seasons while higher in the final wheat growing season table 1 crop n uptake of the aboveground biomass in the control treatment without n application gradually decreased through the three growing seasons there was no significant difference in the crop n uptake among the rec crf and 80 rec dm treatments in the first two growing seasons however the n uptake in the 80 rec dm was higher than those in the other two treatments in the wheat growing season of 2009 2010 the mean n uptakes were similar to the three n strategy treatments and were 50 higher than the control treatment and 13 higher than the cf treatment table 1 the yield and n uptake of the crf treatment were similar compared with the rec treatment on the other hand there was an n surplus for the cf treatment but this did not lead to greater yield or n uptake compared with the rec and other n applied treatments 3 2 nitrogen use efficiency and potential environmental impact across the five treatments the uen averaged 46 48 and 40 for the rec crf and 80 rec dm treatments respectively table 2 the uen for the cf treatment was 19 and as expected the lowest this meant that an average of 243 kg n ha 1 in each growing season was not recovered from the conventional fertilizer in the harvested crop there was 310 kg ha 1 of residual soil nitrate n present in the soil profile after harvest for the cf treatment this was 136 kg ha 1 more than in the rec treatment the latter averaging 174 kg ha 1 table 2 there was no significant difference in residual n in the soil among the rec crf 175 kg ha 1 and 80 rec dm 177 kg ha 1 treatments the mean apparent n loss from the crf treatment was only 18 kg ha 1 which was significantly less than those from the rec treatment 72 kg ha 1 there was no significant difference in the mean apparent n loss between the 80 rec dm 58 kg ha 1 and rec 72 kg ha 1 treatments adding more n than that added to the rec treatment increased n loss with 164 kg ha 1 lost from the cf treatment table 2 3 3 the migration of nitrogen in soil layers the rnar values calculated using eq 4 in the different soil layers were considerably different among the three growing seasons fig 2 the rnar of the treatments displayed highly significant p 0 05 differences across the soil depths with the highest rnar in the 40 60 cm soil layer during the 2008 2009 growing season overall more nitrate accumulated in the rec and cf treatments than in the other treatments rnar was almost 118 kg n ha 1 growing season 1 in the 40 60 cm soil layer for the cf treatment and remained high at 53 kg n ha 1 growing season 1 in the 80 100 cm soil layer the rnar for the rec treatment also reached 93 kg n ha 1 growing season 1 in the 40 60 cm soil layer fig 2a however a completely different scenario for the rnar was found in the latter two growing seasons fig 2b c compared with the rnar in 2008 2009 the rnar values in 2009 2010 were obviously lower with no significant differences between the soil depths a similar rnar was found in the ck treatment in both growing seasons very little nitrate n accumulated in the 40 60 cm soil layer for the rec crf and cf treatments fig 2b and c 3 4 the distribution of nitrate nitrogen in 0 100 cm soils the residual nitrate n concentrations in the different soil layers of the treatments were shown in fig 3 including the distribution of nitrate n before the winter wheat sowing in 2008 2009 and at the harvest stages of the winter wheat and summer maize from 2008 to 2010 the nitrate n concentrations were similar in the 40 100 cm soil layer for the control and crf treatments at the wheat harvest stage of the first growing season winter wheat 2008 2009 but for the cf 80 rec dm and rec treatments relatively high concentrations of nitrate n were observed in the 0 20 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers especially for the 80 rec dm and cf treatments the highest nitrate n concentrations 18 19 mg kg 1 were found in the cf treatment in the 20 80 cm soil layer fig 3b at the harvest stage of the summer maize in 2009 nitrate n concentrations in all treatments were higher than the control in all soil layers for the cf treatment the nitrate n concentration in the 40 60 cm soil layer was not the highest among all the treatments however the nitrate n concentration was high in the 60 100 cm soil layer interestingly in the 40 60 cm soil layer the nitrate n concentration for 80 rec dm was as low as the control treatment fig 3c the nitrate n concentrations in the soil profile at the harvest stage of the wheat in the 2009 2010 growing season were similar for all the treatments except the control treatment in the 40 60 cm soil layer the nitrate n concentrations averaged 10 mg kg 1 for the n application treatments however they reached 26 mg kg 1 in the deeper 60 80 cm soil layer fig 3d 4 discussion 4 1 crop yield there was no irrigation in this research but there was only 154 mm rainfall during the second wheat growth season which was less than the rainfall 218 mm in the first wheat season fig 1 the lower rainfall decreased the wheat yields of most of the treatments in this season table 1 the nitrogen utilization efficiency was calculated according to the difference between the fertilization strategy and the control treatment under the same conditions the amount of rainfall would not affect the ranking of nue values in the different fertilizer strategies or the validity of the conclusions about the optimal strategy 4 2 the effect of n fertilizers on n utilization the very high n application rate in the cf treatment really should not be continued because of the higher n loss compared with the rec treatment tables 1 and 2 this is consistent with the research of qin et al 2012 soil organic matter plays a key role in improving water storage capacity reeves 1997 and good water holding capacity of the soil could reduce drainage from leaching yanan et al 1997 accordingly similar n loss was expected from the 80 rec dm treatment and the rec treatment since they had similar n uptake and residual n in the soil table 2 compared with the rate of n applied to the rec treatment the crf treatment produced equivalent grain yield and uen tables 1 and 2 the study of shoji et al 2007 used barley potato and corn also showed that crf could supply n by synchronizing n release with plant n demand and potentially increase n use efficiency these indicated that crf could improve n use efficiency and have a high potential for reducing environmental pollution amans and slangen 1994 shaviv 2001 shoji et al 2007 ji et al 2012 in this study the amounts of residual n were similar between the crf and rec treatments but the apparent n loss from the crf treatment was lower than from the rec treatment table 2 in fact the synchronization of nutrient release and demand of crf due to the fact that the rate of nutrient release is depended on the nutrient concentration in the soil outside of the crf granule therefore the crf polyolefin coated urea had the potential to reduce n loss from urea and the downward movement of n fertilizer in the soil was lesser for coated urea shoji et al 2007 4 3 the effect of n fertilizers on n accumulated in the soil profile when a field is continuously fertilized the accumulated residual nitrate readily moves down with soil water to deeper soil during the crop growing season qin et al 2012 rnar is a measure of the relative rate of n accumulated in the soil layer which was calculated by subtracting the initial soil nitrate n content from the nitrate n content after the growing period nutrient accumulation in the soil is a long and slow process it was difficult to observe significant differences in the nitrate n migration in a short time among the various n strategies fig 2 although there was no significant difference among the treatments in the same soil layer the rnars for the rec and cf treatments were higher than those for the crf and 80 rec dm treatments figs 2 and 3b this is likely to be due to the lower nitrate production from crf and dm which depended on the nutrient release and mineralization rates in contrast compared with the nitrate n concentration before sowing in 2008 the nitrate n concentrations increased noticeably in the 40 80 cm soil layer for the rec 80 rec dm and cf treatments at the harvest stage of the winter wheat in 2008 2009 fig 3b these effects were probably due to the large nutrient gradient in the soil profile at the beginning of the experiment with a higher nitrate concentration in the top soil layer than in the deeper soil when rnar decreased and even turned negative in the top soil layer fig 2b c the nitrate n concentration of the crf treatment also increased in 60 80 cm soil layer at the harvest stage of maize in 2009 fig 3c indicating that the nitrate n accumulation of the crf treatment began to moved down as expected the nitrate n concentrations in the 40 80 cm soil layers of the treatments had a highly consistent trends in the harvest stage of wheat in 2009 2010 fig 3d based on the above discussion it is suspected that the amount of nitrate in the 40 60 cm soil layer might indicate the risk of nitrate leaching loss in this study region this is supported by the fact that nitrate amounts increased noticeably in the deeper soil when nitrate n concentration stabilized in the 40 60 cm soil layer fig 3d for example the nitrate n concentrations in the 40 60 cm soil layer for both treatments of 80 rec dm and cf were higher than the other treatments at the first harvest averaging 18 5 mg kg 1 and then decreased much more at the second harvest only 3 mg kg 1 in the 80 rec dm treatment at the third harvest the nitrate n concentrations for all the treatments had decreased in the 40 60 cm soil layer however they had increased below the 60 cm soil layer fig 3 these changes were observed earlier than in the other treatments due to the high n application rate for the cf treatment and the possible improvement in the soil quality for the 80 rec dm treatment 5 conclusion and implications for agronomic management practices compared with the rec treatment the crf treatment with the same n use efficiency and residual soil nitrate n this experiment clearly showed the migration rate of nitrate in the soil profile depended on the amount and form of n applied nitrate accumulated was faster in the cf 80 rec dm and rec treatments at the beginning of the experiment and slower in the crf treatment the crf could mitigate the nitrate n migration in the soil of 40 60 cm soil layer the 40 60 cm soil layer was the sensitive soil layer in this study due to the crop roots being localized above the 60 cm layer if control of n application is not feasible barrier layers composed of straw mushroom residues or other substances that absorb nutrients without polluting the soil may be necessary to absorb excessive nutrients and reduce n leaching to the deeper soil acknowledgements this study was

similar to the rec treatment and averaged 37 higher than the control treatment and 17 higher than the cf treatment the yield from the 80 rec dm treatment was less than from the rec treatment in the first two growing seasons while higher in the final wheat growing season table 1 crop n uptake of the aboveground biomass in the control treatment without n application gradually decreased through the three growing seasons there was no significant difference in the crop n uptake among the rec crf and 80 rec dm treatments in the first two growing seasons however the n uptake in the 80 rec dm was higher than those in the other two treatments in the wheat growing season of 2009 2010 the mean n uptakes were similar to the three n strategy treatments and were 50 higher than the control treatment and 13 higher than the cf treatment table 1 the yield and n uptake of the crf treatment were similar compared with the rec treatment on the other hand there was an n surplus for the cf treatment but this did not lead to greater yield or n uptake compared with the rec and other n applied treatments 3 2 nitrogen use efficiency and potential environmental impact across the five treatments the uen averaged 46 48 and 40 for the rec crf and 80 rec dm treatments respectively table 2 the uen for the cf treatment was 19 and as expected the lowest this meant that an average of 243 kg n ha 1 in each growing season was not recovered from the conventional fertilizer in the harvested crop there was 310 kg ha 1 of residual soil nitrate n present in the soil profile after harvest for the cf treatment this was 136 kg ha 1 more than in the rec treatment the latter averaging 174 kg ha 1 table 2 there was no significant difference in residual n in the soil among the rec crf 175 kg ha 1 and 80 rec dm 177 kg ha 1 treatments the mean apparent n loss from the crf treatment was only 18 kg ha 1 which was significantly less than those from the rec treatment 72 kg ha 1 there was no significant difference in the mean apparent n loss between the 80 rec dm 58 kg ha 1 and rec 72 kg ha 1 treatments adding more n than that added to the rec treatment increased n loss with 164 kg ha 1 lost from the cf treatment table 2 3 3 the migration of nitrogen in soil layers the rnar values calculated using eq 4 in the different soil layers were considerably different among the three growing seasons fig 2 the rnar of the treatments displayed highly significant p 0 05 differences across the soil depths with the highest rnar in the 40 60 cm soil layer during the 2008 2009 growing season overall more nitrate accumulated in the rec and cf treatments than in the other treatments rnar was almost 118 kg n ha 1 growing season 1 in the 40 60 cm soil layer for the cf treatment and remained high at 53 kg n ha 1 growing season 1 in the 80 100 cm soil layer the rnar for the rec treatment also reached 93 kg n ha 1 growing season 1 in the 40 60 cm soil layer fig 2a however a completely different scenario for the rnar was found in the latter two growing seasons fig 2b c compared with the rnar in 2008 2009 the rnar values in 2009 2010 were obviously lower with no significant differences between the soil depths a similar rnar was found in the ck treatment in both growing seasons very little nitrate n accumulated in the 40 60 cm soil layer for the rec crf and cf treatments fig 2b and c 3 4 the distribution of nitrate nitrogen in 0 100 cm soils the residual nitrate n concentrations in the different soil layers of the treatments were shown in fig 3 including the distribution of nitrate n before the winter wheat sowing in 2008 2009 and at the harvest stages of the winter wheat and summer maize from 2008 to 2010 the nitrate n concentrations were similar in the 40 100 cm soil layer for the control and crf treatments at the wheat harvest stage of the first growing season winter wheat 2008 2009 but for the cf 80 rec dm and rec treatments relatively high concentrations of nitrate n were observed in the 0 20 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers especially for the 80 rec dm and cf treatments the highest nitrate n concentrations 18 19 mg kg 1 were found in the cf treatment in the 20 80 cm soil layer fig 3b at the harvest stage of the summer maize in 2009 nitrate n concentrations in all treatments were higher than the control in all soil layers for the cf treatment the nitrate n concentration in the 40 60 cm soil layer was not the highest among all the treatments however the nitrate n concentration was high in the 60 100 cm soil layer interestingly in the 40 60 cm soil layer the nitrate n concentration for 80 rec dm was as low as the control treatment fig 3c the nitrate n concentrations in the soil profile at the harvest stage of the wheat in the 2009 2010 growing season were similar for all the treatments except the control treatment in the 40 60 cm soil layer the nitrate n concentrations averaged 10 mg kg 1 for the n application treatments however they reached 26 mg kg 1 in the deeper 60 80 cm soil layer fig 3d 4 discussion 4 1 crop yield there was no irrigation in this research but there was only 154 mm rainfall during the second wheat growth season which was less than the rainfall 218 mm in the first wheat season fig 1 the lower rainfall decreased the wheat yields of most of the treatments in this season table 1 the nitrogen utilization efficiency was calculated according to the difference between the fertilization strategy and the control treatment under the same conditions the amount of rainfall would not affect the ranking of nue values in the different fertilizer strategies or the validity of the conclusions about the optimal strategy 4 2 the effect of n fertilizers on n utilization the very high n application rate in the cf treatment really should not be continued because of the higher n loss compared with the rec treatment tables 1 and 2 this is consistent with the research of qin et al 2012 soil organic matter plays a key role in improving water storage capacity reeves 1997 and good water holding capacity of the soil could reduce drainage from leaching yanan et al 1997 accordingly similar n loss was expected from the 80 rec dm treatment and the rec treatment since they had similar n uptake and residual n in the soil table 2 compared with the rate of n applied to the rec treatment the crf treatment produced equivalent grain yield and uen tables 1 and 2 the study of shoji et al 2007 used barley potato and corn also showed that crf could supply n by synchronizing n release with plant n demand and potentially increase n use efficiency these indicated that crf could improve n use efficiency and have a high potential for reducing environmental pollution amans and slangen 1994 shaviv 2001 shoji et al 2007 ji et al 2012 in this study the amounts of residual n were similar between the crf and rec treatments but the apparent n loss from the crf treatment was lower than from the rec treatment table 2 in fact the synchronization of nutrient release and demand of crf due to the fact that the rate of nutrient release is depended on the nutrient concentration in the soil outside of the crf granule therefore the crf polyolefin coated urea had the potential to reduce n loss from urea and the downward movement of n fertilizer in the soil was lesser for coated urea shoji et al 2007 4 3 the effect of n fertilizers on n accumulated in the soil profile when a field is continuously fertilized the accumulated residual nitrate readily moves down with soil water to deeper soil during the crop growing season qin et al 2012 rnar is a measure of the relative rate of n accumulated in the soil layer which was calculated by subtracting the initial soil nitrate n content from the nitrate n content after the growing period nutrient accumulation in the soil is a long and slow process it was difficult to observe significant differences in the nitrate n migration in a short time among the various n strategies fig 2 although there was no significant difference among the treatments in the same soil layer the rnars for the rec and cf treatments were higher than those for the crf and 80 rec dm treatments figs 2 and 3b this is likely to be due to the lower nitrate production from crf and dm which depended on the nutrient release and mineralization rates in contrast compared with the nitrate n concentration before sowing in 2008 the nitrate n concentrations increased noticeably in the 40 80 cm soil layer for the rec 80 rec dm and cf treatments at the harvest stage of the winter wheat in 2008 2009 fig 3b these effects were probably due to the large nutrient gradient in the soil profile at the beginning of the experiment with a higher nitrate concentration in the top soil layer than in the deeper soil when rnar decreased and even turned negative in the top soil layer fig 2b c the nitrate n concentration of the crf treatment also increased in 60 80 cm soil layer at the harvest stage of maize in 2009 fig 3c indicating that the nitrate n accumulation of the crf treatment began to moved down as expected the nitrate n concentrations in the 40 80 cm soil layers of the treatments had a highly consistent trends in the harvest stage of wheat in 2009 2010 fig 3d based on the above discussion it is suspected that the amount of nitrate in the 40 60 cm soil layer might indicate the risk of nitrate leaching loss in this study region this is supported by the fact that nitrate amounts increased noticeably in the deeper soil when nitrate n concentration stabilized in the 40 60 cm soil layer fig 3d for example the nitrate n concentrations in the 40 60 cm soil layer for both treatments of 80 rec dm and cf were higher than the other treatments at the first harvest averaging 18 5 mg kg 1 and then decreased much more at the second harvest only 3 mg kg 1 in the 80 rec dm treatment at the third harvest the nitrate n concentrations for all the treatments had decreased in the 40 60 cm soil layer however they had increased below the 60 cm soil layer fig 3 these changes were observed earlier than in the other treatments due to the high n application rate for the cf treatment and the possible improvement in the soil quality for the 80 rec dm treatment 5 conclusion and implications for agronomic management practices compared with the rec treatment the crf treatment with the same n use efficiency and residual soil nitrate n this experiment clearly showed the migration rate of nitrate in the soil profile depended on the amount and form of n applied nitrate accumulated was faster in the cf 80 rec dm and rec treatments at the beginning of the experiment and slower in the crf treatment the crf could mitigate the nitrate n migration in the soil of 40 60 cm soil layer the 40 60 cm soil layer was the sensitive soil layer in this study due to the crop roots being localized above the 60 cm layer if control of n application is not feasible barrier layers composed of straw mushroom residues or other substances that absorb nutrients without polluting the soil may be necessary to absorb excessive nutrients and reduce n leaching to the deeper soil acknowledgements this study was

crop yield more than all other biotic and abiotic factors combined lambers et al 2008 walter et al 2011 the frequency and magnitude of regional drought periods have been increasing since the 1970s and the situation is projected to worsen in many parts of the world schar et al 2004 trenberth et al 2003 therefore increasing water use efficiency wue or improving plant resistance has become a basic research topic related to sustainable agricultural development and agricultural ecological balance beltrano et al 1999 zhao et al 2014 as a direct response to water shortages or limitations in arid and semiarid areas wue has attracted considerable attention in terms of improving the biological water saving potential of crops through water nutrient management huang and eissenstat 2000 zheng et al 2011 gopalakrishnan et al 2014 many studies kim et al 2007 luo et al 2014 have shown that the limiting factors of wue mainly include water absorption transport consumption and advantage therefore to evaluate the biological water saving potential of crops we need to consider four aspects first roots are the first organs that come into contact with soil water and water nutrient management mainly adjusts root development root distribution and root physiological activity jackson et al 1990 wasson et al 2012 luo et al 2014 dai et al 2015 such management changes the water absorption of the root subsequently affecting wue lopes and araus 2006 white 2013 second water nutrient management mainly affects water transport by changing the transpiration rate and area maricle et al 2009 chen et al 2017b these changes potentially adjust the transport of water in the plant and adjust water use and consumption maricle et al 2009 li et al 2014 lastly the central aspects of wue in crop water use systems are water consumption and use whereas the transpiration area i e leaf area la stomatal conductance gs the leaf transpiration rate tr water productivity wp i e water use ability and wue are the central aspects of crop water consumption and use kang et al 1998 2000 du et al 2010 water nutrient management can adjust la i e transpiration area as well as leaf gs and tr luo et al 2014 li et al 2014 chen et al 2017a b chen et al 2018 though gs and tr are positively related to wue kang et al 1998 2000 du et al 2010 luo et al 2014 and limiting gs can reduce tr and subsequently increase wue kang et al 1998 2000 kang and zhang 2004 dodd 2009 du et al 2010 therefore optimizing root morphology and physiological traits through water nutrient management may promote water absorption increase water transpiration efficiency or balance the relationship between water consumption and use furthermore this approach might be a promising biological water saving method cotton gossypium hirsutum l is one of the most important fiber producing plants the cotton yield in xinjiang accounts for 60 of the total cotton yield in china and represents 18 of the total global cotton yield data obtained from the china cotton fair examination website however the lack of water resources significantly impacts the agricultural and ecological environments e g affecting the susceptibility of cotton to light temperature and moisture and the agricultural production i e affecting the cotton yield and quality therefore it is crucial to develop methods that promote the biological water saving potential of cotton to reduce water limitations our previous studies have shown that the deep water layer which results from presowing irrigation or snow melt has the potential to direct root growth toward the deep soil layer for moisture which supports the overall wue luo et al 2012 2014 basal fertilization can support cotton root development before the full flowering stage i e generally root development occurs before the full flowering stage and increase the available nutrients in the soil layer garrido lestache et al 2004 shen and li 2011 in addition roots tend to grow toward soil nutrients thus basal fertilizer application might modify the root distribution in the soil profile and increase the root competitive ability for moisture in the soil layer with evaporation zhang 2013 improving wue

sm content in the 0 40 cm layer by time domain reflectometry tdr thompson et al 2016 the stoving method was used to assess the change in sm content in the 0 120 cm layer was determined at sampled roots and at a time point mid way between two root samplings when roots were sampled fresh soil from each soil layer was quickly collected in 2016 the soil layer was divided into 10 cm segments for sm content analysis additionally soil drilling with a diameter of 2 cm which has a smaller effect on the roots of cotton plants was employed to determine the sm content of each soil layer was determined at a time point mid way between two root samplings 2 4 root surface area rsa and root vigor rv three tubes each treatment were carefully removed from the ground and cut into 20 cm segments in 2015 and

added to the two samples the absorption of chromophores was measured at 510 nm after 10 min of incubation at 30 c meanwhile a control sample without roots was used to determine the content of auto oxidized α naphthylamine the concentration of α naphthylamine in the tube was determined by comparing the values obtained after shaking for 30 min and 3 h with the values of the α naphthylamine standard solutions the oxidized α naphthylamine was calculated as the decrease in the amount of α naphthylamine measured after 30 min and 3 h of shaking root activity was expressed as oxidized α

efficiency wue it is important to understand how water nutrient applications influence water absorption transport consumption and advantage to obtain higher wue levels in the present study w80f10 increased the root water absorption large rv 30 rsa 30 and rv 80 in the surface and deep soil layers and transpiration area la which promoted wp before 69 dae after 69 dae w80f10 first increased water transport i e fs and water absorption in the surface and deep soil layers and then increased water advantage i e wp and consumption i e la gs and tr ultimately increasing wue one possible explanation was that the basal fertilizer surface application increased rsa and rv in the surface soil layer promoting the absorption of water in the surface soil layers before 69 dae luo et al 2014 wasson et al 2012 and supporting cotton plant wp after 69 dae large rsa and rv values in the surface soil layer and rv in the deep soil layer were maintained by surface fertigation application and the water in the deep soil layer from w80 this promoted water absorption from the surface and the deep soil layer providing root pressure to ensure transpiration and leaf gas exchange and prevent conditions of limited water transport jiang et al 2015 additionally la gs and tr also promoted the transpiration pulling force of water absorption chen et al 2015 klimešová et al 2015 schneider et al 2017 thus these conditions promoted gas exchange and carboxylation efficiency in the leaf increased photosynthetic productivity and simultaneously increased the wp of organs and resulted in higher wue many studies kang et al 1998 ye et al 2013 have shown that irrigation in different root zones can increase the root physiological activity and distribution in the irrigation zone it also increases aba levels in the non irrigation zone this process can also limit stomatal opening and decrease the occurrence of ineffective water consumption which ultimately increases wue moreover zeng et al 2017 and lawlor 2010 showed that tr was closely related to water absorption and transport furthermore tr has a strong positive relationship with gs which increases the transpiration pulling force satisfying the water needs of different tissues and increasing the wp of organs therefore w80f10 increased the water absorptive ability of the roots and promoted water transport and advantage thereby increasing wue 4 2 relationship among water absorption transport consumption and advantage the water use system is closely related with water absorption transport consumption and advantage however the relationships among these factors under conditions of different water nutrient applications are still unclear in w80f10 the water absorptive ability i e rv 30 rsa 30 and rv 80 supported the crop water use while transport i e fs and consumption i e gs tr and la had lower effects on water use before 69 dae after 69 dae w80f10 promoted water absorption transport consumption and advantage additionally consumption and advantage supported water absorption and transport and water use was significantly greater than water consumption one possible explanation was that the greater root distribution and physiological activity increased the root pressure in the surface and deep soil layers before 69 dae wegner 2013 these conditions then supported water transport to aerial parts and promoted water use in cotton plants after 69 dae the higher available water nutrients from fertigation still supported the root distribution in the surface soil layer and the root physiological activity in the surface and deep soil layers which ensured the greater root pressure required to support water transpiration wegner 2013 petrie et al 2015 in addition adequate water application can increase the transpiration area petrie et al 2015 tr and gs chen et al 2017a which can promote a higher water transport rate and transpiration pulling force wegner 2013 petrie et al 2015 overall this is possible to maintain greater activity in the water use system of cotton plants under w80f10 4 3 water nutrients influence the competitive abilities of organs to absorb water crop wue not only is measured by the water absorption ability advantage and consumption and the relationships among these factors but also demonstrates the coordination and competition of different organs in crop water absorption zhang et al 2003 2006 blum 2009 zheng et al 2011 our research showed that under the w80f10 condition the roots and stems plus leaves were enlarged to complete absorption of water with reproductive organs the organs roots stems plus leaves and reproductive organs competed for water mainly through rv fs gs and tr the competitive ability of the organs for water using rv fs gs and tr decreased in the following order vegetative organ reproductive organ root one possible explanation was that the w80f10 treatment enhanced water absorption transport consumption and use which also increased the photosynthetic ability and efficiency of leaves supporting greater production of dry matter in vegetative organs zhang et al 2006 chen et al 2017a moreover transpiration mainly occurred at vegetative organs i e leaf consuming more than 85 of crop absorptive water badr et al 2012 luo et al 2014 indicating that these organs have a great competitive ability to consume more water zhang et al 2006 wegner 2013 flexas et al 2006 han et al 2015 under the w80f10 condition the root and reproductive organs also had a greater competitive ability for water it is possible that the adequate water nutrient application increased productive ability of vegetative organs promote the development of the root and reproductive organs thereby indirectly supporting the water productivity of roots and reproductive organs lilley and kirkegaard 2011 lynch 2013 in addition reproductive organs as a source organ caused more assimilation and water flow toward reproductive organs maintaining great competitive ability compered to roots thus w80f10 mainly increased 1 the wp of vegetative organs supporting wp of reproductive organs and 2 the competitive ability of reproductive organs for water by raising wue 5 conclusion the combination of presowing irrigation and basal fertilizer surface application increased the rsa in the surface soil layer and rv in the surface and deep soil layers which supported the water absorption and use of the crop before 69 days after emergency after 69 days after emergency a large rsa in the surface soil layer rv in the surface and deep soil layers the leaf transpiration rate stomatal conductance sap flow and water productivity supported water use efficiency therefore we conclude that water use efficiency can be raised by increasing water absorption water transport in the stem and water productivity additionally coordinating the relationships among these variables improved the ability of aerial parts to compete for water which could increase water productivity and maintain the sustainable development of agriculture in arid areas acknowledgments we are grateful to the research grants from the natural science foundation of china grant nos

w80 and without w0 presowing irrigation combined with two basal fertilization methods i e surface application f10 and deep application f30 on soil water absorption and transport and relationships with

layer rv 30 root vigor in the 60 80 cm soil layer rv 80 the leaf transpiration rate stomatal conductance sap flow and water productivity principal component analysis showed that the w80f10 treatment initially positively influenced rsa 30 rv 30 and rv 80 and that these parameters affected the leaf transpiration rate stomatal conductance sap flow and leaf area i e the main transpiration area which finally influenced water productivity and water use efficiency in addition the w80f10 treatment increased the ability of aerial parts to compete for water after 69 days after emergency these findings indicate that the combination of presowing irrigation and basal fertilizer surface application can enhance the ability of aerial parts to compete for water and increase water use efficiency by

crop yield more than all other biotic and abiotic factors combined lambers et al 2008 walter et al 2011 the frequency and magnitude of regional drought periods have been increasing since the 1970s and the situation is projected to worsen in many parts of the world schar et al 2004 trenberth et al 2003 therefore increasing water use efficiency wue or improving plant resistance has become a basic research topic related to sustainable agricultural development and agricultural ecological balance beltrano et al 1999 zhao et al 2014 as a direct response to water shortages or limitations in arid and semiarid areas wue has attracted considerable attention in terms of improving the biological water saving potential of crops through water nutrient management huang and eissenstat 2000 zheng et al 2011 gopalakrishnan et al 2014 many studies kim et al 2007 luo et al 2014 have shown that the limiting factors of wue mainly include water absorption transport consumption and advantage therefore to evaluate the biological water saving potential of crops we need to consider four aspects first roots are the first organs that come into contact with soil water and water nutrient management mainly adjusts root development root distribution and root physiological activity jackson et al 1990 wasson et al 2012 luo et al 2014 dai et al 2015 such management changes the water absorption of the root subsequently affecting wue lopes and araus 2006 white 2013 second water nutrient management mainly affects water transport by changing the transpiration rate and area maricle et al 2009 chen et al 2017b these changes potentially adjust the transport of water in the plant and adjust water use and consumption maricle et al 2009 li et al 2014 lastly the central aspects of wue in crop water use systems are water consumption and use whereas the transpiration area i e leaf area la stomatal conductance gs the leaf transpiration rate tr water productivity wp i e water use ability and wue are the central aspects of crop water consumption and use kang et al 1998 2000 du et al 2010 water nutrient management can adjust la i e transpiration area as well as leaf gs and tr luo et al 2014 li et al 2014 chen et al 2017a b chen et al 2018 though gs and tr are positively related to wue kang et al 1998 2000 du et al 2010 luo et al 2014 and limiting gs can reduce tr and subsequently increase wue kang et al 1998 2000 kang and zhang 2004 dodd 2009 du et al 2010 therefore optimizing root morphology and physiological traits through water nutrient management may promote water absorption increase water transpiration efficiency or balance the relationship between water consumption and use furthermore this approach might be a promising biological water saving method cotton gossypium hirsutum l is one of the most important fiber producing plants the cotton yield in xinjiang accounts for 60 of the total cotton yield in china and represents 18 of the total global cotton yield data obtained from the china cotton fair examination website however the lack of water resources significantly impacts the agricultural and ecological environments e g affecting the susceptibility of cotton to light temperature and moisture and the agricultural production i e affecting the cotton yield and quality therefore it is crucial to develop methods that promote the biological water saving potential of cotton to reduce water limitations our previous studies have shown that the deep water layer which results from presowing irrigation or snow melt has the potential to direct root growth toward the deep soil layer for moisture which supports the overall wue luo et al 2012 2014 basal fertilization can support cotton root development before the full flowering stage i e generally root development occurs before the full flowering stage and increase the available nutrients in the soil layer garrido lestache et al 2004 shen and li 2011 in addition roots tend to grow toward soil nutrients thus basal fertilizer application might modify the root distribution in the soil profile and increase the root competitive ability for moisture in the soil layer with evaporation zhang 2013 improving wue the objective of this study was to determine the effects of presowing irrigation and basal fertilization management on soil water content root morphophysiological traits fs gs tr la and wue we also evaluated the contribution of water absorption transport consumption and use to wue and the competitive strategies organs use to obtain water 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the

sm content in the 0 40 cm layer by time domain reflectometry tdr thompson et al 2016 the stoving method was used to assess the change in sm content in the 0 120 cm layer was determined at sampled roots and at a time point mid way between two root samplings when roots were sampled fresh soil from each soil layer was quickly collected in 2016 the soil layer was divided into 10 cm segments for sm

efficiency wue it is important to understand how water nutrient applications influence water absorption transport consumption and advantage to obtain higher wue levels in the present study w80f10 increased the root water absorption large rv 30 rsa 30 and rv 80 in the surface and deep soil layers and transpiration area la which promoted wp before 69 dae after 69 dae w80f10 first increased water transport i e fs and water absorption in the surface and deep soil layers and then increased water advantage i e wp and consumption i e la gs and tr ultimately increasing wue one possible explanation was that the basal fertilizer surface application increased rsa and rv in the surface soil layer promoting the absorption of water in the surface soil layers before 69 dae luo et al 2014 wasson et al 2012 and supporting cotton plant wp after 69 dae large rsa and rv values in the surface soil layer and rv in the deep soil layer were maintained by surface fertigation application and the water in the deep soil layer from w80 this promoted water absorption from the surface and the deep soil layer providing root pressure to ensure transpiration and leaf gas exchange and prevent conditions of limited water transport jiang et al 2015 additionally la gs and tr also promoted the transpiration pulling force of water absorption chen et al 2015 klimešová et al 2015 schneider et al 2017 thus these conditions promoted gas exchange and carboxylation efficiency in the leaf increased photosynthetic productivity and simultaneously increased the wp of organs and resulted in higher wue many studies kang et al 1998 ye et al 2013 have shown that irrigation in different root zones can increase the root physiological activity and distribution in the irrigation zone it also increases aba levels in the non irrigation zone this process can also limit stomatal opening and decrease the occurrence of ineffective water consumption which ultimately increases wue moreover zeng et al 2017 and lawlor 2010 showed that tr was closely related to water absorption and transport furthermore tr has a strong positive relationship with gs which increases the transpiration pulling force satisfying the water needs of different tissues and increasing the wp of organs therefore w80f10 increased the water absorptive ability of the roots and promoted water transport and advantage thereby increasing wue 4 2 relationship among water absorption transport consumption and advantage the water use system is closely related with water absorption transport consumption and advantage however the relationships among these factors under conditions of different water nutrient applications are still unclear in w80f10 the water absorptive ability i e rv 30 rsa 30 and rv 80 supported the crop water use while transport i e fs and consumption i e gs tr and la had lower effects on water use before 69 dae after 69 dae w80f10 promoted water absorption transport consumption and advantage additionally consumption and advantage supported water absorption and transport and water use was significantly greater than water consumption one possible explanation was that the greater root distribution and physiological activity increased the root pressure in the surface and deep soil layers before 69 dae wegner 2013 these conditions then supported water transport to aerial parts and promoted water use in cotton plants after 69 dae the higher available water nutrients from fertigation still supported the root distribution in the surface soil layer and the root physiological activity in the surface and deep soil layers which ensured the greater root pressure required to support water transpiration wegner 2013 petrie et al 2015 in addition adequate water application can increase the transpiration area petrie et al 2015 tr and gs chen et al 2017a which can promote a higher water transport rate and transpiration pulling force wegner 2013 petrie et al 2015 overall this is possible to maintain greater activity in the water use system of cotton plants under w80f10 4 3 water nutrients influence the competitive abilities of organs to absorb water crop wue not only is measured by the water absorption ability advantage and consumption and the relationships among these factors but also demonstrates the coordination and competition of different organs in crop water absorption zhang et al 2003 2006 blum 2009 zheng et al 2011 our research showed that under the w80f10 condition the roots and stems plus leaves were enlarged to complete absorption of water with reproductive organs the organs roots stems plus leaves and reproductive organs competed for water mainly through rv fs gs and tr the competitive ability of the organs for water using rv fs gs and tr decreased in the following order vegetative organ reproductive organ root one possible explanation was that the w80f10 treatment enhanced water absorption transport consumption and use which also increased the photosynthetic ability and efficiency of leaves supporting greater production of dry matter in vegetative organs zhang et al 2006 chen et al 2017a moreover transpiration mainly occurred at vegetative organs i e leaf consuming more than 85 of crop absorptive water badr et al 2012 luo et al 2014 indicating that these organs have a great competitive ability to consume more water zhang et al 2006 wegner 2013 flexas et al 2006 han et al 2015 under the w80f10 condition the root and reproductive organs also had a greater competitive ability for water it is possible that the adequate water nutrient application increased productive ability of vegetative organs promote the development of the root and reproductive organs thereby indirectly supporting the water productivity of roots and reproductive organs lilley and kirkegaard 2011 lynch 2013 in addition reproductive organs as a source organ caused more assimilation and water flow toward reproductive organs maintaining great competitive ability compered to roots thus w80f10 mainly increased 1 the wp of vegetative organs supporting wp of reproductive organs and 2 the competitive ability of reproductive organs for water by raising wue 5 conclusion the combination of presowing irrigation and basal fertilizer surface application increased the rsa in the surface soil layer and rv in the surface and deep soil layers which supported the water absorption and use of the crop before 69 days after emergency after 69 days after emergency a large rsa in the surface soil layer rv in the surface and deep soil layers the leaf transpiration rate stomatal conductance sap flow and water productivity supported water use efficiency therefore we conclude that water use efficiency can be raised by increasing water absorption water transport in the stem and water productivity additionally coordinating the relationships among these variables improved the ability of aerial parts to compete for water which could increase water productivity and maintain the sustainable development of agriculture in arid areas acknowledgments we are grateful to the research grants from the natural science foundation of china grant nos

11314,a field study was conducted during 2015 16 in a semi arid area of the loess plateau china to clarify the interactive effects of cultivation techniques with different n and p fertilization levels on the maize growth yield evapotranspiration and water use efficiency two planting models were tested conventional flat planting m1 and ridge furrow rf rainfall harvesting planting model m2 with four n p fertilizer rates 0 0 kg ha 1 f0 100 50 kg ha 1 f1 200 100 kg ha 1 f2 and 300 150 kg ha 1 f3 the rf system increased the soil water storage sws where the sws exhibited a decreasing trend as the fertilization rate increased under both cultivation models at 120 days after planting dap the mean sws at the depth of 0 200 cm under the m1f0 m1f3 m2f0 and m2f3 treatments was 376 5 mm 345 7 mm 350 6 mm and 325 4 mm the mean wue over 2 years increased significantly p 0 05 with m2f3 m2f2 m1f3 m1f2 m2f1 and m1f1 by 53 37 7 34 7 31 9 21 6 and 19 0 compared with m1f0 and m2f0 treatments maize responded positively to fertilizer and f2 was the economical fertilizer input rate where the leaf area dry matter accumulation and grain yield increased significantly with increasing fertilization rate up to the economically optimal rate f2 beyond the optimal rate these quantities increased slightly as did the yields and economic returns agronomic efficiency steadily decreased with fertilization rate beyond the f1 level the economic benefit was 54 greater under m2f2 treatment which also obtained significantly higher grain yield wue and agronomic efficiency than that of m2f0 treatment thus we recommend the m2f2 planting model for high productivity and efficient maize production in semi arid regions keywords ridge furrow rainfall harvesting soil water storage water use efficiency biomass agronomic efficiency maize 1 introduction maize zea mays l is one of the most essential forage and food cereal crops in semi arid regions barbieri et al 2012 water and nutrient deficiency are the two main issues that limit crop productivity in semi arid regions xia et al 2012 in arid and semi arid regions it is hard to get better plant development due to lack of nutrients and water stress which lead to reductions in crop productivity abbas et al 2005 nagaz et al 2009 however many dry land studies have given more attention to water use efficiency compared to fertilizer use efficiency which limits the land potential for crop production di paolo and rinaldi 2008 barbieri et al 2012 excessive fertilization may lead to imbalances in the soil nutrient levels and eventually cause environmental pollution adamtey et al 2010 barbieri et al 2012 in dry land agriculture a basic problem is balancing the fertilizer application levels when water resources are limited to improving the wue and nutrient use efficiency stone et al 2001 the soil moisture and nutrient levels are important factors that constrain agricultural productivity in rain fed areas kim et al 2008 seghatoleslami et al 2008 however the ridge furrow rf rainfall harvesting system is a modern cultivation technique used in dry land farming systems which enhances the rainwater and nutrient use efficiency wang et al 2011 covering ridges with plastic film and planting in the furrows can reduce surface evaporation and supply enough rainwater at the main growth stages of maize as well as improving the wue li et al 2005 wang et al 2011 qin et al 2014 thus li et al 2001 showed that covering ridges with plastic mulch and planting corn in the furrows increased the moisture contents at depths of 0 200 cm during at the jointing flowering and harvest stages by 14 8 50 5 mm 4 4 13 7 mm and 7 6 24 7 mm respectively compared with conventional flat planting planting maize in furrows and using plastic film as mulch improved crop growth and improved the accessibility for nutrient uptake ren et al 2010 excessive fertilization may lead to the increased depletion of sws reservoirs by crops due to dry soil layers thereby reducing the availability of water kim et al 2008 earlier studies have shown that the efficient use of precipitation and nutrients can significantly improve the nutrient use efficiency sustain the maize productivity and facilitate sustainable dry land farming systems di paolo and rinaldi 2008 in semi arid regions the soil fertility status and financial profits can be achieved by enhancing the rainwater use efficiency with the rf cultivation technique as a result improving the supply of soil water nutrient uptake and maize productivity singh et al 2010 li et al 2004 and tiquia et al 2002 showed that rf system can increase the deep soil water contents and reduce severe water stress at main growth stages to maximize production drought is one of the most important ongoing problems that affects dry land agriculture but the insufficient fertilizers and unnecessary losses of inadequate light rain also lead to reduced maize production during non drought periods in semi arid regions therefore combining the rf cultivation technique with different fertilizer levels in semi arid areas is slowly gaining attention ogola et al 2002 for improving crop yields extremely low or high fertilization levels are not beneficial while biomass accumulation leaf area plant 1 photosynthesis efficiency and yields can increase by the optimized supply of water and nutrients teixeira et al 2014 earlier research work of rf planting technique had mostly focused on the efficiency of ridge catchments the optimum ridge furrow ratios soil temperature wue and photosynthetic characteristics ren et al 2010 however increasing dry lands crop production needs to consider the interaction between the rainwater harvesting and nutrients management strategies however the response of the crop yield to combined rf planting technique with different n p fertilizer levels is unknown therefore we investigated the combined effects of rf system with different n p fertilizer levels on soil water storage grain yield wue nutrient use efficiency and economic returns we expect that this practice could support a complete rainwater harvesting system and provide a reference for fertilizer application to maize planting under the rf system in a semiarid region of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this research work was conducted during 2015 and

ridge height was 15 cm in the rfrh system ridges were covered with plastic film 0 025 mm thickness and furrows were left bare fig 2 the fertilizer comprised urea n 46 with diammonium phosphate p2o5 46 0 n 18 0 both nitrogen and phosphorus were applied at the time of sowing by spreading it evenly over the plot across the whole plot for conventional cultivation technique and into the furrows with the rf system maize xianyou 335 was sown on april 29 2015 and on april 24 2016 with an inter row distance of 30 cm using a hole sowing machine with a seeding depth of 4 5 cm the maize was harvested on september 18 2015 and on september 26 2016 after harvesting the maize crop the plastic film was removed before the subsequent sowing operation irrigation water was not supplied during the two study years and weeds were removed by hand in each maize growing period 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water contents soil sampling was performed before sowing the maize at the seedling jointing and heading stages as well as after the filling period and harvest the soil auger was driven by hand to a depth of 200 cm with samples taken at each 10 cm in the range 0 20 cm and at 20 cm intervals from 20 to 200 cm for the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting planting model the soil sampled was taken from the middle of a furrow side of the furrow and the middle ridge where the soil water content was calculated as the mean value of the three different positions for the traditional flat planting model the soil was sampled from between the rows the soil cores were wet weighed dried in the oven at 100 c for 50 h and weighed once more to obtain the moisture content ferraro and ghersa 2007 the evapotranspiration et was calculatedon a seasonal basis by using the soil water balance equation as follows 1 et p i u d r δw where p mm is the total precipitation i mm is the irrigation u is the upward flow into the root zone d is the downward drainage out of the root zone r is the surface runoff from each plot and δw mm is the variation of moisture content within the soil profile from 0 to 200 cm between sowing and harvesting in this experiment there was no irrigation so i in eq 1 was zero for all plots the groundwater table remained at a depth of about 50 m below the surface so the upward flow into the root zone was negligible runoff was never observed as the experimental field was flat there was no heavy rain or water logging events during the growing season so the drainage was assumed to be insignificant at 200 cm depth the wue was calculated as 2 wue y et where wue is the water use efficiency y is the maize yield kg ha 1 and et is the crop water consumption mm during the entire growing season the rainfall use efficiency was determined as 3 rue y p where rue is the rainfall use efficiency kg mm 1 ha 1 y is the corn yield kg ha 1 and p is the amount of rainfall during the entire growing season mm sws were calculated using the below equation 4 d 10 θ g ρ b h ρ w where θg is the gravimetric water content ρb is the soil bulk density h consider a length of soil column ρw is the water density the aenp refers to the increase in the grain yield per unit of fertilizer application 5 agronomic efficiency of fertilizer ae np gyf gy0 f where gyf is the grain yield in the fertilized plot kg ha 1 gy0 is the grain yield of the check plot kg ha 1 and f is the

after planting dap and further intervals of 20 30 days during the entire growing period then total dry matter per plant was determined after oven drying at 105 c for 1 h and then at 70 c for a minimum of 48 h until constant weight 2 3 3 grain yield and aboveground biomass accumulation two rows of corn were hand harvested 3 m2 from the center of each treatment with four replications at harvesting time where the grain and biomass yields were calculated counting the mutual area of the ridges and furrows 2 3 4 statistical analysis data from each sampling event were analyzed separately by using one way anova as implemented in the spss 13 0 software means were compared with the lsd test multiple comparisons were conducted with duncan s new multiple range test in all cases differences were treated as significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil water storage sws normal variations in the annual precipitation soil evaporation and maize water consumption produced distinct differences in the sws 0 200 cm with the various rfrh planting models and different n p fertilizer application rates during the maize growth stages figs 3 and 4 however there were no significant differences in the sws at 0 60 cm soil depth under both planting models at different n p fertilizer rates at the sowing time 0 dap in the present study we found that the sws changed with the amount of precipitation its temporal distribution and the number of days after planting in both study years the crop rainwater consumption rate increased with plant growth and development but moderate water stress occurred under the m2 planting model which ensured the successful vegetative growth of maize crop the sws for 0 200 cm soil depth under m2f0 was greater at all growth stages than that of any other treatment in 2015 at 120 dap the lowest sws at 0 60 cm and 60 120 cm soil depths under all treatments whereas in 2016 at 90 dap the lowest sws occurred at 0 60 cm depth under both planting models significant rainfall of 146 9 mm during september 2015 caused an increase in sws for both planting models and all fertilizer rates in the depth range 0 120 cm fig 3 indicates that the m1 planting model had a distinct decrease in sws for 120 200 cm between dap 120 and 150 the response of sws under the m2 model varied depending on the fertilization rate in 2015 from 90 to 120 dap the differences in the sws were not significant among the different treatments during 2016 from 90 to 150 dap the differences in the sws were not significant among the different treatments at 0 60 cm soil layer from 0 to 60 dap during the 2015 growing season there were no considerable variations in the sws between the different treatments at 60 120 cm soil layer depth sws in the 120 200 cm depth range decreased steadily during the growing seasons 0 150 dap for both years the sws data showed that as the n p fertilizer levels increased under both planting models the sws decreased for all depths over the range 0 200 cm during all growth stages of maize 3 2 leaf area and total dry matter plant 1 both the leaf area and total dry matter were affected significantly figs 5 and 6 by the rfrh planting model with different n p fertilizer levels during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons planting model m2 with the f3 fertilizer level produced a significantly higher leaf area cm 2 plant 1 than those with planting model m1 during both maize growing seasons the leaf area was considerably influenced by the n p levels and rf system the leaf area plant 1 increased slowly during the early growth stage 30 60 dap growing rapidly in the middle growth stage 60 90 dap and decreasing gradually in the late growth stage 120 140 dap under both planting models with different n p fertilizer levels moreover the data indicated that the n p fertilizer level had a positive effect on the leaf area per plant under both planting models the aboveground biomass g plant 1 was significantly affected fig 6 by the different planting models and n p fertilizer levels during 2015 and 2016 rfrh planting m2 with the f3 fertilizer level produced a significantly greater dry matter g plant 1 during the different maize growth stages except 30 60 dap compared with the flat planting model m1 during the early maize growth stages 30 60 dap there were no significant differences under both planting models and n p fertilizer levels however the maize grew faster in the middle growth stage 90 120 dap and gradually in the late growth stage 120 140 dap with the m2f3 treatment thus the m2f3 treatment produced a significantly higher leaf area per plant at 90 dap and aboveground dry matters per plant at 140 dap respectively compared with the other treatments 3 3 biomass yield grain yield and et the maize biomass yield grain yield and et were affected significantly by the different planting models and n p fertilizer levels over the two years table 2 the rfrh planting model with different n p fertilizer levels significantly p 0 05 increased the maize biomass and grain yield than that of m1 planting model a mean aboveground biomass yield in the two years with each of the treatments was graded as follows m2f3 m2f2 m1f3 m1f2 m2f1 m1f1 m2f0 m1f0 treatments the mean maize aboveground biomass yield improved significantly with the m1f3 m1f2 and m1f1 treatments i e by 4 45 t ha 1 25 8 3 94 t ha 1 22 9 and 2 02 t ha 1 11 7 compared with m1f0 treatment while those with m2f3 m2f2 and m2f1 treatments increased significantly by 3 87 t ha 1 19 9 2 91 t ha 1 15 0 and 1 02 t ha 1 5 2 compared with m2f0 treatment respectively there were no significant variations in the aboveground biomass yields in 2015 and 2016 between m1f3 and m1f2 treatments m2f3 and m2f2 treatments m2f3 treatment obtained a slightly higher aboveground biomass accumulation compared with m2f2 during both study years but the difference was not significant in 2015 16 the mean maize grain yield for the m1f3 m1f2 and m1f1 treatments exceeded that of the m1f0 treatment by 3 54 t ha 1 46 5 2 76 t ha 1 36 3 and 1 88 t ha 1 24 8 respectively considering the rfrh model mean grain yields for the two years significantly exceeded that of the m2f0 treatment for m2f3 m2f2 and m2f1 by 4 69 t ha 1 54 3 4 16 t ha 1 48 1 and 2 48 t ha 1 28 7 respectively p 0 05 a slightly higher grain yield was obtained in the m2f3 treatment compared with m2f2 during both maize growing seasons but the difference was not significant the seasonal maize et was directly and positively related to the seasonal rainfall distribution and fertilizer application where there were obvious variations in et rate between the different treatments table 2 under the rfrh planting model with different n p fertilizer levels led to lower et rates compared with the flat planting model due to excessive evaporation et rates improved significantly with the m1f3 m1f2 and m1f1 treatments i e by 40 00 mm 10 7 36 35 mm 9 7 and 19 50 mm 5 2 compared to the m1f0 treatment respectively the seasonal et rate also increased significantly with m2f3 m2f2 and m2f1 treatments by 43 45 mm 12 2 35 35 mm 10 0 and 21 30 mm 6 0 compared with m2f0 treatment respectively 3 4 wue rue and aenp the data showed that the rfrh model with different n p fertilizer levels significantly affected the wue rue and aenp of maize crops grown during 2015 and 2016 table 2 the results obtained over the two years showed that m1f3 m1f2 and m1f1 significantly increased the mean wue by 32 35 and 19 than that of m1f0 treatment and that m2f3 m2f2 and m2f1 treatments significantly increased the wue by 38 35 and 22 than that of m2f0 treatment the results obtained over the two years also indicated that m1f3 m1f2 and m1f1 treatments significantly increased the rue by 46 36 and 25 than that of m1f0 treatment and under the m2f3 m2f2 and m2f1 treatments significantly increased the rue by 54 48 and 29 than that of m2f0 treatment the mean results also confirmed that the consumption of more n p fertilizer probably increased the wue and rue levels but the differences between the m2f3 and m2f2 treatments were not significant the aenp results indicated that increasing the n p fertilizer level caused steadily decreasing the aenp table 2 making a comparison of aenp for the two planting models should be done for identical fertilization levels where the maximum 16 50 kg kg 1 aenp was obtained with m2f1 treatment and the minimum 7 86 kg kg 1 with m1f3 treatment the availability of rainwater significantly p 0 05 enhanced aenp and the highest aenp value were achieved with the m2 planting model rather than the m1 flat planting model table 2 thus a small amount of fertilizer was most efficient in the use of n p fertilizer levels under both planting models 3 5 economic benefits economic benefit is one of the most useful evaluation indexes for crop management practices there were obvious differences in the total costs of the various treatments due to the use of plastic film the application of fertilizer and labor table 3 the most important output value from the plots was the maize grain yield and biomass in our study these variables had significantly higher values under the m2f3 and m2f2 treatments as compared to all other treatments the input value is another key determinant factor of net profits results of the current study indicate that application of fertilizer labor and plastic film are important components of the costs of production accounting for up to 50 of the total variable costs the net incomes with the m2f3 m2f2 m1f3 m2f1 m1f2 m1f1 m2f0 and m1f0 treatments were 16109 15905 13986 13721 13423 12550 10 322 and 10 025 yuan ha 1 respectively among the different treatments m2f3 treatment had the highest rate of income return 56 as compared with m1f0 treatment 4 discussion 4 1 soil moisture the semi arid region of southern ningxia in china is highly affected by seasonal variations in precipitation and its distribution during different maize growth stages the annual average precipitation over 40 years is about 354 mm but potential evapotranspiration exceeds 1000 mm and thus overcoming this discrepancy to provide water for agricultural production is a very important issue according to grassini et al 2009 in this study of a dry land farming system the rfrh planting model enhanced plant growth grain yield and wue significantly compared to a flat planting model for all n p fertilization treatments thus we confirmed that rfrh planting with various n p fertilizer levels had positive effects on the sws wue rue economic benefits and maize yield previous studies have suggested that the rfrh planting model suppresses the evaporation of rainwater to retain the soil moisture which can be used to improve the crop water usage in a quantitative manner thereby increasing the maize yield sws and rue li et al 2001 liu et al 2009 found that the soil moisture contents of the topsoil in plastic film mulched plots were higher than those of flat planting plots having an increased soil moisture content of 11 3 21 5 the crop rainwater consumption rate increased with plant growth and development but the moderate water stress with the m2 planting model ensured the successful vegetative growth of maize crop the sws for the entire depth range of 0 200 cm was greater for m2f0 at all growth stages compared with all other treatments for all treatments the sws decreased during the period 0 150 dap in the 120 200 cm depth range as the n p fertilizer level increased in both planting models the sws decreased at all depths of 0 200 cm during the entire growing period and thus the higher soil water consumption rate improved crop growth development and seasonal et 4 2 plant growth and et deng et al 2006 showed that rfrh planting of maize obtained a higher water storage capacity than flat planting i e an improvement of 35 3 42 3 mm where the yield increased by up to 80 and the wue by 6 1 10 6 kg mm 1 ha 1 lenka et al 2009 showed that maize yield is positively correlated with the evapotranspiration rate ogola et al 2002 also reported a significant increase in et due to the low nitrogen supply level and high availability of soil water the higher daily transpiration rates during the flowering stage may be attributable to the greater soil water extraction capacity of the roots under the rfrh planting model and the maximum transpiration capacity of the crop canopy under flat planting reddy et al 1980 the rfrh planting models with different n p fertilizer levels obtained higher maize biomass and grain yields compared with the m1 flat planting model the seasonal et of maize was directly and positively correlated with the seasonal rainfall amount and fertilizer application rate there were obvious variations in evapotranspiration rate between the different treatments table 2 excessive evaporation that occurred for the flat planting model generated greater et amounts compared to those obtained for the rfrh model for all fertilization rates qin et al 2014 showed that plastic film mulch treatments maintained greater soil moisture throughout the growing season than a control treatment with no mulch thereby improving the potato yield and et plastic film mulching reduced evaporation from the topsoil layer and also reduced the total water consumption thereby positively affected the maize yield and wue chen et al 2012 soil temperature and moisture contents were greater under plastic film cultivation than those observed for a control plot without plastic film zhang et al 2005 wang et al 2009 the rf system significantly increased the dry matter and leaf area plant 1 li et al 2001 duan et al 2006 li et al 2001 also showed that supplying n at the rate of 150 kg ha 1 increased the wheat leaf area and biomass accumulation during the dry and rainy seasons with respect to the control plot in the present study we found that planting model m2 with the f3 fertilizer level significantly increased the leaf area and dry matter per plant compared with planting model m1 the leaf area per plant rose gradually during the early growth stage up to 60 dap increased rapidly in the middle growth stage 60 90 dap and then decreased gradually in the late growth stage 120 140 dap for both planting models and different n p fertilizer levels moreover our results indicated that the n p fertilizer levels had positive effects on the biomass accumulation and leaf area with both planting models rfrh planting m2 with the f3 fertilizer level significantly increased biomass g plant 1 at different maize growth stages except for 30 60 dap compared with the flat m1 planting model the m1f3 treatment produced the largest leaf area and aboveground dry matter values per plant at 90 and 140 dap respectively compared with the other treatments 4 3 grain yield and resource use efficiency the wue characterized the association between the grain yield and total et fertilization significantly increased the maize grain yield but there was no corresponding increase in et which suggests that fertilization is effective for increasing the crop water consumption rate thereby improving wue and rue jones et al 1986 showed that the application of plastic film improved the wue and rue and obtained a high yield soil moisture mainly improves the soil nutrient availability which promotes crop nutrient absorption and utilization under the rf planting model with simulated precipitation of 440 340 and 230 mm the wue increased by 69 7 39 9 and 10 3 over that of conventional flat cultivation ren et al 2008 the growth of maize in furrows under ridges covered with biodegradable film or plastic film obviously reduced the et rate and enhanced the wue according to jia et al 2006 the use of fertilizer in dry land farming systems can improve the crop growth conditions and increase the productivity and wue di paolo and rinaldi 2008 but the aenp is affected by the soil fertility status where low soil fertility tends to obtain a high aenp whereas a high soil fertility status leads to a lower aenp we characterized the wue as the association between the grain yield and total et fertilization can effectively increase the crop water utilization rate therefore increasing the agricultural wue and rue the mean results also confirmed that the consumption of more n p fertilizer probably increased the wue and rue values but the differences were not significant between the m2f3 and m2f2 treatments table 2 shows that as the n p fertilizer increased the aenp tended to decrease the effect of different n p fertilizer level was the complete opposite under the two planting models the maximum 16 50 kg kg 1 aenp was obtained with m2f1 treatment and the minimum 7 86 kg kg 1 with m1f3 treatment the availability of rainwater enhanced the aenp and the highest aenp value was achieved with the m2 planting model rather than the m1 flat planting model table 2 which indicates that it is efficient to use a small amount of n p fertilizer in both planting models 4 4 economic evaluation the financial profit is one of the keys useful indicators for evaluating crop management practices in dry land farming systems our economic analysis also suggested that there were greater benefits under the rfrh planting model m2 with an n p level of 200 100 kg ha 1 therefore our results suggest that m2f2 may be a suitable modern planting model for maize productivity in rain fed regions due to the enhancements of the wue rue aenp and soil water storage thereby obtaining higher grain yields and more benefits this may be a useful planting model for reducing the risk of maize production 5 conclusions we examined the effects of the interactions between planting models and fertilizer application rates on the yield growth and development of maize as well as the sws wue rue and et levels we showed that rfrh planting model with an n p fertilizer level of 200 100 kg ha 1 could enhance the sws soil moisture availability during critical growth stages as well as significantly increasing the maize yield and wue increasing the n p fertilizer level significantly enhanced the yield under both planting models but the relative increase in yield was not significant when n p fertilizer level was above 200 100 kg n p ha 1 thus as the amount of fertilizer increased the aenp decreased but the yield and economic benefit tended to increase the economic analysis also suggested that greater 54 benefits could be obtained by using the rfrh planting model with an n p fertilizer level of 200 100 kg ha 1 therefore our results suggest that the m2f2 treatment is appropriate for maize production in rain fed areas because it improves the wue rue and sws levels thereby enhancing the grain yield and economic benefits to reduce the risk of maize production in dry land farming systems acknowledgments this work was supported by henan university of science and technology haust discipline improvement

11314,a field study was conducted during 2015 16 in a semi arid area of the loess plateau china to clarify the interactive effects of cultivation techniques with different n and p fertilization levels on the maize growth yield evapotranspiration and water use efficiency two planting models were tested conventional flat planting m1 and ridge furrow rf rainfall harvesting planting model m2 with four n p fertilizer rates 0 0 kg ha 1 f0 100 50 kg ha 1 f1 200 100 kg ha 1 f2 and 300 150 kg ha 1 f3 the rf system increased the soil water storage sws where the sws exhibited a decreasing trend as the fertilization rate increased under both cultivation models at 120 days after planting dap the mean sws at the depth of 0 200 cm under the m1f0 m1f3 m2f0 and m2f3 treatments was 376 5 mm 345 7 mm 350 6 mm and 325 4 mm the mean wue over 2 years increased significantly p 0 05 with m2f3 m2f2 m1f3 m1f2 m2f1 and m1f1 by 53 37 7 34 7 31 9 21 6 and 19 0 compared with m1f0 and m2f0 treatments maize responded positively to fertilizer and f2 was the economical fertilizer input rate where the leaf area dry matter accumulation and grain yield increased significantly with increasing fertilization rate up to the economically optimal rate f2 beyond the optimal rate these quantities increased slightly as did the yields and economic returns agronomic efficiency steadily decreased with fertilization rate beyond the f1 level the economic benefit was 54 greater under m2f2 treatment which also obtained significantly higher grain yield wue and agronomic efficiency than that of m2f0 treatment thus we recommend the m2f2 planting model for high productivity and efficient maize production in semi arid regions keywords ridge furrow rainfall harvesting soil water storage water use efficiency biomass agronomic efficiency maize 1 introduction maize zea mays l is one of the most essential forage and food cereal crops in semi arid regions barbieri et al 2012 water and nutrient deficiency are the two main issues that limit crop productivity in semi arid regions xia et al 2012 in arid and semi arid regions it is hard to get better plant development due to lack of nutrients and water stress which lead to reductions in crop productivity abbas et al 2005 nagaz et al 2009 however many dry land studies have given more attention to water use efficiency compared to fertilizer use efficiency which limits the land potential for crop production di paolo and rinaldi 2008 barbieri et al 2012 excessive fertilization may lead to imbalances in the soil nutrient levels and eventually cause environmental pollution adamtey et al 2010 barbieri et al 2012 in dry land agriculture a basic problem is balancing the fertilizer application levels when water resources are limited to improving the wue and nutrient use efficiency stone et al 2001 the soil moisture and nutrient levels are important factors that constrain agricultural productivity in rain fed areas kim et al 2008 seghatoleslami et al 2008 however the ridge furrow rf rainfall harvesting system is a modern cultivation technique used in dry land farming systems which enhances the rainwater and nutrient use efficiency wang et al 2011 covering ridges with plastic film and planting in the furrows can reduce surface evaporation and supply enough rainwater at the main growth stages of maize as well as improving the wue li et al 2005 wang et al 2011 qin et al 2014 thus li et al 2001 showed that covering ridges with plastic mulch and planting corn in the furrows increased the moisture contents at depths of 0 200 cm during at the jointing flowering and harvest stages by 14 8 50 5 mm 4 4 13 7 mm and 7 6 24 7 mm respectively compared with conventional flat planting planting maize in furrows and using plastic film as mulch improved crop growth and improved the accessibility for nutrient uptake ren et al 2010 excessive fertilization may lead to the increased depletion of sws reservoirs by crops due to dry soil layers thereby reducing the availability of water kim et al 2008 earlier studies have shown that the efficient use of precipitation and nutrients can significantly improve the nutrient use efficiency sustain the maize productivity and facilitate sustainable dry land farming systems di paolo and rinaldi 2008 in semi arid regions the soil fertility status and financial profits can be achieved by enhancing the rainwater use efficiency with the rf cultivation technique as a result improving the supply of soil water nutrient uptake and maize productivity singh et al 2010 li et al 2004 and tiquia et al 2002 showed that rf system can increase the deep soil water contents and reduce severe water stress at main growth stages to maximize production drought is one of the most important ongoing problems that affects dry land agriculture but the insufficient fertilizers and unnecessary losses of inadequate light rain also lead to reduced maize production during non drought periods in semi arid regions therefore combining the rf cultivation technique with different fertilizer levels in semi arid areas is slowly gaining attention ogola et al 2002 for improving crop yields extremely low or high fertilization levels are not beneficial while biomass accumulation leaf area plant 1 photosynthesis efficiency and yields can increase by the optimized supply of water and nutrients teixeira et al 2014 earlier research work of rf planting technique had mostly focused on the efficiency of ridge catchments the optimum ridge furrow ratios soil temperature wue and photosynthetic characteristics ren et al 2010 however increasing dry lands crop production needs to consider the interaction between the rainwater harvesting and nutrients management strategies however the response of the crop yield to combined rf planting technique with different n p fertilizer levels is unknown therefore we investigated the combined effects of rf system with different n p fertilizer levels on soil water storage grain yield wue nutrient use efficiency and economic returns we expect that this practice could support a complete rainwater harvesting system and provide a reference for fertilizer application to maize planting under the rf system in a semiarid region of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this research work was conducted during 2015 and 2016 in zhongwei city ningxia province with latitude of 36 78 n longitude of 106 02 e and an elevation of 1365 m above sea level the climatic conditions at the research station were warming temperate with an annual mean evaporation rate of 1753 mm yr 1 the average mean annual temperature 6 9 c total duration of sunshine hours 2236 h yr 1 the frost free period was 141 days and the average annual mean rainfall 585 mm yr 1 where over 60 of the rainfall occurred during july september the amounts of rainfall during may september were 289 mm in 2015 and 323 mm in 2016 the monthly rainfall distributions during the two experimental maize growing seasons and the 40 year monthly averages 1973 2013 are shown in fig 1 chemical properties of the trial site are presented in table 1 2 2 field management and experimental design the field research was carried out with a completely randomized block design using three replicates the length and width of each plot were 5 0 m 3 6 m and they were cultivated by conventional tillage the field experiment included eight treatments i flat planting with n p at 0 0 kg ha 1 m1f0 ii flat planting with n p at 100 50 kg ha 1 m1f1 iii flat planting with n

ridge height was 15 cm in the rfrh system ridges were covered with plastic film 0 025 mm thickness and furrows were left bare fig 2 the fertilizer comprised urea n 46 with diammonium phosphate p2o5 46 0 n 18 0 both nitrogen and phosphorus were applied at the time of sowing by spreading it evenly over the plot across the whole plot for conventional cultivation technique and into the furrows with the rf system maize xianyou 335 was sown on april 29 2015 and on april 24 2016 with an inter row distance of 30 cm using a hole sowing machine with a seeding depth of 4 5 cm the maize was harvested on september 18 2015 and on september 26 2016 after harvesting the maize crop the plastic film was removed before the subsequent sowing operation irrigation water was not supplied during the two study years and weeds were removed by hand in each maize growing period 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water contents soil sampling was performed before sowing the maize at the seedling jointing and heading stages as well as after the filling period and harvest the soil auger was driven by hand to a depth of 200 cm with samples taken at each 10 cm in the range 0 20 cm and at 20 cm intervals from 20 to 200 cm for the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting planting model the soil sampled was taken from the middle of a furrow side of the furrow and the middle ridge where the soil water content was calculated as the mean value of the three different positions for the traditional flat planting model the soil was sampled from between the rows the soil cores were wet weighed dried in the oven at 100 c for 50 h and weighed once more to obtain the moisture content ferraro and ghersa 2007 the evapotranspiration et was calculatedon a seasonal basis by using the soil water balance equation as follows 1 et p i u d r δw where p mm is the total precipitation i mm is the irrigation u is the upward flow into the root zone d is the downward drainage out of the root zone r is the surface runoff from each plot and δw mm is the variation of moisture content within the soil profile from 0 to 200 cm between sowing and harvesting in this experiment there was no irrigation so i in eq 1 was zero for all plots the groundwater table remained at a depth of about 50 m below the surface so the upward flow into the root zone was negligible runoff was never observed as the experimental field was flat there was no heavy rain or water logging events during the growing season so the drainage was assumed to be insignificant at 200 cm depth the wue was calculated as 2 wue y et where wue is the water use efficiency y is the maize yield kg ha 1 and et is the crop water consumption mm during the entire growing season the rainfall use efficiency was determined as 3 rue y p where rue is the rainfall use efficiency kg mm 1 ha 1 y is the corn yield kg ha 1 and p is the amount of rainfall during the entire growing season mm sws were calculated using the below equation 4 d 10 θ g ρ b h ρ w where θg is the gravimetric water content ρb is the soil bulk density h consider a length of soil column ρw is the water density the aenp refers to the increase in the grain yield per unit of fertilizer application 5 agronomic efficiency of fertilizer ae np gyf gy0 f where gyf is the grain yield in the fertilized plot kg ha 1 gy0 is the grain yield of the check plot kg ha 1 and f is the

of 48 h until constant weight 2 3 3 grain yield and aboveground biomass accumulation two rows of corn were hand harvested 3 m2 from the center of each treatment with four replications at harvesting time where the grain and biomass yields were calculated counting the mutual area of the ridges and furrows 2 3 4 statistical analysis data from each sampling event were analyzed separately by using one way anova as implemented in the spss 13 0 software means were compared with the lsd test multiple comparisons were conducted with duncan s new multiple range test in all cases differences were treated as significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil water storage sws normal variations in the annual precipitation soil evaporation and maize water consumption produced distinct differences in the sws 0 200 cm with the various rfrh planting models and different n p fertilizer application rates during the maize growth stages figs 3 and 4 however there were no significant differences in the sws at 0 60 cm soil depth under both planting models at different n p fertilizer rates at the sowing time 0 dap in the present study we found that the sws changed with the amount of precipitation its temporal distribution and the number of days after planting in both study years the crop rainwater consumption rate increased with plant growth and development but moderate water stress occurred under the m2 planting model which ensured the successful vegetative growth of maize crop the sws for 0 200 cm soil depth under m2f0 was greater at all growth stages than that of any other treatment in 2015 at 120 dap the lowest sws at 0 60 cm and 60 120 cm soil depths under all treatments whereas in 2016 at 90 dap the lowest sws occurred at 0 60 cm depth under both planting models significant rainfall of 146 9 mm during september 2015 caused an increase in sws for both planting models and all fertilizer rates in the depth range 0 120 cm fig 3 indicates that the m1 planting model had a distinct decrease in sws for 120 200 cm between dap 120 and 150 the response of sws under the m2 model varied depending on the fertilization rate in 2015 from 90 to 120 dap the differences in the sws were not significant among the different treatments during 2016 from 90 to 150 dap the differences in the sws were not significant among the different treatments at 0 60 cm soil layer from 0 to 60 dap during the 2015 growing season there were no considerable variations in the sws between the different treatments at 60 120 cm soil layer depth sws in the 120 200 cm depth range decreased steadily during the growing seasons 0 150 dap for both years the sws data showed that as the n p fertilizer levels increased under both planting models the sws decreased for all depths over the range 0 200 cm during all growth stages of maize 3 2 leaf area and total dry matter plant 1 both the leaf area and total dry matter were affected significantly figs 5 and 6 by the rfrh planting model with different n p fertilizer levels during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons planting model m2 with the f3 fertilizer level produced a significantly higher leaf area cm 2 plant 1 than those with planting model m1 during both maize growing seasons the leaf area was considerably influenced by the n p levels and rf system the leaf area plant 1 increased slowly during the early growth stage 30 60 dap growing rapidly in the middle growth stage 60 90 dap and decreasing gradually in the late growth stage 120 140 dap under both planting models with different n p fertilizer levels moreover the data indicated that the n p fertilizer level had a positive effect on the leaf area per plant under both planting models the aboveground biomass g plant 1 was significantly affected fig 6 by the different planting models and n p fertilizer levels during 2015 and 2016 rfrh planting m2 with the f3 fertilizer level produced a significantly greater dry matter g plant 1 during the different maize growth stages except 30 60 dap compared with the flat planting model m1 during the early maize growth stages 30 60 dap there were no significant differences under both planting models and n p fertilizer levels however the maize grew faster in the middle growth stage 90 120 dap and gradually in the late growth stage 120 140 dap with the m2f3 treatment thus the m2f3 treatment produced a significantly higher leaf area per plant at 90 dap and aboveground dry matters per plant at 140 dap respectively compared with the other treatments 3 3 biomass yield grain yield and et the maize biomass yield grain yield and et were affected significantly by the different planting models and n p fertilizer levels over the two years table 2 the rfrh planting model with different n p fertilizer levels significantly p 0 05 increased the maize biomass and grain yield than that of m1 planting model a mean aboveground biomass yield in the two years with each of the treatments was graded as follows m2f3 m2f2 m1f3 m1f2 m2f1 m1f1 m2f0 m1f0 treatments the mean maize aboveground biomass yield improved significantly with the m1f3 m1f2 and m1f1 treatments i e by 4 45 t ha 1 25 8 3 94 t ha 1 22 9 and 2 02 t ha 1 11 7 compared with m1f0 treatment while those with m2f3 m2f2 and m2f1 treatments increased significantly by 3 87 t ha 1 19 9 2 91 t ha 1 15 0 and 1 02 t ha 1 5 2 compared with m2f0 treatment respectively there were no significant variations in the aboveground biomass yields in 2015 and 2016 between m1f3 and m1f2 treatments m2f3 and m2f2 treatments m2f3 treatment obtained a slightly higher aboveground biomass accumulation compared with m2f2 during both study years but the difference was not significant in 2015 16 the mean maize grain yield for the m1f3 m1f2 and m1f1 treatments exceeded that of the m1f0 treatment by 3 54 t ha 1 46 5 2 76 t ha 1 36 3 and 1 88 t ha 1 24 8 respectively considering the rfrh model mean grain yields for the two years significantly exceeded that of the m2f0 treatment for m2f3 m2f2 and m2f1 by 4 69 t ha 1 54 3 4 16 t ha 1 48 1 and 2 48 t ha 1 28 7 respectively p 0 05 a slightly higher grain yield was obtained in the m2f3 treatment compared with m2f2 during both maize growing seasons but the difference was not significant the seasonal maize et was directly and positively related to the seasonal rainfall distribution and fertilizer application where there were obvious variations in et rate between the different treatments table 2 under the rfrh planting model with different n p fertilizer levels led to lower et rates compared with the flat planting model due to excessive evaporation et rates improved significantly with the m1f3 m1f2 and m1f1 treatments i e by 40 00 mm 10 7 36 35 mm 9 7 and 19 50 mm 5 2 compared to the m1f0 treatment respectively the seasonal et rate also increased significantly with m2f3 m2f2 and m2f1 treatments by 43 45 mm 12 2 35 35 mm 10 0 and 21 30 mm 6 0 compared with m2f0 treatment respectively 3 4 wue rue and aenp the data showed that the rfrh model with different n p fertilizer levels significantly affected the wue rue and aenp of maize crops grown during 2015 and 2016 table 2 the results obtained over the two years showed that m1f3 m1f2 and m1f1 significantly increased the mean wue by 32 35 and 19 than that of m1f0 treatment and that m2f3 m2f2 and m2f1 treatments significantly increased the wue by 38 35 and 22 than that of m2f0 treatment the results obtained over the two years also indicated that m1f3 m1f2 and m1f1 treatments significantly increased the rue by 46 36 and 25 than that of m1f0 treatment and under the m2f3 m2f2 and m2f1 treatments significantly increased the rue by 54 48 and 29 than that of m2f0 treatment the mean results also confirmed that the consumption of more n p fertilizer probably increased the wue and rue levels but the differences between the m2f3 and m2f2 treatments were not significant the aenp results indicated that increasing the n p fertilizer level caused steadily decreasing the aenp table 2 making a comparison of aenp for the two planting models should be done for identical fertilization levels where the maximum 16 50 kg kg 1 aenp was obtained with m2f1 treatment and the minimum 7 86 kg kg 1 with m1f3 treatment the availability of rainwater significantly p 0 05 enhanced aenp and the highest aenp value were achieved with the m2 planting model rather than the m1 flat planting model table 2 thus a small amount of fertilizer was most efficient in the use of n p fertilizer levels under both planting models 3 5 economic benefits economic benefit is one of the most useful evaluation indexes for crop management practices there were obvious differences in the total costs of the various treatments due to the use of plastic film the application of fertilizer and labor table 3 the most important output value from the plots was the maize grain yield and biomass in our study these variables had significantly higher values under the m2f3 and m2f2 treatments as compared to all other treatments the input value is another key determinant factor of net profits results of the current study indicate that application of fertilizer labor and plastic film are important components of the costs of production accounting for up to 50 of the total variable costs the net incomes with the m2f3 m2f2 m1f3 m2f1 m1f2 m1f1 m2f0 and m1f0 treatments were 16109 15905 13986 13721 13423 12550 10 322 and 10 025 yuan ha 1 respectively among the different treatments m2f3 treatment had the highest rate of income return 56 as compared with m1f0 treatment 4 discussion 4 1 soil moisture the semi arid region of southern ningxia in china is highly affected by seasonal variations in precipitation and its distribution during different maize growth stages the annual average precipitation over 40 years is about 354 mm but potential evapotranspiration exceeds 1000 mm and thus overcoming this discrepancy to provide water for agricultural production is a very important issue according to grassini et al 2009 in this study of a dry land farming system the rfrh planting model enhanced plant growth grain yield and wue significantly compared to a flat planting model for all n p fertilization treatments thus we confirmed that rfrh planting with various n p fertilizer levels had positive effects on the sws wue rue economic benefits and maize yield previous studies have suggested that the rfrh planting model suppresses the evaporation of rainwater to retain the soil moisture which can be used to improve the crop water usage in a quantitative manner thereby increasing the maize yield sws and rue li et al 2001 liu et al 2009 found that the soil moisture contents of the topsoil in plastic film mulched plots were higher than those of flat planting plots having an increased soil moisture content of 11 3 21 5 the crop rainwater consumption rate increased with plant growth and development but the moderate water stress with the m2 planting model ensured the successful vegetative growth of maize crop the sws for the entire depth range of 0 200 cm was greater for m2f0 at all growth stages compared with all other treatments for all treatments the sws decreased during the period 0 150 dap in the 120 200 cm depth range as the n p fertilizer level increased in both planting models the sws decreased at all depths of 0 200 cm during the entire growing period and thus the higher soil water consumption rate improved crop growth development and seasonal et 4 2 plant growth and et deng et al 2006 showed that rfrh planting of maize obtained a higher water storage capacity than flat planting i e an improvement of 35 3 42 3 mm where the yield increased by up to 80 and the wue by 6 1 10 6 kg mm 1 ha 1 lenka et al 2009 showed that maize yield is positively correlated with the evapotranspiration rate ogola et al 2002 also reported a significant increase in et due to the low nitrogen supply level and high availability of soil water the higher daily transpiration rates during the flowering stage may be attributable to the greater soil water extraction capacity of the roots under the rfrh planting model and the maximum transpiration capacity of the crop canopy under flat planting reddy et al 1980 the rfrh planting models with different n p fertilizer levels obtained higher maize biomass and grain yields compared with the m1 flat planting model the seasonal et of maize was directly and positively correlated with the seasonal rainfall amount and fertilizer application rate there were obvious variations in evapotranspiration rate between the different treatments table 2 excessive evaporation that occurred for the flat planting model generated greater et amounts compared to those obtained for the rfrh model for all fertilization rates qin et al 2014 showed that plastic film mulch treatments maintained greater soil moisture throughout the growing season than a control treatment with no mulch thereby improving the potato yield and et plastic film mulching reduced evaporation from the topsoil layer and also reduced the total water consumption thereby positively affected the maize yield and wue chen et al 2012 soil temperature and moisture contents were greater under plastic film cultivation than those observed for a control plot without plastic film zhang et al 2005 wang et al 2009 the rf system significantly increased the dry matter and leaf area plant 1 li et al 2001 duan et al 2006 li et al 2001 also showed that supplying n at the rate of 150 kg ha 1 increased the wheat leaf area and biomass accumulation during the dry and rainy seasons with respect to the control plot in the present study we found that planting model m2 with the f3 fertilizer level significantly increased the leaf area and dry matter per plant compared with planting model m1 the leaf area per plant rose gradually during the early growth stage up to 60 dap increased rapidly in the middle growth stage 60 90 dap and then decreased gradually in the late growth stage 120 140 dap for both planting models and different n p fertilizer levels moreover our results indicated that the n p fertilizer levels had positive effects on the biomass accumulation and leaf area with both planting models rfrh planting m2 with the f3 fertilizer level significantly increased biomass g plant 1 at different maize growth stages except for 30 60 dap compared with the flat m1 planting model the m1f3 treatment produced the largest leaf area and aboveground dry matter values per plant at 90 and 140 dap respectively compared with the other treatments 4 3 grain yield and resource use efficiency the wue characterized the association between the grain yield and total et fertilization significantly increased the maize grain yield but there was no corresponding increase in et which suggests that fertilization is effective for increasing the crop water consumption rate thereby improving wue and rue jones et al 1986 showed that the application of plastic film improved the wue and rue and obtained a high yield soil moisture mainly improves the soil nutrient availability which promotes crop nutrient absorption and utilization under the rf planting model with simulated precipitation of 440 340 and 230 mm the wue increased by 69 7 39 9 and 10 3 over that of conventional flat cultivation ren et al 2008 the growth of maize in furrows under ridges covered with biodegradable film or plastic film obviously reduced the et rate and enhanced the wue according to jia et al 2006 the use of fertilizer in dry land farming systems can improve the crop growth conditions and increase the productivity and wue di paolo and rinaldi 2008 but the aenp is affected by the soil fertility status where low soil fertility tends to obtain a high aenp whereas a high soil fertility status leads to a lower aenp we characterized the wue as the association between the grain yield and total et fertilization can effectively increase the crop water utilization rate therefore increasing the agricultural wue and rue the mean results also confirmed that the consumption of more n p fertilizer probably increased the wue and rue values but the differences were not significant between the m2f3 and m2f2 treatments table 2 shows that as the n p fertilizer increased the aenp tended to decrease the effect of different n p fertilizer level was the complete opposite under the two planting models the maximum 16 50 kg kg 1 aenp was obtained with m2f1 treatment and the minimum 7 86 kg kg 1 with m1f3 treatment the availability of rainwater enhanced the aenp and the highest aenp value was achieved with the m2 planting model rather than the m1 flat planting model table 2 which indicates that it is efficient to use a small amount of n p fertilizer in both planting models 4 4 economic evaluation the financial profit is one of the keys useful indicators for evaluating crop management practices in dry land farming systems our economic analysis also suggested that there were greater benefits under the rfrh planting model m2 with an n p level of 200 100 kg ha 1 therefore our results suggest that m2f2 may be a suitable modern planting model for maize productivity in rain fed regions due to the enhancements of the wue rue aenp and soil water storage thereby obtaining higher grain yields and more benefits this may be a useful planting model for reducing the risk of maize production 5 conclusions we examined the effects of the interactions between planting models and fertilizer application rates on the yield growth and development of maize as well as the sws wue rue and et levels we showed that rfrh planting model with an n p fertilizer level of 200 100 kg ha 1 could enhance the sws soil moisture availability during critical growth stages as well as significantly increasing the maize yield and wue increasing the n p fertilizer level significantly enhanced the yield under both planting models but the relative increase in yield was not significant when n p fertilizer level was above 200 100 kg n p ha 1 thus as the amount of fertilizer increased the aenp decreased but the yield and economic benefit tended to increase the economic analysis also suggested that greater 54 benefits could be obtained by using the rfrh planting model with an n p fertilizer level of 200 100 kg ha 1 therefore our results suggest that the m2f2 treatment is appropriate for maize production in rain fed areas because it improves the wue rue and sws levels thereby enhancing the grain yield and economic benefits to reduce the risk of maize production in dry land farming systems acknowledgments this work was supported by henan university of science and technology haust discipline improvement
