23520,minimizing coastal wetland loss is a high priority in coastal areas worldwide typical shoreline protection consists of hard structures placed near areas affected by wave action these commonly used protection methods are costly and may have negative impacts on the surrounding areas the wave suppression and sediment collection wssc system made of multiple wave robber units is an alternative shoreline protection structure the primary goal of this study is to determine the performance characteristics of the technology in terms of energy coefficients experiments were performed on three scaled units within a laboratory wave tank performance characterization showed that the units have wave energy reflections of 0 47 0 83 transmission ranging from 0 10 to 0 42 and wave energy dissipation between 0 49 and 0 88 depending upon unit geometry and wave conditions performance data were also compared to other studies on shoreline protection structures wssc units reflect more wave energy and transmit less energy compared to other breakwater systems these units could be utilized in coastal marshes with a large fetch to reduce wave induced erosion keywords shoreline protection breakwater performance characteristics wave attenuation wave reflection wave transmission 1 introduction protecting coastal areas is an issue of global importance nearly half of the world s population lives within 200 km of a coastline creel 2003 this number is predicted to double by the year 2025 economic benefits to those living near these coastal areas are numerous and include food production from fisheries revenue from tourism including recreational hunting and fishing and connectivity to sea transportation coastal areas also provide important resources for industry such as water large amounts of land and access to ports an estimated 50 of the world s wetlands and 20 of the world s mangroves were lost over the 20th century creel 2003 coastal wetlands provide an essential service to coastal communities by acting as a self sustaining buffer for storm protection especially hurricanes a study by costanza et al 2008 estimated the amount of storm protection provided by coastal wetlands in the u s to be worth about 23 2 billion annually these are only a few reasons why preserving and maintaining coastal wetlands is important and beneficial to society costanza et al 2008 minimizing coastal wetland loss is a high priority in coastal areas throughout the world in the last fifty years coastal land loss in louisiana has surpassed a rate of 40 square miles per year since the 1990s this land loss rate has been estimated between 25 and 35 square miles a year the amount of coastal wetlands lost in louisiana amounts to 80 of the total wetlands lost in the continental u s each year tibbetts 2006 in total wetland disappearance is estimated to account for a loss of 37 billion by the year 2050 lcwc 1998 conservation and upkeep of shorelines is the goal of many coastal protection programs hard structures have been the standard coastal protection for many years piazza et al 2005 introduction of hard structures changes sediment balance by disrupting the sediment flow in the area birben et al 2007 other methods such as vegetative planting and oyster reef creation have shown promise for becoming alternatives to hard shoreline protection techniques as with all engineering applications benefits and disadvantages must be weighed before implementing a solution some disadvantages of the current erosion control methods include soil in louisiana marshes is not typically suitable for hard breakwaters typical soil in louisiana marshes contains a high amount of clay 30 65 and has large and varying amounts of organic matter edwards and proffitt 2003 kudella et al 2006 studied pore pressure generation beneath caisson breakwaters on loose sand with thin clay or silt layers their study showed that residual pore pressure increased under the caissons due to breaking wave loads this residual pore pressure was closely related to soil deformations and could lead to the failure of the breakwater kudella et al 2006 these soil conditions require more specialized materials such as geotextiles to support hard structures that increase their cost groins face the same issues as breakwaters in the marsh setting as they are also heavy and costly to construct vegetative planting and its success depend on substrate quality nutrient availability water temperature water level and salinity these impact vegetative health and density which are important for effective erosion control drastic changes in environmental conditions can lead to a die off and loss of effectiveness oyster reefs are typically only useful for wave attenuation in low energy wave environments the biggest difficulty faced while designing a coastal structure is accurately forecasting its performance mccormick 1993 design of a coastal structure requires accurate models to predict the shoreline response kristensen et al 2013 improperly designed shoreline protection structures may cause undesired erosion in the surrounding areas mccormick 1993 studies of the geometric and structural properties of wave structure relationships in coastal areas have recently led to a great deal of investigation near shorelines hard structures are typically used to eliminate wave energies through absorption shih et al 2015 in the past few decades many researchers have studied the performance characteristics of different types of new shoreline protection devices some of these devices include suspended pipe breakwaters mounted on a frame dentated and serrated seawalls submerged breakwaters submerged inclined pipe breakwaters double wall breakwaters and others shih et al 2015 breakwaters typically achieve wave reduction through diffraction while this may allow for reduced wave heights immediately behind the offshore breakwaters the surrounding areas may suffer from larger wave heights than before this is one of the reasons that the sediment balance is disturbed by hard structures and it affects not only the shoreline but also the native ecosystem in addition to the disruption of the ecosystem and sediment balances these hard structures are costly and many poor coastal communities cannot afford either the installation or the upkeep required for these structures for these reasons the focus of breakwater design has been on maximizing attenuation as opposed to the diffraction while minimizing environmental and economic costs shih et al 2015 a new shoreline protection device was tested in this study fig 1 shows this novel shoreline protection device named the wave suppression and sediment collection system wssc the purpose of the wssc is to reduce wave energy reaching the shoreline while at the same time collecting sediment it has a sloped front face with steps protruding perpendicular from just below openings on the face these openings are pipes that connect the front face to the back of the units all pipes are sloped to ensure sediment laden water travels towards the rear check valves are connected to the back of the pipes to prevent backflow previous studies performed on the wssc mccoy 2015 have provided basic understanding of the units functionality study performed by mccoy et al 2015 mainly focused on the laboratory and mathematical modeling of silt clay transport through the wssc units preliminary wave reduction data of the wssc units were also collected mccoy et al 2015 while wave reduction is an important characteristic for breakwater design other factors such as wave reflection and transmission must also be considered the previous studies used a pressure sensor to determine wave heights in front of and behind the units at a frequency of 5 hz this collection frequency makes the data less reliable when determining wave heights and periods especially in front of the units typical wave tank experiments collect data at over 20 hz by using higher frequencies and more wave height sensors wave heights and periods can be determined more accurately further study was needed to get a better understanding of the device s performance for energy considerations the main objective of this study was to determine the energy characteristics of multiple physical models based on laboratory experiments the performance of the three scale models was studied in terms of energy reflection transmission and loss coefficients the accurate modeling of the performance affects the functionality of the technology to prevent coastal erosion in different environmental settings 2 materials and methods 2 1 wssc units the three laboratory scale models used during this study are shown in figs 2 4 differences among the units are the number and size of pipes connecting the front and the back of the units all three laboratory scale units have the same overall dimensions each unit is 1 37 m long 0 46 m wide and 0 3 m tall the numbers of openings in each unit are 72 10 and 6 for units 1 2 and 3 respectively circular openings were used in units 1 and 2 with diameters of 1 19 cm and 5 08 cm respectively unit 3 has rectangular openings of dimensions 20 32 cm by 5 08 cm the total open areas for the units are 205 cm2 202 cm2 and 619 cm2 for units 1 2 and 3 respectively the nearly equal open area of units 1 and 2 allows for a comparison on whether it is the total open area or the pipe diameter and location that has a greater influence on wave energy attenuation 2 2 wave tank setup the wave tank used in this study is located in the hydraulics laboratory on the university of louisiana at lafayette campus the tank measures 1 83 m wide 3 81 m long and 0 51 m deep scaled wave suppression units used in the studies do not span the entire length of the tank and therefore a 0 30 m tall and 0 15 m wide weir is placed on the side of the unit in order to minimize wave energy transfer around the unit the wssc units were held in place by a custom built framing system the framing system consists of a wooden frame attached to the wave tank by a c clamp on each side a metal all thread rod runs through the wooden frame on each end and applies normal force to hold the units in place during the experiments once secured the frame and rod system provides enough normal force into the units to ensure there is no movement due to wave impact during the experiments waves were generated inside the tank using a flap type paddle connected to a motor and secured to a bridge assembly on top of the tank the electric motor s speed is fully adjustable allowing for multiple wave settings the paddle moves in sinusoidal fashion generating regular incident waves towards the unit during the experiments the units were located a distance of 1 99 m in front of the wave paddle the unit placement was the same as described in the previous study mccoy et al 2015 each unit was placed within the tank at a position of 0 61 m from the rear wall the units were held in place by a specially designed system of vertical rods to add sufficient normal force to prevent them from moving weirs used in the previous study were also employed in this experiment mccoy 2015 plumbers putty was used along the bottom and sides of the unit in order to minimize any water movement through imperfect fittings mccoy 2015 a water hose was used to fill up the tank with water up to a certain depth and there is a control valve that can be opened to drain water from the tank for experimental purposes different water depths were used determined by a measuring rod using the hose and valve the water depths were changed increased or decreased before the experiment 2 3 estimation of wave attenuation a study of the performance characteristics of the laboratory units was performed in the wave tank three capacitance wave sensors were used in this study wave sensors used were the wave staff ossi 010 002f water level sensors produced by ocean sensor systems inc coral springs florida usa incident and reflected wave amplitudes were separated using the methods developed by goda and suzuki 1976 the waves were assumed regular waves as the frequency of the wavemaker was kept constant during each experiment resolving the waves into their respective incident and reflective parts was done by application of the fast fourier transform fft technique goda and suzuki 1976 locations of the sensors and the spacing between them were determined based on goda and suzuki 1976 work for determining reflection coefficients of a breakwater sensor 1 is located 20 cm in front of the unit spacing between sensors is important for differentiating between incident and reflected waves goda and suzuki 1976 gave an approximate range for δl spacing between sensors based on wavelength within the range of measured frequencies f m i n δ l l m a x 0 05 f m a x δ l l m i n 0 45 frequencies obtained by mccoy et al 2015 using pressure readings from the same units were used to estimate the minimum and maximum wavelengths estimated wavelengths were determined by using the following equation presented by fenton and mckee 1990 1 l g t 2 2 π tanh 2 π d g 3 4 2 3 with estimated periods between 0 8 and 3 s and wavelengths between 0 8 and 4 m the range of dl was between 20 and 36 cm therefore sensor 2 was located 30 cm beyond the first sensor the third sensor sensor 3 was located 25 cm in front of the wave paddle to obtain incident wave heights the incident wave heights from sensor 3 fig 6 were analyzed excluding the first few 10 15 seconds of the experiment to remove the transient wave conditions data once waves stabilized after the first 10 15 s data were analyzed for incident wave heights the final setup of the wave sensors within the tank is shown in fig 5 the three capacitance wave sensors were installed above the tank using wooden platforms designed specifically for this experiment the sensors were linked to a computer for data collection software used in data collection was the staff and sonic products interface program provided by ocean sensor systems the first and second sensors were used to collect data to calculate the reflection coefficient which is a measure of the wave energy reflected by the unit the third sensor closest to the paddle was used to calculate the incident wave heights the sensors were first calibrated for water level measurements before collection of data for the experiment once data were collected for ten minutes the third sensor was moved to 20 cm behind the unit while the operation remained the same and additional data were collected to calculate the transmission coefficient a measure of the energy transmitted through the unit performance characteristic tests were conducted at three water depths for each unit 15 2 cm 19 1 cm and 22 9 cm at each water depth four control settings were used each producing a different incident wave height and wave period data were collected at a sampling frequency of 30 hz to ensure measurement of the entire waves from goda and suzuki 1976 the composite wave profiles of incident and reflected waves at location x x 1 and x x 1 δ l can be expressed as 2 η 1 η i η r x x 1 a 1 cos σ t b 1 sin σ t 3 a 1 a i cos θ i a r cos θ r 4 b 1 a i sin θ i a r sin θ r 5 η 2 η i η r x x 1 δ l a 2 cos σ t b 2 sin σ t 6 a 2 a i cos θ i k δ l a r cos θ r k δ l 7 b 2 a i sin θ i k δ l a r sin θ r k δ l where 8 θ i k x 1 ε i 9 θ r k x 1 ε r incident and reflected wave amplitudes can then be calculated by 10 a i 2 s i n k δ l 1 a 2 a 1 c o s k δ l b 1 s i n k δ l 2 b 2 a 1 c o s k δ l b 1 s i n k δ l 2 1 2 11 a r 2 s i n k δ l 1 a 2 a 1 c o s k δ l b 1 s i n k δ l 2 b 2 a 1 sin k δ l b 1 cos k δ l 2 1 2 incident and reflected wave energies are then obtained by 12 e i f min f max s i f d f 13 e r f min f max s r f d f the reflection coefficient k r can then be determined 14 k r e r e i and the wave transmission coefficients k t can be estimated by 15 k t h t h i where h t and h i are transmitted and incident wave heights respectively wave attenuation k l is then estimated by 16 k l 1 k r 2 k t 2 adopting the data reduction method by goda and suzuki 1976 the amplitudes of a 1 to b 2 were determined for individual waves and their respective amplitudes a i and a r were calculated by eqs 10 and 11 the incident and reflected spectral lines were obtained by smoothing the periodograms using the estimated values of a i and a r this method is explained more in detail in section 3 1 of the manuscript once data were obtained they were sorted in ms excel spreadsheets the time series data were then analyzed using a matlab function compiled from multiple functions within the mace toolbox mori 2009 a matlab toolbox for coastal engineers and researchers the zero up crossing analysis was also performed using matlab the periods were then used to estimate the frequency range for the spectral density plots since the units do not have similar faces comparisons were carried out with respect to geometrical similarities comparisons were also made between the wssc units with similar breakwater units studied by other researchers section 3 3 in their studies the coefficient e was used to denote the distance between two horizontal plates table 1 lists the physical characteristics of the units for comparison units 1 and 2 had similar open areas while units 2 and 3 had equal row spacing and number of rows pipe diameter for unit 3 was an equivalent diameter since it did not have circular pipes 3 results and discussion 3 1 waveform variation three different depths were used in this study with four different wave settings at each depth table 2 lists the four different paddle speed settings at three water depths with their corresponding incident wave heights hi and significant wave periods ts paddle speed settings 1 4 represent gradual increase of rotational speeds of the paddle i e setting 1 is the slowest and have longer time periods differences arose between the wave heights and periods at different water depths due to the configuration of the paddle in the wave tank since only paddle rotational speed changes with each setting different water depths produce different wave conditions based on the amount of energy transferred by the paddle other studies have used differing wave heights and periods but generally the water depth is kept constant since the geometries of the units in this study varied by height multiple depths were used in order to compare the effects of these different geometries fig 6 shows typical variations in the waveforms between all four sensors for unit 3 when t 0 9 s d 19 1 cm and h i 5 4 cm the ranges for different water wave conditions were presented by reeve et al 2004 the wave conditions produced by the paddle in the tank were well within the wave breaking parameters suggested by goda 2010 holmes 2001 and the shore protection manual by u s army corps of engineers 1984 in few cases the water wave condition became transitional from shallow water individual wave height is the vertical difference between a peak on the water level graph and the following trough wave amplitude is half of the wave height small amplitude wave reflections exist throughout all three graphs and waveforms follow a regular sinusoidal wave pattern the best representation of the unimpeded waveform existed as the waves first began near 10s in the graph of sensor 3 this first wave is smooth compared to the rest of the waves due to the absence of reflected or standing wave harmonics when comparing to other authors shih 2012 shih et al 2015 these time series show more variation between wave crests this was mainly caused by the short length between the wavemaker and the units which produces more turbulence by reflected and re reflected waves this is also due in part to the larger sampling frequency in this study 30 hz vs 20 hz allowing more small variations to show a unit s wave attenuation can be seen in the wave height difference between sensors 1 3 and the sensor behind the unit raw surface elevation data from these sensors are also known as composite wave profiles these profiles include both incident and reflected waves with no differentiation between the two laboratory data were sorted in ms excel and were analyzed in the matlab software using mace toolbox mori 2009 as mentioned before each sensor data analyzed using the fast fourier transform fft technique produced spectral lines for each sensor and wave condition usually incident and reflected waves are mixed together in each sensor data the fft analysis technique provides estimate of incident and reflected wave amplitudes for each sensor record for each spectral line as the reflected waves impede the ideal incident wave conditions this analysis was carried out for the data of each capacitance wave gage and then results were averaged to isolate the two waves after that the zero up crossing method took into account the difference of maximum and minimum water levels and represented the height of the individual waves calculations performed for spectral density plots revealed that the three estimates of wave amplitudes did not vary significantly in this study thus the average incident and reflected wave amplitudes at spectral lines were taken as representative of the incident and reflected wave amplitudes this was also done for transmitted wave conditions the height of each individual wave for a specific period was then calculated when the water levels crossed the mean water level upward in two consecutive points in time this method can also be used to indicate the level of wave grouping in the obtained data rye 1974 in the current study it can be seen that there was high level of wave grouping for regular wave conditions it was found from another similar study conducted by seelig 1980 for regular wave experiments the wave period follows similar results as the wave paddle period in the tank it was also found that 90 percent or more of the incident wave energy were in the spectral band of the wave paddle frequencies for different regular wave conditions the three gages in front of the wssc unit gave three records of the incident and reflected wave amplitude spectra 3 2 energy characteristics of the wssc non breaking waves were used in this study to determine the changes in the reflection k r transmission k t and loss k l coefficients when a wave encountered the wssc units the waves were considered regular since they are generated at a constant speed and the units absorb and transmit most of its energy before reflecting some of it back towards incoming waves the following provides an analysis of the results obtained with respect to the wave characteristics results of the energy coefficients are discussed using polynomial regression fitting for energy coefficients against dimensionless units similar to shih et al 2015 3 2 1 energy coefficient comparisons between units fig 7 presents the reflection coefficients for all three units with respect to h i gt 2 reflection coefficient k r ranges from 0 47 to 0 83 the graph shows that reflection is generally higher for unit 3 when the h i gt 2 0 004 unit 1 has higher reflection than unit 2 with units 1 and 2 having the same open area it is likely that units with smaller diameter pipes reflect more wave energy with respect to open area shih 2012 studied the effect of different pipe diameter on breakwater energy coefficients the correlation coefficients ranged from 0 21 0 32 for the three units the small correlation coefficient values can be attributed to low number of data points and the homogeneity of the data within a small range also some outlier points might have affected the correlation coefficient values results from his study showed that smaller diameter pipes reflected slightly more waves than larger diameter pipes and the range of k r for these breakwaters ranged from 0 30 to 0 60 the relatively higher range of reflection coefficients in the present study were caused by the units having much lower open area ratio this lower open area ratio indicates the wssc units have more solid surface to reflect wave energy than the highly pervious pipe breakwater system of shih 2012 fig 8 shows the transmission coefficients of all units plotted against h i d transmission coefficient k t ranges from 0 10 to 0 42 coefficients for all units decrease as incident wave heights increase unit 1 with a smaller e had a lower k t trend than the other two units when h i d 0 3 when h i d 0 3 the trends of all units approached 0 10 this was likely caused by smaller row spacing allowing less energy transmission for a certain range of wave heights wang et al 2006 showed that smaller spacing between plates in a multiple layer breakwater led to smaller transmission coefficients one of the reasons that transmission energy decreases with increasing wave height is because higher waves produce greater velocities allowing for more head loss through the pipes fig 9 is the loss coefficients for all units plotted against h i gt 2 coefficients ranged from 0 49 to 0 88 trends show that unit 3 is least effective in reducing wave energy from this graph it can be seen that units with smaller open areas produce larger energy losses this difference is likely caused by the smaller pipes dissipating more energy this relationship can be compared by using the darcy weisbach formula for major energy losses in pipes 17 h f 4 f c l p v 2 2 g d and 18 v q a o since all the units have the same pipe lengths and f c is equal for all units the only differences between the three are velocity and pipe diameter all units have similar flowrates through inspection of eq 17 it can be seen that larger energy losses occur in pipes with higher flow velocity and smaller diameters with velocity being the dominant factor therefore it is reasonable that the units with smaller open area and higher velocities experience greater energy loss similarities were also found by shih 2012 on different diameter pipe breakwaters at h i gt 2 0 008 the largest and smallest diameter pipes in his study had k l values of 0 60 and 0 76 respectively these values are close to the k l regression values of 0 60 and 0 72 for the respective largest and smallest pipes at h i gt 2 0 008 in this study the low correlation coefficients ranging from 0 14 0 22 can be caused by the homogeneity of the data within a small axes range table 3 lists the average energy coefficients grouped by the units open area differences were noted between open area for average k r and k l while k t showed no significant difference in order to determine whether the apparent differences of k r and k l by open area were significant comparisons were performed using rank sum tests a mann whitney rank sum test was performed since the data was not normally distributed as is required by the t test data of two different groups are considered to be statistically different if p 0 05 for a 95 confidence interval the results showed that there exists a significant difference between the two open areas for k r and k l with these significant differences it can be concluded that wssc units attenuate more wave energy with smaller open areas particularly a a o a t ratio of 0 03 reduces wave energy by an average of 74 for these experimental conditions no significant difference was found between k t for the different units 3 3 comparison of hydrodynamic efficiency results of this study are compared to efficiency curves of breakwaters within other studies koraim 2013 neelamani and gayathri 2006 sundar and subbarao 2003 teh et al 2012 dimensionless units of d l water depth to wavelength are used to compare the different units fig 10 shows the k r values obtained in the present study compared to other studies the present breakwater design variations give higher k r values this is caused by differences in the front face geometry the large surface area and slats on the front face of the wssc tend to reflect more wave energy compared to other breakwaters in general higher wave reflection is good for open coastline where transmitted wave energy can cause erosion and the waves are reflected back into the open ocean these higher reflections may have negative effects in certain areas such as harbor entrances and sheltered bays in these areas the constructive interference of reflected waves can lead to larger amplitude waves and an increased rate of erosion along shorelines in fig 11 the present unit s k t values are shown to be much lower than the other breakwaters across the entire range of wavelengths significantly lower transmission coefficients means the present unit would be more suited for blocking wave action from a coastline than the compared breakwaters fig 12 shows k l values obtained in this study compared to those of other studies there are no general trends for k l among the studies values of the present study are higher when d l is low and decrease at larger values of d l and reaching a minimum around k l 0 60 the k l values of the present study seem to be within the upper range of values obtained by other studies 4 limitations this study was conducted in a wave tank with a length of 3 81 m due to the wave tank length limitation the distance between sensor 3 and the paddle was only 1 64 1 31 and 1 10 times water depths for the three water levels used in this study the location of sensor 3 was in all cases within two water depths which might have impacted the incident wave data as standing waves are negligible at two or three water depths away dean and dalrymple 1991 the decaying standing waves coefficients were calculated to be 0 07 0 13 and 0 18 respectively which were not negligible however the standing waves might not have impacted the incident waves to the point where it became unreliable to analyze and compare in addition the absence of significant variations in the wave amplitude estimates from the three sensors indicated that the effect of re reflected waves on the incident and reflected wave data were not significant another possible source of error might also include the existence of nonharmonic terms transversal waves and other disturbances in the wave tank and signal errors in sensors as discussed by goda and suzuki 1976 5 conclusions the evaluation results showed the wssc units were best at attenuating long period waves in the nearshore zones of coastal areas the structure of the wssc units are not suitable for wave breaking zones rather it was designed to work in shallow water and low energy zones of coastal louisiana units with smaller pipe openings and total open area had higher amounts of wave attenuation it is believed that the open pipe area and the slats on the front of the unit are responsible for reflection and attenuation slight differences between the units and their respective energy coefficients were found k r values ranged from 0 47 to 0 83 larger than some other pipe breakwater systems unit 3 had the highest energy reflection while units 1 and 2 were similar transmission coefficient k t ranged from 0 10 to 0 42 in this study with smaller values corresponding to larger wave heights transmission was slightly reduced as row spacing and pipe diameter decreased though there was not a significant difference between the units wave attenuation coefficients ranged from 0 49 to 0 88 with units 1 and 2 reducing significantly more wave energy than unit 3 larger wave attenuation was correlated with smaller open area due to the somewhat high reflection wssc units could be suitable for installation in a relatively open coastal environment as opposed to an enclosed harbor low energy transmission through the units would reduce shoreline wave erosion while the substantial wave attenuation would allow for sediment accumulation along shore acknowledgements the research described in this paper was funded by the university of louisiana pierce industries and the louisiana board of regents under leqsf

al 2015 breakwaters typically achieve wave reduction through diffraction while this may allow for reduced wave heights immediately behind the offshore breakwaters the surrounding areas may suffer from larger wave heights than before this is one of the reasons that the sediment balance is disturbed by hard structures and it affects not only the shoreline but also the native ecosystem in addition to the disruption of the ecosystem and sediment balances these hard structures are costly and many poor coastal communities cannot afford either the installation or the upkeep required for these structures for these reasons the focus of breakwater design has been on maximizing attenuation as opposed to the diffraction while minimizing environmental and economic costs shih et al 2015 a new shoreline protection device was tested in this study fig 1 shows this novel shoreline protection device named the wave suppression and sediment collection system wssc the purpose of the wssc is to reduce wave energy reaching the shoreline while at the same time collecting sediment it has a sloped front face with steps protruding perpendicular from just below openings on the face these openings are pipes that connect the front face to the back of the units all pipes are sloped to ensure sediment laden water travels towards the rear check valves are connected to the back of the pipes to prevent backflow previous studies performed on the wssc mccoy 2015 have provided basic understanding of the units functionality study performed by mccoy et al 2015 mainly focused on the laboratory and mathematical modeling of silt clay transport through the wssc units preliminary wave reduction data of the wssc units were also collected mccoy et al 2015 while wave reduction is an important characteristic for breakwater design other factors such as wave reflection and transmission must also be considered the previous studies used a pressure sensor to determine wave heights in front of and behind the units at a frequency of 5 hz this collection frequency makes the data less reliable when determining wave heights and periods especially in front of the units typical wave tank experiments collect data at over 20 hz by using higher frequencies and more wave height sensors wave heights and periods can be determined more accurately further study was needed to get a better understanding of the device s performance for energy considerations the main objective of this study was to determine the energy characteristics of multiple physical models based on laboratory experiments the performance of the three scale models was studied in terms of energy reflection transmission and loss coefficients the accurate modeling of the performance affects the functionality of the technology to prevent coastal erosion in different environmental settings 2 materials and methods 2 1 wssc units the three laboratory scale models used during this study are shown in figs 2 4 differences among the units are the number and size of pipes connecting the front and the back of the units all three laboratory scale units have the same overall dimensions each unit is 1 37 m long 0 46 m wide and 0 3 m tall the numbers of openings in each unit are 72 10 and 6 for units 1 2 and 3 respectively circular openings were used in units 1 and 2 with diameters of 1 19 cm and 5 08 cm respectively unit 3 has rectangular openings of dimensions 20 32 cm by 5 08 cm the total open areas for the units are 205 cm2 202 cm2 and 619 cm2 for units 1 2 and 3 respectively the nearly equal open area of units 1 and 2 allows for a comparison on whether it is the total open area or the pipe diameter and location that has a greater influence on wave energy attenuation 2 2 wave tank setup the wave tank used in this study is located in the hydraulics laboratory on the university of louisiana at lafayette campus the tank measures 1 83 m wide 3 81 m long and 0 51 m deep scaled wave suppression units used in the studies do not span the entire length of the tank and therefore a 0 30 m tall and 0 15 m wide weir is placed on the side of the unit in order to minimize wave energy transfer around the unit the wssc units were held in place by a custom built framing system the framing system consists of a wooden frame attached to the wave tank by a c clamp on each side a metal all thread rod runs through the wooden frame on each end and applies normal force to hold the units in place during the experiments once secured the frame and rod system provides enough normal force into the units to ensure there is no movement due to wave impact during the experiments waves were generated inside the tank using a flap type paddle connected to a motor and secured to a bridge assembly on top of the tank the electric motor s speed is fully adjustable allowing for multiple wave settings the paddle moves in sinusoidal fashion generating regular incident waves towards the unit during the experiments the units were located a distance of 1 99 m in front of the wave paddle the unit placement was the same as described in the previous study mccoy et al 2015 each unit was placed within the tank at a position of 0 61 m from the rear wall the units were held in place by a specially designed system of vertical rods to add sufficient normal force to prevent them from moving weirs used in the previous study were also employed in this experiment mccoy 2015 plumbers putty was used along the bottom and sides of the unit in order to minimize any water movement through imperfect fittings mccoy 2015 a water hose was used to fill up the tank with water up to a certain depth and there is a control valve that can be opened to drain water from the tank for experimental purposes different water depths were used determined by a measuring rod using the hose and valve the water depths were changed increased or decreased before the experiment 2 3 estimation of wave attenuation a study of the performance characteristics of the laboratory units was performed in the wave tank three capacitance wave sensors were used in this study wave sensors used were the wave staff ossi 010 002f water level sensors produced by ocean sensor systems inc coral springs florida usa incident and reflected wave amplitudes were separated using the methods developed by goda and suzuki 1976 the waves were assumed regular waves as the frequency of the wavemaker was kept constant during each experiment resolving the waves into their respective incident and reflective parts was done by application of the fast fourier transform fft technique goda and suzuki 1976 locations of the sensors and the spacing between them were determined based on goda and suzuki 1976 work for determining reflection coefficients of a breakwater sensor 1 is located 20 cm in front of the unit spacing between sensors is important for differentiating between incident and reflected waves goda and suzuki 1976 gave an approximate range for δl spacing between sensors based on wavelength within the range of measured frequencies f m i n δ l l m a x 0 05 f m a x δ l l m i n 0 45 frequencies obtained by mccoy et al 2015 using pressure readings from the same units were used to estimate the minimum and maximum wavelengths estimated wavelengths were determined by using the following equation presented by fenton and mckee 1990 1 l g t 2 2 π tanh 2 π d g 3 4 2 3 with estimated periods between 0 8 and 3 s and wavelengths between 0 8 and 4 m the range of dl was between 20 and 36 cm therefore sensor 2 was located 30 cm beyond the first sensor the third sensor sensor 3 was located 25 cm in front of the wave paddle to obtain incident wave heights the incident wave heights from sensor 3 fig 6 were analyzed excluding the first few 10 15 seconds of the experiment to remove the transient wave conditions data once waves stabilized after the first 10 15 s data were analyzed for incident wave heights the final setup of the wave sensors within the tank is shown in fig 5 the three capacitance wave sensors were installed above the tank using wooden platforms designed specifically for this experiment the sensors were linked to a computer for data collection software used in data collection was the staff and sonic products interface program provided by ocean sensor systems the first and second sensors were used to collect data to calculate the reflection coefficient which is a measure of the wave energy reflected by the unit the third sensor closest to the paddle was used to calculate the incident wave heights the sensors were first calibrated for water level measurements before collection of data for the experiment once data were collected for ten minutes the third sensor was moved to 20 cm behind the unit while the operation remained the same and additional data were collected to calculate the transmission coefficient a measure of the energy transmitted through the unit performance characteristic tests were conducted at three water depths for each unit 15 2 cm 19 1 cm and 22 9 cm at each water depth four control settings were used each producing a different incident wave height and wave period data were collected at a sampling frequency of 30 hz to ensure measurement of the entire waves from goda and suzuki 1976 the composite wave profiles of incident and reflected waves at location x x 1 and x x 1 δ l can be expressed as 2 η 1 η i η r x x 1 a 1 cos σ t b 1 sin σ t 3 a 1 a i cos θ i a r cos θ r 4 b 1 a i sin θ i a r sin θ r 5 η 2 η i η r x x 1 δ l a 2 cos σ t b 2 sin σ t 6 a 2 a i cos θ i k δ l a r cos θ r k δ l 7 b 2 a i sin θ i k δ l a r sin θ r k δ l where 8 θ i k x 1 ε i 9 θ r k x 1 ε r incident and reflected wave amplitudes can then be calculated by 10 a i 2 s i n k δ l 1 a 2 a 1 c o s k δ l b 1 s i n k δ l 2 b 2 a 1 c o s k δ l b 1 s i n k δ l 2 1 2 11 a r 2 s i n k δ l 1 a 2 a 1 c o s k δ l b 1 s i n k δ l 2 b 2 a 1 sin k δ l b 1 cos k δ l 2 1 2 incident and reflected wave energies are then obtained by 12 e i f min f max s i f d f 13 e r f min f max s r f d f the reflection coefficient k r can then be determined 14 k r e r e i and the wave transmission coefficients k t can be estimated by 15 k t h t h i where h t and h i are transmitted and incident wave heights respectively wave attenuation k l is then estimated by 16 k l 1 k r 2 k t 2 adopting the data reduction method by goda and suzuki 1976 the amplitudes of a 1 to b 2 were determined for individual waves and their respective amplitudes a i and a r were calculated by eqs 10 and 11 the incident and reflected spectral lines were obtained by smoothing the periodograms using the estimated values of a i and a r this method is explained more in detail in section 3 1 of the manuscript once data were obtained they were sorted in ms excel spreadsheets the time series data were then analyzed using a matlab function compiled from multiple functions within the mace toolbox mori 2009 a matlab toolbox for coastal engineers and researchers the zero up crossing analysis was also performed using matlab the periods were then used to estimate the frequency range for the spectral density plots since the units do not have similar faces comparisons were carried out with respect to geometrical similarities comparisons were also made between the wssc units with similar breakwater units studied by other researchers section 3 3 in their studies the coefficient e was used to denote the distance between two horizontal plates table 1 lists the physical characteristics of the units for comparison units 1 and 2 had similar open areas while units 2 and 3 had equal row spacing and number of rows pipe diameter for unit 3 was an equivalent diameter since it did not have circular pipes 3 results and discussion 3 1 waveform variation three different depths were used in this study with four different wave settings at each depth table 2 lists the four different paddle speed settings at three water depths with their corresponding incident wave heights hi and significant wave periods ts paddle speed settings 1 4 represent gradual increase of rotational speeds of the paddle i e setting 1 is the slowest and have longer time periods differences arose between the wave heights and periods at different water depths due to the configuration of the paddle in the wave tank since only paddle rotational speed changes with each setting different water depths produce different wave conditions based on the amount of energy transferred by the paddle other studies have used differing wave heights and periods but generally the water depth is kept constant since the geometries of the units in this study varied by height multiple depths were used in order to compare the effects of these different geometries fig 6 shows typical variations in the waveforms between all four sensors for unit 3 when t 0 9 s d 19 1 cm and h i 5 4 cm the ranges for different water wave conditions were presented by reeve et al 2004 the wave conditions produced by the paddle in the tank were well within the wave breaking parameters suggested by goda 2010 holmes 2001 and the shore protection manual by u s army corps of engineers 1984 in few cases the water wave condition became transitional from shallow water individual wave height is the vertical difference between a peak on the water level graph and the following trough wave amplitude is half of the wave height small amplitude wave reflections exist throughout all three graphs and waveforms follow a regular sinusoidal wave pattern the best representation of the unimpeded waveform existed as the waves first began near 10s in the graph of sensor 3 this first wave is smooth compared to the rest of the waves due to the absence of reflected or standing wave harmonics when comparing to other authors shih 2012 shih et al 2015 these time series show more variation between wave crests this was mainly caused by the short length between the wavemaker and the units which produces more turbulence by reflected and re reflected waves this is also due in part to the larger sampling frequency in this study 30 hz vs 20 hz allowing more small variations to show a unit s wave attenuation can be seen in the wave height difference between sensors 1 3 and the sensor behind the unit raw surface elevation data from these sensors are also known as composite wave profiles these profiles include both incident and reflected waves with no differentiation between the two laboratory data were sorted in ms excel and were analyzed in the matlab software using mace toolbox mori 2009 as mentioned before each sensor data analyzed using the fast fourier transform fft technique produced spectral lines for each sensor and wave condition usually incident and reflected waves are mixed together in each sensor data the fft analysis technique provides estimate of incident and reflected wave amplitudes for each sensor record for each spectral line as the reflected waves impede the ideal incident wave conditions this analysis was carried out for the data of each capacitance wave gage and then results were averaged to isolate the two waves after that the zero up crossing method took into account the difference of maximum and minimum water levels and represented the height of the individual waves calculations performed for spectral density plots revealed that the three estimates of wave amplitudes did not vary significantly in this study thus the average incident and reflected wave amplitudes at spectral lines were taken as representative of the incident and reflected wave amplitudes this was also done for transmitted wave conditions the height of each individual wave for a specific period was then calculated when the water levels crossed the mean water level upward in two consecutive points in time this method can also be used to indicate the level of wave grouping in the obtained data rye 1974 in the current study it can be seen that there was high level of wave grouping for regular wave conditions it was found from another similar study conducted by seelig 1980 for regular wave experiments the wave period follows similar results as the wave paddle period in the tank it was also found that 90 percent or more of the incident wave energy were in the spectral band of the wave paddle frequencies for different regular wave conditions the three gages in front of the wssc unit gave three records of the incident and reflected wave amplitude spectra 3 2 energy characteristics of the wssc non breaking waves were used in this study to determine the changes in the reflection k r transmission k t and loss k l coefficients when a wave encountered the wssc units the waves were considered regular since they are generated at a constant speed and the units absorb and transmit most of its energy before reflecting some of it back towards incoming waves the following provides an analysis of the results obtained with respect to the wave characteristics results of the energy coefficients are discussed using polynomial regression fitting for energy coefficients against dimensionless units similar to shih et al 2015 3 2 1 energy coefficient comparisons between units fig 7 presents the reflection coefficients for all three units with respect to h i gt 2 reflection coefficient k r ranges from 0 47 to 0 83 the graph shows that reflection is generally higher for unit 3 when the h i gt 2 0 004 unit 1 has higher reflection than unit 2 with units 1 and 2 having the same open area it is likely that units with smaller diameter pipes reflect more wave energy with respect to open area shih 2012 studied the effect of different pipe diameter on breakwater energy coefficients the correlation coefficients ranged from 0 21 0 32 for the three units the small correlation coefficient values can be attributed to low number of data points and the homogeneity of the data within a small range also some outlier points might have affected the correlation coefficient values results from his study showed that smaller diameter pipes reflected slightly more waves than larger diameter pipes and the range of k r for these breakwaters ranged from 0 30 to 0 60 the relatively higher range of reflection coefficients in the present study were caused by the units having much lower open area ratio this lower open area ratio indicates the wssc units have more solid surface to reflect wave energy than the highly pervious pipe breakwater system of shih 2012 fig 8 shows the transmission coefficients of all units plotted against h i d transmission coefficient k t ranges from 0 10 to 0 42 coefficients for all units decrease as incident wave heights increase unit 1 with a smaller e had a lower k t trend than the other two units when h i d 0 3 when h i d 0 3 the trends of all units approached 0 10 this was likely caused by smaller row spacing allowing less energy transmission for a certain range of wave heights wang et al 2006 showed that smaller spacing between plates in a multiple layer breakwater led to smaller transmission coefficients one of the reasons that transmission energy decreases with increasing wave height is because higher waves produce greater velocities allowing for more head loss through the pipes fig 9 is the loss coefficients for all units plotted against h i gt 2 coefficients ranged from 0 49 to 0 88 trends show that unit 3 is least effective in reducing wave energy from this graph it can be seen that units with smaller open areas produce larger energy losses this difference is likely caused by the smaller pipes dissipating more energy this relationship can be compared by using the darcy weisbach formula for major energy losses in pipes 17 h f 4 f c l p v 2 2 g d and 18 v q a o since all the units have the same pipe lengths and f c is equal for all units the only differences between the three are velocity and pipe diameter all units have similar flowrates through inspection of eq 17 it can be seen that larger energy losses occur in pipes with higher flow velocity and smaller diameters with velocity being the dominant factor therefore it is reasonable that the units with smaller open area and higher velocities experience greater energy loss similarities were also found by shih 2012 on different diameter pipe breakwaters at h i gt 2 0 008 the largest and smallest diameter pipes in his study had k l values of 0 60 and 0 76 respectively these values are close to the k l regression values of 0 60 and 0 72 for the respective largest and smallest pipes at h i gt 2 0 008 in this study the low correlation coefficients ranging from 0 14 0 22 can be caused by the homogeneity of the data within a small axes range table 3 lists the average energy coefficients grouped by the units open area differences were noted between open area for average k r and k l while k t showed no significant difference in order to determine whether the apparent differences of k r and k l by open area were significant comparisons were performed using rank sum tests a mann whitney rank sum test was performed since the data was not normally distributed as is required by the t test data of two different groups are considered to be statistically different if p 0 05 for a 95 confidence interval the results showed that there exists a significant difference between the two open areas for k r and k l with these significant differences it can be concluded that wssc units attenuate more wave energy with smaller open areas particularly a a o a t ratio of 0 03 reduces wave energy by an average of 74 for these experimental conditions no significant difference was found between k t for the different units 3 3 comparison of hydrodynamic efficiency results of this study are compared to efficiency curves of breakwaters within other studies koraim 2013 neelamani and gayathri 2006 sundar and subbarao 2003 teh et al 2012 dimensionless units of d l water depth to wavelength are used to compare the different units fig 10 shows the k r values obtained in the present study compared to other studies the present breakwater design variations give higher k r values this is caused by differences in the front face geometry the large surface area and slats on the front face of the wssc tend to reflect more wave energy compared to other breakwaters in general higher wave reflection is good for open coastline where transmitted wave energy can cause erosion and the waves are reflected back into the open ocean these higher reflections may have negative effects in certain areas such as harbor entrances and sheltered bays in these areas the constructive interference of reflected waves can lead to larger amplitude waves and an increased rate of erosion along shorelines in fig 11 the present unit s k t values are shown to be much lower than the other breakwaters across the entire range of wavelengths significantly lower transmission coefficients means the present unit would be more suited for blocking wave action from a coastline than the compared breakwaters fig 12 shows k l values obtained in this study compared to those of other studies there are no general trends for k l among the studies values of the present study are higher when d l is low and decrease at larger values of d l and reaching a minimum around k l 0 60 the k l values of the present study seem to be within the upper range of values obtained by other studies 4 limitations this study was conducted in a wave tank with a length of 3 81 m due to the wave tank length limitation the distance between sensor 3 and the paddle was only 1 64 1 31 and 1 10 times water depths for the three water levels used in this study the location of sensor 3 was in all cases within two water depths which might have impacted the incident wave data as standing waves are negligible at two or three water depths away dean and dalrymple 1991 the decaying standing waves coefficients were calculated to be 0 07 0 13 and 0 18 respectively which were not negligible however the standing waves might not have impacted the incident waves to the point where it became unreliable to analyze and compare in addition the absence of significant variations in the wave amplitude estimates from the three sensors indicated that the effect of re reflected waves on the incident and reflected wave data were not significant another possible source of error might also include the existence of nonharmonic terms transversal waves and other disturbances in the wave tank and signal errors in sensors as discussed by goda and suzuki 1976 5 conclusions the evaluation results showed the wssc units were best at attenuating long period waves in the nearshore zones of coastal areas the structure of the wssc units are not suitable for wave breaking zones rather it was designed to work in shallow water and low energy zones of coastal louisiana units with smaller pipe openings and total open area had higher amounts of wave attenuation it is believed that the open pipe area and the slats on the front of the unit are responsible for reflection and attenuation slight differences between the units and their respective energy coefficients were found k r values ranged from 0 47 to 0 83 larger than some other pipe breakwater systems unit 3 had the highest energy reflection while units 1 and 2 were similar transmission coefficient k t ranged from 0 10 to 0 42 in this study with smaller values corresponding to larger wave heights transmission was slightly reduced as row spacing and pipe diameter decreased though there was not a significant difference between the units wave attenuation coefficients ranged from 0 49 to 0 88 with units 1 and 2 reducing significantly more wave energy than unit 3 larger wave attenuation was correlated with smaller open area due to the somewhat high reflection wssc units could be suitable for installation in a relatively open coastal environment as opposed to an enclosed harbor low energy transmission through the units would reduce shoreline wave erosion while the substantial wave attenuation would allow for sediment accumulation along shore acknowledgements the research described in this paper was funded by the university of louisiana pierce industries and the louisiana board of regents under leqsf

23521,a kadomtsev petviashvili type equation with improved dispersion characteristics is derived for varying water depths linear shoaling characteristics of the equation for unidirectional waves are in accord with the principle of energy flux concept a finite difference scheme is devised to demonstrate the extended range of applications of the newly derived equation for a number of well known cases in addition a permanent wave form with singularity is shown to be an exact solution of the kdv or unidirectional kp equations the same form for an arbitrary direction satisfies the combined boussinesq equations of any type keywords kadomtsev petviashvili equation kortweg de vries equation improved dispersion improved shoaling nonlinearity uneven water depths 1 introduction kadomtsev and petviashvili 1970 derived a directional version of korteweg and de vries 1895 equation to study the stability of solitary waves since then the kadomtsev petviashvili equation or briefly the kp equation has found widespread application areas and its various forms have been derived in the context of water waves bryant 1982 studied obliquely intersecting permanent waves by deriving a set of nonlinear equations which could describe fully dispersive waves as well as weakly dispersive waves of the kp type depending on the choice of the coefficients hammack et al 1989 generated finite amplitude two dimensional shallow water waves in laboratory and mathematically described them by the exact solutions of the kp equation accurate representation of waves outside the validity range of the kp equation was indicated as a striking feature based on a crank nicolson type formulation feng and mitsui 1998 proposed an implicit finite difference scheme for numerical solutions of the original kdv and kp equations in the same vein mekki and ali 2013 employed a cranck nicolson discretization for the solution of a kp equation derived from the so called bbm equation of benjamin et al 1972 modeling of dust acoustic solitary wave in dusty plasmas by xue 2003 may also be mentioned as a rather unusual application of the kdv or kp equation the origin of the kp equation like that of the kdv equation may be traced back to the work of boussinesq 1872 the kdv equation is one dimensional boussinesq equation transformed to propagate unidirectional waves while the kp equation is directional form of the kdv equation the present work derives a kp type equation with relatively better dispersion characteristics based on a previous kdv type equation for varying depths beji 2016 the improved dispersion properties enable the new equation to propagate shorter waves quite accurately in comparison with the existing kp models which are basically restricted to long waves further the newly derived linear shoaling terms of the present equation ensure that for unidirectional waves the shoaling rate is in perfect accord with the energy flux concept numerical treatment of the new kp equation is done by a crank nicolson type finite difference formulation similar to feng and mitsui 1998 numerous test cases are carried out starting with examination of shoaling properties of the equation for varying bathymetry and continuing with simulations of truly two dimensional obliquely intersecting cnoidal waves as in the experiments of hammack et al 1989 then nonlinear refraction diffraction of waves over a converging zone as experimentally measured by whalin 1971 are simulated finally a rather difficult case of wave propagation over obliquely shoaling bottom topography with an obliquely situated elliptic shoal given by berkhoff et al 1982 is considered for comparisons with experimental results all these simulations show clearly that the kp type equation derived here is capable of simulating shoaling refraction and diffraction of relatively shorter linear and nonlinear waves with acceptable accuracy as rightly noticed by hammack et al 1989 the capabilities of the kp equation are not strictly restricted to weakly directional waves the extend of directionality encompassed by the kp equation is quite good but only slightly hindered by its linear non dispersive character in transverse direction finally a peculiar permanent wave form analytically satisfying kdv or unidirectional kp equation of any type as well as the combined form of boussinesq equations is obtained the solution being singular is deemed of secondary importance from the physical point of view hence placed in the appendix 2 kp type equation for uneven water depths before proceeding to the derivation of the improved kp equation the derivation of a non dispersive linear kp equation is considered briefly as a preliminary to the general case 2 1 kp type equation based on linear long wave model in order to outline the derivation procedure for the simplest case possible and at the same time to point out an interesting connection with the radiation boundary condition of engquist and majda 1977 first a kp like equation is derived from the linear long wave equations for constant depth the linearized shallow water equations are given by dingemans 1997 1 η t h u 0 2 u t g η 0 where u is the vertically averaged or mean horizontal velocity vector with components u v and η is the free surface displacement as measured from the still water level h is the water depth and g is the gravitational acceleration stands for two dimensional horizontal gradient operator with components x y while subscript t denotes partial differentiation with respect to time by cross differentiations the above equations may be combined into a single equation in terms of η 3 η t t c 2 η x x η y y 0 in which c g h is defined as the non dispersive phase celerity a co ordinate system moving in the positive x direction with the celerity c is now introduced so that wave form evolutions in this moving system are slow new spatial σ x c t and temporal τ ε t co ordinates are employed with the small parameter ε indicating the weak changes of wave form in time in the moving co ordinate system no approximation has been introduced for the y direction however the new co ordinate system moves at the celerity c only in the x direction which is the preferred direction of the propagation while directional waves would have a propagation velocity vector not necessarily in the x direction thus favoring a certain direction in σ τ transformation would result in an unsymmetric wave equation that is to say unlike equation 3 the transformed equation would not be the same when x and y are interchanged expressing the terms in equation 3 in the new co ordinate system gives 4 η t t c 2 η σ σ 2 c ε η σ τ η x x η σ σ where the term o ε 2 has been dropped as being higher order than intended to keep substituting the above expressions for the relevant terms in equation 3 while keeping the y direction term intact results in 5 2 c ε η σ τ c 2 η y y 0 going back to the original co ordinate system requires the inverse transformation ε η σ τ η x t c η x x which is substituted into equation 5 and the entire equation is divided by 2 c to obtain 6 η x t c η x x 1 2 c η y y 0 which may be viewed as the linearized shallow water version of the kp equation solving equation 3 for η x x and using it in equation 6 renders the second order radiation boundary condition η t t c η x t 1 2 c 2 η y y 0 in dimensional form for right going waves derived by engquist and majda 1977 for directional waves in this respect equation 6 suggests itself as a suitable boundary condition it has no missing terms compared to equation 3 but supports only those waves moving in the positive x direction in other words while only right going waves are permitted left going waves are not allowed and at the same time directional radiation of waves has not been compromised 2 2 kp type equation based on improved boussinesq model beji and nadaoka 1996 introduced the concept of partial replacement of dispersion terms to the boussinesq model of peregrine 1967 for varying water depths their improved model comprising continuity and momentum equations may be combined into a single nonlinear wave equation in terms of the surface displacement η by suitable approximations to obtain 7 η t t g h 2 η β 3 g h 3 2 2 η 1 β 3 h 2 2 η t t 3 2 g 2 η 2 g h η 2 β g h 2 h 2 η 1 β h h η t t in which only the terms containing the first spatial derivative of the depth are retained truncation of higher depth gradients corresponds to the mild slope assumption which is used throughout the present work wherever necessary the coefficient β is a non dimensional scalar controlling the dispersion characteristics of the equation while β 1 for 1 d results in the original derivation of boussinesq 1872 β 0 corresponds to the combined form of peregrine s 1967 equations setting β 1 5 results in an improved dispersion relationship which is in accord with the fourth order padé approximation of the linear theory dispersion relation in order to derive a kp type equation from equation 7 the x direction is taken as the main propagation direction with all the relevant terms while only non dispersive propagation in the y direction is retained as in equation 3 all the other y dependent terms namely the nonlinear dispersive and shoaling terms in the y direction are dropped such a truncation renders the propagation in the y direction linear and non dispersive and results in 8 η t t g h η x x η y y β 3 g h 3 η x x x x 1 β 3 h 2 η x x t t 3 2 g η 2 x x g h x η x 2 β g h 2 h x η x x x 1 β h h x η x t t with the exception of η y y term the derivation procedure of the kp type equation from equation 8 is completely identical with the derivation of the kdv type equation given in beji 2016 and therefore is not repeated here retaining η y y term throughout and refraining from the final spatial integration results in a generalized kp type equation for uneven depths 9 η t c η x p c h 2 η x x x q h 2 η x x t 3 c 4 h η 2 x c 4 h h x η r c h h x η x x s h h x η x t x 1 2 c η y y 0 where the non dimensional coefficients p 1 2 β 6 q 1 β 3 r 15 32 β 24 s 5 1 β 6 are employed for the sake of a simpler notation as introduced in beji 2016 performing the differentiation while noting that both h and c are spatially varying quantities gives another form of equation 9 10 η x t c η x x p c h 2 η x x x x q h 2 η x x x t 3 c 4 h η 2 x x 3 c 4 h h x η x r p c h h x η x x x s q h h x η x x t 1 2 c η y y 0 in which r p r 5 p 2 and s q s 2 q and the second derivatives of h are neglected the above kp type equation embodies all the known kp type equations as special cases for constant depth setting β 1 p 1 6 q 0 gives the original kp equation while β 1 2 p 0 q 1 6 gives the kp equation corresponding to the kdv model of benjamin et al 1972 the so called bbm model moreover the equation contains terms accounting for depth variations so that it can model changes in wave amplitude due to changes in water depth accuracy and consistency of shoaling characteristics of the unidirectional version that is to say the corresponding kdv equation has already been investigated analytically and shown that shoaling properties of the model equation are in exact agreement with those obtained from the constancy of energy flux beji 2016 in this connection it is worthwhile to remark that dingemans 1997 enumerates and presents derivations of various available kdv and kp type equations but none has the key shoaling terms derived above here these shoaling characteristics are exploited numerically for equation 10 and their importance for reliable simulations in coastal regions with varying bathymetry is demonstrated 2 3 dispersion relationship of improved kp equation dispersion characteristics of the generalized kp type equation are now examined let η a 0 exp i k x x k y y ω t with a 0 denoting the constant wave amplitude i the imaginary unit ω the circular wave frequency k x k cos θ and k y k sin θ the wave number components in the x and y directions respectively θ is the angle wave propagation direction makes with the x axis substituting η into the linearized constant depth form of equation 10 gives for ω 11 ω c 1 p k x 2 h 2 1 2 k y 2 k x 2 1 q k x 2 h 2 k x where as indicated before c g h is the non dispersive shallow water wave celerity denoting c k p as the phase velocity vector of the generalized kp type equation and recalling the relationship between the frequency and velocity ω k c k p with k k x i k y j for directional waves the dispersion relationship given by equation 11 may be cast into the following form for the phase velocity vector c k p of the new kp type equation 12 c k p c 1 1 6 1 2 β k x 2 h 2 1 2 k y 2 k x 2 1 1 3 1 β k x 2 h 2 k x k 2 k use has been made of p 1 2 β 6 and q 1 β 3 as defined before the form of the dispersion relation corresponding to the unidirectional wave propagation in the x direction is considered for selecting the optimal β value for unidirectional waves θ 0 then k x k and k y 0 which renders the above dispersion relationship identical with the improved or generalized kdv equation presented in beji 2016 without repeating the arguments and analysis presented in detail in beji 2016 there are basically two prominent choices for β namely 1 20 or 0 if the dispersion relationship is to correspond to the fourth order padé approximation of the exact relationship β 1 20 is the choice on the other hand if the shoaling characteristics of the equation is to be in perfect agreement with the energy flux concept β 0 should be preferred simulations indicate negligible differences between the two choices while finite difference scheme is in general observed to be more robust for the choice of β 1 20 as the coefficient of η x x x x becomes somewhat smaller and thus increases the stability of the scheme besides these two choices different options are possible for instance one may prefer to improve the dispersion characteristics further hence seek a best fit to the exact dispersion curve within a preset k h range by adjusting β 3 numerical scheme finite difference schemes katsis and akylas 1987 feng and mitsui 1998 mekki and ali 2013 are preferable for practical applications therefore the improved kp equation is discretized by a crank nicolson type implicit formulation adapted from feng and mitsui 1998 while the present kp equation is substantially different from the one solved by feng and mitsui 1998 the finite difference formulation follows their scheme closely with the exception of the treatment of η y y term which is considered here in uncoupled manner with appreciable improvement in computational efficiency 3 1 finite difference representation of improved kp equation a crank nicolson type discretization of equation 10 renders the following finite difference formulation 13 d x η i j k 1 η i j k 2 δ t δ x c i j δ x 2 η i j k 1 η i j k 2 δ x 2 p c i j h i j 2 δ x 4 η i j k 1 η i j k 2 δ x 4 q h i j 2 d x δ x 2 η i j k 1 η i j k 2 δ t δ x 3 3 c 4 h δ x 2 f i j k 1 f i j k 2 δ x 2 3 c 4 h d x h i j 2 δ x d x η i j k 1 η i j k 4δ x r p c i j h i j d x h i j 2 δ x d x δ x 2 η i j k 1 η i j k 4δ x 3 s q h i j d x h i j 2 δ x δ x 2 η i j k 1 η i j k δ t δ x 2 1 2 c i j δ y 2 η i j k 1 η i j k 2 δ y 2 0 where the centered difference operators are defined as d x η i j k η i 1 j k η i 1 j k δ x 2 η i j k η i 1 j k 2 η i j k η i 1 j k d x δ x 2 η i j k η i 2 k 2 η i 1 j k 2 η i 1 j k η i 2 j k and δ x 4 η i j k η i 2 k 4 η i 1 j k 6 η i j k 4 η i 1 j k η i 2 j k with i and j denoting the indices multiplying the spacings δ x and δ y between the grid points in the x and y directions respectively δ y 2 η i j k is the y direction analogy of δ x 2 η i j k superscript k stands for the time level index and gives the actual time of simulation when multiplied by the time increment δ t note that both water depth and non dispersive celerity are spatially varying quantities and defined at each grid point the nonlinear function f i j k is defined as f i j k η i j k η i j k and the summation f i j k 1 f i j k is expressed in a semi linear form f i j k 1 f i j k 2 η i j k 1 η i j k as in feng and mitsui 1998 for carrying out the implicit formulation without necessity of iteration due to the nonlinear term the formal approximation procedure may be found in feng and mitsui 1998 the informal approach of expressing η i j k 1 η i j k 1 η i j k η i j k as 2 η i j k 1 η i j k may simply be attributed to the approximation that η i j k 1 η i j k 2 0 hence η i j k 1 η i j k 1 η i j k η i j k 2 η i j k 1 η i j k arranging equation 13 by placing the unknown new time level terms on the left and the known previous time level values and the complete η y y discretization on the right results in a penta diagonal matrix equation such a system of equations may be solved by four sweeps the first two sweeps for reducing the system to a tri diagonal matrix and the next two sweeps for solving the tri diagonal system in this process the new time level values contained in η y y on the right are treated as known in the first iteration by using only the old time level values and then introducing the new time level values in subsequent iterations indeed for numerical stability this is found to be quite essential the uncoupled treatment of η y y necessarily requires iteration during this iterative process the semi linearized form of the nonlinear term is avoided after the first iteration and the newly computed η i j k 1 values are used in subsequent iterations in the nonlinear term without resorting to the linearization process however such double treatment procedure showed negligible difference when compared with semi linearized treatment alone finally only three iterations are observed to be sufficient for quite satisfying accuracy for all the cases presented here 3 2 treatment of boundaries test cases and practical applications usually require an incoming boundary across which incident wave field is introduced and an outgoing boundary where waves are radiated away outside the computational domain lateral boundaries are taken as impermeable side walls with the so called mirror condition η y 0 which is relatively simpler to implement introduction of incoming waves at the first node of the domain is trivial the prescribed incident wave form is assigned numerically to the new time level surface elevation η 1 j k 1 of the first node at each time step normally the second and following nodes should be computed from the discretized wave equation wave equations with spatially second order derivatives result in tri diagonal matrix systems and pose no problem in this aspect however in the present case the presence of both third and fourth spatial derivatives gives rise to a penta diagonal system as indicated before this problem may be overcome either by one sided discretization of these higher order derivatives or by simplifying the wave equation itself by appropriate means one sided discretization showed numerical instabilities and was abandoned instead the unidirectional form of equation 10 in absence of 1 2 c η y y term has been simplified by the use of linear wave identity η x x k x 2 η only in the dispersion and shoaling terms so that the following equation equation 14 has been discretized for the second third and the last two nodes the last node requires a further care by backward differentiation of the second derivative 14 1 q k x 2 h 2 η x t c 1 p k x 2 h 2 η x x 3 c 4 h η 2 x x 3 c 4 h h x η x r p c k x 2 h h x η x s q k x 2 h h x η t 0 frequently a radiation boundary condition is implemented on the outgoing boundary such a condition being a further simplified form of the wave equation is used simply because the wave equation itself cannot be discretized appropriately at or near the last nodal point in this connection use of equation 6 or its variant as proposed by engquist and majda 1977 may be considered as a possible choice ideally it should be the wave equation itself propagating the waves out without any interruption pursuing such an idea for boussinesq equations and comparing the results with those obtained from the use of simple linear sommerfeld radiation condition kiyokawa et al 1996 showed the remarkable advantage of using only the wave equations in preventing artificially reflecting waves in the present case the simplified form of the wave equation as given by 14 with 1 2 c η y y term is deemed quite suitable 4 test cases four different tests are considered for exploring the capabilities of the newly derived kp type equation especially over uneven depths first a relatively short unidirectional wave propagation over a sinusoidally varying bottom topography is simulated by the bbm type kp with only the long wave shoaling term and by the improved kp with entire linear shoaling terms present both simulations are compared with the theoretical energy flux concept second similar to the experimental measurements of hammack et al 1989 genuinely two dimensional obliquely intersecting cnoidal waves are produced numerically by using experimentally realizable cnoidal wave parameters given in goring and raichlen 1980 third nonlinear refraction diffraction of waves over a converging zone for three different periods are simulated and corresponding harmonic amplitudes are compared with the measurements of whalin 1971 finally fourth the challenging case of wave propagation over obliquely shoaling bottom topography and obliquely situated elliptic shoal is simulated and wave height variations for definite sections are compared with the experimental measurements given in berkhoff et al 1982 computations for all the test cases were carried out by performing three iterations at every time step as numerical convergence tests with four or five iterations revealed no sensible difference in results 4 1 1 d linear waves over bathymetry applications in coastal zone demand in the first place good linear shoaling characteristics as waves mainly propagate over varying water depths taking linear wave propagation as the zeroth order contribution shoaling may be accounted as a first order effect and inaccuracies in its estimation cannot be compensated by any other mechanism for instance inclusion of high order nonlinear effects would not be justifiable at all while lacking the proper mechanism of linear shoaling particularly for a depth integrated wave model for which full description of highly nonlinear wave motions is barred by the underlying theoretical framework itself improving on nonlinearity would merely be superfluous furthermore as pointed out by stiassnie 2017 based on the work of bonnefoy et al 2016 weakly nonlinear theories are quite satisfactory to model nonlinearities hence inclusion of higher order nonlinearity is not needed in practical applications on the other hand prediction of wave heights is an essential engineering requirement that would improve much by a reliable shoaling model the present work thus places as much emphasis on the accuracy of linear shoaling prediction as on the accuracy of linear dispersion characteristics as a demonstration linear wave propagation over a sinusoidally varying depth is simulated similar simulations over varying bathymetry have been reported in the relevant literature e g madsen and sørensen 1992 simarro et al 2013 for testing the linear shoaling capabilities of wave models all these comparisons as in here reveal the accuracy of the proposed models for uneven depths the water depth is initially h 0 10 m reduces to h m h 0 2 5 m at mid length of channel and then increases to h 0 10 m again the wave period is t 8 s so that at the channel entrance and exit h 0 l 0 1 7 while at mid length of channel h m l m 1 10 both ratios indicating intermediate water waves in fig 1 the upper graph shows the performance of the bbm type kp equation corresponding to β 1 2 with only the kinematic or long wave shoaling term 3 c 4 h h x η x present but the dynamic shoaling terms absent r p 0 s q 0 the lower graph shows the same simulation for the present kp equation with β 1 20 and all the linear shoaling terms included the wave envelope is drawn according to the energy flux concept a 2 c g const with c g taken from the exact linear theory while the bbm type kp model which may be considered as the best available in literature overestimates the amplitude more than 30 in mid channel where the water depth is minimum the present model simulation agrees with the linear theory almost perfectly 4 2 2 d cnoidal waves experiments of goring and raichlen 1980 revealed that physically realizable permanent cnoidal waves exist only for definite h h h l and m values where h is the wave height h the water depth l the wavelength and m the elliptic parameter the wave form of h h 0 05 h l 0 05 m 1 0 215 cn2 from their laboratory experiments was selected for producing obliquely intersecting cnoidal waves in the manner of hammack et al 1989 the case is intended as a demonstration of the ability of the wave model to simulate nonlinear directional waves at the incident boundary along the y axis two separate cnoidal wave trains directed at angles θ and θ to the x axis were generated and superposed generation of a wave train with an angle to the x axis was realized by introducing a time phase lag of δ t l j δ y sin θ c in the argument of the cnoidal function at each y node j 0 m this method is exactly the same as the one used by hammack et al 1989 in their laboratory experiments here the directed wave angle was taken as θ 25 o and the directed wavelengths in the x and y directions respectively were l x l cos θ 4 4 m l y l sin θ 9 5 m with l 4 0 m being the wavelength of generating cnoidal wave the time and spatial resolutions used were δ t t 60 s δ x l x 88 m and δ y l y 22 m the computations were done for 12 wave periods allowing the wave field to develop fully in the entire computational domain the length of the computational domain was taken as 15 l 60 m and the width of the computational domain was set twice the wavelength in the y direction 2 l y 19 m fig 2 gives a perspective view for a region of 3 l x 2 l y at t 11 5 t 4 3 waves converging over topographical lens the third case considers waves converging over a bottom topography that acts as a focusing lens whalin 1971 the waves propagating over the topography converge along the mid section of the tank and grow in amplitude becoming nonlinear accordingly higher harmonics develop and evolve with propagation distance the experimental measurements capture these variations of the primary wave and harmonics the physical wave tank used in the experiments was 84 ft 25 6 m long and 20 ft 6 096 m wide in the middle part of the tank eleven semicircular steps were evenly spaced to form a topographical lens the equations describing the topography can be found in whalin 1971 experiments were carried out by generating regular waves with periods t 1 2 and 3 s primary wave and harmonic amplitudes along the centerline of the wave tank were measured at various stations for all three cases the simulations were performed with a span wise resolution δ y of 1 12 of the wave tank width for incident wave period t 1 s the incident wave amplitude is a 0 1 95 cm in water depth of h 0 0 4572 m the time step and the x direction resolution were respectively δ t t 50 s and δ x l m 50 m with l m 1 3 m denoting the mean wavelength computed as the average of the deep water h 0 1 5 ft 0 4572 m and shallow water h s 0 5 ft 0 1524 m wavelengths which are l 0 1 5 m and l s 1 1 m note that this case is very close to deep water conditions as h 0 l 0 1 3 fig 3 a compares the measured data and the computed results for the primary wave and the first harmonic amplitudes for t 1 s waves in fig 3b the case for t 2 s and a 0 0 75 cm is shown for the primary wave and two harmonics fig 3c gives the same comparisons for t 3 s and a 0 0 68 cm as for t 1 s case computations for the last two cases were carried out with δ t t 50 and δ x l m 50 in this connection it is worthwhile to mention the work of engsig karup et al 2009 which is based on a fully nonlinear potential flow model their simulations of whalin s 1971 experiments compare well with the data as in here while for the case of t 1 s the primary wave amplitude is predicted better than the present simulation this difference in accuracy is likely to be due to the restricted dispersive properties of the current model in deeper waters 4 4 waves over an elliptic shoal on a slope berkhoff et al 1982 compared different wave model predictions with measurements for a rather difficult case of wave propagation over obliquely shoaling bottom topography and obliquely oriented elliptic shoal making 20 o angle with incoming wavefronts the physical domain covered an area of 25 m 20 m the incident waves had the amplitude to depth ratio a 0 h 0 0 05155 and t 1 s period on h 0 0 45 m water depth resulting in h 0 l 0 1 3 4 a relative depth very near whalin s t 1 s period case the depth in the shallowest region over the shoal was reduced to very nearly h s 0 1 m the results given here were produced from a computation with δ t t 60 s δ x l m 60 m δ y w 80 m for actual duration of 31 wave periods here l m 1 2 m denotes the mean wavelength and w 20 m indicates the width of the experimental basin during the last two periods of computation the maxima and minima were determined at grid points along the measurement sections for obtaining the wave heights fig 4 shows the perspective view of the numerical wave tank after 31 periods of simulation the converged and diverged regions of wave forms and the cnoidal character of the waves in the shallow region near the end of the domain are notable features of the simulation comparisons with the experimental measurements are done for eight sections as given in berkhoff et al 1982 the first five sections section 1 5 are crosswise taken here as the y direction while the next three sections section 6 8 are lengthwise along the propagation direction the x direction fig 5 a e shows the transverse y direction sections zero denoting the mid section in x direction comparing the experimental measurements with numerical simulations fig 5f h make the same comparisons for the longitudinal sections the transverse sections are in better agreement with the measurements when compared with the longitudinal sections this is usually true for other reported numerical models as for instance panchang et al 1991 who show improved computations by using a nonlinear dispersion relationship in their essentially linear mild slope equation model likewise a numerical technique used in engsig karup 2014 for fully nonlinear potential model reveals excellent agreement for all the measurement sections of berkhoff et al 1982 here the linear nature of the kp equation in the y direction is likely to contribute to those observed discrepancies however this weakness alone may not be the only responsible element because disagreements are more prominent in the x direction sections shortcomings associated with nonlinear dispersion characteristics of the model are too likely to play a role in these discrepancies 5 concluding remarks a kadomtsev petviashvili type equation for uneven water depths is derived the new equation has improved linear dispersion and linear shoaling characteristics that extend its applicable range to virtually deep water waves quite challenging test cases are considered for checking the performance of the new equation against theoretical predictions and experimental measurements in particular linear dispersion and shoaling characteristics of the equation are quite satisfactory allowing accurate estimation of wave heights over varying depths ranging from relatively deep to very shallow depths the wave model may be used for accurate estimation of wave conditions in nearshore regions appendix the curve known as the witch of agnesi is defined in cartesian co ordinates as 1 y d x d 2 1 where d is a constant denoting the diameter of generating circle this curve was first studied by pierre de fermat in 1630 guido grandi who gave a construction of the curve in 1703 suggested the name versiera from the latin word vertere to turn later maria gaetana agnesi 1718 1799 a remarkable woman mathematician studied the same curve after translation of agnesi s book instituzioni analitiche into english the curve has become known as the witch of agnesi supposedly in the translation the term versiera used by grandi was mistaken for the italian word avversiera witch wavelike shape of the witch of agnesi suggests an analytical solution similar in form after trying a more general expression of the form a x c t n b where a b and n are parameters to be determined and c g h is the non dispersive celerity the following reduced form has been obtained for b 0 n 2 2 η x t a x c t 2 note that the form has a singularity at x c t singular solutions of this type for classic kdv equation have been treated in the literature boya 2004 byers and himonas 2004 but not for a generalized kdv equation in dimensional form as considered here 3 η t c η x p c h 2 η x x x q h 2 η x x t 3 c 4 h η 2 x 0 substituting equation 2 into equation 3 results in 4 2 a c x c t 3 c 2 a x c t 3 p c h 2 24 a x c t 5 q h 2 24 a c x c t 5 3 c 4 h 4 a 2 x c t 5 0 the first two terms cancel each other out the remaining terms are gathered together as 5 24 p h 2 24 q h 2 3 a h a c x c t 5 0 terms inside the square brackets are the dispersive and nonlinear terms which clearly show that if a permanent wave form is to be maintained they must be balanced equating these terms to zero requires a 8 p q h 3 recalling that p 1 2 β 6 and q 1 β 3 gives a 4 h 3 3 which is independent of β hence valid for any kind of kdv type equation the final form of the solution is then 6 η x t 4 h 3 x c t h 2 the kp equation in its directional form does not admit any such solution in an arbitrary direction due to its unsymmetric properties with respect to x and y directions however the combined form of the generalized boussinesq equation equation 7 for constant depth being symmetrical in both directions does admit a solution of the form regardless of the β value 7 η x y t 4 h 3 x cos θ y sin θ c t h 2 where θ is the angle the wave velocity vector makes with the x axis the above solutions though they satisfy the respective wave equations exactly have several peculiar aspects first the form is always a wave of depression remaining below the free surface second it travels at the non dispersive celerity c g h instead of a celerity which is a function of amplitude as is the case for nonlinear waves third it is obviously singular at x c t or x cos θ y sin θ c t with a trough reaching down theoretically to minus infinity or practically to bottom fourth the amplitude of wave if an amplitude can be attributed to this form may not be selected arbitrarily and is fixed according to the water depth therefore only a uniquely determined wave exists for a given depth fig 6 shows the wave form according to η x t 4 h 3 x c t h 2 the singularities at x c t values are truncated at 0 95 h it is unlikely that this analytical form has any physical meaning or producibility though it does satisfy the indicated wave equation exactly at best it could be interpreted as a mathematical peculiarity of kdv or combined boussinesq type equations of any kind 
23521,a kadomtsev petviashvili type equation with improved dispersion characteristics is derived for varying water depths linear shoaling characteristics of the equation for unidirectional waves are in accord with the principle of energy flux concept a finite difference scheme is devised to demonstrate the extended range of applications of the newly derived equation for a number of well known cases in addition a permanent wave form with singularity is shown to be an exact solution of the kdv or unidirectional kp equations the same form for an arbitrary direction satisfies the combined boussinesq equations of any type keywords kadomtsev petviashvili equation kortweg de vries equation improved dispersion improved shoaling nonlinearity uneven water depths 1 introduction kadomtsev and petviashvili 1970 derived a directional version of korteweg and de vries 1895 equation to study the stability of solitary waves since then the kadomtsev petviashvili equation or briefly the kp equation has found widespread application areas and its various forms have been derived in the context of water waves bryant 1982 studied obliquely intersecting permanent waves by deriving a set of nonlinear equations which could describe fully dispersive waves as well as weakly dispersive waves of the kp type depending on the choice of the coefficients hammack et al 1989 generated finite amplitude two dimensional shallow water waves in laboratory and mathematically described them by the exact solutions of the kp equation accurate representation of waves outside the validity range of the kp equation was indicated as a striking feature based on a crank nicolson type formulation feng and mitsui 1998 proposed an implicit finite difference scheme for numerical solutions of the original kdv and kp equations in the same vein mekki and ali 2013 employed a cranck nicolson discretization for the solution of a kp equation derived from the so called bbm equation of benjamin et al 1972 modeling of dust acoustic solitary wave in dusty plasmas by xue 2003 may also be mentioned as a rather unusual application of the kdv or kp equation the origin of the kp equation like that of the kdv equation may be traced back to the work of boussinesq 1872 the kdv equation is one dimensional boussinesq equation transformed to propagate unidirectional waves while the kp equation is directional form of the kdv equation the present work derives a kp type equation with relatively better dispersion characteristics based on a previous kdv type equation for varying depths beji 2016 the improved dispersion properties enable the new equation to propagate shorter waves quite accurately in comparison with the existing kp models which are basically restricted to long waves further the newly derived linear shoaling terms of the present equation ensure that for unidirectional waves the shoaling rate is in perfect accord with the energy flux concept numerical treatment of the new kp equation is done by a crank nicolson type finite difference formulation similar to feng and mitsui 1998 numerous test cases are carried out starting with examination of shoaling properties of the equation for varying bathymetry and continuing with simulations of truly two dimensional obliquely intersecting cnoidal waves as in the experiments of hammack et al 1989 then nonlinear refraction diffraction of waves over a converging zone as experimentally measured by whalin 1971 are simulated finally a rather difficult case of wave propagation over obliquely shoaling bottom topography with an obliquely situated elliptic shoal given by berkhoff et al 1982 is considered for comparisons with experimental results all these simulations show clearly that the kp type equation derived here is capable of simulating shoaling refraction and diffraction of relatively shorter linear and nonlinear waves with acceptable accuracy as rightly noticed by hammack et al 1989 the capabilities of the kp equation are not strictly restricted to weakly directional waves the extend of directionality encompassed by the kp equation is quite good but only slightly hindered by its linear non dispersive character in transverse direction finally a peculiar permanent wave form analytically satisfying kdv or unidirectional kp equation of any type as well as the combined form of boussinesq equations is obtained the solution being singular is deemed of secondary importance from the physical point of view hence placed in the appendix 2 kp type equation for uneven water depths before proceeding to the derivation of the improved kp equation the derivation of a non dispersive linear kp equation is considered briefly as a preliminary to the general case 2 1 kp type equation based on linear long wave model in order to outline the derivation procedure for the simplest case possible and at the same time to point out an interesting connection with the radiation boundary condition of engquist and majda 1977 first a kp like equation is derived from the linear long wave equations for constant depth the linearized shallow water equations are given by dingemans 1997 1 η t h u 0 2 u t g η 0 where u is the vertically averaged or mean horizontal velocity vector with components u v and η is the free surface displacement as measured from the still water level h is the water depth and g is the gravitational acceleration stands for two dimensional horizontal gradient operator with components x y while subscript t denotes partial differentiation with respect to time by cross differentiations the above equations may be combined into a single equation in terms of η 3 η t t c 2 η x x η y y 0 in which c g h is defined as the non dispersive phase celerity a co ordinate system moving in the positive x direction with the celerity c is now introduced so that wave form evolutions in this moving system are slow new spatial σ x c t and temporal τ ε t co ordinates are employed with the small parameter ε indicating the weak changes of wave form in time in the moving co ordinate system no approximation has been introduced for the y direction however the new co ordinate system moves at the celerity c only in the x direction which is the preferred direction of the propagation while directional waves would have a propagation velocity vector not necessarily in the x direction thus favoring a certain direction in σ τ transformation would result in an unsymmetric wave equation that is to say unlike equation 3 the transformed equation would not be the same when x and y are interchanged expressing the terms in equation 3 in the new co ordinate system gives 4 η t t c 2 η σ σ 2 c ε η σ τ η x x η σ σ where the term o ε 2 has been dropped as being higher order than intended to keep substituting the above expressions for the relevant terms in equation 3 while keeping the y direction term intact results in 5 2 c ε η σ τ c 2 η y y 0 going back to the original co ordinate system requires the inverse transformation ε η σ τ η x t c η x x which is substituted into equation 5 and the entire equation is divided by 2 c to obtain 6 η x t c η x x 1 2 c η y y 0 which may be viewed as the linearized shallow water version of the kp equation solving equation 3 for η x x and using it in equation 6 renders the second order radiation boundary condition η t t c η x t 1 2 c 2 η y y 0 in dimensional form for right going waves derived by engquist and majda 1977 for directional waves in this respect equation 6 suggests itself as a suitable boundary condition it has no missing terms compared to equation 3 but supports only those waves moving in the positive x direction in other words while only right going waves are permitted left going waves are not allowed and at the same time directional radiation of waves has not been compromised 2 2 kp type equation based on improved boussinesq model beji and nadaoka 1996 introduced the concept of partial replacement of dispersion terms to the boussinesq model of peregrine 1967 for varying water depths their improved model comprising continuity and momentum equations may be combined into a single nonlinear wave equation in terms of the surface displacement η by suitable approximations to obtain 7 η t t g h 2 η β 3 g h 3 2 2 η 1 β 3 h 2 2 η t t 3 2 g 2 η 2 g h η 2 β g h 2 h 2 η 1 β h h η t t in which only the terms containing the first spatial derivative of the depth are retained truncation of higher depth gradients corresponds to the mild slope assumption which is used throughout the present work wherever necessary the coefficient β is a non dimensional scalar controlling the dispersion characteristics of the equation while β 1 for 1 d results in the original derivation of boussinesq 1872 β 0 corresponds to the combined form of peregrine s 1967 equations setting β 1 5 results in an improved dispersion relationship which is in accord with the fourth order padé approximation of the linear theory dispersion relation in order to derive a kp type equation from equation 7 the x direction is taken as the main propagation direction with all the relevant terms while only non dispersive propagation in the y direction is retained as in equation 3 all the other y dependent terms namely the nonlinear dispersive and shoaling terms in the y direction are dropped such a truncation renders the propagation in the y direction linear and non dispersive and results in 8 η t t g h η x x η y y β 3 g h 3 η x x x x 1 β 3 h 2 η x x t t 3 2 g η 2 x x g h x η x 2 β g h 2 h x η x x x 1 β h h x η x t t with the exception of η y y term the derivation procedure of the kp type equation from equation 8 is completely identical with the derivation of the kdv type equation given in beji 2016 and therefore is not repeated here retaining η y y term throughout and refraining from the final spatial integration results in a generalized kp type equation for uneven depths 9 η t c η x p c h 2 η x x x q h 2 η x x t 3 c 4 h η 2 x c 4 h h x η r c h h x η x x s h h x η x t x 1 2 c η y y 0 where the non dimensional coefficients p 1 2 β 6 q 1 β 3 r 15 32 β 24 s 5 1 β 6 are employed for the sake of a simpler notation as introduced in beji 2016 performing the differentiation while noting that both h and c are spatially varying quantities gives another form of equation 9 10 η x t c η x x p c h 2 η x x x x q h 2 η x x x t 3 c 4 h η 2 x x 3 c 4 h h x η x r p c h h x η x x x s q h h x η x x t 1 2 c η y y 0 in which r p r 5 p 2 and s q s 2 q and the second derivatives of h are neglected the above kp type equation embodies all the known kp type equations as special cases for constant depth setting β 1 p 1 6 q 0 gives the original kp equation while β 1 2 p 0 q 1 6 gives the kp equation corresponding to the kdv model of benjamin et al 1972 the so called bbm model moreover the equation contains terms accounting for depth variations so that it can model changes in wave amplitude due to changes in water depth accuracy and consistency of shoaling characteristics of the unidirectional version that is to say the corresponding kdv equation has already been investigated analytically and shown that shoaling properties of the model equation are in exact agreement with those obtained from the constancy of energy flux beji 2016 in this connection it is worthwhile to remark that dingemans 1997 enumerates and presents derivations of various available kdv and kp type equations but none has the key shoaling terms derived above here these shoaling characteristics are exploited numerically for equation 10 and their importance for reliable simulations in coastal regions with varying bathymetry is demonstrated 2 3 dispersion relationship of improved kp equation dispersion characteristics of the generalized kp type equation are now examined let η a 0 exp i k x x k y y ω t with a 0 denoting the constant wave amplitude i the imaginary unit ω the circular wave frequency k x k cos θ and k y k sin θ the wave number components in the x and y directions respectively θ is the angle wave propagation direction makes with the x axis substituting η into the linearized constant depth form of equation 10 gives for ω 11 ω c 1 p k x 2 h 2 1 2 k y 2 k x 2 1 q k x 2 h 2 k x where as indicated before c g h is the non dispersive shallow water wave celerity denoting c k p as the phase velocity vector of the generalized kp type equation and recalling the relationship between the frequency and velocity ω k c k p with k k x i k y j for directional waves the dispersion relationship given by equation 11 may be cast into the following form for the phase velocity vector c k p of the new kp type equation 12 c k p c 1 1 6 1 2 β k x 2 h 2 1 2 k y 2 k x 2 1 1 3 1 β k x 2 h 2 k x k 2 k use has been made of p 1 2 β 6 and q 1 β 3 as defined before the form of the dispersion relation corresponding to the unidirectional wave propagation in the x direction is considered for selecting the optimal β value for unidirectional waves θ 0 then k x k and k y 0 which renders the above dispersion relationship identical with the improved or generalized kdv equation presented in beji 2016 without repeating the arguments and analysis presented in detail in beji 2016 there are basically two prominent choices for β namely 1 20 or 0 if the dispersion relationship is to correspond to the fourth order padé approximation of the exact relationship β 1 20 is the choice on the other hand if the shoaling characteristics of the equation is to be in perfect agreement with the energy flux concept β 0 should be preferred simulations indicate negligible differences between the two choices while finite difference scheme is in general observed to be more robust for the choice of β 1 20 as the coefficient of η x x x x becomes somewhat smaller and thus increases the stability of the scheme besides these two choices different options are possible for instance one may prefer to improve the dispersion characteristics further hence seek a best fit to the exact dispersion curve within a preset k h range by adjusting β 3 numerical scheme finite difference schemes katsis and akylas 1987 feng and mitsui 1998 mekki and ali 2013 are preferable for practical applications therefore the improved kp equation is discretized by a crank nicolson type implicit formulation adapted from feng and mitsui 1998 while the present kp equation is substantially different from the one solved by feng and mitsui 1998 the finite difference formulation follows their scheme closely with the exception of the treatment of η y y term which is considered here in uncoupled manner with appreciable improvement in computational efficiency 3 1 finite difference representation of improved kp equation a crank nicolson type discretization of equation 10 renders the following finite difference formulation 13 d x η i j k 1 η i j k 2 δ t δ x c i j δ x 2 η i j k 1 η i j k 2 δ x 2 p c i j h i j 2 δ x 4 η i j k 1 η i j k 2 δ x 4 q h i j 2 d x δ x 2 η i j k 1 η i j k 2 δ t δ x 3 3 c 4 h δ x 2 f i j k 1 f i j k 2 δ x 2 3 c 4 h d x h i j 2 δ x d x η i j k 1 η i j k 4δ x r p c i j h i j d x h i j 2 δ x d x δ x 2 η i j k 1 η i j k 4δ x 3 s q h i j d x h i j 2 δ x δ x 2 η i j k 1 η i j k δ t δ x 2 1 2 c i j δ y 2 η i j k 1 η i j k 2 δ y 2 0 where the centered difference operators are defined as d x η i j k η i 1 j k η i 1 j k δ x 2 η i j k η i 1 j k 2 η i j k η i 1 j k d x δ x 2 η i j k η i 2 k 2 η i 1 j k 2 η i 1 j k η i 2 j k and δ x 4 η i j k η i 2 k 4 η i 1 j k 6 η i j k 4 η i 1 j k η i 2 j k with i and j denoting the indices multiplying the spacings δ x and δ y between the grid points in the x and y directions respectively δ y 2 η i j k is the y direction analogy of δ x 2 η i j k superscript k stands for the time level index and gives the actual time of simulation when multiplied by the time increment δ t note that both water depth and non dispersive celerity are spatially varying quantities and defined at each grid point the nonlinear function f i j k is defined as f i j k η i j k η i j k and the summation f i j k 1 f i j k is expressed in a semi linear form f i j k 1 f i j k 2 η i j k 1 η i j k as in feng and mitsui 1998 for carrying out the implicit formulation without necessity of iteration due to the nonlinear term the formal approximation procedure may be found in feng and mitsui 1998 the informal approach of expressing η i j k 1 η i j k 1 η i j k η i j k as 2 η i j k 1 η i j k may simply be attributed to the approximation that η i j k 1 η i j k 2 0 hence η i j k 1 η i j k 1 η i j k η i j k 2 η i j k 1 η i j k arranging equation 13 by placing the unknown new time level terms on the left and the known previous time level values and the complete η y y discretization on the right results in a penta diagonal matrix equation such a system of equations may be solved by four sweeps the first two sweeps for reducing the system to a tri diagonal matrix and the next two sweeps for solving the tri diagonal system in this process the new time level values contained in η y y on the right are treated as known in the first iteration by using only the old time level values and then introducing the new time level values in subsequent iterations indeed for numerical stability this is found to be quite essential the uncoupled treatment of η y y necessarily requires iteration during this iterative process the semi linearized form of the nonlinear term is avoided after the first iteration and the newly computed η i j k 1 values are used in subsequent iterations in the nonlinear term without resorting to the linearization process however such double treatment procedure showed negligible difference when compared with semi linearized treatment alone finally only three iterations are observed to be sufficient for quite satisfying accuracy for all the cases presented here 3 2 treatment of boundaries test cases and practical applications usually require an incoming boundary across which incident wave field is introduced and an outgoing boundary where waves are radiated away outside the computational domain lateral boundaries are taken as impermeable side walls with the so called mirror condition η y 0 which is relatively simpler to implement introduction of incoming waves at the first node of the domain is trivial the prescribed incident wave form is assigned numerically to the new time level surface elevation η 1 j k 1 of the first node at each time step normally the second and following nodes should be computed from the discretized wave equation wave equations with spatially second order derivatives result in tri diagonal matrix systems and pose no problem in this aspect however in the present case the presence of both third and fourth spatial derivatives gives rise to a penta diagonal system as indicated before this problem may be overcome either by one sided discretization of these higher order derivatives or by simplifying the wave equation itself by appropriate means one sided discretization showed numerical instabilities and was abandoned instead the unidirectional form of equation 10 in absence of 1 2 c η y y term has been simplified by the use of linear wave identity η x x k x 2 η only in the dispersion and shoaling terms so that the following equation equation 14 has been discretized for the second third and the last two nodes the last node requires a further care by backward differentiation of the second derivative 14 1 q k x 2 h 2 η x t c 1 p k x 2 h 2 η x x 3 c 4 h η 2 x x 3 c 4 h h x η x r p c k x 2 h h x η x s q k x 2 h h x η t 0 frequently a radiation boundary condition is implemented on the outgoing boundary such a condition being a further simplified form of the wave equation is used simply because the wave equation itself cannot be discretized appropriately at or near the last nodal point in this connection use of equation 6 or its variant as proposed by engquist and majda 1977 may be considered as a possible choice ideally it should be the wave equation itself propagating the waves out without any interruption pursuing such an idea for boussinesq equations and comparing the results with those obtained from the use of simple linear sommerfeld radiation condition kiyokawa et al 1996 showed the remarkable advantage of using only the wave equations in preventing artificially reflecting waves in the present case the simplified form of the wave equation as given by 14 with 1 2 c η y y term is deemed quite suitable 4 test cases four different tests are considered for exploring the capabilities of the newly derived kp type equation especially over uneven depths first a relatively short unidirectional wave propagation over a sinusoidally varying bottom topography is simulated by the bbm type kp with only the long wave shoaling term and by the improved kp with entire linear shoaling terms present both simulations are compared with the theoretical energy flux concept second similar to the experimental measurements of hammack et al 1989 genuinely two dimensional obliquely intersecting cnoidal waves are produced numerically by using experimentally realizable cnoidal wave parameters given in goring and raichlen 1980 third nonlinear refraction diffraction of waves over a converging zone for three different periods are simulated and corresponding harmonic amplitudes are compared with the measurements of whalin 1971 finally fourth the challenging case of wave propagation over obliquely shoaling bottom topography and obliquely situated elliptic shoal is simulated and wave height variations for definite sections are compared with the experimental measurements given in berkhoff et al 1982 computations for all the test cases were carried out by performing three iterations at every time step as numerical convergence tests with four or five iterations revealed no sensible difference in results 4 1 1 d linear waves over bathymetry applications in coastal zone demand in the first place good linear shoaling characteristics as waves mainly propagate over varying water depths taking linear wave propagation as the zeroth order contribution shoaling may be accounted as a first order effect and inaccuracies in its estimation cannot be compensated by any other mechanism for instance inclusion of high order nonlinear effects would not be justifiable at all while lacking the proper mechanism of linear shoaling particularly for a depth integrated wave model for which full description of highly nonlinear wave motions is barred by the underlying theoretical framework itself improving on nonlinearity would merely be superfluous furthermore as pointed out by stiassnie 2017 based on the work of bonnefoy et al 2016 weakly nonlinear theories are quite satisfactory to model nonlinearities hence inclusion of higher order nonlinearity is not needed in practical applications on the other hand prediction of wave heights is an essential engineering requirement that would improve much by a reliable shoaling model the present work thus places as much emphasis on the accuracy of linear shoaling prediction as on the accuracy of linear dispersion characteristics as a demonstration linear wave propagation over a sinusoidally varying depth is simulated similar simulations over varying bathymetry have been reported in the relevant literature e g madsen and sørensen 1992 simarro et al 2013 for testing the linear shoaling capabilities of wave models all these comparisons as in here reveal the accuracy of the proposed models for uneven depths the water depth is initially h 0 10 m reduces to h m h 0 2 5 m at mid length of channel and then increases to h 0 10 m again the wave period is t 8 s so that at the channel entrance and exit h 0 l 0 1 7 while at mid length of channel h m l m 1 10 both ratios indicating intermediate water waves in fig 1 the upper graph shows the performance of the bbm type kp equation corresponding to β 1 2 with only the kinematic or long wave shoaling term 3 c 4 h h x η x present but the dynamic shoaling terms absent r p 0 s q 0 the lower graph shows the same simulation for the present kp equation with β 1 20 and all the linear shoaling terms included the wave envelope is drawn according to the energy flux concept a 2 c g const with c g taken from the exact linear theory while the bbm type kp model which may be considered as the best available in literature overestimates the amplitude more than 30 in mid channel where the water depth is minimum the present model simulation agrees with the linear theory almost perfectly 4 2 2 d cnoidal waves experiments of goring and raichlen 1980 revealed that physically realizable permanent cnoidal waves exist only for definite h h h l and m values where h is the wave height h the water depth l the wavelength and m the elliptic parameter the wave form of h h 0 05 h l 0 05 m 1 0 215 cn2 from their laboratory experiments was selected for producing obliquely intersecting cnoidal waves in the manner of hammack et al 1989 the case is intended as a demonstration of the ability of the wave model to simulate nonlinear directional waves at the incident boundary along the y axis two separate cnoidal wave trains directed at angles θ and θ to the x axis were generated and superposed generation of a wave train with an angle to the x axis was realized by introducing a time phase lag of δ t l j δ y sin θ c in the argument of the cnoidal function at each y node j 0 m this method is exactly the same as the one used by hammack et al 1989 in their laboratory experiments here the directed wave angle was taken as θ 25 o and the directed wavelengths in the x and y directions respectively were l x l cos θ 4 4 m l y l sin θ 9 5 m with l 4 0 m being the wavelength of generating cnoidal wave the time and spatial resolutions used were δ t t 60 s δ x l x 88 m and δ y l y 22 m the computations were done for 12 wave periods allowing the wave field to develop fully in the entire computational domain the length of the computational domain was taken as 15 l 60 m and the width of the computational domain was set twice the wavelength in the y direction 2 l y 19 m fig 2 gives a perspective view for a region of 3 l x 2 l y at t 11 5 t 4 3 waves converging over topographical lens the third case considers waves converging over a bottom topography that acts as a focusing lens whalin 1971 the waves propagating over the topography converge along the mid section of the tank and grow in amplitude becoming nonlinear accordingly higher harmonics develop and evolve with propagation distance the experimental measurements capture these variations of the primary wave and harmonics the physical wave tank used in the experiments was 84 ft 25 6 m long and 20 ft 6 096 m wide in the middle part of the tank eleven semicircular steps were evenly spaced to form a topographical lens the equations describing the topography can be found in whalin 1971 experiments were carried out by generating regular waves with periods t 1 2 and 3 s primary wave and harmonic amplitudes along the centerline of the wave tank were measured at various stations for all three cases the simulations were performed with a span wise resolution δ y of 1 12 of the wave tank width for incident wave period t 1 s the incident wave amplitude is a 0 1 95 cm in water depth of h 0 0 4572 m the time step and the x direction resolution were respectively δ t t 50 s and δ x l m 50 m with l m 1 3 m denoting the mean wavelength computed as the average of the deep water h 0 1 5 ft 0 4572 m and shallow water h s 0 5 ft 0 1524 m wavelengths which are l 0 1 5 m and l s 1 1 m note that this case is very close to deep water conditions as h 0 l 0 1 3 fig 3 a compares the measured data and the computed results for the primary wave and the first harmonic amplitudes for t 1 s waves in fig 3b the case for t 2 s and a 0 0 75 cm is shown for the primary wave and two harmonics fig 3c gives the same comparisons for t 3 s and a 0 0 68 cm as for t 1 s case computations for the last two cases were carried out with δ t t 50 and δ x l m 50 in this connection it is worthwhile to mention the work of engsig karup et al 2009 which is based on a fully nonlinear potential flow model their simulations of whalin s 1971 experiments compare well with the data as in here while for the case of t 1 s the primary wave amplitude is predicted better than the present simulation this difference in accuracy is likely to be due to the restricted dispersive properties of the current model in deeper waters 4 4 waves over an elliptic shoal on a slope berkhoff et al 1982 compared different wave model predictions with measurements for a rather difficult case of wave propagation over obliquely shoaling bottom topography and obliquely oriented elliptic shoal making 20 o angle with incoming wavefronts the physical domain covered an area of 25 m 20 m the incident waves had the amplitude to depth ratio a 0 h 0 0 05155 and t 1 s period on h 0 0 45 m water depth resulting in h 0 l 0 1 3 4 a relative depth very near whalin s t 1 s period case the depth in the shallowest region over the shoal was reduced to very nearly h s 0 1 m the results given here were produced from a computation with δ t t 60 s δ x l m 60 m δ y w 80 m for actual duration of 31 wave periods here l m 1 2 m denotes the mean wavelength and w 20 m indicates the width of the experimental basin during the last two periods of computation the maxima and minima were determined at grid points along the measurement sections for obtaining the wave heights fig 4 shows the perspective view of the numerical wave tank after 31 periods of simulation the converged and diverged regions of wave forms and the cnoidal character of the waves in the shallow region near the end of the domain are notable features of the simulation comparisons with the experimental measurements are done for eight sections as given in berkhoff et al 1982 the first five sections section 1 5 are crosswise taken here as the y direction while the next three sections section 6 8 are lengthwise along the propagation direction the x direction fig 5 a e shows the transverse y direction sections zero denoting the mid section in x direction comparing the experimental measurements with numerical simulations fig 5f h make the same comparisons for the longitudinal sections the transverse sections are in better agreement with the measurements when compared with the longitudinal sections this is usually true for other reported numerical models as for instance panchang et al 1991 who show improved computations by using a nonlinear dispersion relationship in their essentially linear mild slope equation model likewise a numerical technique used in engsig karup 2014 for fully nonlinear potential model reveals excellent agreement for all the measurement sections of berkhoff et al 1982 here the linear nature of the kp equation in the y direction is likely to contribute to those observed discrepancies however this weakness alone may not be the only responsible element because disagreements are more prominent in the x direction sections shortcomings associated with nonlinear dispersion characteristics of the model are too likely to play a role in these discrepancies 5 concluding remarks a kadomtsev petviashvili type equation for uneven water depths is derived the new equation has improved linear dispersion and linear shoaling characteristics that extend its applicable range to virtually deep water waves quite challenging test cases are considered for checking the performance of the new equation against theoretical predictions and experimental measurements in particular linear dispersion and shoaling characteristics of the equation are quite satisfactory allowing accurate estimation of wave heights over varying depths ranging from relatively deep to very shallow depths the wave model may be used for accurate estimation of wave conditions in nearshore regions appendix the curve known as the witch of agnesi is defined in cartesian co ordinates as 1 y d x d 2 1 where d is a constant denoting the diameter of generating circle this curve was first studied by pierre de fermat in 1630 guido grandi who gave a construction of the curve in 1703 suggested the name versiera from the latin word vertere to turn later maria gaetana agnesi 1718 1799 a remarkable woman mathematician studied the same curve after translation of agnesi s book instituzioni analitiche into english the curve has become known as the witch of agnesi supposedly in the translation the term versiera used by grandi was mistaken for the italian word avversiera witch wavelike shape of the witch of agnesi suggests an analytical solution similar in form after trying a more general expression of the form a x c t n b where a b and n are parameters to be determined and c g h is the non dispersive celerity the following reduced form has been obtained for b 0 n 2 2 η x t a x c t 2 note that the form has a singularity at x c t singular solutions of this type for classic kdv equation have been treated in the literature boya 2004 byers and himonas 2004 but not for a generalized kdv equation in dimensional form as considered here 3 η t c η x p c h 2 η x x x q h 2 η x x t 3 c 4 h η 2 x 0 substituting equation 2 into equation 3 results in 4 2 a c x c t 3 c 2 a x c t 3 p c h 2 24 a x c t 5 q h 2 24 a c x c t 5 3 c 4 h 4 a 2 x c t 5 0 the first two terms cancel each other out the remaining terms are gathered together as 5 24 p h 2 24 q h 2 3 a h a c x c t 5 0 terms inside the square brackets are the dispersive and nonlinear terms which clearly show that if a permanent wave form is to be maintained they must be balanced equating these terms to zero requires a 8 p q h 3 recalling that p 1 2 β 6 and q 1 β 3 gives a 4 h 3 3 which is independent of β hence valid for any kind of kdv type equation the final form of the solution is then 6 η x t 4 h 3 x c t h 2 the kp equation in its directional form does not admit any such solution in an arbitrary direction due to its unsymmetric properties with respect to x and y directions however the combined form of the generalized boussinesq equation equation 7 for constant depth being symmetrical in both directions does admit a solution of the form regardless of the β value 7 η x y t 4 h 3 x cos θ y sin θ c t h 2 where θ is the angle the wave velocity vector makes with the x axis the above solutions though they satisfy the respective wave equations exactly have several peculiar aspects first the form is always a wave of depression remaining below the free surface second it travels at the non dispersive celerity c g h instead of a celerity which is a function of amplitude as is the case for nonlinear waves third it is obviously singular at x c t or x cos θ y sin θ c t with a trough reaching down theoretically to minus infinity or practically to bottom fourth the amplitude of wave if an amplitude can be attributed to this form may not be selected arbitrarily and is fixed according to the water depth therefore only a uniquely determined wave exists for a given depth fig 6 shows the wave form according to η x t 4 h 3 x c t h 2 the singularities at x c t values are truncated at 0 95 h it is unlikely that this analytical form has any physical meaning or producibility though it does satisfy the indicated wave equation exactly at best it could be interpreted as a mathematical peculiarity of kdv or combined boussinesq type equations of any kind 
23522,experiments regarding vortex induced vibration viv on floating circular cylinders with low aspect ratio were carried out in a recirculation water channel the floating circular cylinders were elastically supported by a set of linear springs eight different aspect ratios were tested namely l d 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 75 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 these aspect ratios were selected to cover the aspect ratio range of the main offshore circular platforms such as spar and monocolumn the aim was to understand the vortex induced motions vim of such platforms due to this the cylinders were floating or m 1 the range of reynolds number covered 2800 re 55 400 the amplitude results showed a decrease in amplitude with decreasing aspect ratio in the in line and in the transverse directions the frequency results confirm a different behavior for cylinders with l d 0 5 in these cases the cylinder free end effects were predominant the resonant behavior was no longer observed for l d 0 2 the decrease in strouhal

transverse direction 1 introduction the vortex induced vibration viv phenomenon has long been studied and many works can be found in the literature among which bearman 1984 sarpkaya 2004 and williamson and govardhan 2004 2008 the majority of these studies focused on cylinders with one degree of freedom dof i e the cylinders vibrate only in the transverse direction of the incident flow recently the cylinders with 2dof have become an object of studies due to the offshore demand for example the riser systems connected to the offshore platforms these works regarded the high aspect ratio cylinders the high aspect ratio cylinders characteristic is that the submerged length is much longer than the characteristic diameter of the cylinder l d 13 where l d represents the aspect ratio value l is the immersed length of the cylinder and d is the respective characteristic diameter see for example jauvtis and williamson 2004 another demand of the offshore industry also raised the interest in the viv around floating cylinders with low aspect ratio 0 3 l d 6 0 and small mass ratio m 6 0 this specific subject was called vortex induced motions vim whose motivation has been the high velocity of the incident current on circular offshore platforms particularly cases of a spar 1 5 l d 6 0 see works by dijk et al 2003 and finn et al 2013 and monocolumn 0 2 l d 0 5 see work by gonçalves et al 2010 vim has also been studied on multi column platforms such as semi submersible and tension leg platforms tlp see works by gonçalves et al 2012c 2013b 2018 and liu et al 2016 2017 in these cases of platforms the columns can also be considered cylinders with low aspect ratio 1 0 l d 2 2 floating circular platforms present a large characteristic diameter associated with a large natural period of motions in the horizontal plane therefore these systems are subjected to vim that can directly affect the fatigue life of riser and mooring systems in this context our aim here is to understand with experiments in a circulating water channel the viv around floating circular cylinders m 1 0 with very low aspect ratio 0 2 l d 2 0 as a motivation for better understanding the vim of platforms the work tries to complete the studies previously conducted for the flow around a stationary cylinder with very low aspect ratio presented by gonçalves et al 2015 in the latter the particle image velocimetry piv measurements and the power spectrum density psd of forces showed different behavior for cylinders with l d 0 5 in which cases the free end effects were predominant even without von kármán street main characteristics around most of the span length of the cylinder in the range of 0 2 l d 0 5 the vortex shedding around it was capable of producing alternating forces in the transverse direction therefore alternating forces were not observed in the transverse direction for cylinders with l d 0 2 section 2 presents a background of vim phenomenon of offshore platforms as well as a background of viv of cylinders with low aspect ratio section 3 shows the experimental setup of the tests performed the analysis methodology of the tests is presented in section 4 section 5 presents the experimental results comprising nondimensional amplitudes for the 6dof and the frequencies in both transverse and in line direction additionally the psd of the motions is given for supporting the discussions and conclusions in the same chapter drag and lift forces and added mass coefficient are also discussed all the results are shown as a function of the reduced velocity v r u f 0 d where u represents the flow velocity and f 0 is the natural frequency in still water in the transverse direction finally section 6 presents the general conclusions and perspectives of the current work 2 background 2 1 vortex induced motion of offshore platforms the study of vim has become of utmost importance since offshore platforms were placed in the gulf of mexico usa where the strong loop currents triggered vigorous motions due to vortex shedding in this region spar platforms were a good solution to explore and to produce hydrocarbons at deep water levels however the cylindrical shape of this type of platform with a high level of current speeds is susceptible to synchronized vortex shedding that induces large motion of the order of its diameter dimension among the first experimental vim studies of spar platforms works by dijk et al 2003 and finn et al 2013 for example can be highlighted their purpose was to verify the influence of the hull geometry and appendages the maximum amplitudes in the transverse direction observed were around 70 of the characteristic diameter the typical aspect ratio of the spar platforms is around the range of 1 5 l d 6 0 the vim of monocolumn platforms showed to be important even considering their lower aspect ratio the typical aspect ratio of a monocolumn platform is around the range of 0 2 l d 0 5 the work by gonçalves et al 2010 observed transverse motion amplitudes around 100 of the characteristic diameter and significant coupled motion between in line and transverse motions characterized by eight shape trajectories recently the increase in the demand for the multi column platforms as a solution for exploring ultra deep water level oil fields demands a better understanding of the vim phenomenon in this kind of platforms the interaction of the vortex shedding surrounding each column promotes large amplitudes of vim around 40 of the characteristic diameter of the columns as shown among others by gonçalves et al 2012c 2013b 2018 and liu et al 2016 2017 the large amplitudes caused by vim combined with the periodic motion characteristics decrease the fatigue life of risers and mooring lines implying high costs for the platform project antony et al 2017 presented costs saving associated with improving vim prediction accuracy and highlighted the importance of quantifying the vim of floating offshore platforms this paper thus tries to help designers to understand the vim phenomenon fundamentally i e from basic viv tests of very low aspect ratio cylinders since vim is most studied for a particular platform hull which makes it difficult to extrapolate the results in a general way 2 2 vortex induced vibration of cylinders with low aspect ratio cylinders as commented before the viv studies of a cylinder with 2dof are more recent than 1dof ones in the offshore scenario cylinders with 2dof and small mass ratio m 6 are necessary since the largest number of cases is cylinder immersed in water particular attention has been given to long cylinders with m 2 5 this value is a typical value for risers pesce and fujarra 2000 presented 2dof viv results for long flexible cantilever bar with m 2 4 and l d 94 5 the results showed significant amplitudes in the transverse direction due to the presence of a 2t triple vortices formation around the cylinder later jauvtis and williamson 2004 proved the existence of the 2t structure due to the existence of 2dof and small mass ratio values in this work a rigid vertical cylinder supported by an elastic base with m 2 6 and l d 10 was studied the presence of an initial super upper and the lower branch were observed to be different as compared with m 6 later stappenbelt and lalji 2008 confirmed this behavior for a rigid vertical cylinder supported by an elastic base with m 2 4 and l d 8 other important studies for 2dof and small mass ratio can be cited such as blevins and coughran 2009 for a vertical rigid cylinder supported by an elastic base with m 2 6 and l d 17 8 freire and meneghini 2010 for a vertical rigid pivoted cylinder with m 2 8 and l d 21 9 and franzini et al 2013 for a vertical rigid cylinder supported by elastic base with m 2 6 and l d 13 0 in all the works cited about the viv on 2dof cylinders with small mass ratio transverse amplitudes were almost the same independently of the aspect ratio l d 8 and no free end effects were taken into account then in morse et al 2008 the free end effect was investigated by considering a rigid cylinder supported elastically with l d 8 and free to oscillate only in the transverse direction of the flow against expectation the transverse amplitudes of oscillation for the cylinder equipped with an endplate were no higher than those presented by the same cylinder without it the conclusion is that the free end effects are important in the viv of cylinders with l d 8 the presence of free end affected the lower branch behavior and kept the transverse amplitudes still significant for high reduced velocities and it is not possible to observe a sudden drop in the amplitudes studies on viv of low aspect ratio cylinders started due to the demand for floating offshore platforms characterized by low aspect ratio structures l d 6 another important characteristic of these units is the very small mass ratio typical floaters such as a spar monocolumn and the semisubmersible platforms have m 1 and tlp platforms have m 1 due to the presence of the tensioned tendons blevins and coughran 2009 also presented results for a cylinder with mass ratio value around one m 1 and l d 17 8 this result is crucial to compare the results from floating cylinders the results by blevins and coughran 2009 showed that the lower branch is not present for this mass ratio a behavior distinct of that presented in the cylinders with m 2 5 these previous works show the importance of understanding both effects the very low aspect ratio and floating cylinder mass ratio characteristic m 1 few studies are found in the literature studying the viv on cylinders with very low aspect ratio and small mass ratio the studies about 2dof viv of small mass ratio cylinders with high aspect ratio were cited in the previous paragraph the behavior of very low aspect ratio cylinders was further studied only for the flow around fixed cylinder cases mounted on a surface in these cases the cylinders do not pierce the free surface a review of the flow above the free end of a surface mounted finite height circular cylinder can be found in sumer 2013 the aspect ratio l d 2 was defined as the threshold value in which the three dimensional 3d structures around the cylinder free end become more important than the typical two dimensional 2d vortex structures along the vertical span of the cylinder as commented by some authors in the review the typical von kármán street cannot be determined and symmetric structures can be observed for l d 2 one of the goals here is to complement the results submitted by gonçalves et al 2015 hence experiments on the flow around stationary circular cylinders with very low aspect ratio piercing the water free surface were carried out eight different aspect ratios were tested 0 2 l d 2 0 no end plates were employed forces were measured using a six degree of freedom load cell and the strouhal number was inferred from the transverse force fluctuation frequency the range of reynolds number covered 10 000 re 50 000 the results showed a decrease in drag force coefficients with decreasing aspect ratio as well as a decrease in strouhal number with decreasing aspect ratio the piv measurements and the psd of forces showed different behavior for cylinders with l d 0 5 in which cases the free end effects were predominant even without von kármán street main characteristics around the length of the cylinder in the range of 0 2 l d 0 5 the vortex shedding around it was capable of producing alternating forces in the transverse direction therefore alternating forces were not observed in the transverse direction for cylinders with l d 0 2 the phenomenology around fixed cylinders can be used to better understand the behavior for 2dof recently fukuoka et al 2016 performed similar experiments to evaluate the effects of the free surface and end cell on flow around a finite circular cylinder with low aspect ratio and the results were similar as compared with the previous work cited for the aspect ratio teste 1 l d 4 fundamental viv experiments of floating circular cylinders became necessary since the previous vim tests of offshore platforms took into account the complex details of the hull such as strakes fairleads and other hydrodynamic appendages this modification in the cylinder geometry from a bare hull changed the vortex formation around the cylinders and the phenomenon could not be understood as a whole and it is specific for each particular platform sanchis et al 2008 experimented a floating cylinder with l d 6 and showed for a small range of reduced velocity tested 4 v r 8 amplitudes in the transverse direction around 100 of the characteristic diameter for the highest velocity tested wang et al 2009 aiming to understand the hard tank section of a spar platform performed viv tests on a floating cylinder with l d 2 4 for a range of 3 v r 7 the highest transverse amplitude was around 80 of the characteristic diameter for the highest reduced velocity tested recently fujiwara et al 2013 performed viv tests on a floating cylinder with l d 3 for a wide range of reduced velocities 2 v r 11 in these experiments the transverse amplitudes reached around 120 the characteristic diameter and the absence of the lower branch was observed in blevins and coughran 2009 the absence of the lower branch was also observed for a cylinder with l d 17 8 and m 1 additionally someya et al 2010 was the first work to draft a schematic of the structures around the free end of a cylinder with l d 5 undergoing viv the authors proposed that the 3d structures around the free end were tip vortex and they were those responsible for affecting the viv of cylinders with low aspect ratio the few results of viv of floating cylinders with low aspect ratio cited ranging 2 4 l d 6 did not show a great difference in amplitudes when compared with the high aspect ratio case for example our goal to fill this lack in the literature was motivated by the monocolumn platforms l d 0 4 it is possible to find some works in the literature about the viv of very low aspect ratio cylinders l d 2 0 for example gonçalves et al 2012b 2013a present a series of fundamental experiments on 2dof viv of circular cylinders with very low aspect ratio 0 3 l d 2 0 and small mass ratio values namely 1 00 2 62 and 4 36 conversely to what would be expected for cylinders with very low aspect ratio the results showed large motions in the transverse direction with maximum amplitudes around 150 of the characteristic diameter for cylinders with l d 2 despite being smaller when the aspect ratio is reduced the response amplitudes presented high values around 40 of the characteristic diameter in the in line direction the case of m 1 deserves more attention because it shows lower amplitude than the cases with the same aspect ratio and larger mass ratio this counter intuitive behavior seems to be related to the energy transferring process from the steady stream to the oscillatory hydro elastic system the case of m 1 was studied only for cylinders with l d 2 and l d 1 5 tests are still necessary for lower values of aspect ratio rahman thiagarajan 2015 and rahman et al 2016 performed experimental and numerical studies respectively on 1dof viv of low aspect ratio cylinders in the range of 0 5 l d 13 and mass ratio value m 1 6 the response amplitude was observed to decrease as the aspect ratio reduced the decrease in response amplitude was found to be accompanied by a reduction in the correlation length of vortex shedding the decreasing trend is also followed by the results measured for drag and lift force this is the same behavior pointed out by the previous works by gonçalves et al 2013a for 2dof cases complementing these works zhao and cheng 2014 performed cfd simulations for 1dof viv of a circular cylinder with 1 l d 20 and mass ratio m 2 to try to understand the 3d structures around the cylinder free end the vortices that were shed from the cylinder with low aspect ratio l d 2 and l d 1 were found to be generated from the cylinder free end and convected toward the top end of the cylinder by the up wash velocity the wake flow in a vibrating cylinder with l d 5 includes the vortex shedding flow at the top part of the cylinder and the end induced vortex shedding near the free end of the cylinder after this literature review it is possible to verify the importance of studying the viv of floating circular cylinders with very low aspect ratio a still little explored subject in the literature 3 experimental setup all the experiments were carried out in a recirculating water channel at the fluid dynamics research group laboratory ndf facility of the university of são paulo usp brazil the water channel has a test section 0 7 m wide 0 9 m deep and 7 5 m long the flow speed u is variable up to 0 4 m s allowing for tests with different values of reynolds number and reduced velocity with a turbulence intensity of less than 3 obtained from velocity and turbulence profiles measured with hot film anemometers by assi 2005 the floating cylinder was elastically supported by a set of four springs with the same stiffness parameter k 0 73 n m in a rectangular support with dimensions l q 1090 mm and w q 610 mm length and width respectively as can be seen in fig 1 and table 1 the springs were fixed in the model above 20 mm from the water line to prevent them from touching the water in any condition the vertical distance between the point where the springs were attached to the rectangular support and the point where the springs were fixed on the model was 100 mm therefore the spring angles were smaller than 10 due to these small angles the restoration of the system still can be considered linear in the range of the displacements of the tests performed the models were made of polyvinyl chloride pvc with external diameter d 125 mm the cylinder is free to move in the 6dof the motions were measured using an optical motion capture system qualisys details of the position of the camera can be seen in fig 2 due to the small volume of control measured during the tests the standard deviation error of measurements is lower than 0 1 mm eight different cylinders were built one for each aspect ratio tested namely l d 0 20 0 30 0 40 0 50 0 75 1 00 1 50 and 2 00 see fig 3 the loading condition was adjusted changing the ballast inside the models the water height of the channel was kept constant during the tests h 536 mm thus the distance between the cylinder free end and the bottom of the water channel h depending on the aspect ratio as can be seen in table 1 the blockage coefficient can be defined as β l d h w where h is the water height and w is the width of the water channel for all the cases the blockage coefficient was smaller than 8 as observed in table 1 the mass property vertical center of gravity position kg and metacentric height gm values are presented in table 2 the natural frequencies in still water in the in line and transverse direction were practically the same for each l d condition f 0 x f 0 y 0 97 due to this it is possible to consider f 0 x f 0 y f 0 the natural frequency in still water for the vertical direction roll pitch and yaw were also calculated from decay tests the damping coefficient in the transverse direction in still water was almost the same for all conditions ζ w 4 the structural damping was very low around ζ s 0 1 all these results are presented in table 3 forty velocity conditions were carried out for each aspect ratio the reduced velocity range performed was 2 v r 14 and the reynolds number range was 2 10 3 r e 6 10 4 which corresponds to current incidences of 0 02 u 0 45 m s the reduced velocity was calculated using the natural frequency in the still water in the transverse direction as v r u f 0 y d or v r u f 0 d as adopted the froude number of the tests was defined as a function of the flow velocity and the cylinder submerged length as fr l u g l as proposed by chaplin and teigen 2003 as can be seen in table 4 only a few cases have fr l 0 5 for the highest reduced velocities for these particular conditions l d 0 4 and high velocities the free surface effects are significant and can introduce more tridimensional effects in the flow but these effects could not be detached from the free end effects details about the conditions tested are presented in table 4 4 analysis methodology 4 1 characteristic amplitudes and frequencies the values of characteristic amplitudes for each degree of freedom as well as the characteristic frequencies were obtained employing the hilbert huang transform method hht as proposed by gonçalves et al 2012a the hht was developed in huang et al 1998 as an alternative to deal with non stationary signals that arise from non linear systems the characteristic amplitude was defined by taking the mean of the 10 largest amplitudes obtained in the hht it is important to highlight that in the hht there are instantaneous amplitudes of motion which makes the number of points to calculate the mean of the 10 largest amplitudes proportional to the length of data and consequently to the sampling frequency which implies a reduction in the statistic uncertainty on the other hand using the traditional 10 largest peak amplitudes there are few points to evaluate the statistics as compared to the hht the characteristic motion frequency was defined by taking the frequency related to the 10 largest amplitudes obtained in the hht the 6dof were measured during the tests the modal form factor as defined by blevins 1990 utilized was γ 1 to obtain the characteristic amplitudes due to the cylinder being considered a rigid body mounted on an elastic support in sum the modal form factor is a way of considering the characteristic of the natural vibration of the support structure allowing displacements in any location to be accurately compared to the translational movement of a rigid structure for instance a cylinder elastically supported this value will be significant in comparison with the results from the literature during the discussion of the results the psd results were evaluated using the fast fourier transform method fft and plotted in a color graph as a function of the reduced velocity 4 2 force coefficients the linear rigid body motion equations for a cylinder with two uncoupled dof in line and transverse direction are represented by the following equations proposed and discussed in sarpkaya 2004 as shown below 1 m s x t c x t k x x t f h x t 2 m s y t c y t k y y t f h y t where m s represents the cylinder mass c the structural damping coefficient of the system f h x and f h y are the total hydrodynamic forces acting on the system in the in line x and transverse y directions the structural damping ratio for the tests is ζ s 0 1 which allows neglecting the structural damping force component in these equations the structural forces are placed on the left side and the hydrodynamic forces which include added mass force component in phase with acceleration hydrodynamic damping force component in phase with velocity and other forces due to fluid are placed on the right side in the experiments the total hydrodynamic forces in each given direction are measured indirectly using these motion equations the total hydrodynamic force is the sum of the inertial dissipative and restoring forces of the system the restoring forces were derived from the position and stiffness values of each mooring spring then the force is decomposed in the in line and in the transverse direction the force in the transverse direction of the flow is commonly represented in the form of the nondimensional lift force coefficient c y as in 3 f h y t 1 2 ρ l d u 2 c y t 4 c y t 2 f h y t ρ l d u 2 where ρ is the fluid density the non time dependent lift force coefficient c y r m s was evaluated as the root mean square rms of the non dimensional force signal in the transverse direction the force in the in line direction to the flow is commonly represented in the form of the nondimensional drag force coefficient c x as in 5 f h x t 1 2 ρ a p u 2 c x t 6 c x t 2 f h x t ρ l d u 2 the force in the in line direction can be divided into two components one related to the average drag force static component and a second one related to the dynamic drag force oscillatory component thus the mean drag force can be described as c x and the non time dependent oscillatory drag force coefficient c x r m s can be evaluated as the rms of the non dimensional force signal in the in line direction 4 3 added mass coefficient considering as usual that the component of the total hydrodynamic force in phase with the acceleration is related to the added mass it is possible to evaluate the added mass coefficient at the characteristic frequency of the motion from a standard frequency domain analysis as proposed by fujarra and pesce 2002 for the motions in the transverse direction 7 m a y f y ℛ ℱ f h y ℱ y m d where ℛ is the real part of the complex number and ℱ is the fast fourier transform operator the same procedure is applied to the motions in the in line direction 5 experimental results the results from the experiments performed considering floating cylinders with very low aspect ratio are presented next comprising characteristic amplitudes and frequencies in all the 6dof as a function of the reduced velocity v r u f 0 d as well as the psd for supporting the discussions and conclusions additionally results of force coefficients and added mass are presented for the in line and transverse directions fig 4 and fig 5 respectively show the transverse a y γ d and in line a x γ d characteristic amplitudes for the case of m 1 and l d 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 75 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 in general the amplitudes decrease with decreasing aspect ratio the amplitude curves seem to shift to the right when the aspect ratio decreases this fact can be associated with the free end effects the characteristic amplitudes in the transverse direction a y γ d showed a distinct behavior for l d 0 75 see fig 4 in these cases it was possible to observe a growth in amplitudes with increasing v r but it is not possible to see the amplitude fall which is one characteristic of the lower branch in the cases of 0 5 l d 0 3 the results showed a decrease of amplitudes for v r 8 and an abrupt fall for v r 10 the latter behavior can characterize the lower branch on the other hand for l d 0 2 the amplitudes in the transverse direction did not exceed a y γ d 0 2 and there was no resonant behavior in this lowest aspect ratio the maximum amplitudes are similar to a y γ d 1 4 for 1 l d 2 the maximum values are a y γ d 1 1 for l d 0 75 moreover the maximum amplitudes vary around 0 6 a y γ d 0 8 with higher amplitudes for larger aspect ratio for 0 3 l d 0 5 the characteristic amplitudes in the in line direction a x γ d also showed a distinct behavior for l d 0 75 see fig 5 in these cases one first local maximum was found around v r 3 and it is possible to observe an abrupt growth for v r 5 with the maximum value around v r 7 in the cases of 0 2 l d 0 5 the results showed a linear increase of amplitudes for v r 6 and similar maximum values for this range of aspect ratio the maximum amplitudes are a x γ d 0 45 and a x γ d 0 25 for l d 2 and 0 2 l d 0 5 respectively the results of the ratio between the transverse motion frequency and the natural transverse frequency in still water f y f 0 presented in fig 6 showed the resonance behavior of the motion in the in line direction for 2 v r 4 and l d 1 this response is characterized by f y 0 5 f 0 and f x f 0 thus f x f y 2 0 a linear increase of f y f 0 as a function of v r occurred for v r 4 and l d 1 in this region it is possible to assume that the vortex shedding frequency is similar to the motion frequency in the transverse direction f s f y making it feasible to infer the strouhal number as the curve inclination yet a constant value of f y f 0 0 9 up to v r 7 for l d 0 75 was observed only after this reduced velocity did the linear increase of f y f 0 as a function of v r occur the strouhal like number can be evaluated considering the hypothesis that the frequency of the vortex shedding is similar to the frequency of the motion in the transverse direction in the synchronization range i e f s f y the strouhal like number was calculated as the inclination of the line in the graph of f y f 0 v r using linear fitting along the synchronization range the results of the strouhal like number for the cylinders with very low aspect ratio and 6dof are presented in fig 7 the present results were compared with the results from fixed tests performed in gonçalves et al 2015 viv of low aspect ratio cylinders with 2dof by gonçalves et al 2013a and results from cylinders with high aspect ratio the strouhal like number values s t was obtained from linear fitting with r 2 0 999 which showed a large linear agreement between the data in the synchronization range in the strouhal like number results in fig 7 the st was observed to decrease with the decrease of the aspect ratio for cylinders with 2dof in the range 1 5 l d 2 0 the same behavior occurred for the cylinders with 6dof in two different ranges namely 1 0 l d 2 0 and 0 3 l d 0 5 it is possible to conjecture that in the first range 1 0 l d 2 0 the von kármán was still present and it was governing the motion on the other hand in the second range 0 3 l d 0 5 the von kármán was not presented and the resonance motion was governed by the structures shedding around the cylinder free end all the values were lower than the values for the cylinders with high aspect ratio l d 13 the decrease in the strouhal number due to the decrease in the aspect ratio was also observed for the fixed tests as presented by okamoto and yagita 1973 sakamoto and arie 1983 fox and apelt 1993 norberg 1994 and gonçalves et al 2015 significant result highlighted for cylinders with high aspect ratio by leong and wei 2008 and stappenbelt and lalji 2008 is that the strouhal number verified for cylinders under viv s t 0 16 is lower than the one verified for the fixed cases s t 0 20 as presented in williamson and govardhan 2004 the same behavior was observed for the present results for cylinders with very low aspect ratio examining the last results presented together with the results of the ratio between in line and transverse motion frequencies f x f y see fig 8 the reduced velocity range in which the linear behavior of f y f 0 was observed seems to be the same as the couple between the motions in the in line and in the transverse direction occurred a region characterized by f x f y 2 for l d 0 5 it was possible to observe values of f x f y 0 5 in high values of reduced velocities these reduced velocities were the same as the abrupt fall of the amplitudes in the transverse direction confirming the existence of the lower branch and the loss of synchronism of the shedding frequency and the motion frequency of the cylinder the case of l d 0 2 was different because it did not present the coupled behavior f x f y 2 in any reduced velocity condition this result together with the amplitude results confirms that the typical viv behavior was not observed for l d 0 2 i e there was no vortex shedding capable of synchronizing the frequency of the cylinder motion and the structures formed around this aspect ratio were not capable of creating alternating forces and consequently motion in the cylinder the same behavior was observed for stationary cylinders with low aspect ratio presented in gonçalves et al 2015 in that work the value of l d 0 2 showed to be critical concerning alternating forces generation the psd results of the motions in the in line and in the transverse directions as a function of reduced velocities for each aspect ratio are presented in figs 9 14 to corroborate the statements made so far the psd results of the motions in the in line direction see figs 9 11 showed the region where the dominant in line frequency is defined this region is characterized by an inclined line when looking at the graph of f x f 0 as a function of v r and also by a line with constant value when looking at the graph of f x d u as a function of v r the range of these lines was observed to decrease with decreasing aspect ratio and this line did not exist for l d 0 2 for l d 0 5 a second region with considerable energy density was observed for v r 7 with lower dominant frequencies around f x f 0 0 4 the psd results of the motions in the transverse direction see figs 12 14 showed the region where the dominant transverse frequency is defined this region is also characterized by an inclined line practically with half the inclination verified in the in line direction when looking at the graph of f x f 0 as a function of v r and also by a line with constant value practically half that verified in the in line direction when looking at the graph of f x d u as a function of v r these values characterize the strouhal number for each aspect ratio condition assuming that the vortex shedding frequency is similar to the motion frequency in the transverse direction f s f y in the same way as the in line direction the range of these lines was observed to decrease with decreasing aspect ratio for l d 0 2 the positive inclination of the line was not found and the value was constant f y f 0 1 for l d 0 5 a previous region before the inclined line was observed where the value is constant f y f 0 1 which showed a different behavior when compared with the higher aspect ratios it is interesting to draw a parallel between the psd results of the cylinder free to oscillate with 6dof see figs 9 14 with the psd results of the stationary cylinder obtained by gonçalves et al 2015 in those results a different behavior was observed for stationary cylinders with l d 0 5 in those cases the cylinder free end was responsible for changing the structures shedding around the cylinder and these structures were responsible for the considerable energy density in lower frequencies in those cases the typical von karmán street was not verified for l d 0 2 alternating forces were not observed the same behaviors were verified and confirmed for the cylinders free to oscillate with 6dof showing the coherence between the results and confirming the statements made before the results of mean drag force coefficient c x and oscillatory drag force coefficient c x r m s are presented in fig 15 and fig 16 respectively the results of drag coefficient showed to be similar to that presented for characteristic amplitudes i e the drag force coefficient decreased with decreasing aspect ratio see fig 15 the mean drag force coefficient results allow observing the dynamic drag amplification behavior when f x f y 2 except for l d 0 2 the force characteristics were different for l d 0 2 the same behavior was presented by gonçalves et al 2015 for fixed cylinders and l d 0 2 due to the combined presence of free end and free surface effects the maximum values of mean drag coefficient reach c x 4 and c x 1 5 respectively for l d 2 0 and l d 0 5 the results of oscillatory drag force coefficient c x r m s showed high values in the region of in line resonance for v r 4 and l d 0 5 for l d 0 5 the c x r m s 0 2 is almost constant and lower than for the highest aspect ratio it is possible to see for these aspect ratios l d 0 5 that the in line amplitudes were also low the maximum values of oscillatory drag coefficient reach c x r m s 0 9 and c x r m s 0 3 respectively for l d 2 0 and l d 0 5 the results of lift force coefficient c y r m s are presented in fig 17 the results of lift force coefficient also decreased with decreasing aspect ratio for l d 1 00 it was possible to observe two local maxima the first one related to the in line resonance in v r 3 and the second one related to the beginning of the synchronization process between in line and transverse motions the results of lift force coefficient showed that the maximum value of c y r m s occurred at lower reduced velocity with increasing aspect ratio the maximum values of lift force coefficient reach c y r m s 1 4 and c y r m s 0 4 respectively for l d 2 0 and l d 0 5 the added mass results for the in line direction in fig 18 showed a decrease with increasing reduced velocity with an asymptotic value of m a x 1 the same behavior reported in jauvtis and williamson 2004 and in cunha et al 2006 the zero crossing occurred for all cases around v r 4 which confirms the resonance of the in line motion around this reduced velocity except for l d 0 2 in the latter case the viv behavior was not observed however the added mass results for the transverse direction fig 19 did not present the zero crossing regions confirming the absence of the lower branch for l d 0 5 and v r 14 in turn added mass results for high aspect ratio cylinders as in vikestad et al 2000 usually show a zero crossing where the lower branch appears and the resonant process is finished in fact for 0 2 l d 0 5 the curve crossed zero confirming the presence of lower branch for these cases besides pointing out the characteristic amplitudes in the transverse direction presented in fig 4 the characteristic amplitudes in the vertical direction a z d presented larger amplitudes for lower aspect ratio and also an increase in the amplitudes by increasing the reduced velocity see fig 20 the vertical amplitudes are related to wave generation on the free surface i e the vertical amplitudes depend on the froude number f r l however the vertical amplitudes are very low a z d 0 05 and their effects on the vim can be neglected the characteristic roll a r o l l and pitch a p i t c h motion amplitudes are presented in fig 21 and fig 22 respectively the roll motions were coupled directly to the motions in the transverse direction for v r 8 and coupled to the motion in the transverse direction and yaw motion for v r 8 as can be seen in fig 24 the yaw motion presented local minima around v r 8 for l d 0 5 and the yaw amplitudes increased suddenly after this reduced velocity it is interesting to note that the natural frequency of yaw motion was higher than the transverse one and the yaw could be resonant for larger reduced velocities but the reduced velocities tested were not enough to verify this behavior the maximum characteristic roll motion amplitude was a r o l l 5 for the cases with highest aspect ratio and the trend was a decrease in the roll motion amplitudes with a decrease in the aspect ratio see fig 21 moreover the maximum characteristic pitch amplitude was a p i t c h 2 5 see fig 22 the value for the maximum characteristic pitch amplitude was lower than the roll ones also seeing that the amplitudes in the in line direction were lower than the transverse one the trend was the same for the roll motion amplitudes except for the l d 0 2 in which the pitch motion amplitudes were higher than the higher aspect ratio cases this behavior can be attributed to the free surface effect in this case due to f r l 0 5 the mean pitch angle results are presented in fig 23 for all aspect ratio cases the mean pitch angle is similar and increased by increasing the reduced velocity distinct behavior occurred at the start of the lower branch region for 0 2 l d 0 5 a decline in the amplitude was verified in this region and the dynamic amplification of the drag ceased in fact results presented by franzini et al 2013 showed that angle values inferior to 10 do not substantially affect the viv response for cylinders with l d 13 therefore the effect of the inclination can be neglected for the low aspect ratio cylinders presented here the characteristic yaw motion amplitudes a y a w showed a large relation to the motions in the transverse direction see fig 24 for the cases l d 0 5 it is possible to observe local minima in the same reduced velocity as the maximum lift coefficient occurred and after this value increased in the yaw amplitudes a decrease in the yaw motion in the highest reduced velocities tested for these cases was not observed however a drop was verified in the yaw amplitudes for the l d 0 5 in the same region characterized by the lower branch in the motions in the transverse direction no yaw amplitudes higher than a y a w 0 5 were observed for l d 0 2 for the yaw motions as well as for the motions in the transverse direction it is possible to distinguish three different region behaviors namely 0 5 l d 2 0 0 2 l d 0 5 and l d 0 2 fig 25 presents an example of the time series for all the 6dof at v r 7 for one case in each distinct behavior region commented before namely l d 2 0 0 5 and 0 2 the couple between the different degrees of freedom is due to the elastically supported system applied to the experiments it is possible to observe at the moment that the cylinder promoted motions in the transverse direction the roll motion is coupled and in the same phase the same occurred for the motions in the in line direction and pitch motion the example time series shown in fig 25 helps to summarize the characteristic behavior for each region as for the range 0 5 l d 2 0 von kárman street main characteristic is predominant and the double frequency can be observed for motion in the in line direction when compared with the frequency for motion to the transverse direction for the 0 2 l d 0 5 even without von kármán street main characteristics around the majority span length of the cylinder the vortex shedding around it was capable of producing alternating forces in the transverse direction and no more double frequency in the motions in the in line direction is observed finally for l d 0 2 low amplitudes are found in the transverse and in line direction and the free surface effects play an important role increasing the motions in the vertical direction and pitch motions therefore the vortex structure are not enough to produce significant viv amplitudes the psd results for all the 6dof presented in fig 26 fig 27 and fig 28 for l d 2 0 0 5 and 0 2 respectively concerning frequency results corroborated the summary statement made before the couple between the motion in the transverse direction and roll as well as the couple between the motion in the in line direction and pitch can be highlighted i e each pair of the degree of freedom presented the same frequency behavior the results for l d 0 2 showed an absence of significant energy for most degrees of freedom however the increase of the energy for the motions in the vertical direction for low frequencies due to the increase in the free surface effects were also observed for this very low aspect ratio note that the vertical energy is not enough to change the viv behavior for the motions in the transverse and in the in line direction the analysis performed so far confirmed that the free end effects increase with decreasing aspect ratio mainly for 0 2 l d 0 5 in this range of aspect ratio the structures formed around the cylinder free end are the only ones responsible for the alternating forces in the transverse direction differently from the typical von kármán street presented for higher aspect ratios 6 literature comparison as detailed in the introduction section of this work few works in the literature are found about viv of circular cylinders with low aspect ratio and small mass ratio the goals of the present section are to compare the current results with the ones found in the literature and to show the consistency of our results fig 29 presents the literature comparison of the characteristic motion amplitude in the transverse direction for cylinders with the mass ratio of m 1 00 details about the works compared are presented in table 5 the first point to be detached is the difference between 1dof and 2dof results for l d 17 8 which confirms that the presence of the motions both in the in line and in the transverse direction directly impact the viv on the other hand 2dof and 6dof results l d 2 0 are similar and this difference of degrees of freedom does not play an important role the second one is the highest amplitudes occurring for l d 2 0 instead of the highest aspect ratio l d 17 8 as discussed in gonçalves et al 2013a 2015 and confirmed by the present work the low frequency forces due to the free end presence keep the synchronization for a longer time in the latter the results for 2 4 l d 17 8 are similar therefore the effect of the free end presence may not affect the viv behavior for l d 2 4 the amplitude results for l d 0 5 is the lowest due to the existence of the free end structures for this case instead of the typical von kármán street behavior for l d 0 5 as discussed in the experimental results section of this work fig 30 presents the literature comparison of the characteristic motion amplitude in the transverse direction for cylinders with the mass ratio of m 2 50 and 2dof details about the works compared are presented in table 6 the results for l d 17 8 confirmed the difference between 1dof and 2dof for m 2 50 also it is possible to observe the difference between the results for and m 2 50 statement discussed intensely in jauvtis and williamson 2004 for l d 10 and gonçalves et al 2013a for low aspect ratio cylinders even for m 2 50 the results for l d 2 0 presented higher amplitudes for v r 8 than cylinders with high aspect ratio cylinders the explanation for the absence of the lower branch for the v r 8 may be the presence of low frequency forces due to the free end presence as commented before as expected for the l d 0 5 the amplitudes are the lowest fig 31 presents the literature comparison of the characteristic motion amplitude in the transverse direction for cylinders with very low aspect ratio and small mass ratio details about the works compared are presented in table 7 only the work by rahman thiagarajan 2015 presented experimental results from viv of l d 2 0 the results cannot be compared directly with the results of the current work because of the difference between mass ratio and degrees of freedom yet the conclusion is similar the amplitudes in the transverse direction decrease when the aspect ratio decreases the literature review and comparison summed up the importance of having studied the floating cylinders with very low aspect ratio and have helped to fill this lack of studies 7 conclusion the present work was motivated by the vim studies on circular platforms particularly the case of the monocolumn platform 0 20 l d 0 50 it aimed to understand the viv around floating circular cylinders with very low aspect ratio hence viv experiments were carried out in a circulating water channel at ndf brazil eight different aspect ratio conditions were tested in all the conditions the cylinder was free to oscillate with 6dof and m 1 motions were acquired using an optical motion capture system results regarding motion amplitudes motion characteristic frequencies lift and drag forces and added mass were presented and discussed for each aspect ratio literature review and comparison were performed to corroborate the statements in this work regarding the motion amplitudes the characteristic amplitudes in both in line and transverse directions decreased with decreasing aspect ratio the results of drag and lift forces also showed the same behavior confirming the reduction in amplitudes with decreasing aspect ratio the same behavior was verified for the strouhal number assuming that f y f s on the other hand the added mass results helped to confirm the end of the resonant process when this value reached a value equal zero and also for motions in the transverse direction to confirm the lower branch behavior the motion amplitudes for the vertical direction roll pitch and yaw did not show to affect the viv behavior since the energy of these degrees of freedom was low and related to the couple with the motions in the in line and transverse direction distinct responses were observed regarding the possible source of the alternating forces analyzing the characteristic frequency results the first one for cylinders with 0 5 l d 2 00 in which the von kármán street is present together with the structures formed around the cylinder free end the second one for cylinders with 0 20 l d 0 50 in which only the vortex formed and shedding around the cylinder free end were responsible for the resonant behavior of the system and the last one for cylinders with l d 0 20 in which the vortex structures due to the cylinder free end were predominant but not capable of promoting a viv resonant behavior of the system thus the value l d 0 20 can be considered the critical aspect ratio value for the existence of viv on cylinders these conclusions are similar those obtained for stationary cylinders with low aspect ratio and presented in previous work by gonçalves et al 2013a these two works together can help to better understand the viv behavior of low aspect ratio cylinders future works can use cfd simulations to better visualize the structures formed around the cylinder free end and can further explain the phenomenon of flow around low aspect ratio cylinders acknowledgements the authors thank rodrigo s campos for his help in performing the tests the authors would also like to acknowledge the são paulo research foundation fapesp process number 2014 02043 1 and the brazilian national council for scientific and technological development

23522,experiments regarding vortex induced vibration viv on floating circular cylinders with low aspect ratio were carried out in a recirculation water channel the floating circular cylinders were elastically supported by a set of linear springs eight different aspect ratios were tested namely l d 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 75 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 these aspect ratios were selected to cover the aspect ratio range of the main offshore circular platforms such as spar and monocolumn the aim was to understand the vortex induced motions vim of such platforms due to this the cylinders were floating or m 1 the range of reynolds number covered 2800 re 55 400 the amplitude results showed a decrease in amplitude with decreasing aspect ratio in the in line and in the transverse directions the frequency results confirm a different behavior for cylinders with l d 0 5 in these cases the cylinder free end effects were predominant the resonant behavior was no longer observed for l d 0 2 the decrease in strouhal number with decreasing aspect ratio is also verified as well as for drag and lift forces the added mass results help to identify the end of resonance for both directions in line and transverse the

transverse direction 1 introduction the vortex induced vibration viv phenomenon has long been studied and many works can be found in the literature among which bearman 1984 sarpkaya 2004 and williamson and govardhan 2004 2008 the majority of these studies focused on cylinders with one degree of freedom dof i e the cylinders vibrate only in the transverse direction of the incident flow recently the cylinders with 2dof have become an object of studies due to the offshore demand for example the riser systems connected to the offshore platforms these works regarded the high aspect ratio cylinders the high aspect ratio cylinders characteristic is that the submerged length is much longer than the characteristic diameter of the cylinder l d 13 where l d represents the aspect ratio value l is the immersed length of the cylinder and d is the respective characteristic diameter see for example jauvtis and williamson 2004 another demand of the offshore industry also raised the interest in the viv around floating cylinders with low aspect ratio 0 3 l d 6 0 and small mass ratio m 6 0 this specific subject was called vortex induced motions vim whose motivation has been the high velocity of the incident current on circular offshore platforms particularly cases of a spar 1 5 l d 6 0 see works by dijk et al 2003 and finn et al 2013 and monocolumn 0 2 l d 0 5 see work by gonçalves et al 2010 vim has also been studied on multi column platforms such as semi submersible and tension leg platforms tlp see works by gonçalves et al 2012c 2013b 2018 and liu et al 2016 2017 in these cases of platforms the columns can also be considered cylinders with low aspect ratio 1 0 l d 2 2 floating circular platforms present a large characteristic diameter associated with a large natural period of motions in the horizontal plane therefore these systems are subjected to vim that can directly affect the fatigue life of riser and mooring systems in this context our aim here is to understand with experiments in a circulating water channel the viv around floating circular cylinders m 1 0 with very low aspect ratio 0 2 l d 2 0 as a motivation for better understanding the vim of platforms the work tries to complete the studies previously conducted for the flow around a stationary cylinder with very low aspect ratio presented by gonçalves et al 2015 in the latter the particle image velocimetry piv measurements and the power spectrum density psd of forces showed different behavior for cylinders with l d 0 5 in which cases the free end effects were predominant even without von kármán street main characteristics around most of the span length of the cylinder in the range of 0 2 l d 0 5 the vortex shedding around it was capable of producing alternating forces in the transverse direction therefore alternating forces were not observed in the transverse direction for cylinders with l d 0 2 section 2 presents a background of vim phenomenon of offshore platforms as well as a background of viv of cylinders with low aspect ratio section 3 shows the experimental setup of the tests performed the analysis methodology of the tests is presented in section 4 section 5 presents the experimental results comprising nondimensional amplitudes for the 6dof and the frequencies in both transverse and in line direction additionally the psd of the motions is given for supporting the discussions and conclusions in the same chapter drag and lift forces and added mass coefficient are also discussed all the results are shown as a function of the reduced velocity v r u f 0 d where u represents the flow velocity and f 0 is the natural frequency in still water in the transverse direction finally section 6 presents the general conclusions and perspectives of the current work 2 background 2 1 vortex induced motion of offshore platforms the study of vim has become of utmost importance since offshore platforms were placed in the gulf of mexico usa where the strong loop currents triggered vigorous motions due to vortex shedding in this region spar platforms were a good solution to explore and to produce hydrocarbons at deep water levels however the cylindrical shape of this type of platform with a high level of current speeds is susceptible to synchronized vortex shedding that induces large motion of the order of its diameter dimension among the first experimental vim studies of spar platforms works by dijk et al 2003 and finn et al 2013 for example can be highlighted their purpose was to verify the influence of the hull geometry and appendages the maximum amplitudes in the transverse direction observed were around 70 of the characteristic diameter the typical aspect ratio of the spar platforms is around the range of 1 5 l d 6 0 the vim of monocolumn platforms showed to be important even considering their lower aspect ratio the typical aspect ratio of a monocolumn platform is around the range of 0 2 l d 0 5 the work by gonçalves et al 2010 observed transverse motion amplitudes around 100 of the characteristic diameter and significant coupled motion between in line and transverse motions characterized by eight shape trajectories recently the increase in the demand for the multi column platforms as a solution for exploring ultra deep water level oil fields demands a better understanding of the vim phenomenon in this kind of platforms the interaction of the vortex shedding surrounding each column promotes large amplitudes of vim around 40 of the characteristic diameter of the columns as shown among others by gonçalves et al 2012c 2013b 2018 and liu et al 2016 2017 the large amplitudes caused by vim combined with the periodic motion characteristics decrease the fatigue life of risers and mooring lines implying high costs for the platform project antony et al 2017 presented costs saving associated with improving vim prediction accuracy and highlighted the importance of quantifying the vim of floating offshore platforms this paper thus tries to help designers to understand the vim phenomenon fundamentally i e from basic viv tests of very low aspect ratio cylinders since vim is most studied for a particular platform hull which makes it difficult to extrapolate the results in a general way 2 2 vortex induced vibration of cylinders with low aspect ratio cylinders as commented before the viv studies of a cylinder with 2dof are more recent than 1dof ones in the offshore scenario cylinders with 2dof and small mass ratio m 6 are necessary since the largest number of cases is cylinder immersed in water particular attention has been given to long cylinders with m 2 5 this value is a typical value for risers pesce and fujarra 2000 presented 2dof viv results for long flexible cantilever bar with m 2 4 and l d 94 5 the results showed significant amplitudes in the transverse direction due to the presence of a 2t triple vortices formation around the cylinder later jauvtis and williamson 2004 proved the existence of the 2t structure due to the existence of 2dof and small mass ratio values in this work a rigid vertical cylinder supported by an elastic base with m 2 6 and l d 10 was studied the presence of an initial super upper and the lower branch were observed to be different as compared with m 6 later stappenbelt and lalji 2008 confirmed this behavior for a rigid vertical cylinder supported by an elastic base with m 2 4 and l d 8 other important studies for 2dof and small mass ratio can be cited such as blevins and coughran 2009 for a vertical rigid cylinder supported by an elastic base with m 2 6 and l d 17 8 freire and meneghini 2010 for a vertical rigid pivoted cylinder with m 2 8 and l d 21 9 and franzini et al 2013 for a vertical rigid cylinder supported by elastic base with m 2 6 and l d 13 0 in all the works cited about the viv on 2dof cylinders with small mass ratio transverse amplitudes were almost the same independently of the aspect ratio l d 8 and no free end effects were taken into account then in morse et al 2008 the free end effect was investigated by considering a rigid cylinder supported elastically with l d 8 and free to oscillate only in the transverse direction of the flow against expectation the transverse amplitudes of oscillation for the cylinder equipped with an endplate were no higher than those presented by the same cylinder without it the conclusion is that the free end effects are important in the viv of cylinders with l d 8 the presence of free end affected the lower branch behavior and kept the transverse amplitudes still significant for high reduced velocities and it is not possible to observe a sudden drop in the amplitudes studies on viv of low aspect ratio cylinders started due to the demand for floating offshore platforms characterized by low aspect ratio structures l d 6 another important characteristic of these units is the very small mass ratio typical floaters such as a spar monocolumn and the semisubmersible platforms have m 1 and tlp platforms have m 1 due to the presence of the tensioned tendons blevins and coughran 2009 also presented results for a cylinder with mass ratio value around one m 1 and l d 17 8 this result is crucial to compare the results from floating cylinders the results by blevins and coughran 2009 showed that the lower branch is not present for this mass ratio a behavior distinct of that presented in the cylinders with m 2 5 these previous works show the importance of understanding both effects the very low aspect ratio and floating cylinder mass ratio characteristic m 1 few studies are found in the literature studying the viv on cylinders with very low aspect ratio and small mass ratio the studies about 2dof viv of small mass ratio cylinders with high aspect ratio were cited in the previous paragraph the behavior of very low aspect ratio cylinders was further studied only for the flow around fixed cylinder cases mounted on a surface in these cases the cylinders do not pierce the free surface a review of the flow above the free end of a surface mounted finite height circular cylinder can be found in sumer 2013 the aspect ratio l d 2 was defined as the threshold value in which the three dimensional 3d structures around the cylinder free end become more important than the typical two dimensional 2d vortex structures along the vertical span of the cylinder as commented by some authors in the review the typical von kármán street cannot be determined and symmetric structures can be observed for l d 2 one of the goals here is to complement the results submitted by gonçalves et al 2015 hence experiments on the flow around stationary circular cylinders with very low aspect ratio piercing the water free surface were carried out eight different aspect ratios were tested 0 2 l d 2 0 no end plates were employed forces were measured using a six degree of freedom load cell and the strouhal number was inferred from the transverse force fluctuation frequency the range of reynolds number covered 10 000 re 50 000 the results showed a decrease in drag force coefficients with decreasing aspect ratio as well as a decrease in strouhal number with decreasing aspect ratio the piv measurements and the psd of forces showed different behavior for cylinders with l d 0 5 in which cases the free end effects were predominant even without von kármán street main characteristics around the length of the cylinder in the range of 0 2 l d 0 5 the vortex shedding around it was capable of producing alternating forces in the transverse direction therefore alternating forces were not observed in the transverse direction for cylinders with l d 0 2 the phenomenology around fixed cylinders can be used to better understand the behavior for 2dof recently fukuoka et al 2016 performed similar experiments to evaluate the effects of the free surface and end cell on flow around a finite circular cylinder with low aspect ratio and the results were similar as compared with the previous work cited for the aspect ratio teste 1 l d 4 fundamental viv experiments of floating circular cylinders became necessary since the previous vim tests of offshore platforms took into account the complex details of the hull such as strakes fairleads and other hydrodynamic appendages this modification in the cylinder geometry from a bare hull changed the vortex formation around the cylinders and the phenomenon could not be understood as a whole and it is specific for each particular platform sanchis et al 2008 experimented a floating cylinder with l d 6 and showed for a small range of reduced velocity tested 4 v r 8 amplitudes in the transverse direction around 100 of the characteristic diameter for the highest velocity tested wang et al 2009 aiming to understand the hard tank section of a spar platform performed viv tests on a floating cylinder with l d 2 4 for a range of 3 v r 7 the highest transverse amplitude was around 80 of the characteristic diameter for the highest reduced velocity tested recently fujiwara et al 2013 performed viv tests on a floating cylinder with l d 3 for a wide range of reduced velocities 2 v r 11 in these experiments the transverse amplitudes reached around 120 the characteristic diameter and the absence of the lower branch was observed in blevins and coughran 2009 the absence of the lower branch was also observed for a cylinder with l d 17 8 and m 1 additionally someya et al 2010 was the first work to draft a schematic of the structures around the free end of a cylinder with l d 5 undergoing viv the authors proposed that the 3d structures around the free end were tip vortex and they were those responsible for affecting the viv of cylinders with low aspect ratio the few results of viv of floating cylinders with low aspect ratio cited ranging 2 4 l d 6 did not show a great difference in amplitudes when compared with the high aspect ratio case for example our goal to fill this lack in the literature was motivated by the monocolumn platforms l d 0 4 it is possible to find some works in the literature about the viv of very low aspect ratio cylinders l d 2 0 for example gonçalves et al 2012b 2013a present a series of fundamental experiments on 2dof viv of circular cylinders with very low aspect ratio 0 3 l d 2 0 and small mass ratio values namely 1 00 2 62 and 4 36 conversely to what would be expected for cylinders with very low aspect ratio the results showed large motions in the transverse direction with maximum amplitudes around 150 of the characteristic diameter for cylinders with l d 2 despite being smaller when the aspect ratio is reduced the response amplitudes presented high values around 40 of the characteristic diameter in the in line direction the case of m 1 deserves more attention because it shows lower amplitude than the cases with the same aspect ratio and larger mass ratio this counter intuitive behavior seems to be related to the energy transferring process from the steady stream to the oscillatory hydro elastic system the case of m 1 was studied only for cylinders with l d 2 and l d 1 5 tests are still necessary for lower values of aspect ratio rahman thiagarajan 2015 and rahman et al 2016 performed experimental and numerical studies respectively on 1dof viv of low aspect ratio cylinders in the range of 0 5 l d 13 and mass ratio value m 1 6 the response amplitude was observed to decrease as the aspect ratio reduced the decrease in response amplitude was found to be accompanied by a reduction in the correlation length of vortex shedding the decreasing trend is also followed by the results measured for drag and lift force this is the same behavior pointed out by the previous works by gonçalves et al 2013a for 2dof cases complementing these works zhao and cheng 2014 performed cfd simulations for 1dof viv of a circular cylinder with 1 l d 20 and mass ratio m 2 to try to understand the 3d structures around the cylinder free end the vortices that were shed from the cylinder with low aspect ratio l d 2 and l d 1 were found to be generated from the cylinder free end and convected toward the top end of the cylinder by the up wash velocity the wake flow in a vibrating cylinder with l d 5 includes the vortex shedding flow at the top part of the cylinder and the end induced vortex shedding near the free end of the cylinder after this literature review it is possible to verify the importance of studying the viv of floating circular cylinders with very low aspect ratio a still little explored subject in the literature 3 experimental setup all the experiments were carried out in a recirculating water channel at the fluid dynamics research group laboratory ndf facility of the university of são paulo usp brazil the water channel has a test section 0 7 m wide 0 9 m deep and 7 5 m long the flow speed u is variable up to 0 4 m s allowing for tests with different values of reynolds number and reduced velocity with a turbulence intensity of less than 3 obtained from velocity and turbulence profiles measured with hot film anemometers by assi 2005 the floating cylinder was elastically supported by a set of four springs with the same stiffness parameter k 0 73 n m in a rectangular support with dimensions l q 1090 mm and w q 610 mm length and width respectively as can be seen in fig 1 and table 1 the springs were fixed in the model above 20 mm from the water line to prevent them from touching the water in any condition the vertical distance between the point where the springs were attached to the rectangular support and the point where the springs were fixed on the model was 100 mm therefore the spring angles were smaller than 10 due to these small angles the restoration of the system still can be considered linear in the range of the displacements of the tests performed the models were made of polyvinyl chloride pvc with external diameter d 125 mm the cylinder is free to move in the 6dof the motions were measured using an optical motion capture system qualisys details of the position of the camera can be seen in fig 2 due to the small volume of control measured during the tests the standard deviation error of measurements is lower than 0 1 mm eight different cylinders were built one for each aspect ratio tested namely l d 0 20 0 30 0 40 0 50 0 75 1 00 1 50 and 2 00 see fig 3 the loading condition was adjusted changing the ballast inside the models the water height of the channel was kept constant during the tests h 536 mm thus the distance between the cylinder free end and the bottom of the water channel h depending on the aspect ratio as can be seen in table 1 the blockage coefficient can be defined as β l d h w where h is the water height and w is the width of the water channel for all the cases the blockage coefficient was smaller than 8 as observed in table 1 the mass property vertical center of gravity position kg and metacentric height gm values are presented in table 2 the natural frequencies in still water in the in line and transverse direction were practically the same for each l d condition f 0 x f 0 y 0 97 due to this it is possible to consider f 0 x f 0 y f 0 the natural frequency in still water for the vertical direction roll pitch and yaw were also calculated from decay tests the damping coefficient in the transverse direction in still water was almost the same for all conditions ζ w 4 the structural damping was very low around ζ s 0 1 all these results are presented in table 3 forty velocity conditions were carried out for each aspect ratio the reduced velocity range performed was 2 v r 14 and the reynolds number range was 2 10 3 r e 6 10 4 which corresponds to current incidences of 0 02 u 0 45 m s the reduced velocity was calculated using the natural frequency in the still water in the transverse direction as v r u f 0 y d or v r u f 0 d as adopted the froude number of the tests was defined as a function of the flow velocity and the cylinder submerged length as fr l u g l as proposed by chaplin and teigen 2003 as can be seen in table 4 only a few cases have fr l 0 5 for the highest reduced velocities for these particular conditions l d 0 4 and high velocities the free surface effects are significant and can introduce more tridimensional effects in the flow but these effects could not be detached from the free end effects details about the conditions tested are presented in table 4 4 analysis methodology 4 1 characteristic amplitudes and frequencies the values of characteristic amplitudes for each degree of freedom as well as the characteristic frequencies were obtained employing the hilbert huang transform method hht as proposed by gonçalves et al 2012a the hht was developed in huang et al 1998 as an alternative to deal with non stationary signals that arise from non linear systems the characteristic amplitude was defined by taking the mean of the 10 largest amplitudes obtained in the hht it is important to highlight that in the hht there are instantaneous amplitudes of motion which makes the number of points to calculate the mean of the 10 largest amplitudes proportional to the length of data and consequently to the sampling frequency which implies a reduction in the statistic uncertainty on the other hand using the traditional 10 largest peak amplitudes there are few points to evaluate the statistics as compared to the hht the characteristic motion frequency was defined by taking the frequency related to the 10 largest amplitudes obtained in the hht the 6dof were measured during the tests the modal form factor as defined by blevins 1990 utilized was γ 1 to obtain the characteristic amplitudes due to the cylinder being considered a rigid body mounted on an elastic support in sum the modal form factor is a way of considering the characteristic of the natural vibration of the support structure allowing displacements in any location to be accurately compared to the translational movement of a rigid structure for instance a cylinder elastically supported this value will be significant in comparison with the results from the literature during the discussion of the results the psd results were evaluated using the fast fourier transform method fft and plotted in a color graph as a function of the reduced velocity 4 2 force coefficients the linear rigid body motion equations for a cylinder with two uncoupled dof in line and transverse direction are represented by the following equations proposed and discussed in sarpkaya 2004 as shown below 1 m s x t c x t k x x t f h x t 2 m s y t c y t k y y t f h y t where m s represents the cylinder mass c the structural damping coefficient of the system f h x and f h y are the total hydrodynamic forces acting on the system in the in line x and transverse y directions the structural damping ratio for the tests is ζ s 0 1 which allows neglecting the structural damping force component in these equations the structural forces are placed on the left side and the hydrodynamic forces which include added mass force component in phase with acceleration hydrodynamic damping force component in phase with velocity and other forces due to fluid are placed on the right side in the experiments the total hydrodynamic forces in each given direction are measured indirectly using these motion equations the total hydrodynamic force is the sum of the inertial dissipative and restoring forces of the system the restoring forces were derived from the position and stiffness values of each mooring spring then the force is decomposed in the in line and in the transverse direction the force in the transverse direction of the flow is commonly represented in the form of the nondimensional lift force coefficient c y as in 3 f h y t 1 2 ρ l d u 2 c y t 4 c y t 2 f h y t ρ l d u 2 where ρ is the fluid density the non time dependent lift force coefficient c y r m s was evaluated as the root mean square rms of the non dimensional force signal in the transverse direction the force in the in line direction to the flow is commonly represented in the form of the nondimensional drag force coefficient c x as in 5 f h x t 1 2 ρ a p u 2 c x t 6 c x t 2 f h x t ρ l d u 2 the force in the in line direction can be divided into two components one related to the average drag force static component and a second one related to the dynamic drag force oscillatory component thus the mean drag force can be described as c x and the non time dependent oscillatory drag force coefficient c x r m s can be evaluated as the rms of the non dimensional force signal in the in line direction 4 3 added mass coefficient considering as usual that the component of the total hydrodynamic force in phase with the acceleration is related to the added mass it is possible to evaluate the added mass coefficient at the characteristic frequency of the motion from a standard frequency domain analysis as proposed by fujarra and pesce 2002 for the motions in the transverse direction 7 m a y f y ℛ ℱ f h y ℱ y m d where ℛ is the real part of the complex number and ℱ is the fast fourier transform operator the same procedure is applied to the motions in the in line direction 5 experimental results the results from the experiments performed considering floating cylinders with very low aspect ratio are presented next comprising characteristic amplitudes and frequencies in all the 6dof as a function of the reduced velocity v r u f 0 d as well as the psd for supporting the discussions and conclusions additionally results of force coefficients and added mass are presented for the in line and transverse directions fig 4 and fig 5 respectively show the transverse a y γ d and in line a x γ d characteristic amplitudes for the case of m 1 and l d 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 75 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 in general the amplitudes decrease with decreasing aspect ratio the amplitude curves seem to shift to the right when the aspect ratio decreases this fact can be associated with the free end effects the characteristic amplitudes in the transverse direction a y γ d showed a distinct behavior for l d 0 75 see fig 4 in these cases it was possible to observe a growth in amplitudes with increasing v r but it is not possible to see the amplitude fall which is one characteristic of the lower branch in the cases of 0 5 l d 0 3 the results showed a decrease of amplitudes for v r 8 and an abrupt fall for v r 10 the latter behavior can characterize the lower branch on the other hand for l d 0 2 the amplitudes in the transverse direction did not exceed a y γ d 0 2 and there was no resonant behavior in this lowest aspect ratio the maximum amplitudes are similar to a y γ d 1 4 for 1 l d 2 the maximum values are a y γ d 1 1 for l d 0 75 moreover the maximum amplitudes vary around 0 6 a y γ d 0 8 with higher amplitudes for larger aspect ratio for 0 3 l d 0 5 the characteristic amplitudes in the in line direction a x γ d also showed a distinct behavior for l d 0 75 see fig 5 in these cases one first local maximum was found around v r 3 and it is possible to observe an abrupt growth for v r 5 with the maximum value around v r 7 in the cases of 0 2 l d 0 5 the results showed a linear increase of amplitudes for v r 6 and similar maximum values for this range of aspect ratio the maximum amplitudes are a x γ d 0 45 and a x γ d 0 25 for l d 2 and 0 2 l d 0 5 respectively the results of the ratio between the transverse motion frequency and the natural transverse frequency in still water f y f 0 presented in fig 6 showed the resonance behavior of the motion in the in line direction for 2 v r 4 and l d 1 this response is characterized by f y 0 5 f 0 and f x f 0 thus f x f y 2 0 a linear increase of f y f 0 as a function of v r occurred for v r 4 and l d 1 in this region it is possible to assume that the vortex shedding frequency is similar to the motion frequency in the transverse direction f s f y making it feasible to infer the strouhal number as the curve inclination yet a constant value of f y f 0 0 9 up to v r 7 for l d 0 75 was observed only after this reduced velocity did the linear increase of f y f 0 as a function of v r occur the strouhal like number can be evaluated considering the hypothesis that the frequency of the vortex shedding is similar to the frequency of the motion in the transverse direction in the synchronization range i e f s f y the strouhal like number was calculated as the inclination of the line in the graph of f y f 0 v r using linear fitting along the synchronization range the results of the strouhal like number for the cylinders with very low aspect ratio and 6dof are presented in fig 7 the present results were compared with the results from fixed tests performed in gonçalves et al 2015 viv of low aspect ratio cylinders with 2dof by gonçalves et al 2013a and results from cylinders with high aspect ratio the strouhal like number values s t was obtained from linear fitting with r 2 0 999 which showed a large linear agreement between the data in the synchronization range in the strouhal like number results in fig 7 the st was observed to decrease with the decrease of the aspect ratio for cylinders with 2dof in the range 1 5 l d 2 0 the same behavior occurred for the cylinders with 6dof in two different ranges namely 1 0 l d 2 0 and 0 3 l d 0 5 it is possible to conjecture that in the first range 1 0 l d 2 0 the von kármán was still present and it was governing the motion on the other hand in the second range 0 3 l d 0 5 the von kármán was not presented and the resonance motion was governed by the structures shedding around the cylinder free end all the values were lower than the values for the cylinders with high aspect ratio l d 13 the decrease in the strouhal number due to the decrease in the aspect ratio was also observed for the fixed tests as presented by okamoto and yagita 1973 sakamoto and arie 1983 fox and apelt 1993 norberg 1994 and gonçalves et al 2015 significant result highlighted for cylinders with high aspect ratio by leong and wei 2008 and stappenbelt and lalji 2008 is that the strouhal number verified for cylinders under viv s t 0 16 is lower than the one verified for the fixed cases s t 0 20 as presented in williamson and govardhan 2004 the same behavior was observed for the present results for cylinders with very low aspect ratio examining the last results presented together with the results of the ratio between in line and transverse motion frequencies f x f y see fig 8 the reduced velocity range in which the linear behavior of f y f 0 was observed seems to be the same as the couple between the motions in the in line and in the transverse direction occurred a region characterized by f x f y 2 for l d 0 5 it was possible to observe values of f x f y 0 5 in high values of reduced velocities these reduced velocities were the same as the abrupt fall of the amplitudes in the transverse direction confirming the existence of the lower branch and the loss of synchronism of the shedding frequency and the motion frequency of the cylinder the case of l d 0 2 was different because it did not present the coupled behavior f x f y 2 in any reduced velocity condition this result together with the amplitude results confirms that the typical viv behavior was not observed for l d 0 2 i e there was no vortex shedding capable of synchronizing the frequency of the cylinder motion and the structures formed around this aspect ratio were not capable of creating alternating forces and consequently motion in the cylinder the same behavior was observed for stationary cylinders with low aspect ratio presented in gonçalves et al 2015 in that work the value of l d 0 2 showed to be critical concerning alternating forces generation the psd results of the motions in the in line and in the transverse directions as a function of reduced velocities for each aspect ratio are presented in figs 9 14 to corroborate the statements made so far the psd results of the motions in the in line direction see figs 9 11 showed the region where the dominant in line frequency is defined this region is characterized by an inclined line when looking at the graph of f x f 0 as a function of v r and also by a line with constant value when looking at the graph of f x d u as a function of v r the range of these lines was observed to decrease with decreasing aspect ratio and this line did not exist for l d 0 2 for l d 0 5 a second region with considerable energy density was observed for v r 7 with lower dominant frequencies around f x f 0 0 4 the psd results of the motions in the transverse direction see figs 12 14 showed the region where the dominant transverse frequency is defined this region is also characterized by an inclined line practically with half the inclination verified in the in line direction when looking at the graph of f x f 0 as a function of v r and also by a line with constant value practically half that verified in the in line direction when looking at the graph of f x d u as a function of v r these values characterize the strouhal number for each aspect ratio condition assuming that the vortex shedding frequency is similar to the motion frequency in the transverse direction f s f y in the same way as the in line direction the range of these lines was observed to decrease with decreasing aspect ratio for l d 0 2 the positive inclination of the line was not found and the value was constant f y f 0 1 for l d 0 5 a previous region before the inclined line was observed where the value is constant f y f 0 1 which showed a different behavior when compared with the higher aspect ratios it is interesting to draw a parallel between the psd results of the cylinder free to oscillate with 6dof see figs 9 14 with the psd results of the stationary cylinder obtained by gonçalves et al 2015 in those results a different behavior was observed for stationary cylinders with l d 0 5 in those cases the cylinder free end was responsible for changing the structures shedding around the cylinder and these structures were responsible for the considerable energy density in lower frequencies in those cases the typical von karmán street was not verified for l d 0 2 alternating forces were not observed the same behaviors were verified and confirmed for the cylinders free to oscillate with 6dof showing the coherence between the results and confirming the statements made before the results of mean drag force coefficient c x and oscillatory drag force coefficient c x r m s are presented in fig 15 and fig 16 respectively the results of drag coefficient showed to be similar to that presented for characteristic amplitudes i e the drag force coefficient decreased with decreasing aspect ratio see fig 15 the mean drag force coefficient results allow observing the dynamic drag amplification behavior when f x f y 2 except for l d 0 2 the force characteristics were different for l d 0 2 the same behavior was presented by gonçalves et al 2015 for fixed cylinders and l d 0 2 due to the combined presence of free end and free surface effects the maximum values of mean drag coefficient reach c x 4 and c x 1 5 respectively for l d 2 0 and l d 0 5 the results of oscillatory drag force coefficient c x r m s showed high values in the region of in line resonance for v r 4 and l d 0 5 for l d 0 5 the c x r m s 0 2 is almost constant and lower than for the highest aspect ratio it is possible to see for these aspect ratios l d 0 5 that the in line amplitudes were also low the maximum values of oscillatory drag coefficient reach c x r m s 0 9 and c x r m s 0 3 respectively for l d 2 0 and l d 0 5 the results of lift force coefficient c y r m s are presented in fig 17 the results of lift force coefficient also decreased with decreasing aspect ratio for l d 1 00 it was possible to observe two local maxima the first one related to the in line resonance in v r 3 and the second one related to the beginning of the synchronization process between in line and transverse motions the results of lift force coefficient showed that the maximum value of c y r m s occurred at lower reduced velocity with increasing aspect ratio the maximum values of lift force coefficient reach c y r m s 1 4 and c y r m s 0 4 respectively for l d 2 0 and l d 0 5 the added mass results for the in line direction in fig 18 showed a decrease with increasing reduced velocity with an asymptotic value of m a x 1 the same behavior reported in jauvtis and williamson 2004 and in cunha et al 2006 the zero crossing occurred for all cases around v r 4 which confirms the resonance of the in line motion around this reduced velocity except for l d 0 2 in the latter case the viv behavior was not observed however the added mass results for the transverse direction fig 19 did not present the zero crossing regions confirming the absence of the lower branch for l d 0 5 and v r 14 in turn added mass results for high aspect ratio cylinders as in vikestad et al 2000 usually show a zero crossing where the lower branch appears and the resonant process is finished in fact for 0 2 l d 0 5 the curve crossed zero confirming the presence of lower branch for these cases besides pointing out the characteristic amplitudes in the transverse direction presented in fig 4 the characteristic amplitudes in the vertical direction a z d presented larger amplitudes for lower aspect ratio and also an increase in the amplitudes by increasing the reduced velocity see fig 20 the vertical amplitudes are related to wave generation on the free surface i e the vertical amplitudes depend on the froude number f r l however the vertical amplitudes are very low a z d 0 05 and their effects on the vim can be neglected the characteristic roll a r o l l and pitch a p i t c h motion amplitudes are presented in fig 21 and fig 22 respectively the roll motions were coupled directly to the motions in the transverse direction for v r 8 and coupled to the motion in the transverse direction and yaw motion for v r 8 as can be seen in fig 24 the yaw motion presented local minima around v r 8 for l d 0 5 and the yaw amplitudes increased suddenly after this reduced velocity it is interesting to note that the natural frequency of yaw motion was higher than the transverse one and the yaw could be resonant for larger reduced velocities but the reduced velocities tested were not enough to verify this behavior the maximum characteristic roll motion amplitude was a r o l l 5 for the cases with highest aspect ratio and the trend was a decrease in the roll motion amplitudes with a decrease in the aspect ratio see fig 21 moreover the maximum characteristic pitch amplitude was a p i t c h 2 5 see fig 22 the value for the maximum characteristic pitch amplitude was lower than the roll ones also seeing that the amplitudes in the in line direction were lower than the transverse one the trend was the same for the roll motion amplitudes except for the l d 0 2 in which the pitch motion amplitudes were higher than the higher aspect ratio cases this behavior can be attributed to the free surface effect in this case due to f r l 0 5 the mean pitch angle results are presented in fig 23 for all aspect ratio cases the mean pitch angle is similar and increased by increasing the reduced velocity distinct behavior occurred at the start of the lower branch region for 0 2 l d 0 5 a decline in the amplitude was verified in this region and the dynamic amplification of the drag ceased in fact results presented by franzini et al 2013 showed that angle values inferior to 10 do not substantially affect the viv response for cylinders with l d 13 therefore the effect of the inclination can be neglected for the low aspect ratio cylinders presented here the characteristic yaw motion amplitudes a y a w showed a large relation to the motions in the transverse direction see fig 24 for the cases l d 0 5 it is possible to observe local minima in the same reduced velocity as the maximum lift coefficient occurred and after this value increased in the yaw amplitudes a decrease in the yaw motion in the highest reduced velocities tested for these cases was not observed however a drop was verified in the yaw amplitudes for the l d 0 5 in the same region characterized by the lower branch in the motions in the transverse direction no yaw amplitudes higher than a y a w 0 5 were observed for l d 0 2 for the yaw motions as well as for the motions in the transverse direction it is possible to distinguish three different region behaviors namely 0 5 l d 2 0 0 2 l d 0 5 and l d 0 2 fig 25 presents an example of the time series for all the 6dof at v r 7 for one case in each distinct behavior region commented before namely l d 2 0 0 5 and 0 2 the couple between the different degrees of freedom is due to the elastically supported system applied to the experiments it is possible to observe at the moment that the cylinder promoted motions in the transverse direction the roll motion is coupled and in the same phase the same occurred for the motions in the in line direction and pitch motion the example time series shown in fig 25 helps to summarize the characteristic behavior for each region as for the range 0 5 l d 2 0 von kárman street main characteristic is predominant and the double frequency can be observed for motion in the in line direction when compared with the frequency for motion to the transverse direction for the 0 2 l d 0 5 even without von kármán street main characteristics around the majority span length of the cylinder the vortex shedding around it was capable of producing alternating forces in the transverse direction and no more double frequency in the motions in the in line direction is observed finally for l d 0 2 low amplitudes are found in the transverse and in line direction and the free surface effects play an important role increasing the motions in the vertical direction and pitch motions therefore the vortex structure are not enough to produce significant viv amplitudes the psd results for all the 6dof presented in fig 26 fig 27 and fig 28 for l d 2 0 0 5 and 0 2 respectively concerning frequency results corroborated the summary statement made before the couple between the motion in the transverse direction and roll as well as the couple between the motion in the in line direction and pitch can be highlighted i e each pair of the degree of freedom presented the same frequency behavior the results for l d 0 2 showed an absence of significant energy for most degrees of freedom however the increase of the energy for the motions in the vertical direction for low frequencies due to the increase in the free surface effects were also observed for this very low aspect ratio note that the vertical energy is not enough to change the viv behavior for the motions in the transverse and in the in line direction the analysis performed so far confirmed that the free end effects increase with decreasing aspect ratio mainly for 0 2 l d 0 5 in this range of aspect ratio the structures formed around the cylinder free end are the only ones responsible for the alternating forces in the transverse direction differently from the typical von kármán street presented for higher aspect ratios 6 literature comparison as detailed in the introduction section of this work few works in the literature are found about viv of circular cylinders with low aspect ratio and small mass ratio the goals of the present section are to compare the current results with the ones found in the literature and to show the consistency of our results fig 29 presents the literature comparison of the characteristic motion amplitude in the transverse direction for cylinders with the mass ratio of m 1 00 details about the works compared are presented in table 5 the first point to be detached is the difference between 1dof and 2dof results for l d 17 8 which confirms that the presence of the motions both in the in line and in the transverse direction directly impact the viv on the other hand 2dof and 6dof results l d 2 0 are similar and this difference of degrees of freedom does not play an important role the second one is the highest amplitudes occurring for l d 2 0 instead of the highest aspect ratio l d 17 8 as discussed in gonçalves et al 2013a 2015 and confirmed by the present work the low frequency forces due to the free end presence keep the synchronization for a longer time in the latter the results for 2 4 l d 17 8 are similar therefore the effect of the free end presence may not affect the viv behavior for l d 2 4 the amplitude results for l d 0 5 is the lowest due to the existence of the free end structures for this case instead of the typical von kármán street behavior for l d 0 5 as discussed in the experimental results section of this work fig 30 presents the literature comparison of the characteristic motion amplitude in the transverse direction for cylinders with the mass ratio of m 2 50 and 2dof details about the works compared are presented in table 6 the results for l d 17 8 confirmed the difference between 1dof and 2dof for m 2 50 also it is possible to observe the difference between the results for and m 2 50 statement discussed intensely in jauvtis and williamson 2004 for l d 10 and gonçalves et al 2013a for low aspect ratio cylinders even for m 2 50 the results for l d 2 0 presented higher amplitudes for v r 8 than cylinders with high aspect ratio cylinders the explanation for the absence of the lower branch for the v r 8 may be the presence of low frequency forces due to the free end presence as commented before as expected for the l d 0 5 the amplitudes are the lowest fig 31 presents the literature comparison of the characteristic motion amplitude in the transverse direction for cylinders with very low aspect ratio and small mass ratio details about the works compared are presented in table 7 only the work by rahman thiagarajan 2015 presented experimental results from viv of l d 2 0 the results cannot be compared directly with the results of the current work because of the difference between mass ratio and degrees of freedom yet the conclusion is similar the amplitudes in the transverse direction decrease when the aspect ratio decreases the literature review and comparison summed up the importance of having studied the floating cylinders with very low aspect ratio and have helped to fill this lack of studies 7 conclusion the present work was motivated by the vim studies on circular platforms particularly the case of the monocolumn platform 0 20 l d 0 50 it aimed to understand the viv around floating circular cylinders with very low aspect ratio hence viv experiments were carried out in a circulating water channel at ndf brazil eight different aspect ratio conditions were tested in all the conditions the cylinder was free to oscillate with 6dof and m 1 motions were acquired using an optical motion capture system results regarding motion amplitudes motion characteristic frequencies lift and drag forces and added mass were presented and discussed for each aspect ratio literature review and comparison were performed to corroborate the statements in this work regarding the motion amplitudes the characteristic amplitudes in both in line and transverse directions decreased with decreasing aspect ratio the results of drag and lift forces also showed the same behavior confirming the reduction in amplitudes with decreasing aspect ratio the same behavior was verified for the strouhal number assuming that f y f s on the other hand the added mass results helped to confirm the end of the resonant process when this value reached a value equal zero and also for motions in the transverse direction to confirm the lower branch behavior the motion amplitudes for the vertical direction roll pitch and yaw did not show to affect the viv behavior since the energy of these degrees of freedom was low and related to the couple with the motions in the in line and transverse direction distinct responses were observed regarding the possible source of the alternating forces analyzing the characteristic frequency results the first one for cylinders with 0 5 l d 2 00 in which the von kármán street is present together with the structures formed around the cylinder free end the second one for cylinders with 0 20 l d 0 50 in which only the vortex formed and shedding around the cylinder free end were responsible for the resonant behavior of the system and the last one for cylinders with l d 0 20 in which the vortex structures due to the cylinder free end were predominant but not capable of promoting a viv resonant behavior of the system thus the value l d 0 20 can be considered the critical aspect ratio value for the existence of viv on cylinders these conclusions are similar those obtained for stationary cylinders with low aspect ratio and presented in previous work by gonçalves et al 2013a these two works together can help to better understand the viv behavior of low aspect ratio cylinders future works can use cfd simulations to better visualize the structures formed around the cylinder free end and can further explain the phenomenon of flow around low aspect ratio cylinders acknowledgements the authors thank rodrigo s campos for his help in performing the tests the authors would also like to acknowledge the são paulo research foundation fapesp process number 2014 02043 1 and the brazilian national council for scientific and technological development

23523,a methodology is presented to numerically determine the hydrodynamic coefficients of ship hull sections using a time domain navier stokes model results are presented for three topologically distinct sections of a ship hull skeg midship and bulbous bow subjected to heave and sway motions in shallow and deep water the simulations have been performed with the open source computational fluid dynamics openfoam software a preliminary assessment of the necessity of viscosity consideration on the determination of the hydrodynamic coefficients which should depend on the section topology and depth is carried out results demonstrate an overall good agreement of the added mass and damping coefficients between the calculated values and the ones obtained with a boundary equation method potential flow formulation an exception is the skeg section in shallow waters keywords openfoam cfd added mass damping coefficient potential flow shallow water 1 introduction the vast majority of methods applying direct three dimensional approaches to seakeeping predictions consider the potential flow idealization to the fluid motion they are typically based on body or body plus free surface discretization by panels making use of gauss and green s theorems together with disturbance potential formulations that vanish at large distances from the body this is in contrast to field methods which apply a computational fluid dynamics cfd approach with its difficult numerical domain preparation and cumbersome computational time involved in those methods coarser meshes are typically used to impose the far field boundary conditions and to resolve the flow away from the hull with a refinement of these applied near the ship still in sadat hosseini et al 2013 this resolves to between 37 9 m and 45 1 m grid points for computing the added resistance in short waves for the moeri tanker kvlcc2 the problem can be solved in the frequency domain where a linear consideration of all quantities involved is introduced although 2nd order mean drift forces may be computed from using just the linear solution for example newman 1967 in addition inglis and price 1981 newman and sclavounos 1988 and nakos and sclavounos 1990 are some of the most important studies of this kind it can also be solved in time domain whether directly or through the use of some linear quantities such as the radiation and diffraction forces e g lin and yue 1990 and nakos et al 1993 from the totally linear approach to the usage of full navier stokes equations based algorithms several levels of introducing nonlinearities on the system can be outlined as those by hirdaris et al 2014 with their 6 levels 1 linear 2 nonlinear froude krylov 3 body nonlinear 4 body exact 5 fully nonlinear with smooth waves 6 fully nonlinear from the aforementioned studies it is clear that 3d methods are presently well established nonetheless 2d formulations such as level 2 methods by fonseca and guedes soares 1998 and rajendran et al 2015 2016 the latter using a nonlinear approach to the hydrodynamic coefficients are still valuable options for they are extremely fast to compute in what regards sectional hydrodynamic coefficients of semi submerged bodies its earliest calculation approach is that by ursell 1949 where an analytical solution was found for an oscillating circle based on multiple expansions haskind 1953 used an analytic scheme to calculate the force and moment acting on steady oscillating contours of ship like sections by use of an auxiliary continuous function on the whole complex plane domain whereas grim 1953 obtained added mass and damping coefficients for real ship sections by assuming a least square fitting of the solutions to comply with the neumann conditions on the contours by applying conformal mapping of close to ship like sections tasai 1959 1961 generalized the application of ursell s 1949 formulation such sections were created by approximating real ship sections to analytic functions in the lower complex half plane following lewis 1929 for which conformal mappings to a circle were available crude approximations often occurred as the conformal process only considered two parameters based on the breadth draft and area of the section even though efforts have been made to improve the realism of the sections by increasing the number of parameters e g landweber and macagno 1967 ramos and guedes soares 1997 it was frank 1967 who formulated an approach that allowed for arbitrary sections to be considered the method accepts arbitrary shaped contours approximated by segments on which green pulsating sources wehausen and laitone 1960 fulfilling the radiation and free surface boundary conditions automatically are distributed however as evidenced by john 1950 frank s close fit method suffers from the irregular frequencies phenomenon the method by yeung 1973 is immune to this problem while fulfilling an arbitrary section geometry requirement in addition to implementing the possibility of shallow water consideration without actually considering any singularity distribution directly the method was further developed by sutulo and guedes soares 2004 where the body boundary condition was applied on the segments discretizing the oscillating contour instead of their collocation points it was then applied to the study of a set of sections of the s175 hull firstly in simple bottom geometries sutulo et al 2009 secondly in stepped and ramp bottom topologies sutulo et al 2010 all the above methods implement the potential flow assumption and disregard viscous effects entirely added mass can typically be approximated to not dependent on viscosity for the special case of a sinusoidal relative motion between the flow and object fackrell 2011 similarly viscous effects are negligible in radiated gravity waves due to the body motion but the same is not always true for damping it is known that viscous damping in roll is typically the most significant viscous effect on a ship motion lavrov et al 2016 carried out cfd calculations using navier stokes equations implemented in openfoam to study the flow in the vicinity of 2d ship sections subjected to forced roll motions they concluded that for the same shapes a 10 20 difference in the added mass was observed throughout the whole frequency range compared to results from the application of a linear frequency domain potential flow code accounting for viscous effects quérard et al 2008 carried out rans based simulations with ansys cfx 11 0 and concluded on the superiority of their predictions compared to potential flow analysis especially for sway and roll fluid damping four sections geometries were investigated rectangular triangular chine and bulbous bow comparisons were done with vugts 1968 experimental data and a conformal mapping technique for the first two but only to the later regarding the chine a bulbous sections for which only results in roll are available even though overall good results were achieved the bulbous bow section results showed some significant deviations between the two methods this irrespective of these sections being thought to be well approached by potential formulations lavrov et al 2016 in what regards the hydrodynamic coefficients on the other hand the bulbous bow section studied did not exhibit an actual protruding bulb in the same line of study henning 2011 used fluent cfd commercial software to determine added mass and viscosity inclusive damping coefficients of three simple contours triangle square and semi circle arguing these to approximate some typical ship sections a satisfactory correlation was identified between his results and those experimentally obtained by vugts 1968 regarding heave and sway motions however roll amplitudes in excess of 11 remained largely unresolved most importantly the author reports the inability to achieve good results using a single turbulence model for all hull motion cases yet another study was carried out by bonfiglio et al 2012 for the square and semi circle but where the computations were carried out using openfoam open source libraries comparison to experiments provided qualitatively similar conclusions to those of henning 2011 later bonfiglio et al 2013 carried out another validation of their methodology by comparing satisfactorily their numerical results with experimental values by hart and kiesow 1988 regarding a golf club section in heave finally the same authors simulate and compare the influence of viscosity in heave induced radiation forces between mono hull and double hull versions of a similar section plus a swath section in heave bonfiglio and brizzolara 2013 more recently gadelho et al 2015 presented a methodology based on navier stokes equations to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients of an oscillating 2d rigid cylindrical body the dynamic mesh scheme employed to reproduce the oscillating movement of each section is similar to that of gadelho et al 2014a regarding the performance assessment of a wedge shaped wave maker in a 2d wave tank results demonstrated an overall good agreement of hydrodynamic coefficients with ones obtained by potential formulations even though deviations were witnessed in higher frequencies while the aforementioned studies deal with deep water conditions the case of shallow water is also important to be assessed tezdogan et al 2016 that is the case of a ship travelling in a channel or inside a harbour where the low frequency data corresponding to the horizontal motions can also be useful for maneuvering issues sutulo et al 2009 viscous effects which are especially important for the horizontal motions can be properly assessed by using cfd methods van oortmerssen 1976 used 3d potential sources distributed on the surface of vertical oscillating contours where the sources green functions formulation accounted for the presence of a flat bottom or a vertical quay this was in contrast with yeung 1973 who considered the following borders to be discretized body free surface bottom and a cylindrical wall away from the body though a greater number of equations is present in the later the method has the ability to include arbitrary shaped bottoms and the case of ships in canals svendsen 1968 had acknowledged the presence of a nonlinear term in the forces induced on a rectangular cylinder under forced heave with draught depth ratio close to unity but the validity of a linear strip theory approach to the seakeeping in restricted waters was demonstrated by hooft 1974 and reiterated by tuck 1978 at least for heave motion under reasonable bottom clearances andersen 1979 used a finite element for calculating the sectional hydrodynamic properties of a ship with depth to draught ratios infinite 3 and 1 5 the approach was concluded to be very suitable several studies have since taken place more recently one can highlight the works by kim 1999 perunovic and juncher jensen 2003 and koo and kim 2015 the last of these developed a simplified formula of heave added mass coefficients for various two dimensional body sections in a finite water depth all studies consider a 2d approach to the problem the objective of this paper is to present a navier stokes equation based methodology applied to the study of two dimensional hydrodynamic coefficients of a set of three distinct but paradigmatic real ship section profiles skeg midship and bulbous bow heave and sway forced motions are simulated in deep and shallow water and results are compared with the potential flow solutions of sutulo et al 2009 analysis of the results allow for a better understanding of the viscous effects and for a preliminary assessment of the necessity of viscosity consideration on the determination of the hydrodynamic coefficients which should depend on the section topology the formulation of the problem is presented in section 2 followed by the numerical problem description governing equations model setup and scheme calibration validation in section 3 results are shown and compared with the potential flow solutions in section 4 finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 formulation of the problem the hydrodynamic coefficients added masses and damping coefficients of ship sections are to be calculated regarding the heave and sway motions these are solutions of the two dimensional radiation problem where the sections are forced to oscillate in still water generating a flow on the surrounding fluid the forces necessary to produce such sinusoidal motions can be calculated thus providing the solution to the problem consider the forced kinematic oscillation of a section 1 ξ i ω a i s i n ω t i 2 3 where ω is the circular frequency t represents

respectively 3 3 numerical model setup three sections of the s175 ship hull were tested in shallow and deep water subjected to heave and sway oscillating motions in otherwise calm water the geometry of each section is presented in fig 1 section s2 corresponds to bulbous section s10 to the midship section and s22 to an aft section the chosen cartesian coordinates are x direction is parallel to the flume length y direction parallel to the flume height and z direction parallel to the flume width the x origin is located in the left boundary of the domain and y origin is located in the undisturbed waterline to simulate a 2d wave flume only one cell in the z direction was used in openfoam a boundary is generally broken up into a set of patches one patch may include one or more enclosed areas of the boundary surface in this case three type of boundaries were defined patch type inlet outlet and atmosphere is a generic type containing no geometric or topological information about the mesh wall type bottom and hull geometry is one that coincides with a solid wall and is required for some physical modelling empty type front and back are used for solutions in 2 dimensions 2d the type used on each patch whose plane is normal to the 3rd dimension for which no solution is required two domains with a length of 1200 m were used in the numerical simulations one for shallow water water depth h 10 5 m and another for deep water h 95 0 m i e h d 1 1 10 where d is the sections draught the domain used for the deep water case is shown in fig 2 where section s10 is represented the domain must be large enough to prevent too early a reflection of waves at the side walls yet not so big so as to involve a cumbersome cpu time for carrying out the simulations the wave front velocity originated from the initial body oscillation is given by 7 c g c 2 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h where c is the wave phase velocity and k denotes the wave number the phase velocity follows the dispersion relation 8 c g k tanh k h by considering the longest period simulated 13 8s the lowest depth 10 45 m and the widest section s s10 breadth 24 84 m the time it takes for the radiated wave system front to leave the body reflect on the end walls and reach the body is approx 129s this means that the initial nine oscillations are free from any reflection effect a greater number is present for higher frequencies and deeper water cases naturally 3 4 calibration and validation calibration and validation of the numerical model setup to be used as a numerical 2d wave flume is well described in gadelho et al 2014b where a 2d numerical wave flume was developed and calibrated to evaluate the effect of obstacles on the wave propagation on the other hand the calibration and validation of the cfd model to calculate hydrodynamic coefficients of a half submerged cylinder in heave and sway motions is presented in gadelho et al 2015 the present work has a similar domain to that of gadelho et al 2015 but the bodies geometries are more complex thus a mesh sensitivity analysis focused on the mesh near the bodies and in way of the free surface was carried out the meshes are generated with openfoam s tool snappyhexmesh which adjusts a base mesh created with blockmesh to a given geometry seven mesh combinations were made for section s02 m1 m2 m7 in deep water regime h 95 0 m for the oscillating sway motion with amplitude a 0 5 m and period t 2 99 s a description of the meshes and cpu time is presented in table 1 where δx δy and δz are the base mesh element spacing in the x y and z directions respectively addlayers is a process of snappyhexmesh to refine the mesh near a surface and refinementbox is the process of refining the mesh in a zone bounded by a box m1 is identical to the mesh presented in gadelho et al 2015 its base mesh is regular with approximately 250 000 cells and δx 1 0 m and δy δz 0 5 m the maximum aspect ratio is 2 1 which is good to avoid interpolation errors of unacceptable magnitude the remaining six meshes are variations of the aspect ratio refinement near the body and refinement near the initial free surface three criteria to evaluate the final mesh suitability were taken into account aspect ratio not bigger than 4 1 can be exceeded up to 10 1 near the body ratio of cell to neighbor cells size not bigger than 4 1 on the base mesh also called smoothness of the mesh cpu time for a 60s simulation below 10 h only m1 satisfies all criteria while the remaining ones fail on the computational time restriction m6 and m7 fail on the neighbor cell size ratio leading inclusively to very high cpu time due to the courant number convergence condition m3 is near the limit of the aspect ratio criterion and so it prevents snappyhexmesh to generate a proper geometry definition on the other hand there is little variation of the fluid exerted forces amplitude and phase for all 7 meshes see fig 3 through 5 the peak values of the recorded horizontal forces have maximum variations between meshes as low as 2 5 the same happening with the phase from this observations m1 mesh configuration was adopted for all simulations in all simulations it was used a computer with an intel core i7 4770 k cpu 3 5 ghz 8 with 16 gb of ram memory the computational time of each simulation varied between approximately 10 h and 30 h depending on the mesh geometry period and motion considered 4 results the simulations consist of imposing a small amplitude oscillatory motion to the ship sections following the motion law described in equation 1 in heave and sway in all simulations the motion starts with a very small amplitude which is progressively increased to a i 0 25 m 2 6 of the draught of the body at 12 5s after the motion starts this makes valid the use of equation 3 after a small number of motion cycles as transient effects are greatly diminished the simulation time is approximately 60 s meaning that under the wave reflection analysis carried out in section 3 3 no reflection is actually present a total of 92 simulations were carried out with the heave and sway motions being considered for 8 frequencies for sections s02 and s22 and 7 frequencies for s10 in deep and shallow water see table 2 the evolution of non dimensional pressure fields about each section under sway motion for the shallow water case and period t 6 18 s is presented in figs 6 and 7 the corresponding results in deep water regime are shown in figs 8 and 9 where the same period is considered the non dimensional pressure fields c p are defined by the expression 9 c p p 0 5 ρ u r e f 2 where u r e f a i ω observing fig 6 through 9 it is seen that the order of magnitude of the non dimensional pressure variation is similar for the three sections and that pressures are slightly higher in shallow water sections s02 and s10 do not exhibit any vortex shedding but that is not the case for s22 where vortex shedding is particularly pronounced in the shallow water case the evolution of non dimensional pressure fields around each section under heave motion for the deep water regime and period t 6 18 s is presented in fig 10 through 12 it is seen that section s10 do not exhibit any vortex shedding but that is not the case for s02 and s22 where vortex shedding is pronounced the results of the hydrodynamic coefficients for two depth to draught ratios are presented in figs 13 through 15 in these cfd refers to the present study results whereas sutulo refers to sutulo et al 2009 potential flow based results the nondimensional frequency ω is defined as ω 2 l ref g with l ref being equal to the maximum value between the draught and half of the breadth of the section measured the nondimensionalization of the added mass μ and damping coefficient ν follows the one by sutulo et al 2009 10 μ 22 μ 22 ρ π d 2 μ 33 μ 33 ρ π b 2 μ 42 μ 42 ρ π l r e f 3 where d is the draught of the section and b the breadth the damping coefficients are additionally divided by the frequency ω results for s02 in fig 13 show that added mass in sway and sway to roll agree very well with the potential flow solution this was predictable being in line with the absence of vortex shedding in figs 6 and 8 due to the section s streamlined geometry but μ 33 is higher in the cfd model the same phenomenon is observed with the damping coefficient where ν 22 and ν 42 are similar in both models but ν 33 is also higher in the cfd model for both water depths this behaviour is particularly significant for the shallow water case with the coefficients in heave exceeding twice the value of the ones obtained with the potential flow solution the results for s10 in fig 14 show that all the computed coefficients agree very well with the potential solution in both water depths leading to the neglecting of the influence of viscous effects and non linear effects to be valid in fig 15 the results for section s22 show that although added mass converge in both models to the same value in high frequencies the same is not true for longer periods however the significance of the phenomenon can be limited to the shallow water case on the other hand the damping coefficients are seen to be somewhat similar at least to a reasonable degree of consequence for their actual application in seakeeping methods the heave motion coefficients discrepancy may be attributed to the nonlinear nature of the cfd study which becomes important for this section where the geometry in way of the free surface changes considerably with the instantaneous draft as for the sway oscillation of this section when focusing on viscous effects it can be approximated to that of a sharped edged object oscillating in an otherwise stationary fluid for the free surface influence on the local flow about the bottom end of the body where flow separation takes place may be deemed negligible a keulegan carpenter number can then be defined based on the draught of the section k c 2πa i d 0 165 a very low value under these circumstances generated vortices are shed from the separation point but are sweep back passed the body when the motion is reversed to form a pair of successive vortices with opposite sign during the next half cycle the pair convecting away at typical angles of approx 45 graham 1980 this is clearly observable in fig 9 furthermore for such a small kc and neglecting the free surface influence the forces acting on the oscillating body should be due almost entirely to the potential flow added mass owing to the weakness of the shed vortices fig 15 corroborates this assumption however as δ d 0 where δ is the gap between the section and the bottom the influence of the bottom boundary layer becomes important and the mechanisms resulting from its interaction with the body boundary are still nowadays unclear bimbato et al 2011 in fig 7 it is clear that the vortex shedding regime deviates substantially from its deep water counterpart being much more prominent and thus causing radical departures from the potential flow solution as predicted by brennen 1982 the effect of these is seen to be mainly on the inertial forces fig 15 leading to the common approach to only consider the potential flow added mass fackrell 2011 to become invalid 5 conclusion a methodology was presented to numerically determine the hydrodynamic coefficients of ship hull sections using a time domain navier stokes cfd model results were presented for three sections of the s175 ship hull skeg midship and bulbous bow subjected to heave and sway forced motions in shallow and deep water in general the cfd results agree well with the potential flow solution however divergences were found for the less streamlined section where vortex shedding is present the differences were particularly significant for the shallow water case which was analysed in more detail it was found that limited differences for the deep water case agreed with previous investigations concerning oscillating bodies at low keulegan carpenter numbers the typical vortex shedding regime in these circumstances and the limited effects on the hydrodynamic coefficients due to these vortices weakness was corroborated with the simulations results on the other hand the significant influence of the small clearance between the section and the bottom was confirmed for the shallow water case a dramatic difference relative to the deep water case of the vortex shedding characteristics was observed leading to the necessity of including a viscous inclusive method for a proper added mass calculation contrary to common numerical seakeeping approaches although the current study is limited in the number of sections considered the typical geometry nature of each of the three present in most ships makes a case for some preliminary conclusions on the need to carry out cfd simulations depending on the topology of the section it is found that potential flow solutions to the radiation problem approximate very well the actual forces at play in heave and sway motions for typical ship sections but the same is not true for blunted section geometries when the clearance to the bottom is very small particularly regarding the added mass coefficient carrying out cfd simulations for these and only these cases is advised for future work it is interesting to extend the study to different ship sections and take into account the influence of using different turbulence models acknowledgements this work was performed within the project shopera energy efficient safe ship operation which was

23523,a methodology is presented to numerically determine the hydrodynamic coefficients of ship hull sections using a time domain navier stokes model results are presented for three topologically distinct sections of a ship hull skeg midship and bulbous bow subjected to heave and sway motions in shallow and deep water the simulations have been performed with the open source computational fluid dynamics openfoam software a preliminary assessment of the necessity of viscosity consideration on the determination of the hydrodynamic coefficients which should depend on the section topology and depth is carried out results demonstrate an overall good agreement of the added mass and damping coefficients between the calculated values and the ones obtained with a boundary equation method potential flow formulation an exception is the skeg section in shallow waters keywords openfoam cfd added mass damping coefficient potential flow shallow water 1 introduction the vast majority of methods applying direct three dimensional approaches to seakeeping predictions consider the potential flow idealization to the fluid motion they are typically based on body or body plus free surface discretization by panels making use of gauss and green s theorems together with disturbance potential formulations that vanish at large distances from the body this is in contrast to field methods which apply a computational fluid dynamics cfd approach with its difficult numerical domain preparation and cumbersome computational time involved in those methods coarser meshes are typically used to impose the far field boundary conditions and to resolve the flow away from the hull with a refinement of these applied near the ship still in sadat hosseini et al 2013 this resolves to between 37 9 m and 45 1 m grid points for computing the added resistance in short waves for the moeri tanker kvlcc2 the problem can be solved in the frequency domain where a linear consideration of all quantities involved is introduced although 2nd order mean drift forces may be computed from using just the linear solution for example newman 1967 in addition inglis and price 1981 newman and sclavounos 1988 and nakos and sclavounos 1990 are some of the most important studies of this kind it can also be solved in time domain whether directly or through the use of some linear quantities such as the radiation and diffraction forces e g lin and yue 1990 and nakos et al 1993 from the totally linear approach to the usage of full navier stokes equations based algorithms several levels of introducing nonlinearities on the system can be outlined as those by hirdaris et al 2014 with their 6 levels 1 linear 2 nonlinear froude krylov 3 body nonlinear 4 body exact 5 fully nonlinear with smooth waves 6 fully nonlinear from the aforementioned studies it is clear that 3d methods are presently well established nonetheless 2d formulations such as level 2 methods by fonseca and guedes soares 1998 and rajendran et al 2015 2016 the latter using a nonlinear approach to the hydrodynamic coefficients are still valuable options for they are extremely fast to compute in what regards sectional hydrodynamic coefficients of semi submerged bodies its earliest calculation approach is that by ursell 1949 where an analytical solution was found for an oscillating circle based on multiple expansions haskind 1953 used an analytic scheme to calculate the force and moment acting on steady oscillating contours of ship like sections by use of an auxiliary continuous function on the whole complex plane domain whereas grim 1953 obtained added mass and damping coefficients for real ship sections by assuming a least square fitting of the solutions to comply with the neumann conditions on the contours by applying conformal mapping of close to ship like sections tasai 1959 1961 generalized the application of ursell s 1949 formulation such sections were created by approximating real ship sections to analytic functions in the lower complex half plane following lewis 1929 for which conformal mappings to a circle were available crude approximations often occurred as the conformal process only considered two parameters based on the breadth draft and area of the section even though efforts have been made to improve the realism of the sections by increasing the number of parameters e g landweber and macagno 1967 ramos and guedes soares 1997 it was frank 1967 who formulated an approach that allowed for arbitrary sections to be considered the method accepts arbitrary shaped contours approximated by segments on which green pulsating sources wehausen and laitone 1960 fulfilling the radiation and free surface boundary conditions automatically are distributed however as evidenced by john 1950 frank s close fit method suffers from the irregular frequencies phenomenon the method by yeung 1973 is immune to this problem while fulfilling an arbitrary section geometry requirement in addition to implementing the possibility of shallow water consideration without actually considering any singularity distribution directly the method was further developed by sutulo and guedes soares 2004 where the body boundary condition was applied on the segments discretizing the oscillating contour instead of their collocation points it was then applied to the study of a set of sections of the s175 hull firstly in simple bottom geometries sutulo et al 2009 secondly in stepped and ramp bottom topologies sutulo et al 2010 all the above methods implement the potential flow assumption and disregard viscous effects entirely added mass can typically be approximated to not dependent on viscosity for the special case of a sinusoidal relative motion between the flow and object fackrell 2011 similarly viscous effects are negligible in radiated gravity waves due to the body motion but the same is not always true for damping it is known that viscous damping in roll is typically the most significant viscous effect on a ship motion lavrov et al 2016 carried out cfd calculations using navier stokes equations implemented in openfoam to study the flow in the vicinity of 2d ship sections subjected to forced roll motions they concluded that for the same shapes a 10 20 difference in the added mass was observed throughout the whole frequency range compared to results from the application of a linear frequency domain potential flow code accounting for viscous effects quérard et al 2008 carried out rans based simulations with ansys cfx 11 0 and concluded on the superiority of their predictions compared to potential flow analysis especially for sway and roll fluid damping four sections geometries were investigated rectangular triangular chine and bulbous bow comparisons were done with vugts 1968 experimental data and a conformal mapping technique for the first two but only to the later regarding the chine a bulbous sections for which only results in roll are available even though overall good results were achieved the bulbous bow section results showed some significant deviations between the two methods this irrespective of these sections being thought to be well approached by potential formulations lavrov et al 2016 in what regards the hydrodynamic coefficients on the other hand the bulbous bow section studied did not exhibit an actual protruding bulb in the same line of study henning 2011 used fluent cfd commercial software to determine added mass and viscosity inclusive damping coefficients of three simple contours triangle square and semi circle arguing these to approximate some typical ship sections a satisfactory correlation was identified between his results and those experimentally obtained by vugts 1968 regarding heave and sway motions however roll amplitudes in excess of 11 remained largely unresolved most importantly the author reports the inability to achieve good results using a single turbulence model for all hull motion cases yet another study was carried out by bonfiglio et al 2012 for the square and semi circle but where the computations were carried out using openfoam open source libraries comparison to experiments provided qualitatively similar conclusions to those of henning 2011 later bonfiglio et al 2013 carried out another validation of their methodology by comparing satisfactorily their numerical results with experimental values by hart and kiesow 1988 regarding a golf club section in heave finally the same authors simulate and compare the influence of viscosity in heave induced radiation forces between mono hull and double hull versions of a similar section plus a swath section in heave bonfiglio and brizzolara 2013 more recently gadelho et al 2015 presented a methodology based on navier stokes equations to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients of an oscillating 2d rigid cylindrical body the dynamic mesh scheme employed to reproduce the oscillating movement of each section is similar to that of gadelho et al 2014a regarding the performance assessment of a wedge shaped wave maker in a 2d wave tank results demonstrated an overall good agreement of hydrodynamic coefficients with ones obtained by potential formulations even though deviations were witnessed in higher frequencies while the aforementioned studies deal with deep water conditions the case of shallow water is also important to be assessed tezdogan et al 2016 that is the case of a ship travelling in a channel or inside a harbour where the low frequency data corresponding to the horizontal motions can also be useful for maneuvering issues sutulo et al 2009 viscous effects which are especially important for the horizontal motions can be properly assessed by using cfd methods van oortmerssen 1976 used 3d potential sources distributed on the surface of vertical oscillating contours where the sources green functions formulation accounted for the presence of a flat bottom or a vertical quay this was in contrast with yeung 1973 who considered the following borders to be discretized body free surface bottom and a cylindrical wall away from the body though a greater number of equations is present in the later the method has the ability to include arbitrary shaped bottoms and the case of ships in canals svendsen 1968 had acknowledged the presence of a nonlinear term in the forces induced on a rectangular cylinder under forced heave with draught depth ratio close to unity but the validity of a linear strip theory approach to the seakeeping in restricted waters was demonstrated by hooft 1974 and reiterated by tuck 1978 at least for heave motion under reasonable bottom clearances andersen 1979 used a finite element for calculating the sectional hydrodynamic properties of a ship with depth to draught ratios infinite 3 and 1 5 the approach was concluded to be very suitable several studies have since taken place more recently one can highlight the works by kim 1999 perunovic and juncher jensen 2003 and koo and kim 2015 the last of these developed a simplified formula of heave added mass coefficients for various two dimensional body sections in a finite water depth all studies consider a 2d approach to the problem the objective of this paper is to present a navier stokes equation based methodology applied to the study of two dimensional hydrodynamic coefficients of a set of three distinct but paradigmatic real ship section profiles skeg midship and bulbous bow heave and sway forced motions are simulated in deep and shallow water and results are compared with the potential flow solutions of sutulo et al 2009 analysis of the results allow for a better understanding of the viscous effects and for a preliminary assessment of the necessity of viscosity consideration on the determination of the hydrodynamic coefficients which should depend on the section topology the formulation of the problem is presented in section 2 followed by the numerical problem description governing equations model setup and scheme calibration validation in section 3 results are shown and compared with the potential flow solutions in section 4 finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 formulation of the problem the hydrodynamic coefficients added masses and damping coefficients of ship sections are to be calculated regarding the heave and sway motions these are solutions of the two dimensional radiation problem where the sections are forced to oscillate in still water generating a flow on the surrounding fluid the forces necessary to produce such sinusoidal

in all simulations the motion starts with a very small amplitude which is progressively increased to a i 0 25 m 2 6 of the draught of the body at 12 5s after the motion starts this makes valid the use of equation 3 after a small number of motion cycles as transient effects are greatly diminished the simulation time is approximately 60 s meaning that under the wave reflection analysis carried out in section 3 3 no reflection is actually present a total of 92 simulations were carried out with the heave and sway motions being considered for 8 frequencies for sections s02 and s22 and 7 frequencies for s10 in deep and shallow water see table 2 the evolution of non dimensional pressure fields about each section under sway motion for the shallow water case and period t 6 18 s is presented in figs 6 and 7 the corresponding results in deep water regime are shown in figs 8 and 9 where the same period is considered the non dimensional pressure fields c p are defined by the expression 9 c p p 0 5 ρ u r e f 2 where u r e f a i ω observing fig 6 through 9 it is seen that the order of magnitude of the non dimensional pressure variation is similar for the three sections and that pressures are slightly higher in shallow water sections s02 and s10 do not exhibit any vortex shedding but that is not the case for s22 where vortex shedding is particularly pronounced in the shallow water case the evolution of non dimensional pressure fields around each section under heave motion for the deep water regime and period t 6 18 s is presented in fig 10 through 12 it is seen that section s10 do not exhibit any vortex shedding but that is not the case for s02 and s22 where vortex shedding is pronounced the results of the hydrodynamic coefficients for two depth to draught ratios are presented in figs 13 through 15 in these cfd refers to the present study results whereas sutulo refers to sutulo et al 2009 potential flow based results the nondimensional frequency ω is defined as ω 2 l ref g with l ref being equal to the maximum value between the draught and half of the breadth of the section measured the nondimensionalization of the added mass μ and damping coefficient ν follows the one by sutulo et al 2009 10 μ 22 μ 22 ρ π d 2 μ 33 μ 33 ρ π b 2 μ 42 μ 42 ρ π l r e f 3 where d is the draught of the section and b the breadth the damping coefficients are additionally divided by the frequency ω results for s02 in fig 13 show that added mass in sway and sway to roll agree very well with the potential flow solution this was predictable being in line with the absence of vortex shedding in figs 6 and 8 due to the section s streamlined geometry but μ 33 is higher in the cfd model the same phenomenon is observed with the damping coefficient where ν 22 and ν 42 are similar in both models but ν 33 is also higher in the cfd model for both water depths this behaviour is particularly significant for the shallow water case with the coefficients in heave exceeding twice the value of the ones obtained with the potential flow solution the results for s10 in fig 14 show that all the computed coefficients agree very well with the potential solution in both water depths leading to the neglecting of the influence of viscous effects and non linear effects to be valid in fig 15 the results for section s22 show that although added mass converge in both models to the same value in high frequencies the same is not true for longer periods however the significance of the phenomenon can be limited to the shallow water case on the other hand the damping coefficients are seen to be somewhat similar at least to a reasonable degree of consequence for their actual application in seakeeping methods the heave motion coefficients discrepancy may be attributed to the nonlinear nature of the cfd study which becomes important for this section where the geometry in way of the free surface changes considerably with the instantaneous draft as for the sway oscillation of this section when focusing on viscous effects it can be approximated to that of a sharped edged object oscillating in an otherwise stationary fluid for the free surface influence on the local flow about the bottom end of the body where flow separation takes place may be deemed negligible a keulegan carpenter number can then be defined based on the draught of the section k c 2πa i d 0 165 a very low value under these circumstances generated vortices are shed from the separation point but are sweep back passed the body when the motion is reversed to form a pair of successive vortices with opposite sign during the next half cycle the pair convecting away at typical angles of approx 45 graham 1980 this is clearly observable in fig 9 furthermore for such a small kc and neglecting the free surface influence the forces acting on the oscillating body should be due almost entirely to the potential flow added mass owing to the weakness of the shed vortices fig 15 corroborates this assumption however as δ d 0 where δ is the gap between the section and the bottom the influence of the bottom boundary layer becomes important and the mechanisms resulting from its interaction with the body boundary are still nowadays unclear bimbato et al 2011 in fig 7 it is clear that the vortex shedding regime deviates substantially from its deep water counterpart being much more prominent and thus causing radical departures from the potential flow solution as predicted by brennen 1982 the effect of these is seen to be mainly on the inertial forces fig 15 leading to the common approach to only consider the potential flow added mass fackrell 2011 to become invalid 5 conclusion a methodology was presented to numerically determine the hydrodynamic coefficients of ship hull sections using a time domain navier stokes cfd model results were presented for three sections of the s175 ship hull skeg midship and bulbous bow subjected to heave and sway forced motions in shallow and deep water in general the cfd results agree well with the potential flow solution however divergences were found for the less streamlined section where vortex shedding is present the differences were particularly significant for the shallow water case which was analysed in more detail it was found that limited differences for the deep water case agreed with previous investigations concerning oscillating bodies at low keulegan carpenter numbers the typical vortex shedding regime in these circumstances and the limited effects on the hydrodynamic coefficients due to these vortices weakness was corroborated with the simulations results on the other hand the significant influence of the small clearance between the section and the bottom was confirmed for the shallow water case a dramatic difference relative to the deep water case of the vortex shedding characteristics was observed leading to the necessity of including a viscous inclusive method for a proper added mass calculation contrary to common numerical seakeeping approaches although the current study is limited in the number of sections considered the typical geometry nature of each of the three present in most ships makes a case for some preliminary conclusions on the need to carry out cfd simulations depending on the topology of the section it is found that potential flow solutions to the radiation problem approximate very well the actual forces at play in heave and sway motions for typical ship sections but the same is not true for blunted section geometries when the clearance to the bottom is very small particularly regarding the added mass coefficient carrying out cfd simulations for these and only these cases is advised for future work it is interesting to extend the study to different ship sections and take into account the influence of using different turbulence models acknowledgements this work was performed within the project shopera energy efficient safe ship operation which was

23524,a novel technique of model updating named improved cross model cross mode icmcm is presented it is based on extracted modal data and to avoid a rank deficient problem and a biased solution of the derived linear equations this method changes the form of coefficient matrix and adds more independent equations on the basis of the original cross model cross mode cmcm method truncated singular value decomposition is utilized for possible solutions results of two numerical investigations including model updating of a simply supported beam and damage detection on a jacket platform indicate better accuracy and stability of the proposed technique a comparative rank study reveals that this improved technique handles more unknowns with the same amount of extracted modes several damage cases are considered with modal data contaminated by noise results affected by noise level extracted mode combinations and different damage cases are discussed monte carlo simulations show that even mode shapes contaminated with up to 3 added noise it would still be possible to obtain satisfactory results with proper selected modes keywords finite element model model updating damage detection cmcm icmcm numerical rank 1 introduction in recent years finite element analysis has become an essential tool for structural design however the fact that sometimes there is a large difference between numerical estimation and experimental measurements has demanded more accurate and reliable models three classes of modeling error are normally considered i e parameter error discrete error and structural error deduced by theoretical hypothesis and other unknowns any of uncertainties in modeling might lead to deviation and even to wrong estimation one general purpose of model updating is to make better correspondence between dynamic response of the analytical model and the real structure so that a more practical model could be applied for dynamic prediction optimal design or reliability analysis the modal parameters of structure e g frequencies and mode shapes change with modifications of physical properties this conclusion also produces certain cases where model updating techniques are sometimes interpreted as damage detection procedure when better correspondence of dynamic response are ensured between intact and damaged structure the corrected physical properties from intact model could be regarded as damage indications the model updating technique has been developing rapidly the general steps and problems are well elaborated in the book finite element model updating in structural dynamics friswell and mottershead 1995 usually two sorts of model updating methods are considered i direct matrix approach which corrects the elements of the system matrix in a process that may destroy symmetry and physical connectivity of the original system frequently leading to results with no physical significance a second class is defined as ii iterative parameter approach mostly based on sensitivity of the chosen dynamic response with respect to certain parameters this approach always calls for massive calculations and convergent results are not always ensured many researchers have proposed various methods using dynamic data in model updating or damage detection such as modal strain energy rezaei et al 2016 liu et al 2014 wavelet transform asgarian et al 2016 or damping ratio budipriyanto et al 2007 several artificial intelligence algorithms e g artificial neural network zubaydi et al 2002 genetic algorithm malekzehtab and golafshani 2013 particle swarm optimization malekzehtab et al 2012 have been introduced mottershead et al 2011 gave a tutorial of model updating using sensitivity method and probabilistic approaches khodaparast et al 2008 silva et al 2016a b are applied to a set of physical structures literature reviews of model updating mottershead and friswell 1993 as well as of damage detection doebling et al 1996 using vibration characteristics have been well elaborated among many approaches the cross model cross mode method cmcm hu et al 2007 was proposed which directly corrects stiffness and mass matrix without iterative computation thus avoiding the convergence problem a further attempt of simultaneously updating mass stiffness and damping matrix was developed by hu and li 2007 in the cmcm method there is no necessity for pairing or scaling of mode shapes although the need of complete mode shape seems to be the only limitation this drawback has been considered by some researchers silva et al 2016a b drozg et al 2018 by several modal expansion and model reduction techniques li et al 2008 proposed the cmcm method by taking incomplete modal data into damage detection and wang et al 2015 presented an experimental study on offshore platform these studies have confirmed the validity of the cmcm method in few given conditions or with limited number of unknowns but without considering the rank study of the coefficient matrix and noise effect in other words the stability of the solution is not always guaranteed in essence the cmcm method seeks to solve a system of linear equations which can lead to solutions without physical meaning if the coefficient matrix is rank deficient as well as frequently producing biased answers especially when the extracted modal data is contaminated by noise it is normally expected a unique solution in least square sense with a full rank coefficient matrix while several numerical treatments namely the regularization method has to be conducted to correct against noise effect on the basis of the original cmcm method the proposed icmcm approach changes the coefficient matrix into a difference form and in order to satisfy full rank condition for linear equations created by modal data new expressions are added results of two numerical investigations including model updating of a simply supported beam and damage detection of a jacket platform indicate better the accuracy and stability of the proposed technique it is shown that the proposed icmcm method provides a higher rank of the coefficient matrix with the same amount of modal data thus larger number of unknowns could be determined in an optimized least square sense in the second example several damage cases are considered with modal data contaminated by noise results affected by the noise level extracted mode combination and different damage cases are discussed monte carlo simulations show that even when mode shapes are contaminated with up to 3 added noise one can still obtain satisfactory results if proper modes are selected in section 2 the theoretical background of the previous cmcm method and of the proposed icmcm technique are described section 3 shows a brief introduction seeking for solution of linear equations including the truncated singular value decomposition which is adopted in this paper two numerical applications are investigated and results are compared in section 4 main conclusions are given in section 5 2 theoretical background 2 1 original cmcm method in the cmcm method hu et al 2007 an undamped system is assumed where the stiffness matrix and the mass matrix of the structure denoted by k and m are extracted from the baseline fe model the superscript denotes the parameters that stem from experimental measurements the expressions begin with the i th characteristic equation of the baseline fe model 1 k φ i λ i m φ i and the j th characteristic equation from the experimental measurements 2 k φ j λ j m φ j where λ i φ i and λ j φ j denote the i th and j th modal pairs from the baseline fe model and experimental measurements respectively k and m represent stiffness and mass matrix of the updated fe model respectively which are unknown at present assuming that k and m can be written in combination form with respect to all elements of the baseline fe model one concludes that 3 k k n 1 n e α n k n and 4 m m n 1 n e β n m n where n e is the total number of elements k n and m n are stiffness and mass matrix of the n th element written in global coordinate respectively by definition α n and β n stand for correction coefficients which are expected to be determined premutiplying eq 1 by φ j t and eq 2 by φ i t yields 5 φ j t k φ i λ i φ j t m φ i and 6 φ i t k φ j λ j φ i t m φ j note that k and m are symmetric and the transpose of a scalar stays the same one shows that the transposition of eq 5 yields 7 φ i t k φ j λ i φ i t m φ j dividing eq 6 by eq 7 one thus has 8 φ i t k φ j φ i t k φ j λ j λ i φ i t m φ j φ i t m φ j substituting eqs 3 and 4 into eq 8 results in 9 1 n 1 n e α n c n i j λ j λ i 1 n 1 n e β n d n i j where 10 c n i j φ i t k n φ j φ i t k φ j and 11 d n i j φ i t m n φ j φ i t m φ j rearranging and replacing i j with a new index m eq 9 becomes 12 n 1 n e α n c n m b m n 1 n e β n d n m b m 1 or 13 n 1 n e α n c n m n 1 n e β n e n m f m where b m λ j λ i e n m b m d n m and f m b m 1 the symbol represents the term in equations that consist of the i th component from the fe model along with the j th component from the experimental measurements when the first n i th numbers of modes are obtained from the fe model and the first n j th numbers of modes are extracted from the experimental measurements a total number of n m n i n j equations can be formulated from eq 13 rewriting those equations in matrix form one gets 14 c α e β f where c and e are n m n e matrices the correction coefficient vectors α and β have the size of n e f is the residual column vector with size n e a more compact format is expressed as 15 g γ f where g c e and γ α β t the coefficient matrix g has size of n m 2 n e thus eq 15 becomes either under determined or over determined problem depending on relationship between the rank of g and 2 n e if g is square and not singular a direct inverse solution can be obtained the minimum norm is an alternative estimation when dealing with under determined problems although it usually suffers from solutions of no physical significance it is always expected to have more equations than the number of unknowns namely n m 2 n e in this way the unique least square solution under full rank condition would be expected from expression 16 γ g g f where g g is the generalized inverse matrix of the coefficient matrix g particularly if all non zero correction coefficients α n and β n are involved in a model updating case one defines as a complete updating case a partial updating case implies that at least one of non zero correction coefficients are allowed to be changed if two sets of correction coefficients lead to two distinct updated systems k m and a k a m where a is an arbitrary positive constant not equal to 1 although different physical understanding are associated with these two updated fe models they would result in the same eigenvalue and eigenvector in modal sense as a consequence solutions derived from these equations would adapt for both systems in fact one concludes that there must exist multiple sets of solutions for a complete updating case accordingly at least one constraint must be given to obtain a unique solution the constraints could be constant stiffness or mass matrix of a certain element or the total mass of the system though this means elimination of some possible solutions this depends on the applications and should be carefully selected 2 2 icmcm technique in general model updating methods seek to solve a system of linear equations that always encounter with the rank deficient problem this may probably be deduced by the partial updating case where the physical property of most elements remains unchanged an effective approach dealing with this is by adding more linearly independent equations in this way this problem can be effectively avoided and a particular solution can be guaranteed considering the elements of matrix g where coefficients are derived by division form see eq 10 which frequently produces possible ill determined rank it is advantageous to rewrite the expressions in difference form premutiplying eq 2 by φ i t yields 17 φ i t k φ j λ j φ i t m φ j imposing eqs 3 and 4 into eq 17 one concludes 18 φ i t k n 1 n e α n k n φ j λ j φ i t m n 1 n e β n m n φ j or 19 n 1 n e α n c n m n 1 n e β n e n m f m where c n m φ i t k n φ j e n m λ j φ i t m n φ j f m λ j φ i t m φ j φ i t k φ j analogous to this expresses eq 6 combining with eqs 3 and 4 one obtains 20 φ i t k n 1 n e α n k n φ j λ j φ i t m n 1 n e β n m n φ j or 21 n 1 n e α n c n m n 1 n e β n e n m f m where c n m φ i t k n φ j e n m λ j φ i t m n φ j f m λ j φ i t m φ j φ i t k φ j notice in eq 18 k m are symmetric that makes the two equations exactly the same when i j thus the number of added independent equations is expected to be n j 2 2 again suppose the first n i th modes are obtained from the fe model and n j th modes are extracted from experimental measurements one can rewrite equations from eqs 19 and 21 in matrix form by 22 c α e β f and 23 c α e β f where c and e are n j n j n e matrices c and e are n i n j n e matrices α and β are correction coefficient vectors to be determined with size of n e f and f are column vectors with size of n j n j and n i n j respectively it is advantageous here that more n j n j equations are obtained from eq 22 more concise expression can be taken as 24 g ˆ γ ˆ f where g ˆ c e c e γ ˆ α β t and f f f t likewise when g ˆ is square and not singular a direct inverse solution is concluded while if g ˆ is not square or is square and singular one expects a generalized inverse solution in least square sense by expression 25 γ ˆ g ˆ g f for two particular cases if one assumes the constant stiffness or mass matrix of structures α 0 or β 0 two of following equations can be derived respectively as 26 c ˆ α f and 27 e ˆ β f where c ˆ c c t e ˆ e e t f f f t note that no change for stiffness or mass matrix means extra constraints for the system thus they are deemed as partial updating cases in damage detection field e g case 2 in this paper one assumes that damage effects only on local stiffness and keeps mass matrix unchanged when all correction coefficients in γ ˆ are calculated from eq 25 one actually has completed the location and quantification of damage detection procedure since γ ˆ contains stiffness and mass change of each element for model updating the baseline fe model can be updated by applying those changes within γ ˆ which are expressed in eq 3 and eq 4 modal analysis for updated model could be executed and the comparison could be made with the experimental measurement fig 1 shows the procedure of model updating and damage detection for two numerical investigations in this paper normally relative difference of several lower order frequencies as well as the modal assurance criterion mac allemang and brown 1982 of mode shapes are adopted to evaluate results of model updating the mac is defined as follows 28 mac φ i φ j φ i t φ j 2 φ i t φ i φ j t φ j it is obvious that mac ranges between 0 and 1 where a large value of mac shows high correlation between mode shapes and small mac indicates few or even no similarity of two vectors one hopes higher mac that represents better correspondence for an updated model with experimental measurement 3 solution of the linear equations similarly to most model updating methods both cmcm and icmcm methods seek to solve a system of linear equations see eq 15 and eq 24 for simplification a standard form is written by 29 a x b where a r m n m n is the coefficient matrix and b r m 1 is the right hand side vector it is well known that there exists unique and unbiased least square solution only if a shows full rank a rank deficient situation makes possible minimum norm solutions but unfortunately it rarely leads to physically meaningful updated parameters this conclusion can be verified in the following numerical investigation of a simulated beam therefore it is always expected that the number of equations are more than the number of unknowns with full rank condition in which an exclusive solution is concluded for each a the unique singular value decomposition is formulated in form 30 a u σ v t i 1 n σ i u i v i t where u r m m and v r n n are two orthonormal matrixes matrix σ r m n has diagonal and non negative singular values σ i which satisfy σ 1 σ 2 σ n u i and v i are the i th column of matrix u and v respectively then the exact least square solution x l s for problem min a x b 2 is given by 31 x l s a g b i 1 n u i t b σ i v i where a g is the generalized inverse matrix of a small perturbation on b would bring in large deviation on solution if a has ill determined numerical rank especially when random noise is added hansen 1990 defined this as the discrete ill posed problem and concluded the success of regularization techniques such as truncated singular value decomposition tsvd or tikhonov method depends on comparative speed converge to zero between u i t b and singular values σ i which is the well known discrete picard condition in this paper the traditional tsvd method is adopted to compare results of two updating methods only the largest singular values σ 1 σ 2 σ k together with corresponding orthonormal vectors u i and v i are accumulated to calculate eq 31 whereas singular values extremely close to zero with corresponding rows and columns in matrix u and v are neglected according to this one obtains tsvd solution 32 x i 1 k u i t b σ i v i where k is defined as truncation parameter it should be noticed the importance of choosing truncation parameter k if it is fairly large the smaller singular values may have much negative effective on solution oppositely a smaller k means greater loss of some components in final solution in this paper an automated implementation for selecting k is adopted by matlab programming 4 numerical investigations 4 1 model updating of a simply supported beam first model updating of a simply supported beam is presented to verify the validity of the icmcm method and compare with the previous method the model is chosen from an experimental program to establish the relation between the damage and the changes of dynamic characteristics peeters et al 1996 the simulated beam with length of 6 m has rectangular section with size of 200 mm 250 mm a total number of 15 plane beam elements are divided with elastic module of e 33 4 g p a and density of ρ 2500 k g m 3 sectional area a 0 05 m 2 and moment of inertia i 1 66 e 4 m 4 can be computed see fig 2 herein all modal frequencies and mode shapes including experimental measurement are derived for the fe model complete mode shapes are extracted and normalized to the mass matrix the first three frequencies of the baseline fe model are computed as 9 19 hz 36 69 hz 82 38 hz when the baseline fe model is constructed with the available geometric and physical parameters the experimental measurements which would be adopted in subsequent model updating are extracted from the simulated updated fe model with a set of change on correction coefficient of each element from the baseline model the chosen correction coefficient vector α for stiffness matrix and β for mass matrix are created by product of random vector σ and τ yield normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation of 0 5 along with a preset amplification factor μ thus one obtains 33 k n k n 1 u σ n k n 1 α n and 34 m n m n 1 u τ n m n 1 β n where σ σ 1 σ 2 σ n e τ τ 1 τ 2 τ n e n e is the total element number in essence the amplification factor u represents the degree of error between the fe model and the actual structure in this case two sets of amplification factors i e u 0 3 and u 0 8 are considered as explained in section2 1 to obtain a unique solution with as many updated parameters as possible an additional constraint is implemented as the invariability of the mass matrix for element 15 which indicates β 15 0 here are two sets of chosen correction coefficients see fig 3 with settlement of the correction coefficients the frequencies and the mode shapes to be updated can be simulated thus a subsequent model updating process with respect to baseline fe model is achieved to solve eq 24 in the least square sense at least 29 equations are required which calls for appropriate selection of analytical fe modes n i and simulated experimental modes n j to achieve a system with over 29 equations some given combinations of n i n j are calculated table 1 gives the comparison of model updating results by both cmcm and icmcm method the mean value of first three order of mac as well as the relative difference of frequencies rdf are shown results reveal that the cmcm method has unstable solutions for this case when n i 15 n j 2 and n i 10 n j 3 the derived correction coefficients are of no physical significance showing several lower values of mac thus indicating failure of model updating as the realization method is not considered here prohibitively deviation of correction coefficients are found even leading to some plural solutions when n i 6 n j 5 although outstanding performance of rdfs seem to be observed when n i 15 n j 2 with a minimum rdf of only 0 0472 u 0 3 the calculated correction coefficients are proved to be tremendously different from the preset which similarly concludes a biased updated model see fig 4 meanwhile the icmcm method guarantees stable and accurate solutions with the same cases no matter how the amplification factor alters as well as combination of extracted modes higher value of mac and lower rdf are obtained furthermore the extra situation of n i 7 n j 3 shown in fig 5 highlights superiority that even fewer modes are employed satisfactory mac and rdf are still concluded the calculated correction coefficients α n and β n are also illustrated in fig 5 which exactly match the preset a rank study of coefficient matrix g and g ˆ reveals that both methods tend to see ascendant rank with more extracted modes fig 6 and fig 7 in fig 6 one finds the ranks by cmcm method correspond to mode combinations in table 1 are merely 15 the essential difference lies in the fact that no matter how to change extracted combinations n i n j cmcm results suffer from rank deficient problem where the maximum rank of 15 fig 6 is obviously not enough for a 29 unknowns equations while full rank condition are always guaranteed by icmcm method with moderate mode selection as seen in fig 7 every single curve can reach a maximum rank of 29 for a particular point of n i 7 n j 3 which already produces a rank of 29 hence there is no more requirement for modal data whatever comes from the baseline fe model or the experiment measurements in this case since rank curves reveal limitation of the previous cmcm method with capability of only 15 unknowns more constrains should be given to obtain unique and stable solution for example if all β n are set to be zeros one gets satisfactory results illustrated in fig 8 it can be concluded icmcm method effectively improves full rank condition and handles more numbers of unknowns under the same amount of extracted modes 4 2 damage detection on a jacket platform a second study is simulated by damage detection on a jacket platform herein a precise undamaged model is assumed to have been established since the model updating and the damage detection process can be explained in a similar way a comparative study on damage detection is presented this model is chosen from an early work to study damage detection from limited modal information kim and stubbs 1995 the simulated typical jacket platform shown in fig 9 consists of 36 pipe elements 16 nodes within four levels all elements with uniform modulus of elasticity e 210 g p a possion s ratio ν 0 3 and mass density ρ 7850 k g m 3 have outer and inner diameter of 17 8 cm and 16 02 cm respectively the side length from bottom to the top level are 10 97 m 8 53 m 6 10 m and 3 66 m identical height of 9 14 m is set between levels boundary conditions are defined as constraints of all dofs of the grounding nodes no mass loss is considered in this study note that model reduction or modal expansion technique are not considered here namely mode shapes on all dofs are utilized all mode shapes are orthogonal to the mass matrix the first three modal frequencies of the intact model are calculated as 4 0157 hz 4 1045 hz 4 5867 hz three damage cases are listed in table 2 including various degrees of damage with single triple and multiple locations simulated damaged elements are marked in fig 9 by calculating modal frequencies and mode shapes of the damaged structure the results calculated by both cmcm and icmcm method are derived different combinations of the extracted modes where the first n i th modes from the intact fe model and the first n j th modes from the damaged structure are discussed to avoid the effect originated by the rank deficient problem only full rank situations of the coefficient matrices are considered namely the rank of matrix g and g ˆ are all calculated to be equal to the number of unknowns since there are 36 elements in this platform which means a 36 unknown problem a combination n i n j that generates a system with equations more than the number of unknowns is considered results of the three damage cases give the same conclusion see table 3 unbiased solutions are always guaranteed when the icmcm method is adopted for the cmcm method even when full condition of g is satisfied it seems when few modes are extracted from the damaged structure e g n j 1 or n j 2 one observes large deviations between solutions and the preset damage distribution but if n j increases to 3 or above precise solutions seem to be calculated a specific illustration is presented in fig 10 where the icmcm solutions show a perfect coincidence with the preset values but a biased curve is derived by the cmcm method note that only few lower order modes can be extracted precisely and high order modes generate larger error in practical applications the cmcm method which calls for higher order modes from the damaged structure is deemed to have this defect a further study confirms that the instability of the cmcm method varies with the number of extracted modes fig 11 presents the sum of absolute error sae of all correction coefficients along with an increasing n i and a constant n j 3 within two damage cases c2 and c3 table 2 the curves reveal a general perspective of the errors calculated by the two methods as for cmcm method when the n i is no more than 16 excellent results are shown but the curves show that a larger number of n i has even negative influence on the solution n i 16 whereas the icmcm method offers stable and exact solution all the time in practical situations modal data extracted from measurements always suffer from noise contamination so that unsatisfied solutions might be derived for the particular interest of investigating the performance of the icmcm method under noise effect noise contamination is simulated by adding a series of random numbers to the extracted mode shapes at each dof formulated by 35 φ j n o i s e φ j 1 φ j max δ η where φ j is the j th mode shape of damaged structures and φ j max represents the maximum value of φ j δ is random vector with gaussian distribution of mean value of 0 and standard deviation of 1 η indicates the noise level with contaminated mode shapes damage distribution are estimated and compared with the preset values since the mode shape is most likely to be contaminated by 3 measurement noise shi et al 2000 for damage cases c2 and c3 as seen in table 2 three noise levels i e 0 5 1 and 3 are considered together with various n i n j considering the difficulty of obtaining high order mode shapes from reality n j is set to be no more than 3 to achieve statistical significance on the detection result 2000 monte carlo simulations are conducted for each parameter set the estimated mean value of damage with corresponding ε range ε denotes the standard deviation are illustrated and several conclusions are listed as follows a multiple small damages tend to be more difficultly detected than the triple damage case with the same extracted modes and noise level fig 12 shows a nearly perfect detection c2 and small quantity of fluctuations with preset value c3 compared with preset damage the solution from the both cases seem to be acceptable but note that the damage in c3 are set to be much smaller in absolute value these fluctuations may cause comparable errors and lead to incorrect damage location and quantification b the negative effect of increasing noise level are observed for all damage cases results of c2 under diverse noise levels are exhibited in fig 13 where a near perfect and less satisfactory estimation are concluded with η 0 5 and η 1 when 3 noise level is added a comparable error is found with respect to preset value it is observed that the preset damaged elements no 2 no 18 no 29 can always be found but notice that an increasing error is concluded with the rise of noise level especially in element no 2 the negative effect also reflects on those elements without preset damage the deviation tends to be greater when higher noise level is added c when high noise level 3 is introduced sufficiently precise solution could still be obtained by increasing the number of extracted modes n i n j a relative higher damaged mode n j would benefit a lower demand of undamaged modes n i for comparable accuracy fig 14 illustrates the estimated damage distribution c3 table 2 with four different mode combinations it is note the fewer modes such as n i 18 n j 2 and n i 12 n j 3 yield poor detection results however when more modes from the model are added icmcm shows nearly coincident estimations with the preset values 5 conclusions this paper proposes an improved and direct computing method of model updating named icmcm being a direct approach substantial computation and convergence problems are avoided no pairing or regularization for analytical and experimental mode shapes highlights the practicability while large amount of correction coefficients can be determined in an optimized least square sense compared with the original cmcm method two numerical studies conclude that icmcm handles more unknowns under the same amount of extracted modes and more accurate solutions are always guaranteed rank study of a simply supported beam reveals that the proposed icmcm technique is more full rank accessible and thus a unique solution of the formulated linear equations is obtained noise effect is considered and some significant conclusions are presented it is noted noise even up to 3 is added to the extracted mode shapes satisfactory results can still be derived as long as enough high number of modal information is utilized however model updating or damage detection for large structures might be difficult due to the fact that enormous correction coefficients need to be determined which calls for more n i n j at the same time one hopes that if although not always feasible more pre information is given e g location of damage or constant mass for given elements a reduced linear system could be established without demanding number of modes note that the modeling error is not considered in this paper and some insights into selection of model parameters to be updated are of great importance which normally calls for a sensitivity study in addition it is disadvantageous that icmcm method still requires complete mode shapes at each dof this problem could be studied by modal expansion or model reduction techniques in future work

23524,a novel technique of model updating named improved cross model cross mode icmcm is presented it is based on extracted modal data and to avoid a rank deficient problem and a biased solution of the derived linear equations this method changes the form of coefficient matrix and adds more independent equations on the basis of the original cross model cross mode cmcm method truncated singular value decomposition is utilized for possible solutions results of two numerical investigations including model updating of a simply supported beam and damage detection on a jacket platform indicate better accuracy and stability of the proposed technique a comparative rank study reveals that this improved technique handles more unknowns with the same amount of extracted modes several damage cases are considered with modal data contaminated by noise results affected by noise level extracted mode combinations and different damage cases are discussed monte carlo simulations show that even mode shapes contaminated with up to 3 added noise it would still be possible to obtain satisfactory results with proper selected modes keywords finite element model model updating damage detection cmcm icmcm numerical rank 1 introduction in recent years finite element analysis has become an essential tool for structural design however the fact that sometimes there is a large difference between numerical estimation and experimental measurements has demanded more accurate and reliable models three classes of modeling error are normally considered i e parameter error discrete error and structural error deduced by theoretical hypothesis and other unknowns any of uncertainties in modeling might lead to deviation and even to wrong estimation one general purpose of model updating is to make better correspondence between dynamic response of the analytical model and the real structure so that a more practical model could be applied for dynamic prediction optimal design or reliability analysis the modal parameters of structure e g frequencies and mode shapes change with modifications of physical properties this conclusion also produces certain cases where model updating techniques are sometimes interpreted as damage detection procedure when better correspondence of dynamic response are ensured between intact and damaged structure the corrected physical properties from intact model could be regarded as damage indications the model updating technique has been developing rapidly the general steps and problems are well elaborated in the book finite element model updating in structural dynamics friswell and mottershead 1995 usually two sorts of model updating methods are considered i direct matrix approach which corrects the elements of the system matrix in a process that may destroy symmetry and physical connectivity of the original system frequently leading to results with no physical significance a second class is defined as ii iterative parameter approach mostly based on sensitivity of the chosen dynamic response with respect to certain parameters this approach always calls for massive calculations and convergent results are not always ensured many researchers have proposed various methods using dynamic data in model updating or damage detection such as modal strain energy rezaei et al 2016 liu et al 2014 wavelet transform asgarian et al 2016 or damping ratio budipriyanto et al 2007 several artificial intelligence algorithms e g artificial neural network zubaydi et al 2002 genetic algorithm malekzehtab and golafshani 2013 particle swarm optimization malekzehtab et al 2012 have been introduced mottershead et al 2011 gave a tutorial of model updating using sensitivity method and probabilistic approaches khodaparast et al 2008 silva et al 2016a b are applied to a set of physical structures literature reviews of model updating mottershead and friswell 1993 as well as of damage detection doebling et al 1996 using vibration characteristics have been well elaborated among many approaches the cross model cross mode method cmcm hu et al 2007 was proposed which directly corrects stiffness and mass matrix without iterative computation thus avoiding the convergence problem a further attempt of simultaneously updating mass stiffness and damping matrix was developed by hu and li 2007 in the cmcm method there is no necessity for pairing or scaling of mode shapes although the need of complete mode shape seems to be the only limitation this drawback has been considered by some researchers silva et al 2016a b drozg et al 2018 by several modal expansion and model reduction techniques li et al 2008 proposed the cmcm method by taking incomplete modal data into damage detection and wang et al 2015 presented an experimental study on offshore platform these studies have confirmed the validity of the cmcm method in few given conditions or with limited number of unknowns but without considering the rank study of the coefficient matrix and noise effect in other words the stability of the solution is not always guaranteed in essence the cmcm method seeks to solve a system of linear equations which can lead to solutions without physical meaning if the coefficient matrix is rank deficient as well as frequently producing biased answers especially when the extracted modal data is contaminated by noise it is normally expected a unique solution in least square sense with a full rank coefficient matrix while several numerical treatments namely the regularization method has to be conducted to correct against noise effect on the basis of the original cmcm method the proposed icmcm approach changes the coefficient matrix into a difference form and in order to satisfy full rank condition for linear equations created by modal data new expressions are added results of two numerical investigations including model updating of a simply supported beam and damage detection of a jacket platform indicate better the accuracy and stability of the proposed technique it is shown that the proposed icmcm method provides a higher rank of the coefficient matrix with the same amount of modal data thus larger number of unknowns could be determined in an optimized least square sense in the second example several damage cases are considered with modal data contaminated by noise results affected by the noise level extracted mode combination and different damage cases are discussed monte carlo simulations show that even when mode shapes are contaminated with up to 3 added noise one can still obtain satisfactory results if proper modes are selected in section 2 the theoretical background of the previous cmcm method and of the proposed icmcm technique are described section 3 shows a brief introduction seeking for solution of linear equations including the truncated singular value decomposition which is adopted in this paper two numerical applications are investigated and results are compared in section 4 main conclusions are given in section 5 2 theoretical background 2 1 original cmcm method in the cmcm method hu et al 2007 an undamped system is assumed where the stiffness matrix and the mass matrix of the structure denoted by k and m are extracted from the baseline fe model the superscript denotes the parameters that stem from experimental measurements the expressions begin with the i th characteristic equation of the baseline fe model 1 k φ i λ i m φ i and the j th characteristic equation from the experimental measurements 2 k φ j λ j m φ j where λ i φ i and λ j φ j denote the i th and j th modal pairs from the baseline fe model and experimental measurements respectively k and m represent stiffness and mass matrix of the updated fe model respectively which are unknown at present assuming that k and m can be written in combination form with respect to all elements of the baseline fe model one concludes that 3 k k n 1 n e α n k n and 4 m m n 1 n e β n m n where n e is the total number of elements k n and m n are stiffness and mass matrix of the n th element written in global coordinate respectively by definition α n and β n stand for correction coefficients which are expected to be determined premutiplying eq 1 by φ j t and eq 2 by φ i t yields 5 φ j t k φ i λ i φ j t m φ i and 6 φ i t k φ j λ j φ i t m φ j note that k and m are symmetric and the transpose of a scalar stays the same one shows that the transposition of eq 5 yields 7 φ i t k φ j λ i φ i t m φ j dividing eq 6 by eq 7 one thus has 8 φ i t k φ j φ i t k φ j λ j λ i φ i t m φ j φ i t m φ j substituting eqs 3 and 4 into eq 8 results in 9 1 n 1 n e α n c n i j λ j λ i 1 n 1 n e β n d n i j where 10 c n i j φ i t k n φ j φ i t k φ j and 11 d n i j φ i t m n φ j φ i t m φ j rearranging and replacing i j with a new index m eq 9 becomes 12 n 1 n e α n c n m b m n 1 n e β n d n m b m 1 or 13 n 1 n e α n c n m n 1 n e β n e n m f m where b m λ j λ i e n m b m d n m and f m b m 1 the symbol represents the term in equations that consist of the i th component from the fe model along with the j th component from the experimental measurements when the first n i th numbers of modes are obtained from the fe model and the first n j th numbers of modes are extracted from the experimental measurements a total number of n m n i n j equations can be formulated from eq 13 rewriting those equations in matrix form one gets 14 c α e β f where c and e are n m n e matrices the correction coefficient vectors α and β have the size of n e f is the residual column vector with size n e a more compact format is expressed as 15 g γ f where g c e and γ α β t the coefficient matrix g has size of n m 2 n e thus eq 15 becomes either under determined or over determined problem depending on relationship between the rank of g and 2 n e if g is square and not singular a direct inverse solution can be obtained the minimum norm is an alternative estimation when dealing with under determined problems although it usually suffers from solutions of no physical significance it is always expected to have more equations than the number of unknowns namely n m 2 n e in this way the unique least square solution under full rank condition would be expected from expression 16 γ g g f where g g is the generalized inverse matrix of the coefficient matrix g particularly if all non zero correction coefficients α n and β n are involved in a model updating case one defines as a complete updating case a partial updating case implies that at least one of non zero correction coefficients are allowed to be changed if two sets of correction coefficients lead to two distinct updated systems k m and a k a m where a is an arbitrary positive constant not equal to 1 although different physical understanding are associated with these two updated fe models they would result in the same eigenvalue and eigenvector in modal sense as a consequence solutions derived from these equations would adapt for both systems in fact one concludes that there must exist multiple sets of solutions for a complete updating case accordingly at least one constraint must be given to obtain a unique solution the constraints could be constant stiffness or mass matrix of a certain element or the total mass of the system though this means elimination of some possible solutions this depends on the applications and should be carefully selected 2 2 icmcm technique in general model updating methods seek to solve a system of linear equations that always encounter with the rank deficient problem this may probably be deduced by the partial updating case where the physical property of most elements remains unchanged an effective approach dealing with this is by adding more linearly independent equations in this way this problem can be effectively avoided and a particular solution can be guaranteed considering the elements of matrix g where coefficients are derived by division form see eq 10 which frequently produces possible ill determined rank it is advantageous to rewrite the expressions in difference form premutiplying eq 2 by φ i t yields 17 φ i t k φ j λ j φ i t m φ j imposing eqs 3 and 4 into eq 17 one concludes 18 φ i t k n 1 n e α n k n φ j λ j φ i t m n 1 n e β n m n φ j or 19 n 1 n e α n c n m n 1 n e β n e n m f m where c n m φ i t k n φ j e n m λ j φ i t m n φ j f m λ j φ i t m φ j φ i t k φ j analogous to this expresses eq 6 combining with eqs 3 and 4 one obtains 20 φ i t k n 1 n e α n k n φ j λ j φ i t m n 1 n e β n m n φ j or 21 n 1 n e α n c n m n 1 n e β n e n m f m where c n m φ i t k n φ j e n m λ j φ i t m n φ j f m λ j φ i t m φ j φ i t k φ j notice in eq 18 k m are symmetric that makes the two equations exactly the same when i j thus the number of added independent equations is expected to be n j 2 2 again suppose the first n i th modes are obtained from the fe model and n j th modes are extracted from experimental measurements one can rewrite equations from eqs 19 and 21 in matrix form by 22 c α e β f and 23 c α e β f where c and e are n j n j n e matrices c and e are n i n j n e matrices α and β are correction coefficient vectors to be determined with size of n e f and f are column vectors with size of n j n j and n i n j respectively it is advantageous here that more n j n j equations are obtained from eq 22 more concise expression can be taken as 24 g ˆ γ ˆ f where g ˆ c e c e γ ˆ α β t and f f f t likewise when g ˆ is square and not singular a direct inverse solution is concluded while if g ˆ is not square or is square and singular one expects a generalized inverse solution in least square sense by expression 25 γ ˆ g ˆ g f for two particular cases if one assumes the constant stiffness or mass matrix of structures α 0 or β 0 two of following equations can be derived respectively as 26 c ˆ α f and 27 e ˆ β f where c ˆ c c t e ˆ e e t f f f t note that no change for stiffness or mass matrix means extra constraints for the system thus they are deemed as partial updating cases in damage detection field e g case 2 in this paper one assumes that damage effects only on local stiffness and keeps mass matrix unchanged when all correction coefficients in γ ˆ are calculated from eq 25 one actually has completed the location and quantification of damage detection procedure since γ ˆ contains stiffness and mass change of each element for model updating the baseline fe model can be updated by applying those changes within γ ˆ which are expressed in eq 3 and eq 4 modal analysis for updated model could be executed and the comparison could be made with the experimental measurement fig 1 shows the procedure of model updating and damage detection for two numerical investigations in this paper normally relative difference of several lower order frequencies as well as the modal assurance criterion mac allemang and brown 1982 of mode shapes are adopted to evaluate results of model updating the mac is defined as follows 28 mac φ i φ j φ i t φ j 2 φ i t φ i φ j t φ j it is obvious that mac ranges between 0 and 1 where a large value of mac shows high correlation between mode shapes and small mac indicates few or even no similarity of two vectors one hopes higher mac that represents better correspondence for an updated model with experimental measurement 3 solution of the linear equations similarly to most model updating methods both cmcm and icmcm methods seek to solve a system of linear equations see eq 15 and eq 24 for simplification a standard form is written by 29 a x b where a r m n m n is the coefficient matrix and b r m 1 is the right hand side vector it is well known that there exists unique and unbiased least square solution only if a shows full rank a rank deficient situation makes possible minimum norm solutions but unfortunately it rarely leads to physically meaningful updated parameters this conclusion can be verified in the following numerical investigation of a simulated beam therefore it is always expected that the number of equations are more than the number of unknowns with full rank condition in which an exclusive solution is concluded for each a the unique singular value decomposition is formulated in form 30 a u σ v t i 1 n σ i u i v i t where u r m m and v r n n are two orthonormal matrixes matrix σ r m n has diagonal and non negative singular values σ i which satisfy σ 1 σ 2 σ n u i and v i are the i th column of matrix u and v respectively then the exact least square solution x l s for problem min a x b 2 is given by 31 x l s a g b i 1 n u i t b σ i v i where a g is the generalized inverse matrix of a small perturbation on b would bring in large deviation on solution if a has ill determined numerical rank especially when random noise is added hansen 1990 defined this as the discrete ill posed problem and concluded the success of regularization techniques such as truncated singular value decomposition tsvd or tikhonov method depends on comparative speed converge to zero between u i t b and singular values σ i which is the well known discrete picard condition in this paper the traditional tsvd method is adopted to compare results of two updating methods only the largest singular values σ 1 σ 2 σ k together with corresponding orthonormal vectors u i and v i are accumulated to calculate eq 31 whereas singular values extremely close to zero with corresponding rows and columns in matrix u and v are neglected according to this one obtains tsvd solution 32 x i 1 k u i t b σ i v i where k is defined as truncation parameter it should be noticed the importance of choosing truncation parameter k if it is fairly large the smaller singular values may have much negative effective on solution oppositely a smaller k means greater loss of some components in final solution in this paper an automated implementation for selecting k is adopted by matlab programming 4 numerical investigations 4 1 model updating of a simply supported beam first model updating of a simply supported beam is presented to verify the validity of the icmcm method and compare with the previous method the model is chosen from an experimental program to establish the relation between the damage and the changes of dynamic characteristics peeters et al 1996 the simulated beam with length of 6 m has rectangular section with size of 200 mm 250 mm a total number of 15 plane beam elements are divided with elastic module of e 33 4 g p a and density of ρ 2500 k g m 3 sectional area a 0 05 m 2 and moment of inertia i 1 66 e 4 m 4 can be computed see fig 2 herein all modal frequencies and mode shapes including experimental measurement are derived for the fe model complete mode shapes are extracted and normalized to the mass matrix the first three frequencies of the baseline fe model are computed as 9 19 hz 36 69 hz 82 38 hz when the baseline fe model is constructed with the available geometric and physical parameters the experimental measurements which would be adopted in subsequent model updating are extracted from the simulated updated fe model with a set of change on correction coefficient of each element from the baseline model the chosen correction coefficient vector α for stiffness matrix and β for mass matrix are created by product of random vector σ and τ yield normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation of 0 5 along with a preset amplification factor μ thus one obtains 33 k n k n 1 u σ n k n 1 α n and 34 m n m n 1 u τ n m n 1 β n where σ σ 1 σ 2 σ n e τ τ 1 τ 2 τ n e n e is the total element number in essence the amplification factor u represents the degree of error between the fe model and the actual structure in this case two sets of amplification factors i e u 0 3 and u 0 8 are considered as explained in section2 1 to obtain a unique solution with as many updated parameters as possible an additional constraint is implemented as the invariability of the mass matrix for element 15 which indicates β 15 0 here are two sets of chosen correction coefficients see fig 3 with settlement of the correction coefficients the frequencies and the mode shapes to be updated can be simulated thus a subsequent model updating process with respect to baseline fe model is achieved to solve eq 24 in the least square sense at least 29 equations are required which calls for appropriate selection of analytical fe modes n i and simulated experimental modes n j to achieve a system with over 29 equations some given combinations of n i n j are calculated table 1 gives the comparison of model updating results by both cmcm and icmcm method the mean value of first three order of mac as well as the relative difference of frequencies rdf are shown results reveal that the cmcm method has unstable solutions for this case when n i 15 n j 2 and n i 10 n j 3 the derived correction coefficients are of no physical significance showing several lower values of mac thus indicating failure of model updating as the realization method is not considered here prohibitively deviation of correction coefficients are found even leading to some plural solutions when n i 6 n j 5 although outstanding performance of rdfs seem to be observed when n i 15 n j 2 with a minimum rdf of only 0 0472 u 0 3 the calculated correction coefficients are proved to be tremendously different from the preset which similarly concludes a biased updated model see fig 4 meanwhile the icmcm method guarantees stable and accurate solutions with the same cases no matter how the amplification factor alters as well as combination of extracted modes higher value of mac and lower rdf are obtained furthermore the extra situation of n i 7 n j 3 shown in fig 5 highlights superiority that even fewer modes are employed satisfactory mac and rdf are still concluded the calculated correction coefficients α n and β n are also illustrated in fig 5 which exactly match the preset a rank study of coefficient matrix g and g ˆ reveals that both methods tend to see ascendant rank with more extracted modes fig 6 and fig 7 in fig 6 one finds the ranks by cmcm method correspond to mode combinations in table 1 are merely 15 the essential difference lies in the fact that no matter how to change extracted combinations n i n j cmcm results suffer from rank deficient problem where the maximum rank of 15 fig 6 is obviously not enough for a 29 unknowns equations while full rank condition are always guaranteed by icmcm method with moderate mode selection as seen in fig 7 every single curve can reach a maximum rank of 29 for a particular point of n i 7 n j 3 which already produces a rank of 29 hence there is no more requirement for modal data whatever comes from the baseline fe model or the experiment measurements in this case since rank curves reveal limitation of the previous cmcm method with capability of only 15 unknowns more constrains should be given to obtain unique and stable solution for example if all β n are set to be zeros one gets satisfactory results illustrated in fig 8 it can be concluded icmcm method effectively improves full rank condition and handles more numbers of unknowns under the same amount of extracted modes 4 2 damage detection on a jacket platform a second study is simulated by damage detection on a jacket platform herein a precise undamaged model is assumed to have been established since the model updating and the damage detection process can be explained in a similar way a comparative study on damage detection is presented this model is chosen from an early work to study damage detection from limited modal information kim and stubbs 1995 the simulated typical jacket platform shown in fig 9 consists of 36 pipe elements 16 nodes within four levels all elements with uniform modulus of elasticity e 210 g p a possion s ratio ν 0 3 and mass density ρ 7850 k g m 3 have outer and inner diameter of 17 8 cm and 16 02 cm respectively the side length from bottom to the top level are 10 97 m 8 53 m 6 10 m and 3 66 m identical height of 9 14 m is set between levels boundary conditions are defined as constraints of all dofs of the grounding nodes no mass loss is considered in this study note that model reduction or modal expansion technique are not considered here namely mode shapes on all dofs are utilized all mode shapes are orthogonal to the mass matrix the first three modal frequencies of the intact model are calculated as 4 0157 hz 4 1045 hz 4 5867 hz three damage cases are listed in table 2 including various degrees of damage with single triple and multiple locations simulated damaged elements are marked in fig 9 by calculating modal frequencies and mode shapes of the damaged structure the results calculated by both cmcm and icmcm method are derived different combinations of the extracted modes where the first n i th modes from the intact fe model and the first n j th modes from the damaged structure are discussed to avoid the effect originated by the rank deficient problem only full rank situations of the coefficient matrices are considered namely the rank of matrix g and g ˆ are all calculated to be equal to the number of unknowns since there are 36 elements in this platform which means a 36 unknown problem a combination n i n j that generates a system with equations more than the number of unknowns is considered results of the three damage cases give the same conclusion see table 3 unbiased solutions are always guaranteed when the icmcm method is adopted for the cmcm method even when full condition of g is satisfied it seems when few modes are extracted from the damaged structure e g n j 1 or n j 2 one observes large deviations between solutions and the preset damage distribution but if n j increases to 3 or above precise solutions seem to be calculated a specific illustration is presented in fig 10 where the icmcm solutions show a perfect coincidence with the preset values but a biased curve is derived by the cmcm method note that only few lower order modes can be extracted precisely and high order modes generate larger error in practical applications the cmcm method which calls for higher order modes from the damaged structure is deemed to have this defect a further study confirms that the instability of the cmcm method varies with the number of extracted modes fig 11 presents the sum of absolute error sae of all correction coefficients along with an increasing n i and a constant n j 3 within two damage cases c2 and c3 table 2 the curves reveal a general perspective of the errors calculated by the two methods as for cmcm method when the n i is no more than 16 excellent results are shown but the curves show that a larger number of n i has even negative influence on the solution n i 16 whereas the icmcm method offers stable and exact solution all the time in practical situations modal data extracted from measurements always suffer from noise contamination so that unsatisfied solutions might be derived for the particular interest of investigating the performance of the icmcm method under noise effect noise contamination is simulated by adding a series of random numbers to the extracted mode shapes at each dof formulated by 35 φ j n o i s e φ j 1 φ j max δ η where φ j is the j th mode shape of damaged structures and φ j max represents the maximum value of φ j δ is random vector with gaussian distribution of mean value of 0 and standard deviation of 1 η indicates the noise level with contaminated mode shapes damage distribution are estimated and compared with the preset values since the mode shape is most likely to be contaminated by 3 measurement noise shi et al 2000 for damage cases c2 and c3 as seen in table 2 three noise levels i e 0 5 1 and 3 are considered together with various n i n j considering the difficulty of obtaining high order mode shapes from reality n j is set to be no more than 3 to achieve statistical significance on the detection result 2000 monte carlo simulations are conducted for each parameter set the estimated mean value of damage with corresponding ε range ε denotes the standard deviation are illustrated and several conclusions are listed as follows a multiple small damages tend to be more difficultly detected than the triple damage case with the same extracted modes and noise level fig 12 shows a nearly perfect detection c2 and small quantity of fluctuations with preset value c3 compared with preset damage the solution from the both cases seem to be acceptable but note that the damage in c3 are set to be much smaller in absolute value these fluctuations may cause comparable errors and lead to incorrect damage location and quantification b the negative effect of increasing noise level are observed for all damage cases results of c2 under diverse noise levels are exhibited in fig 13 where a near perfect and less satisfactory estimation are concluded with η 0 5 and η 1 when 3 noise level is added a comparable error is found with respect to preset value it is observed that the preset damaged elements no 2 no 18 no 29 can always be found but notice that an increasing error is concluded with the rise of noise level especially in element no 2 the negative effect also reflects on those elements without preset damage the deviation tends to be greater when higher noise level is added c when high noise level 3 is introduced sufficiently precise solution could still be obtained by increasing the number of extracted modes n i n j a relative higher damaged mode n j would benefit a lower demand of undamaged modes n i for comparable accuracy fig 14 illustrates the estimated damage distribution c3 table 2 with four different mode combinations it is note the fewer modes such as n i 18 n j 2 and n i 12 n j 3 yield poor detection results however when more modes from the model are added icmcm shows nearly coincident estimations with the preset values 5 conclusions this paper proposes an improved and direct computing method of model updating named icmcm being a direct approach substantial computation and convergence problems are avoided no pairing or regularization for analytical and experimental mode shapes highlights the practicability while large amount of correction coefficients can be determined in an optimized least square sense compared with the original cmcm method two numerical studies conclude that icmcm handles more unknowns under the same amount of extracted modes and more accurate solutions are always guaranteed rank study of a simply supported beam reveals that the proposed icmcm technique is more full rank accessible and thus a unique solution of the formulated linear equations is obtained noise effect is considered and some significant conclusions are presented it is noted noise even up to 3 is added to the extracted mode shapes satisfactory results can still be derived as long as enough high number of modal information is utilized however model updating or damage detection for large structures might be difficult due to the fact that enormous correction coefficients need to be determined which calls for more n i n j at the same time one hopes that if although not always feasible more pre information is given e g location of damage or constant mass for given elements a reduced linear system could be established without demanding number of modes note that the modeling error is not considered in this paper and some insights into selection of model parameters to be updated are of great importance which normally calls for a sensitivity study in addition it is disadvantageous that icmcm method still requires complete mode shapes at each dof this problem could be studied by modal expansion or model reduction techniques in future work
