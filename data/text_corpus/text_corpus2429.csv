12145,water is very crucial for man animals and plants because of its health implications in case it is polluted water has many uses like drinking for man and animals domestic use and for agricultural use the concentration levels of cd ni and pb in borehole water of kilimambogo region were measured using the atomic absorption spectrometer aas ph was measured on site using a digital ph standard meter the use of fertilizers and chemicals from the neighboring small scale farms and the large pineapple farms could easily contaminate the water table the mean heavy metal concentration for cd ni and pb were found to be 6 4 6 9 and 42 0 ppm respectively the mean hazard quotients hq were 26 2 1 4 and 57 0 for adults and 12 9 0 69 and 27 9 for children for the corresponding elements the mean carcinogenic risks for cd ni and pb were 4 9 10 2 1 2 10 2 and 7 3 10 3 for adults and 1 1 10 2 2 8 10 2 and 1 6 10 3 for children respectively the mean metal pollution index mpi and heavy metal evaluation index hei were 10 and 934 higher than the set critical threshold value of 100 therefore the borehole sources are enriched with heavy metals and should be periodically monitored keywords heavy metal groundwater health risks kilimambogo cancer risks non cancer risks 1 introduction the need for quality and clean water by man to live healthily is normally a problem if the water sources are contaminated heavy metals are the main pollutants in drinking water that pose risks to man and animals heavy metals present in water and the environment leaves man exposed to many health risks underground water is an important source of heavy metals and is considered to be the main sources of drinking water especially in the rural kenya chege et al 2013a inhalation and ingestion of food and drinking water are the main paths through which the heavy metals from the earth s crust find their way into our bodies these heavy metals contaminate drinking water when wastes from homes industries and factories are not properly disposed from soil erosion agricultural activities such as irrigation and the application of fertilizers and pesticides salwa et al 2016 use of water that contains heavy metals for farming increases the levels of the toxins in soil and consequently to the crops grown therein via root uptake ademola et al 2015 ending up in the human body a good number of heavy metals are highly toxic as the compounds are soluble in water and get easily accumulated into animal and plant tissues bhuvaneshwari et al 2016 anthropogenic activities like iron industry mining chemical steel and smelting procedures domestic activities drainage of sewerages dumping of hospital wastes among others are the leading heavy metals sources in the environment nazir et al 2015 some elements like ni are essential for regular body functioning and growth of living creatures however when their concentrations exceed the recommended levels they may cause health risks to man animals and vegetation other elements like cadmium cd lead pb and mercury hg are not crucial to human body and are toxic even at small concentrations hence they are regarded as carcinogenic pb is highly poisonous and may cause chronic health risks such as high blood pressure abdominal pain lung and stomach cancers headache kidney damage and nerve damages cd is the most toxic element even at low concentration high exposure to cd can cause skeletal damage cancer diarrhea hair loss kidney damage dermatitis renal dysfunction itai itai disease depression koki et al 2015 or muscle function damage this study aimed at determining the concentration levels of cd ni and pb in borehole water sources of kilimambogo region in kenya and compare them with the levels recommended by international organizations like who also ph of the water was measured on site and the exposure and risk assessment due to the heavy metals determined by calculating their hazard quotient hq total hazard index thi heavy metal evaluation index hei metal pollution index mpi and cancer risks 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in kilimambogo region which lies in the boarder of machakos and kiambu counties in kenya the areas included ol and kitini villages of kyanzavi division matungulu district of machakos county and makutano magogoni ndula and ngoliba of gatuanyaga in kiambu county the fourteen falls and delmonte kenya estate are within the vicinity of ol donyo sabuk a map showing the study area is shown in fig 1 2 2 sample collection and preparation water samples were collected in the wet season from the boreholes using 1000 ml new pvc bottles the bottles were washed rinsed off with 10 nitric acid then with double distilled water and finally with the sample water on site before collection a global positioning system gps was used to record the sampling locations a portable digital ph meter was used for in situ ph measurement the samples were accurately labeled and then transported to the laboratory for preservation and analysis the samples were preserved using nitric acid to a ph of less than two and then refrigerated for at least three days before analysis acidifying water facilitates the release of metals that might have adsorbed on to the surfaces of the bottles and helps stabilize them for more than four days without refrigeration chege et al 2013a 2013b 2 3 sample analysis samples were prepared by adding 2 ml of concentrated hno3 and 1 ml concentrated hcl to 100 ml of each sample and then heated until the volume reduced to about 20 ml in the digestion process metals bound in organic or inorganic matrices are released as soluble ions hence increasing the sensitivity of metal detection by the aas the solution was left to cool filled up to 100 ml using double distilled water filtered into 250 ml conical flasks and the procedure repeated for all other samples a blank was also similarly prepared using the double distilled water using the same procedures as the samples each of the samples were aspirated into the acetylene air flame of the aas with a cathode lamp corresponding to the metal of interest as a source of light and the absorbance of light measured in each case triplicate trials were performed in each case and the average of the three values obtained the calibration curve was used to calculate metal concentration less the concentration of the blank sample chege et al 2013b the sample analysis was done using atomic absorption flame emission spectrophotometer aa 6200 at kenyatta university 2 4 water quality assessment the level of contamination of drinking water with heavy metals was determined using metal pollution and heavy metal evaluation indices the indices estimate the quality of the drinking water 2 4 1 metal pollution index mpi this indicates the overall load of heavy metals in the water samples koki et al 2015 omar et al 2015 ojekunle et al 2016 1 m p i c c d c p b c n i 1 3 where ccd cpb and

water quality classification using the metal pollution index and the heavy metal evaluation index 2 5 exposures and risk assessments due to heavy metals the exposure to heavy metals is evaluated for carcinogenic and non carcinogenic effects some non carcinogenic effects include toxicity to liver respiratory system irritant action kidneys and fertility disorders konchakova et al 2016 the key exposure pathways of the heavy metals are ingestion and dermal absorption koki et al 2015 2 5 1 chronic daily intake the daily human exposure to heavy metals through the drinking water pathway was calculated using equation 3 koki et al 2015 maigari et al 2016 sakizadeh and mirzaei 2016 sultana et al 2017 3 c d i c i i r e f e d b w a t ci is the heavy metal concentration in mg l 1 ir the

365 for adults and 6 365 for children the cdi was used to estimate the carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risks associated with water intake maigari et al 2016 sultana et al 2017 bamuwamye et al 2017 2 5 2 cancer risks the carcinogenic risks associated with the intake of the carcinogenic agents in water were calculated based on the usepa human risk assessment model cancer risks indicate the probability of a population developing any type of cancer due to intake of the carcinogens by determining the incremental lifetime cancer risk ilcr from equation 4 koki et al 2015 bamuwamye et al 2015 sultana et al 2017 4 i l c r c d i c s f cdi is the chronic daily intake of the carcinogens in mg kg bw day which is an indication of the lifetime average daily dose of exposure to the heavy metals csf is the cancer slope factors which indicate the risk produced by a lifetime average dose of 1 mg kg bw day and depends on specific heavy metals the acceptable cancer risk from heavy metal intake regulation is between 10 6 to 10 4 wangsasuluk et al 2013 the cumulative cancer risks due to the exposure of several carcinogenic heavy metals was calculated using equation 5 sultana et al 2017 5 i l

through intake of several heavy metals was determined using the chronic hazard index hi given by equation 7 maigari et al 2016 sultana et al 2017 bamuwamye et al 2017 7 h i i 1 n h q i hi should not exceed one 1 hq 5 shows a level of concern while 10 hq 100 shows that there is need for additional data gathering and monitoring 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentration of carcinogenic heavy metals in borehole water samples and ph levels the concentration levels of cd ni and pb in borehole water samples in kilimambogo region were determined the levels exceeded the who limits in all samples as indicated in table 2 the content of cd exceeded the limit of 0 003 mg l 1 in all samples ni exceeded the limit 0 07 mg l 1 in 90 of all the samples while pb exceeded 0 01 mg l 1 the who reference level in all samples the applications of fertilizers pesticides and chemicals in the large pineapple farms as well as by farmers could be a reason for the increased concentration levels of elements in water the pineapples are mainly farmed by irrigation hence the elements could easily get transported from the farms along the water table 3 2 ph levels table 3 shows the ph levels in the samples which had a mean of 6 6 ranging from 6 2 to 7 3 only four samples had values below the 6 5 the recommended minimum sample b1 collected from makandara spring had the highest ph value of 7 3 3 3 water quality assessment table 3 shows the measured metal pollution indices mpi and the heavy metal evaluation indices hei the mean mpi was 10 2 ranging from 0 0 to 16 6 and based on the water quality classification indicated in table 1 only source b3 had pure water while 80 of the sources were seriously affected the mean hei was 935 ranging from 365 to 1228 based on the water quality classification in table 1 all the measured values exceeded 100 the set critical threshold value hence the water sources in the region are critically polluted with heavy metals and are unsuitable for drinking domestic or agricultural use 3 4 non carcinogenic risks the non carcinogenic risks for cd ni and pb were determined by evaluating the hazard quotients and hazard indices for adults and children table 4 shows the measured hazard quotients hq and hazard indices hi the mean and range hq for adults were 26 2 18 1 32 4 1 4 bd 3 3 and 244 62 4 734 3 for cd ni and pb and for children 12 8

16 0 04 0 46 10 2 for children the cumulative mean cancer risks from the carcinogens for adults and children were 17 27 5 27 30 64 10 2 and 4 01 1 18 7 43 10 2 these risks were greater than the acceptable levels proposed by usepa in both adults and children 4 conclusion and recommendation the concentration levels of the heavy metals in kilimambogo area were above the levels recommended by who the risk analysis carried out using the various risk indices discussed indicated that the water sources were highly contaminated for instance the metal pollution index rating indicated that most of the measured sources are highly polluted with heavy metals this could be accredited to the anthropogenic activities like industrial activities sewage domestic wastes and robust agricultural activities in the region the hazard indices hi of all samples exceeded 1 indicating a high risk of exposure to the metals the water sources therefore need to be constantly monitored and a remedy

12146,many in situ groundwater remediation technologies have been developed among which the permeable reactive barrier prb technology has emerged as an efficient cost effective and sustainable remediation technique for the variety of contaminants in this paper a numerical model is developed using visual modflow to evaluate the performance of a multi prb system over the temporal and spatial groundwater quality variations model is simulated for a single contaminant i e chloride cl released from multiple point sources over a hypothetical study area for a period of five years 1800 days initially the model is simulated without any remediation barrier and later multiple barriers using activated wood charcoal awc as a common reactive material are introduced consecutively to contain the plume to a desirable limit various parameters such as the dimensions of the barriers and continuous pumping are taken into consideration for the performance evaluation of the multi prb system the results indicate that the performance of the multi prb system is more efficient compared to the single prb and natural attenuation system as the concentration in all the wells could be seen drastically declined with the installation of prbs thicker prb could produce better chloride removal rate due to the increase in residence time for the adsorption of chloride over the reactive media further the continuous pumping would also increase the rate of remediation for the observation wells in its vicinity however up to a certain limit furthermore the maximum efficiency of the multi prb system can be achieved at a lower depth compare to full study depth moreover the prbs adjacent to the contaminant source treat the contaminants in the plume capture zone with high efficiency than the far away prbs finally the numerical model shows that the contaminant plume containing chloride is efficiently captured by the multi prb system in the proximity of the point sources graphical abstract

over the deterioration of groundwater quality due to various geogenic and anthropogenic sources like agricultural runoff industrial exertions activated mine drainage domestic and municipal solid wastes etc chakraborti et al 2010 schipper et al 2010 wiafe et al 2013 rodak et al 2014 these sources have caused the emergence of numerous toxic and fatal contaminants in the groundwater like the chlorinated compounds hydrocarbons heavy metals etc which have gathered worldwide attention thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 obiri nyarko et al 2014 more than 400 000 sites in the usa have been severely contaminated with toxic metals such as chlorinated compounds and radioactive materials similarly over europe and australia there are well documented cases of groundwater pollution due to nitrates hydrocarbons chlorinated compounds sulfates phosphates etc national research council nrc 1994 thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 chakraborti et al 2010 the increasing concentration of groundwater contamination has not only led it unfit for drinking but also caused an adverse effect on humans animals and the environment thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 suhag 2016 these severe incidents of groundwater contamination create demand for the development of an efficient groundwater remediation technique to eliminate the higher risk to health and the environment suhag 2016 many conventional groundwater remediation techniques have been developed over the past few decades among which the pump and treat p t technology has been widely adopted for the active remediation of contaminated groundwater above the ground surface philip and atlas 2005 the p t technique is simple in application however it has low remediation efficiency and is less cost effective due to requirements of exhaustive energy and input resources usepa 2002 the drawbacks of the p t technology have ushered the evolution of many other ex situ groundwater remediation technologies like steam stripping bioremediation etc thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 interstate technology regulatory council itrc 2011 however these technologies are also unable to restore the contaminated groundwater sites completely or within the prescribed limit usepa 2002 further many in situ groundwater remediation technologies have been developed among which the permeable reactive barrier prb has emerged as a promising alternative for the in situ treatment of a variety of the groundwater contaminants such as heavy metals organics radionuclides volatile organic carbons vocs chlorinated compounds etc birke et al 2003 thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 phillips 2009 xu et al 2012 obiri nyarko et al 2014 faisal and ali 2017 the prb system primarily consists of a barrier filled with the reactive material which is placed in the path of the contaminant plume at the subsurface to provide treated water in downstream of the barrier naidu et al 2014 the reactive materials used in the prb system play a very significant role to determine the performance efficiency of the entire remediation process the widely used reactive materials in prb are zero valent iron zvi activated carbon ac limestone activated alumina sawdust pea gravel etc the most common reactive material among them is zvi which has been installed in more than 60 of the prbs worldwide interstate technology regulatory council itrc 2005 however the treatment efficiency of zvi is very insignificant in many cases due to critical issues of precipitation and clogging at certain sites thereafter ac has been applied widely for the removal of contaminants such as hydrocarbons and chlorinated compounds obiri nyarko et al 2014 in particular for the treatment of chlorinated compounds variety of ac have been used such as commercial activated charcoal cac activated coconut charcoal acc heat activated bone charcoal habc and activated wood charcoal awc mukherjee et al 2007 mohammed et al 2012 trubetskaya et al 2019 ac and its different varieties provide higher adsorption sites on their surface for the chloride and other contaminants therefore many studies have shown ac as an effective and efficient adsorption material for various organic pollutants weber and morris 1963 mukherjee et al 2007 faust and aly 2013 adsorption of various pollutants over activated carbon is considered as the best available technology bat recommended by usepa among all the available technologies adams and watson 1996 however it is found that the cacs are very costly in nature and they cannot use to treat a large range of chlorinated and other contaminants very efficiently for a longer time period akl et al 2014 therefore locally available and modified ac materials i e awc steam activated biomass soot and tire carbon black are more sustainable options for the treatment of a large number of contaminants at a lower cost kennedy et al 2004 mohammed et al 2012 trubetskaya et al 2019 the suitable design of the reactive barrier depends on many factors in which hydraulic conductivities of the surrounding aquifer kaquifer as well as the barrier kbarrier are the most significant kbarrier of the barrier must be higher than that of the kaquifer to maximize the remediation efficiency by allowing the contaminated groundwater plume to pass through the barrier under a natural hydraulic gradient kacimov et al 2011 bortone et al 2013 various studies have investigated the performance of the prb system for the treatment of different contaminants on lab scale experiments or large scale field assessment blowes et al 1998 vogan et al 1999 puls et al 1999 wilkin et al 2003 genç fuhrman et al 2007 however prior to on site prb installation the modelling of the prb design would aid in analyzing the performance of the prb system for longer time periods and simulate its behaviour under various plausible scenarios by varying factors such as the configuration of prb location and orientation of barrier contaminant properties etc zheng and wang 1999 and konikow 2011 have used the numerical groundwater modelling tools modflow and mt3dms for the flow and solute transport modelling respectively to analyze the spreading of the contaminant plume in the aquifer system for a longer duration the modflow and the mt3dms tools work on finite difference techniques such as explicit implicit and crank nicolson finite difference methods modflow has been widely used to quantitatively estimate the aquifer response concerning different input parameters mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 scott and folkes 2000 zhan et al 2009 xu et al 2012 scott and folkes 2000 mayer et al 2001 and pandey and mathur 2015 have introduced reactive barriers in their groundwater models to analyze the behaviour of plume migration through the prb system further few studies are carried out towards multiple reactive barrier multi prb systems instead of a single barrier system for efficient groundwater remediation birke et al 2007 lee et al 2010 xu et al 2012 a multi prb system as shown in fig 1 is broadly defined as a sequence of prbs placed one after another and each prb is either filled with the same or different reactive materials based on the target contaminants birke et al 2007 it can also be defined as a single barrier filled with two or more reactive materials for the simultaneous removal of contaminants xu et al 2012 obiri nyarko et al 2014 lee et al 2010 recommended the use of numerical modelling coupled with the multi prb system for the efficient remediation of a wide variety and higher ranges of contaminants xu et al 2012 have developed a model for a three dimensional flow and contaminant transport in an aquifer system subject to multi prb remediation considering different forms of a single contaminant developed in various stages of a chain reaction however they modelled the plume under the impact of a single contaminant point source in a very small area and for a short time period birke et al 2007 have explained that treating a mixture of pollutants without many difficulties is easy with the single reactive material in the multi prb system contrary the situation is very difficult arises many problems such as clogging uncertain interruption of fluid flow etc when several reactive materials used sequentially in a multi prb system nevertheless for the higher range of single contaminant it is very difficult to design and manage the hydraulics of the system and its reactive behaviour with a large thickness of the barrier the analysis of these factors and their impact on the performance of the prb system for a large area are rare to find in the earlier studies moreover the role of the location of the multiple reactive barriers was unexplored in the modelling for the prb system over a longer timeframe this paper aims to develop a multi prb numerical model using a modified modflow engine for the flow model followed by the mt3dms engine for the contaminant transport model this numerical model aims to analyze the reactive efficiency of activated wood charcoal awc as a reactive barrier material for the treatment of a single contaminant at different stages released from multiple point sources in an artificially drawn study area the study is based on the advection dispersion reaction adr equation considering the adsorption as the reaction process for the groundwater remediation from all the prbs in a sequential manner the three reactive barriers in continuous configuration are placed at three different locations from the point sources the vmod is used as a numerical modelling tool for the development of a flow and solute transport model for a multi prb system the modflow 2000 and mt3dmsv5 2 are used as a flow and solute transport engine respectively in vmod the three major aims of this paper are a to simulate the three dimensional flow and solute transport model for the remediation of a homogeneous aquifer b to analyze the removal efficiency of all the reactive barriers under the impact of various factors over space and time for the treatment of contaminants released from multiple source c to analyze the effect of continuous pumping on the removal efficiency of the prb system 2 study area a hypothetical study area as shown in fig 2 is considered for the development of the multi prb numerical model to analyze the management of the contaminated plume mahar and datta 2000 have introduced this study area for the identification of groundwater pollution sources under transient conditions later various researchers like singh et al 2004 borah and bhattacharjya 2013 2014 srivastava and singh 2015 chaubey and kashyap 2017 have adopted the same study area for dealing with different aspects of groundwater modelling the hypothetical study area covers a confined aquifer with an area of 1 04 km2 1 3 km 0 8 km and a depth of up to 30 m the details of the aquifer characteristics are shown in table 1 a continuous pumping well p is located at the center of the study area the pumping rates of the p as shown in table 2 are varied at an interval of 90 days constant time step with the maximum and minimum pumping rates m3 day being 381 024 and 163 296 respectively the boundary conditions of the aquifer are considered to be time invariant the north and the south boundaries are modelled as no flow boundaries the east and the west boundaries are regarded as the constant head boundaries with the hydraulic head m varied from 100 00 to 99 58 and 88 00 to 87 72 respectively two potentially active contaminant sources s1 s2 are placed at the upgradient of the study area the s1 and s2 sources are active for the first 360 days with varying flux after every 90 days as shown in table 3 it is assumed that chloride cl is the only contaminant produced from both the active contaminant sources the eight observation wells c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7 and c8 are spread throughout the aquifer 3 methodology the general methodology adopted for modelling of prb s is shown in fig 3 and briefly described below the first step is the identification of the target contaminant in the considered study area the second step is the development of flow and solute transport modelling for the given aquifer system for the analysis of the contaminant plume spreading throughout the area based on the identification of highly contaminated zones in the subsequent step the next step is the installation of a single or multiple prbs further the prb system is subjected to performance evaluation at every installation to check the desirability of the prb system for in situ groundwater remediation from multiple contaminant sources 3 1 assumptions in this study the following assumptions have been made a the aquifer is considered to be homogeneous b the aquifer is considered to be isotropic c all contaminant sources are producing one common contaminant i e chloride cl d the initial concentration of cl in all the wells is considered to be 100 mg l e the adsorption phenomenon is the only form of remediation taken into consideration f the langmuir isotherm is adopted for the adsorption phenomenon 3 2 governing equations the reactive transport of the solute in the aquifer was modelled using the advection dispersion reaction adr equation coupled with the flow equation in tensor notation the three dimensional transport of the solute can be represented by equation 1 zheng and wang 1999 1 c t x i u i c x i d i j c x i j m 1 n r m where c solute concentration ml 3 t time t ui velocity in three dimensions lt 1 xi longitudinal lateral and vertical distance l dij dispersion coefficient tensor l2t 1 rm physical chemical and biological reaction rates ml 2t 1 m number of reaction types that have been taken place inside the barrier the aquifer is considered to be homogeneous with the principal components of dispersion represented by dxx dyy and dzz for longitudinal lateral and vertical flow therefore equation 1 can be simplified to a partial differential equation in three dimensions with constant coefficients as shown by equation 2 2 c t u x c x i u y c y i u z c z i d x x 2 c x 2 d y y 2 c y 2 d z z 2 c z 2 m 1 n r m the chemical interaction specifically adsorption of the solute with the surfaces of the porous medium in the prb can be defined by the following equation 3 fetter 1992 3 c t v c z z d c z b d θ f k f g c

coefficient g a function that indicates the sorption isotherm the g c function is mainly based on the best breakthrough curve which could follow either the linear or the freundlich or the langmuir model it is assumed that adsorption was the only predominant process for the interaction of the contaminant and the reactive materials inside the barrier therefore equation 3 can be reduced to equation 4 as shown below 4 c t v c z z d c z b d θ f k f g c 3 3 numerical simulation of prb in this study visual modflow version 2011 1 is used for the flow and transport simulation in a homogeneous aquifer system the entire hypothetical study area 1300 m 800 m is disintegrated into smaller rectilinear grid cells of size 100 m 100 m a single layer of 30 m depth is considered in all the computational grids of the model after the definition of grid size various input parameters such as the hydraulic characteristics conductivity transmissivity specific yield specific storage effective porosity and initial head boundary conditions location of impermeable boundaries and constant heads are initialized to the model pumping well is also considered in the study which constitutes an important component of the solute transport in the aquifer system the continuous pumping effectively influences the water flow as well as the solute transport within the aquifer and directly affect the management of the groundwater system therefore over drafting of water also termed as continuous pumping from the subsurface can unenviable changes in the movement of contaminant transport in the aquifer system due to uncertain variations in the head losses in the aquifer system further due to uncertain changes in the simulation of the flow and transport model the numerical simulation efficiency of the contaminant remediation from the reactive barriers is also changed effectively the centre of the study area is selected as the location of the single continuous pumping to analyze the direct effect of solute transport in the whole aquifer due to the continuous drafting of water from the aquifer as well as the effect on the performance efficiency of the prb system modflow 2000 a three dimensional finite difference based groundwater flow modelling tool was used to simulate the flow under transient conditions the contaminant transport simulation was performed using mt3dms which followed the flow modflow simulation in order to analyze the contaminant spreading throughout the study area the mt3dms tool was defined using some additional properties such as initial concentration and two different point sources as the boundary conditions the central finite difference method under the implicit state was used to solve the advection dispersion transport in the model the combined flow and contaminant transport model was run using whs solver which works on a two tier approach for the solution at each time step further the flow and transport model is simulated for 20 time steps in the entire five years period after a successful model run for the flow and contaminant transport modelling the installation of a single and multiple prb systems is incorporated the results of the developed numerical model using visual modflow have been compared with the results of the previous studies of mahar and datta 2000 borah and bhattacharjya 2013 2014 srivastava and singh 2015 performed on the same study area the results could verify the solute transport model including the temporal distribution of concentration in the area covering all the observation wells thereafter the continuous prb configuration system followed by the developed flow and solute transport model is adopted for the chloride remediation produced from two different point sources initially the 1st prb is installed just adjacent to the contaminant source s1 and s2 followed by multi prbs 2nd prb and 3rd prb installation as shown in fig 2 the thickness of the prbs is defined as 10 m throughout the depth of the barrier i e 30 m of the study area the prbs are installed at an orientation of 90 to the contaminant plume activated wood charcoal awc is used as the reactive material in the prb system for the adsorption of the cl mohammed et al 2012 the adsorption parameters for the awc reactive materials such as adsorption capacity 3 637 g kg and adsorption intensity 0 804 l g are obtained from mohammed et al 2012 many researchers have defined that for a given prb design the discharge through the barrier increases with an increase in kbarrier permeability of the barrier relative to kaquifer permeability of the aquifer and vice versa gupta and fox 1999 therefore the hydraulic conductivity of the reactive barrier is defined as three times that of the aquifer hydraulic conductivity with a value of 5 7e 4 m s the 2nd prb is installed close to the contaminant source however at some distance to the 1st prb the 3rd prb is installed far away from the contaminant sources as well as from the 1st and 2nd prbs the numerical simulation of the model is performed in six parts a no prb installation b after 1st prb installation c after 2nd prb installation d after 3rd prb installation e after 1st 2nd prb installation together f after 1st 2nd 3rd prb installation together 4 results and discussions the results of this study are divided into five major sections i concentration analysis of the wells ii effect of prb thickness variations iii effect of pumping variations iv effect of depth variations v spatial variation of the contaminant plume at different time steps vi contaminant removal efficiency of the multi prb system 4 1 concentration analysis of the wells the variations in the concentration of chloride with time in all the observation wells for all the cases of prb installation is shown in fig 4 in case a with no prb installation the observation wells c2 c5 and c1 show the steep increase in the contaminant concentration for the initial days in the observation period due to continuous emission of the contaminant from the nearby contaminant sources s1 and s2 thereafter the concentration in c2 c5 and c1 reaches their respective maximum values and then subsequently decreases to zero until the end of the observation period 1800 days the well c5 shows a bi modal concentration profile i e having two peaks because of its proximity to the discontinuous source s2 the continuation of the source s2 for the first 180 days leads to the gradual increment of the contaminant concentration in the well until the first peak is achieved s2 is discontinued for the next 90 days leading to a decrease in concentration after 270 days s2 is re continued following which the concentration rapidly increases and attains the global peak the other wells c3 c4 c6 c7 and c8 which are located far away from source s1 and s2 show a very minimal increase in contaminant concentration with respect to time moreover they achieve their peak concentration very late 900 days after the source is deactivated at the end of the observation period i e 1800 days most of the wells except c2 c5 and c1 are not completely attenuated the continuity discontinuity of the contaminant sources near the observation wells leads to the increment decrement pattern in the concentration profile of these wells the concentration in all the observation wells declines mostly due to no continuous external recharge of contaminants from both the sources as well as continuous dilution due to pumping in case b i e 1st prb installation the similar increment decrement pattern of the concentration in the wells is observed as shown in fig 4 b when compared to the case a with no prb installation the concentration in all the observation wells drops threefold similarly the rate of increase in contaminant concentration is also decreased in all the observation wells this is evident as the time to reach the peak concentration is significantly delayed moreover the concentration profile of well c5 which is bimodal in case a shows a single peak as one of the peaks gets replaced by the point of inflection it is noteworthy here that the placement of the reactive barrier in addition to remediating the groundwater retards the contaminant plume for a longer period when compared to the case a of the absence of a barrier at the end of the observation period the wells c2 c5 and c1 show higher concentrations compared to all other observation wells due to retardation of the solute transport upstream of all the observation wells therefore the high intensity of the plume is contained in the vicinity of the contaminant sources and these three observation wells unlike other far away observation wells further the installation of a 2nd prb upstream of all the observation wells as shown in fig 4 c has been incorporated adjacent to the 1st prb location both the reactive barriers have shown almost similar results of concentration degradation with respect to time for all the observation wells however in the case of wells c5 and c2 concentration degradation is opposite for the entire observation period 1800 days in both the prbs as in the 1st prb the rate of concentration degradation of well c5 is faster than well c2 however the rate of concentration degradation of well c2 is faster than well c5 after the installation of the 2nd prb this manifests the different time period of concentration recharge in both the sources and different time of interaction of the contaminant plume with the reactive barrier as the location of both the barriers are different further the 3rd prb is placed downstream of observation wells c2 c5 and c2 but upstream of all the other observation wells i e c3 c4 c5 c6 c7 and c8 as shown in fig 4 wells c2 c5 and c1 show worse results as shown in fig 4 d as compared to 1st prb and 2nd prb however the remaining wells show the same results for all three prbs this clearly identifies the importance of the prb location for the remediation of a contaminated site after 1st 2nd prb case e and 1st 2nd 3rd prb case f simultaneous installation the concentration in most of the wells is further reduced as compared to the individual installation as shown in fig 4 e and f however due to the increased containment of the contaminant plume by the 1st 2nd and 1st 2nd 3rd prb the rate of concentration decrease in wells after discontinuity of all sources is significantly lowered with the installation of 1st 2nd 3rd prb a concentration reduction in wells c3 c4 c6 c7 and c8 is observed when compared to their concentrations during the 1st 2nd prb installation however no such reduction in the concentration is observed for the observation wells lying upstream of the 3rd prb i e c2 c5 and c1 the installation of the 1st 2nd 3rd prb does not show a significant reduction in the peak concentration of the contaminant the concentration in c2 c5 and c1 is still higher than the permissible limit of cl w h o 2011 since the third prb is placed far away from the source and therefore it lies in the downstream of the observation wells c2 c5 and c1 it plays no role in reducing their contamination this raises a critical point that the location of prb plays a vital role in increasing the remediation efficiency of the entire aquifer system the prbs which placed nearby the pollution sources are more likely to remediate the aquifer compared to prbs which are far away from the source the peak contaminant concentration in all the wells for all the four cases of the prb system is shown in fig 5 the installation of the multi prb system sequentially reduces the contaminant concentration in all the wells in case a with no prb installation the maximum peak concentration of the contaminant is observed in c2 followed by c5 and c1 due to their proximity to the contaminant sources however the other wells i e c6 c3 and c7 show relatively lower concentration the minimum peak concentration of the contaminant is observed in c8 and c4 these results reveal that the natural attenuation system of the aquifer is not sufficient to remediate the contaminant up to the required plausible limit permissible limit of chloride in drinking water thereafter the installation of the 1st prb led to a decrease in concentration at c2 and c5 along with other observation wells further with the installation of the 1st 2nd prb and 1st 2nd 3rd prb together the concentration in c2 c5 and c1 decreases more compared to individual installations of 1st prb 2nd prb and 3rd prb however the concentration in c5 drops down drastically when compared to c1 and c2 because c5 is closer to the continuous pumping location p than to c1 and c2 further the concentration in c3 c4 c6 c7 and c8 observation wells drops below the required plausible limit 4 2 effect of prb thickness variations the effect of various thicknesses of reactive barrier in a single prb system for chloride degradation releasing from the multiple contaminant sources is represented in fig 6 the barrier thickness has been varied from 1 m to 10 m it is clearly shown that the thicker prb shows better chloride degradation results than the thinner reactive barrier the thickest prb i e 10 m manifests the highest drop in chloride concentration for the nearest observation wells c2 and c5 from the source below 1000 mg l as shown in fig 6 f however the thinnest prb i e 1 m manifests a small decline in chloride concentration but the concentration is found more than 2000 mg l as shown in fig 6 a for the same observation wells the other cases of barrier thickness show the chloride degradation results in between thickest i e 10 m and thinnest prb i e 1 m it can be clearly observed that the more residence time has been provided to the contaminant plume for the thick barrier which leads the contaminant plume for better adsorption process over the barrier s reactive media compared to the thin prb 4 3 effect of continuous pumping variations three different cases of pumping variations have been observed when a the rate of continuous pumping is p as mentioned in table 2 b the rate of the continuous pumping is five times more than the current pumping i e 5p and c the rate of continuous pumping is ten times more than the current pumping i e 10p the effect of continuous pumping variations has been observed for four different installations of prbs i e without prb 1st prb 1st 2nd prb and 1st 2nd 3rd prb as shown in fig 7 it has been observed that the increase in continuous pumping rate from p to 5p leads to dilution of contaminant concentration in all the observation wells the high rate of dilution has been observed in without prb case fig 7 a e however in all other prb cases fig 7 b f 1st prb fig 7 c g 1st 2nd prb and fig 7 d h 1st 2nd 3rd prb the rate of dilution of concentration is lower due to contaminant retardation within the reactive barriers further the rate of pumping has been increased to 10p which also displays almost similar results fig 7 i j l or the same rate of dilution in contaminant concentration as in the case of 5p this exhibits the saturation of dilution rate of contaminant concentration at 5p pumping rate and thereafter the changes in the concentration are very low for all the observation wells 4 4 effect of depth variations the multiple prbs performances have been analyzed for four different depth variations between 0 and 30 m three different prb cases i e 1st prb 1st prb 2nd prb and 1st prb 2nd prb 3rd prb have been taken for performance analysis for four different depths i e 5 m 10 m 20 m and 30 m in this study all the scenarios have been analyzed at a depth of 30 m however in three dimensional modelling it is significant to analyze the reactive barrier performance at different depths in the porous media therefore the comprehensive analysis for all the observation wells has been shown in fig 8 as concentration vs time graph the degradation of contaminant concentration is very low at 5 m and 10 m depths for all the multi prb installation as shown in fig 8 a f however the pattern of rising and fall of concentration vs time graph for all the observation wells is similar to the without prb installation case as shown in fig 4 a this clearly displays the very small rate of contaminant degradation at these depths therefore for high degradation rates prb must be installed at higher depth at this particular study area further the installation of the prb at 20 m depth has significantly changed the rate of contaminant degradation compared to the lower depth as shown in fig 8 g i the contaminant concentration has come down below the required plausible limit except at observation wells c2 c5 and c1 however these wells also show a significant drop in the concertation at this depth as shown in fig 8 g for 1st prb case at the same depth the rate of degradation has increased after the installation of multi prbs 1st prb 2nd prb together as shown in fig 8 h the same concentration drop has been displayed by 1st prb 2nd prb 3rd prb installation simultaneously as shown in fig 8 i however wells downstream of 3rd prb have shown more significant changes after the installation of three prbs together compared to upstream wells this is because the contaminant plume is treated thrice before reaching downstream wells compared twice for the upstream wells the rate of contaminant degradation for all the observation wells at a depth of 30 m is similar to the rate of degradation at 20 m as shown in fig 8 j l for all the prb installations it is evident from this depth variation study that the maximum removal efficiency is achieved at a depth of 20 m therefore this study reveals that instead of going for the full depth of 30 m the maximum efficiency of a multi reactive barrier system for this hypothetical example can be achieved at a lower depth of 20 m 4 5 spatial variation of contaminant plume at different time steps the spatial variation of the contaminant plume in the entire aquifer is analyzed at four different time steps 90 days 450 days 900 days and 1800 days for each prb installation case as shown in figs 9 12 fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of contaminant plume in the case of no prb installation it is observed that with the passage of time the plume spreads and moves away from the point source the concentration intensity of the plume is at maximum near the source and radially decreases while moving away from the source at the end of 450 days the plume spread almost reaches the center of the aquifer as shown in fig 9 b the plume spreads in an oval shape which indicates that the longitudinal dispersivity x direction is higher than transverse dispersivity y direction within the aquifer at the end of 900 days the plume spread increases significantly however the strength of the plume is reduced due to lower dispersivity in the transverse direction the plumes from sources s1 and s2 overlap as shown in fig 9 c and their cumulative spread encompasses all the observation wells it is also observed that after the discontinuity of source s1 and s2 the contaminant plume moves away from their source profoundly in the downstream direction at the end of the simulation period i e 1800 days the overlapped plume has entirely left the contaminant source and moved to the downgradient half of the aquifer moreover the maximum concentration intensity of the plume is significantly reduced to 750 mg l as shown in fig 9 d the installation of the 1st prb significantly decreases the contaminant intensity of the plume at all the time steps as shown in fig 10 however the spread of contaminant plume is reduced at the initial time steps only due to the placement of the 1st barrier just adjacent to the sources the containment of plume near the source takes place as a result the plume is unable to leave its originating point sources even after many days of discontinuity of the source therefore when compared to the case of no prb installation the longitudinal plume spread is higher within the considered section of the aquifer nevertheless the 1st prb is highly effective in minimizing the overall spread and intensity of contamination in the considered aquifer system the spreading of the plume and the contaminant intensity further reduces by installing the 1st 2nd prb at a small distance away from the sources as shown in fig 11 similar to the previous case the plume does not leave the discontinuous source until the end of the observation period the prbs not only act as barriers that treat the water passing through it but also contain the contaminant for a longer time period at the upstream of the barrier the installation of the 1st 2nd 3rd prb where 3rd prb has been installed away from the contaminant source further reduces the spread and the intensity of contamination in the aquifer as shown in fig 12 the concentration of contaminant decreases below the required permissible limit of cl w h o 2011 within the entire aquifer during the observation period of 1800 days moreover the plume is completely contained between the source and the third barrier thus reducing the spread of the contaminated plume significantly at the end of 1800 days this shows that the water passing through the third barrier is completely remediated 4 6 contaminant removal efficiency of the multi prb system the contaminant removal efficiency of the multi prb system has been defined by its percentage of contaminant concentration degradation in all the observation wells after every prb installation in the aquifer the removal efficiency is defined by equation 5 5 r e m o v a l 100 c i w c i j c i w where c i w is the concentration of the ith well in mg l without any prb installation throughout the aquifer c i j is the concentration of the ith well in mg l after jth prb installation the removal efficiency of the multi prb system is evaluated with reference to the no prb installation case fig 13 shows the percentage removal of the contaminant in each observation well after the installation of the 1st prb 2nd prb 3rd prb 1st 2nd prb and 1st 2nd 3rd prb the contaminant removal starts early in wells c2 c5 and c1 as compared to other observation wells as shown in fig 13 b e a as the treated plume from the 1st and 2nd prb reach them early when compared to the other observation wells however the percentage removal curve of the 3rd prb is shown to be the lowest removal efficiency for these observation wells this is because the 1st prb and 2nd prb have been installed at the upstream of all the observation wells but the 3rd prb has been installed downstream of c2 c5 and c1 and upstream of the other wells therefore the contaminant retardation has not occurred in these upstream wells due to the 3rd prb installation nevertheless the percentage removal curves of the 1st 2nd and 1st 2nd 3rd prb is overlapped for these wells throughout the observation period because these wells are located in the downstream of 1st and 2nd prb but upstream of the 3rd prb therefore no major changes have occurred in these wells after the installation of 3rd prb however in the case of the other wells i e c3 c4 c6 c7 and c8 situated downstream from the 3rd prb the overlap of the removal curves takes place for the first half of the simulation period i e 900 days however wells c3 and c7 show the incomplete contaminant remediation after all the three prb installation at the end of the observation time 1800 days due to the lower dispersivity of the aquifer in the transverse direction and the non alignment of these wells with the contaminant source the treated plume reaches these wells very late it is observed that the percentage removal of the contaminants sequentially increased with the installation of multiple numbers of prbs the contaminated plume initially gets treated with the first prb followed by the second prb and third prb sequentially therefore the efficiency of the 1st 2nd 3rd prb is higher than the 1st 2nd prb followed by the 1st prb these results indicate the higher efficiency of the multi prbs compared to single prb in remediating the aquifer efficiently 5 conclusions this paper has investigated the in situ remediation of a homogeneous aquifer system with a single contaminant by numerical modelling of a multi prb system a hypothetical study area having two active point sources of contamination and continuous pumping is modelled modflow is used to simulate the flow model followed by mt3dms for the solute transport model three prbs continuously configured are installed at three different locations from the source the performance of the multi prb system is evaluated for a time period of five years 1800 days it is observed that the performance of multiple prbs is superior to a single prb system and natural attenuation in the aquifer processes in the case of no prb system the maximum intensity of contaminant plume is significantly higher than the permissible limit as the concentration in all the observation wells are many folds higher than the desired standard limits therefore with the installation of the 1st prb adjacent to the contaminant sources the plume concentration intensity dropped down remarkably so as the concentration in all the observation wells however the 1st prb installation is still unable to achieve the reduction up to the permissible contaminant limit consequently the second and third prbs are installed simultaneously to remediate the aquifer to achieve the essential limit of the contaminant in the groundwater since the concentration in all near and far away wells are dropped to a desired permissible value the thickness of the prb is a guiding factor in determining the efficiency of prb in the remediation of the contaminant plume the thick barriers can be provided more residence time to the contaminant plume for better reactivity with the reactive material compare to the thin prb multiple prbs with the limited barrier thickness also drop down the chances of frequent hydraulic loss and help to manage the reactive behaviour between the contaminant and reactive material when installed on the field in addition the continuous pumping also increases the remediation rate of the multi prb system for the area in its vicinity further it is observed that the depth of reactive barrier installation is also important to analyze before field installation to achieve the optimum depth of the barrier for obtaining maximum removal efficiency the depth variation in this study showed that the maximum contaminant degradation can be achieved at a depth less than the full depth possible for the study therefore on the field study the installation of reactive barriers at the right depth should lead to a cost saving by minimizing the size and number of required reactive barriers further it is also observed that the prbs which are in the proximity of contaminant source contain the plume more significantly than the far away prbs furthermore it is observed that dispersion plays an important role in governing the treatment rate of the contaminant plume for a long period of time the low transverse dispersion coefficient results in a lower treatment rate of the plume that reaches the observation wells are not aligned with the point source on the other hand the high longitudinal dispersion leads to a higher rate of plume treatment to the observation wells aligned with the contaminant source moreover the results suggest that the performance evaluation of multi prb systems is

12146,many in situ groundwater remediation technologies have been developed among which the permeable reactive barrier prb technology has emerged as an efficient cost effective and sustainable remediation technique for the variety of contaminants in this paper a numerical model is developed using visual modflow to evaluate the performance of a multi prb system over the temporal and spatial groundwater quality variations model is simulated for a single contaminant i e chloride cl released from multiple point sources over a hypothetical study area for a period of five years 1800 days initially the model is simulated without any remediation barrier and later multiple barriers using activated wood charcoal awc as a common reactive material are introduced consecutively to contain the plume to a desirable limit various parameters such as the dimensions of the barriers and continuous pumping are taken into consideration for the performance evaluation of the multi prb system the results indicate that the performance of the multi prb system is more efficient compared to the single prb and natural attenuation system as the concentration in all the wells could be seen drastically declined with the installation of prbs thicker prb could produce better chloride removal rate due to the increase in residence time for the adsorption of chloride over the reactive media further the continuous pumping would also increase the rate of remediation for the observation wells in its vicinity however up to a certain limit furthermore the maximum efficiency of the multi prb system can be achieved at a lower depth compare to full study depth moreover the prbs adjacent to the contaminant source treat the contaminants in the plume capture zone with high efficiency than the far away prbs finally the numerical model shows that the contaminant plume containing chloride is efficiently captured by the multi prb system in the proximity of the point sources graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater remediation multi permeable reactive barrier visual modflow activated wood charcoal continuous pumping 1 introduction recent years have witnessed an increasing concern over the deterioration of groundwater quality due to various geogenic and anthropogenic sources like agricultural runoff industrial exertions activated mine drainage domestic and municipal solid wastes etc chakraborti et al 2010 schipper et al 2010 wiafe et al 2013 rodak et al 2014 these sources have caused the emergence of numerous toxic and fatal contaminants in the groundwater like the chlorinated compounds hydrocarbons heavy metals etc which have gathered worldwide attention thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 obiri nyarko et al 2014 more than 400 000 sites in the usa have been severely contaminated with toxic metals such as chlorinated compounds and radioactive materials similarly over europe and australia there are well documented cases of groundwater pollution due to nitrates hydrocarbons chlorinated compounds sulfates phosphates etc national research council nrc 1994 thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 chakraborti et al 2010 the increasing concentration of groundwater contamination has not only led it unfit for drinking but also caused an adverse effect on humans animals and the environment thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 suhag 2016 these severe incidents of groundwater contamination create demand for the development of an efficient groundwater remediation technique to eliminate the higher risk to health and the environment suhag 2016 many conventional groundwater remediation techniques have been developed over the past few decades among which the pump and treat p t technology has been widely adopted for the active remediation of contaminated groundwater above the ground surface philip and atlas 2005 the p t technique is simple in application however it has low remediation efficiency and is less cost effective due to requirements of exhaustive energy and input resources usepa 2002 the drawbacks of the p t technology have ushered the evolution of many other ex situ groundwater remediation technologies like steam stripping bioremediation etc thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 interstate technology regulatory council itrc 2011 however these technologies are also unable to restore the contaminated groundwater sites completely or within the prescribed limit usepa 2002 further many in situ groundwater remediation technologies have been developed among which the permeable reactive barrier prb has emerged as a promising alternative for the in situ treatment of a variety of the groundwater contaminants such as heavy metals organics radionuclides volatile organic carbons vocs chlorinated compounds etc birke et al 2003 thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 phillips 2009 xu et al 2012 obiri nyarko et al 2014 faisal and ali 2017 the prb system primarily consists of a barrier filled with the reactive material which is placed in the path of the contaminant plume at the subsurface to provide treated water in downstream of the barrier naidu et al 2014 the reactive materials used in the prb system play a very significant role to determine the performance efficiency of the entire remediation process the widely used reactive materials in prb are zero valent iron zvi activated carbon ac limestone activated alumina sawdust pea gravel etc the most common reactive material among them is zvi which has been installed in more than 60 of the prbs worldwide interstate technology regulatory council itrc 2005 however the treatment efficiency of zvi is very insignificant in many cases due to critical issues of precipitation and clogging at certain sites thereafter ac has been applied widely for the removal of contaminants such as hydrocarbons and chlorinated compounds obiri nyarko et al 2014 in particular for the treatment of chlorinated compounds variety of ac have been used such as commercial activated charcoal cac activated coconut charcoal acc heat activated bone charcoal habc and activated wood charcoal awc mukherjee et al 2007 mohammed et al 2012 trubetskaya et al 2019 ac and its different varieties provide higher adsorption sites on their surface for the chloride and other contaminants therefore many studies have shown ac as an effective and efficient adsorption material for various organic pollutants weber and morris 1963 mukherjee et al 2007 faust and aly 2013 adsorption of various pollutants over activated carbon is considered as the best available technology bat recommended by usepa among all the available technologies adams and watson 1996 however it is found that the cacs are very costly in nature and they cannot use to treat a large range of chlorinated and other contaminants very efficiently for a longer time period akl et al 2014 therefore locally available and modified ac materials i e awc steam activated biomass soot and tire carbon black are more sustainable options for the treatment of a large number of contaminants at a lower cost kennedy et al 2004 mohammed et al 2012 trubetskaya et al 2019 the suitable design of the reactive barrier depends on many factors in which hydraulic conductivities of the surrounding aquifer kaquifer as well as the barrier kbarrier are the most significant kbarrier of the barrier must be higher than that of the kaquifer to maximize the remediation efficiency by allowing the contaminated groundwater plume to pass through the barrier under a natural hydraulic gradient kacimov et al 2011 bortone et al 2013 various studies have investigated the performance of the prb system for the treatment of different contaminants on lab scale experiments or large scale field assessment blowes et al 1998 vogan et al 1999 puls et al 1999 wilkin et al 2003 genç fuhrman et al 2007 however prior to on site prb installation the modelling of the prb design would aid in analyzing the performance of the prb system for longer time periods and simulate its behaviour under various plausible scenarios by varying factors such as the configuration of prb location and orientation of barrier contaminant properties etc zheng and wang 1999 and konikow 2011 have used the numerical groundwater modelling tools modflow and mt3dms for the flow and solute transport modelling respectively to analyze the spreading of the contaminant plume in the aquifer system for a longer duration the modflow and the mt3dms tools work on finite difference techniques such as explicit implicit and crank nicolson finite difference methods modflow has been widely used to quantitatively estimate the aquifer response concerning different input parameters mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 scott and folkes 2000 zhan et al 2009 xu et al 2012 scott and folkes 2000 mayer et al 2001 and pandey and mathur 2015 have introduced reactive barriers in their groundwater models to analyze the behaviour of plume migration through the prb system further few studies are carried out towards multiple reactive barrier multi prb systems instead of a single barrier system for efficient groundwater remediation birke et al 2007 lee et al 2010 xu et al 2012 a multi prb system as shown in fig 1 is broadly defined as a sequence of prbs placed one after another and each prb is either filled with the same or different reactive materials based on the target contaminants birke et al 2007 it can also be defined as a single barrier filled with two or more reactive materials for the simultaneous removal of contaminants xu et al 2012 obiri nyarko et al 2014 lee et al 2010 recommended the use of numerical modelling coupled with the multi prb system for the efficient remediation of a wide variety and higher ranges of contaminants xu et al 2012 have developed a model for a three dimensional flow and contaminant transport in an aquifer system subject to multi prb remediation considering different forms of a single contaminant developed in various stages of a chain reaction however they modelled the plume under the impact of a single contaminant point source in a very small area and for a short time period birke et al 2007 have explained that treating a mixture of pollutants without many difficulties is easy with the single reactive material in the multi prb system contrary the situation is very difficult arises many problems such as clogging uncertain interruption of fluid flow etc when several reactive materials used sequentially in a multi prb system nevertheless for the higher range of single contaminant it is very difficult to design and manage the hydraulics of the system and its reactive behaviour with a large thickness of the barrier the analysis of these factors and their impact on the performance of the prb system for a large area are rare to find in the earlier studies moreover the role of the location of the multiple reactive barriers was unexplored in the modelling for the prb system over a longer timeframe this paper aims to develop a multi prb numerical model using a modified modflow engine for the flow model followed by the mt3dms engine for the contaminant transport model this numerical model aims to analyze the reactive efficiency of activated wood charcoal awc as a reactive barrier material for the treatment of a single contaminant at different stages released from multiple point sources in an artificially drawn study area the study is based on the advection dispersion reaction adr equation considering the adsorption as the reaction process for the groundwater remediation from all the prbs in a sequential manner the three reactive barriers in continuous configuration are placed at three different locations from the point sources the vmod is used as a numerical modelling tool for the development of a flow and solute transport model for a multi prb system the modflow 2000 and mt3dmsv5 2 are used as a flow and solute transport engine respectively in vmod the three major aims of this paper are a to simulate the three dimensional flow and solute transport model for the remediation of a homogeneous aquifer b to analyze the removal efficiency of all the reactive barriers under the impact of various factors over space and time for the treatment of contaminants released from multiple source c to analyze the effect of continuous pumping on the removal efficiency of the prb system 2 study area a hypothetical study area as shown in fig 2 is considered for the development of the multi prb numerical model to analyze the management of the contaminated plume mahar and datta 2000 have introduced this study area for the identification of groundwater pollution sources under transient conditions later various researchers like singh et al 2004 borah and bhattacharjya 2013 2014 srivastava and singh 2015 chaubey and kashyap 2017 have adopted the same study area for dealing with different aspects of groundwater modelling the hypothetical study area covers a confined aquifer with an area of 1 04 km2 1 3 km 0 8 km and a depth of up to 30 m the details of the aquifer characteristics are shown in table 1 a continuous pumping well p is located at the center of the study area the pumping rates of the p as shown in table 2 are varied at an interval of 90 days constant time step with the maximum and minimum pumping rates m3 day being 381 024 and 163 296 respectively the boundary conditions of the aquifer are considered to be time invariant the north and the south boundaries are modelled as no flow boundaries the east and the west boundaries are regarded as the constant head boundaries with the hydraulic head m varied from 100 00 to 99 58 and 88 00 to 87 72 respectively two potentially active contaminant sources s1 s2 are placed at the upgradient of the study area the s1 and s2 sources are active for the first 360 days with varying flux after every 90 days as shown in table 3 it is assumed that chloride cl is the only contaminant produced from both the active contaminant sources the eight observation wells c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7 and c8 are spread throughout the aquifer 3 methodology the general methodology adopted for modelling of prb s is shown in fig 3 and briefly described below the first step is the identification of the target contaminant in the considered study area the second step is the development of flow and solute transport modelling for the given aquifer system for the analysis of the contaminant plume spreading throughout the area based on the identification of highly contaminated zones in the subsequent step the next step is the installation of a single or multiple prbs further the prb system is subjected to performance evaluation at every installation to check the desirability of the prb system for in situ groundwater remediation from multiple contaminant sources 3 1 assumptions in this study the following assumptions have been made a the aquifer is considered to be homogeneous b the aquifer is considered to be isotropic c all contaminant sources are producing one common contaminant i e chloride cl d the initial concentration of cl in all the wells is considered to be 100 mg l e the adsorption phenomenon is the only form of remediation taken into consideration f the langmuir isotherm is adopted for the adsorption phenomenon 3 2 governing equations the reactive transport of the solute in the aquifer was modelled using the advection dispersion reaction adr equation coupled with the flow equation in tensor notation the three dimensional transport of the solute can be represented by equation 1 zheng and wang 1999 1 c t x i u i c x i d i j c x i j m 1 n r m where c solute concentration ml 3 t time t ui velocity in three dimensions lt 1 xi longitudinal lateral and vertical distance l dij dispersion coefficient tensor l2t 1 rm physical chemical and biological reaction rates ml 2t 1 m number of reaction types that have been taken place inside the barrier the aquifer is considered to be homogeneous with the principal components of dispersion represented by dxx dyy and dzz for longitudinal lateral and vertical flow therefore equation 1 can be simplified to a partial differential equation in three dimensions with constant coefficients as shown by equation 2 2 c t u x c x i u y c y i u z c z i d x x 2 c x 2 d y y 2 c y 2 d z z 2 c z 2 m 1 n r m the chemical interaction specifically adsorption of the solute with the surfaces of the porous medium in the prb can be defined by the following equation 3 fetter 1992 3 c t v c z z d c z b d θ f k f g c

coefficient g a function that indicates the sorption isotherm the g c function is mainly based on the best breakthrough curve which could follow either the linear or the freundlich or the langmuir model it is assumed that adsorption was the only predominant process for the interaction of the contaminant and the reactive materials inside the barrier therefore equation 3 can be reduced to equation 4 as shown below 4 c t v c z z d c z b d θ f k f g c 3 3 numerical simulation of prb in this study visual modflow version 2011 1 is used for the flow and transport simulation in a homogeneous aquifer system the entire hypothetical study area 1300 m 800 m is disintegrated into smaller rectilinear grid cells of size 100 m 100 m a single layer of 30 m depth is considered in all the computational grids of the model after the definition of grid size various input parameters such as the hydraulic characteristics conductivity transmissivity specific yield specific storage effective porosity and initial head boundary conditions location of impermeable boundaries and constant heads are initialized to the model pumping well is also considered in the study which constitutes an important component of the solute transport in the aquifer system the continuous pumping effectively influences the water flow as well as the solute transport within the aquifer and directly affect the management of the groundwater system therefore over drafting of water also termed as continuous pumping from the subsurface can unenviable changes in the movement of contaminant transport in the aquifer system due to uncertain variations in the head losses in the aquifer system further due to uncertain changes in the simulation of the flow and transport model the numerical simulation efficiency of the contaminant remediation from the reactive barriers is also changed effectively the centre of the study area is selected as the location of the single continuous pumping to analyze the direct effect of solute transport in the whole aquifer due to the continuous drafting of water from the aquifer as well as the effect on the performance efficiency of the prb system modflow 2000 a three dimensional finite difference based groundwater flow modelling tool was used to simulate the flow under transient conditions the contaminant transport simulation was performed using mt3dms which followed the flow modflow simulation in order to analyze the contaminant spreading throughout the study area the mt3dms tool was defined using some additional properties such as initial concentration and two different point sources as the boundary conditions the central finite difference method under the implicit state was used to solve the advection dispersion transport in the model the combined flow and contaminant transport model was run using whs solver which works on a two tier approach for the solution at each time step further the flow and transport model is simulated for 20 time steps in the entire five years period after a successful model run for the flow and contaminant transport modelling the installation of a single and multiple prb systems is incorporated the results of the developed numerical model using visual modflow have been compared with the results of the previous studies of mahar and datta 2000 borah and bhattacharjya 2013 2014 srivastava and singh 2015 performed on the same study area the results could verify the solute transport model including the temporal distribution of concentration in the area covering all the observation wells thereafter the continuous prb configuration system followed by the developed flow and solute transport model is adopted for the chloride remediation produced from two different point sources initially the 1st prb is installed just adjacent to the contaminant source s1 and s2 followed by multi prbs 2nd prb and 3rd prb installation as shown in fig 2 the thickness of the prbs is defined as 10 m throughout the depth of the barrier i e 30 m of the study area the prbs are installed at an orientation of 90 to the contaminant plume activated wood charcoal awc is used as the reactive material in the prb system for the adsorption of the cl mohammed et al 2012 the adsorption parameters for the awc reactive materials such as adsorption capacity 3 637 g kg and adsorption intensity 0 804 l g are obtained from mohammed et al 2012 many researchers have defined that for a given prb design the discharge through the barrier increases with an increase in kbarrier permeability of the barrier relative to kaquifer permeability of the aquifer and vice versa gupta and fox 1999 therefore the hydraulic conductivity of the reactive barrier is defined as three times that of the aquifer hydraulic conductivity with a value of 5 7e 4 m s the 2nd prb is installed close to the contaminant source however at some distance to the 1st prb the 3rd prb is installed far away from the contaminant sources as well as from the 1st and 2nd prbs the numerical simulation of the model is performed in six parts a no prb installation b after 1st prb installation c after 2nd prb installation d after 3rd prb installation e after 1st 2nd prb installation together f after 1st 2nd 3rd prb installation together 4 results and discussions the results of this study are divided into five major sections i concentration analysis of the wells ii effect of prb thickness variations iii effect of pumping variations iv effect of depth variations v spatial variation of the contaminant plume at different time steps vi contaminant removal efficiency of the multi prb system 4 1 concentration analysis of the wells the variations in the concentration of chloride with time in all the observation wells for all the cases of prb installation is shown in fig 4 in case a with no prb installation the observation wells c2 c5 and c1 show the steep increase in the contaminant concentration for the initial days in the observation period due to continuous emission of the contaminant from the nearby contaminant sources s1 and s2 thereafter the concentration in c2 c5 and c1 reaches their respective maximum values and then subsequently decreases to zero until the end of the observation period 1800 days the well c5 shows a bi modal concentration profile i e having two peaks because of its proximity to the discontinuous source s2 the continuation of the source s2 for the first 180 days leads to the gradual increment of the contaminant concentration in the well until the first peak is achieved s2 is discontinued for the next 90 days leading to a decrease in concentration after 270 days s2 is re continued following which the concentration rapidly increases and attains the global peak the other wells c3 c4 c6 c7 and c8 which are located far away from source s1 and s2 show a very minimal increase in contaminant concentration with respect to time moreover they achieve their peak concentration very late 900 days after the source is deactivated at the end of the observation period i e 1800 days most of the wells except c2 c5 and c1 are not completely attenuated the continuity discontinuity of the contaminant sources near the observation wells leads to the increment decrement pattern in the concentration profile of these wells the concentration in all the observation wells declines mostly due to no continuous external recharge of contaminants from both the sources as well as continuous dilution due to pumping in case b i e 1st prb installation the similar increment decrement pattern of the concentration in the wells is observed as shown in fig 4 b when compared to the case a with no prb installation the concentration in all the observation wells drops threefold similarly the rate of increase in contaminant concentration is also decreased in all the observation wells this is evident as the time to reach the peak concentration is significantly delayed moreover the concentration profile of well c5 which is bimodal in case a shows a single peak as one of the peaks gets replaced by the point of inflection it is noteworthy here that the placement of the reactive barrier in addition to remediating the groundwater retards the contaminant plume for a longer period when compared to the case a of the absence of a barrier at the end of the observation period the wells c2 c5 and c1 show higher concentrations compared to all other observation wells due to retardation of the solute transport upstream of all the observation wells therefore the high intensity of the plume is contained in the vicinity of the contaminant sources and these three observation wells unlike other far away observation wells further the installation of a 2nd prb upstream of all the observation wells as shown in fig 4 c has been incorporated adjacent to the 1st prb location both the reactive barriers have shown almost similar results of concentration degradation with respect to time for all the observation wells however in the case of wells c5 and c2 concentration degradation is opposite for the entire observation period 1800 days in both the prbs as in the 1st prb the rate of concentration degradation of well c5 is faster than well c2 however the rate of concentration degradation of well c2 is faster than well c5 after the installation of the 2nd prb this manifests the different time period of concentration recharge in both the sources and different time of interaction of the contaminant plume with the reactive barrier as the location of both the barriers are different further the 3rd prb is placed downstream of observation wells c2 c5 and c2 but upstream of all the other observation wells i e c3 c4 c5 c6 c7 and c8 as shown in fig 4 wells c2 c5 and c1 show worse results as shown in fig 4 d as compared to 1st prb and 2nd prb however the remaining wells show the same results for all three prbs this clearly identifies the importance of the prb location for the remediation of a contaminated site after 1st 2nd prb case e and 1st 2nd 3rd prb case f simultaneous installation the concentration in most of the wells is further reduced as compared to the individual installation as shown in fig 4 e and f however due to the increased containment of the contaminant plume by the 1st 2nd and 1st 2nd 3rd prb the rate of concentration decrease in wells after discontinuity of all sources is significantly lowered with the installation of 1st 2nd 3rd prb a concentration reduction in wells c3 c4 c6 c7 and c8 is observed when compared to their concentrations during the 1st 2nd prb installation however no such reduction in the concentration is observed for the observation wells lying upstream of the 3rd prb i e c2 c5 and c1 the installation of the 1st 2nd 3rd prb does not show a significant reduction in the peak concentration of the contaminant the concentration in c2 c5 and c1 is still higher than the permissible limit of cl w h o 2011 since the third prb is placed far away from the source and therefore it lies in the downstream of the observation wells c2 c5 and c1 it plays no role in reducing their contamination this raises a critical point that the location of prb plays a vital role in increasing the remediation efficiency of the entire aquifer system the prbs which placed nearby the pollution sources are more likely to remediate the aquifer compared to prbs which are far away from the source the peak contaminant concentration in all the wells for all the four cases of the prb system is shown in fig 5 the installation of the multi prb system sequentially reduces the contaminant concentration in all the wells in case a with no prb installation the maximum peak concentration of the contaminant is observed in c2 followed by c5 and c1 due to their proximity to the contaminant sources however the other wells i e c6 c3 and c7 show relatively lower concentration the minimum peak concentration of the contaminant is observed in c8 and c4 these results reveal that the natural attenuation system of the aquifer is not sufficient to remediate the contaminant up to the required plausible limit permissible limit of chloride in drinking water thereafter the installation of the 1st prb led to a decrease in concentration at c2 and c5 along with other observation wells further with the installation of the 1st 2nd prb and 1st 2nd 3rd prb together the concentration in c2 c5 and c1 decreases more compared to individual installations of 1st prb 2nd prb and 3rd prb however the concentration in c5 drops down drastically when compared to c1 and c2 because c5 is closer to the continuous pumping location p than to c1 and c2 further the concentration in c3 c4 c6 c7 and c8 observation wells drops below the required plausible limit 4 2 effect of prb thickness variations the effect of various thicknesses of reactive barrier in a single prb system for chloride degradation releasing from the multiple contaminant sources is represented in fig 6 the barrier thickness has been varied from 1 m to 10 m it is clearly shown that the thicker prb shows better chloride degradation results than the thinner reactive barrier the thickest prb i e 10 m manifests the highest drop in chloride concentration for the nearest observation wells c2 and c5 from the source below 1000 mg l as shown in fig 6 f however the thinnest prb i e 1 m manifests a small decline in chloride concentration but the concentration is found more than 2000 mg l as shown in fig 6 a for the same observation wells the other cases of barrier thickness show the chloride degradation results in between thickest i e 10 m and thinnest prb i e 1 m it can be clearly observed that the more residence time has been provided to the contaminant plume for the thick barrier which leads the contaminant plume for better adsorption process over the barrier s reactive media compared to the thin prb 4 3 effect of continuous pumping variations three different cases of pumping variations have been observed when a the rate of continuous pumping is p as mentioned in table 2 b the rate of the continuous pumping is five times more than the current pumping i e 5p and c the rate of continuous pumping is ten times more than the current pumping i e 10p the effect of continuous pumping variations has been observed for four different installations of prbs i e without prb 1st prb 1st 2nd prb and 1st 2nd 3rd prb as shown in fig 7 it has been observed that the increase in continuous pumping rate from p to 5p leads to dilution of contaminant concentration in all the observation wells the high rate of dilution has been observed in without prb case fig 7 a e however in all other prb cases fig 7 b f 1st prb fig 7 c g 1st 2nd prb and fig 7 d h 1st 2nd 3rd prb the rate of dilution of concentration is lower due to contaminant retardation within the reactive barriers further the rate of pumping has been increased to 10p which also displays almost similar results fig 7 i j l or the same rate of dilution in contaminant concentration as in the case of 5p this exhibits the saturation of dilution rate of contaminant concentration at 5p pumping rate and thereafter the changes in the concentration are very low for all the observation wells 4 4 effect of depth variations the multiple prbs performances have been analyzed for four different depth variations between 0 and 30 m three different prb cases i e 1st prb 1st prb 2nd prb and 1st prb 2nd prb 3rd prb have been taken for performance analysis for four different depths i e 5 m 10 m 20 m and 30 m in this study all the scenarios have been analyzed at a depth of 30 m however in three dimensional modelling it is significant to analyze the reactive barrier performance at different depths in the porous media therefore the comprehensive analysis for all the observation wells has been shown in fig 8 as concentration vs time graph the degradation of contaminant concentration is very low at 5 m and 10 m depths for all the multi prb installation as shown in fig 8 a f however the pattern of rising and fall of concentration vs time graph for all the observation wells is similar to the without prb installation case as shown in fig 4 a this clearly displays the very small rate of contaminant degradation at these depths therefore for high degradation rates prb must be installed at higher depth at this particular study area further the installation of the prb at 20 m depth has significantly changed the rate of contaminant degradation compared to the lower depth as shown in fig 8 g i the contaminant concentration has come down below the required plausible limit except at observation wells c2 c5 and c1 however these wells also show a significant drop in the concertation at this depth as shown in fig 8 g for 1st prb case at the same depth the rate of degradation has increased after the installation of multi prbs 1st prb 2nd prb together as shown in fig 8 h the same concentration drop has been displayed by 1st prb 2nd prb 3rd prb installation simultaneously as shown in fig 8 i however wells downstream of 3rd prb have shown more significant changes after the installation of three prbs together compared to upstream wells this is because the contaminant plume is treated thrice before reaching downstream wells compared twice for the upstream wells the rate of contaminant degradation for all the observation wells at a depth of 30 m is similar to the rate of degradation at 20 m as shown in fig 8 j l for all the prb installations it is evident from this depth variation study that the maximum removal efficiency is achieved at a depth of 20 m therefore this study reveals that instead of going for the full depth of 30 m the maximum efficiency of a multi reactive barrier system for this hypothetical example can be achieved at a lower depth of 20 m 4 5 spatial variation of contaminant plume at different time steps the spatial variation of the contaminant plume in the entire aquifer is analyzed at four different time steps 90 days 450 days 900 days and 1800 days for each prb installation case as shown in figs 9 12 fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of contaminant plume in the case of no prb installation it is observed that with the passage of time the plume spreads and moves away from the point source the concentration intensity of the plume is at maximum near the source and radially decreases while moving away from the source at the end of 450 days the plume spread almost reaches the center of the aquifer as shown in fig 9 b the plume spreads in an oval shape which indicates that the longitudinal dispersivity x direction is higher than transverse dispersivity y direction within the aquifer at the end of 900 days the plume spread increases significantly however the strength of the plume is reduced due to lower dispersivity in the transverse direction the plumes from sources s1 and s2 overlap as shown in fig 9 c and their cumulative spread encompasses all the observation wells it is also observed that after the discontinuity of source s1 and s2 the contaminant plume moves away from their source profoundly in the downstream direction at the end of the simulation period i e 1800 days the overlapped plume has entirely left the contaminant source and moved to the downgradient half of the aquifer moreover the maximum concentration intensity of the plume is significantly reduced to 750 mg l as shown in fig 9 d the installation of the 1st prb significantly decreases the contaminant intensity of the plume at all the time steps as shown in fig 10 however the spread of contaminant plume is reduced at the initial time steps only due to the placement of the 1st barrier just adjacent to the sources the containment of plume near the source takes place as a result the plume is unable to leave its originating point sources even after many days of discontinuity of the source therefore when compared to the case of no prb installation the longitudinal plume spread is higher within the considered section of the aquifer nevertheless the 1st prb is highly effective in minimizing the overall spread and intensity of contamination in the considered aquifer system the spreading of the plume and the contaminant intensity further reduces by installing the 1st 2nd prb at a small distance away from the sources as shown in fig 11 similar to the previous case the plume does not leave the discontinuous source until the end of the observation period the prbs not only act as barriers that treat the water passing through it but also contain the contaminant for a longer time period at the upstream of the barrier the installation of the 1st 2nd 3rd prb where 3rd prb has been installed away from the contaminant source further reduces the spread and the intensity of contamination in the aquifer as shown in fig 12 the concentration of contaminant decreases below the required permissible limit of cl w h o 2011 within the entire aquifer during the observation period of 1800 days moreover the plume is completely contained between the source and the third barrier thus reducing the spread of the contaminated plume significantly at the end of 1800 days this shows that the water passing through the third barrier is completely remediated 4 6 contaminant removal efficiency of the multi prb system the contaminant removal efficiency of the multi prb system has been defined by its percentage of contaminant concentration degradation in all the observation wells after every prb installation in the aquifer the removal efficiency is defined by equation 5 5 r e m o v a l 100 c i w c i j c i w where c i w is the concentration of the ith well in mg l without any prb installation throughout the aquifer c i j is the concentration of the ith well in mg l after jth prb installation the removal efficiency of the multi prb system is evaluated with reference to the no prb installation case fig 13 shows the percentage removal of the contaminant in each observation well after the installation of the 1st prb 2nd prb 3rd prb 1st 2nd prb and 1st 2nd 3rd prb the contaminant removal starts early in wells c2 c5 and c1 as compared to other observation wells as shown in fig 13 b e a as the treated plume from the 1st and 2nd prb reach them early when compared to the other observation wells however the percentage removal curve of the 3rd prb is shown to be the lowest removal efficiency for these observation wells this is because the 1st prb and 2nd prb have been installed at the upstream of all the observation wells but the 3rd prb has been installed downstream of c2 c5 and c1 and upstream of the other wells therefore the contaminant retardation has not occurred in these upstream wells due to the 3rd prb installation nevertheless the percentage removal curves of the 1st 2nd and 1st 2nd 3rd prb is overlapped for these wells throughout the observation period because these wells are located in the downstream of 1st and 2nd prb but upstream of the 3rd prb therefore no major changes have occurred in these wells after the installation of 3rd prb however in the case of the other wells i e c3 c4 c6 c7 and c8 situated downstream from the 3rd prb the overlap of the removal curves takes place for the first half of the simulation period i e 900 days however wells c3 and c7 show the incomplete contaminant remediation after all the three prb installation at the end of the observation time 1800 days due to the lower dispersivity of the aquifer in the transverse direction and the non alignment of these wells with the contaminant source the treated plume reaches these wells very late it is observed that the percentage removal of the contaminants sequentially increased with the installation of multiple numbers of prbs the contaminated plume initially gets treated with the first prb followed by the second prb and third prb sequentially therefore the efficiency of the 1st 2nd 3rd prb is higher than the 1st 2nd prb followed by the 1st prb these results indicate the higher efficiency of the multi prbs compared to single prb in remediating the aquifer efficiently 5 conclusions this paper has investigated the in situ remediation of a homogeneous aquifer system with a single contaminant by numerical modelling of a multi prb system a hypothetical study area having two active point sources of contamination and continuous pumping is modelled modflow is used to simulate the flow model followed by mt3dms for the solute transport model three prbs continuously configured are installed at three different locations from the source the performance of the multi prb system is evaluated for a time period of five years 1800 days it is observed that the performance of multiple prbs is superior to a single prb system and natural attenuation in the aquifer processes in the case of no prb system the maximum intensity of contaminant plume is significantly higher than the permissible limit as the concentration in all the observation wells are many folds higher than the desired standard limits therefore with the installation of the 1st prb adjacent to the contaminant sources the plume concentration intensity dropped down remarkably so as the concentration in all the observation wells however the 1st prb installation is still unable to achieve the reduction up to the permissible contaminant limit consequently the second and third prbs are installed simultaneously to remediate the aquifer to achieve the essential limit of the contaminant in the groundwater since the concentration in all near and far away wells are dropped to a desired permissible value the thickness of the prb is a guiding factor in determining the efficiency of prb in the remediation of the contaminant plume the thick barriers can be provided more residence time to the contaminant plume for better reactivity with the reactive material compare to the thin prb multiple prbs with the limited barrier thickness also drop down the chances of frequent hydraulic loss and help to manage the reactive behaviour between the contaminant and reactive material when installed on the field in addition the continuous pumping also increases the remediation rate of the multi prb system for the area in its vicinity further it is observed that the depth of reactive barrier installation is also important to analyze before field installation to achieve the optimum depth of the barrier for obtaining maximum removal efficiency the depth variation in this study showed that the maximum contaminant degradation can be achieved at a depth less than the full depth possible for the study therefore on the field study the installation of reactive barriers at the right depth should lead to a cost saving by minimizing the size and number of required reactive barriers further it is also observed that the prbs which are in the proximity of contaminant source contain the plume more significantly than the far away prbs furthermore it is observed that dispersion plays an important role in governing the treatment rate of the contaminant plume for a long period of time the low transverse dispersion coefficient results in a lower treatment rate of the plume that reaches the observation wells are not aligned with the point source on the other hand the high longitudinal dispersion leads to a higher rate of plume treatment to the observation wells aligned with the contaminant source moreover the results suggest that the performance evaluation of multi prb systems is very significant through numerical modelling for a longer duration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest acknowledgment this research is fully

12147,the links between groundwater and welfare are highly contested unclear and confounded by political environmental and economic factors the lack of understanding of these links has wider implication on policies and strategies aimed at accelerating the sustainable development goals of safely managed drinking water services and eradicating poverty this study provides empirical evidence of the existing links between groundwater and poverty using welfare metrics versus productive uses of water groundwater table depth drinking water services and groundwater dependency with data obtained from a household socio economic survey n 3349 a water audit of water infrastructure n 570 and volumetric usage from water data transmitters n 300 results show that the bottom welfare households are characterized by greater dependency on shallow groundwater less acceptable drinking water services by taste reliability affordability or accessibility but not quantity productive use of groundwater for livestock accrues to the middle welfare quintiles with the bottom and top welfare quintiles by choice or exclusion having little engagement groundwater productive uses services and characteristics explain at least 17 of the variation in a households welfare with productive uses particularly benefiting female headed households these findings suggest that ancillary investments to improve affordability and reliability of rural water services will be needed to enhance welfare of the poor who depend on groundwater systems further such knowledge of the relationships between water and welfare can support the formulation of policies and strategies aimed at poverty reduction inclusive growth and access to safe water for all graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater water services welfare kenya 1 introduction groundwater plays an important role in human welfare particularly for vulnerable and marginalized populations in rural africa and asia moench 2002 mukherji 2005 calow et al 2010 however the relationship between groundwater and human welfare lacks conceptual clarity due to identification and measurement problems identification issues concern how people use different water resources surface water rainwater or vended water at different times for domestic bathing cooking drinking laundry or washing and productive livestock agriculture enterprise purposes measurement issues revolve around availability of acceptable data on the timing type and volume of water usage and the associated linkages to welfare welfare may be a broader conceptualization of the

opportunity to unlock the potential of groundwater for the poor the widespread gaps in scientific understanding on the extent nature and variability in groundwater fan et al 2013 and the systematic

well with the evidence on the functionality availability or allocation of handpumps in rural african communities furthermore there exists a scarcity of high quality studies that have examined how domestic and productive uses of groundwater shape welfare for growth and development in africa baguma et al 2017 this paper aims to contribute to advancing the conceptual understanding of groundwater and welfare in three dimensions first a conceptual framework identifies the salient components and interactions between water resources including groundwater and their association with domestic and productive water uses which in turn influences different welfare outcomes and impacts second we test this framework in coastal kenya drawing upon interdisciplinary data from over 3349 households and measured handpump usage using smart handpump technology thomson hope and foster 2012a third we map and model these relationships to estimate the share of household welfare associated with groundwater and its spatial distribution in a study area of some 2000 km2 the following section introduces the conceptual framework followed by the methodology and study site section four presents the results followed by a discussion of the three major findings followed by a conclusion 2 groundwater and welfare in this section we outline a conceptual framework of groundwater and welfare the framework has four dimensions in a schematic of the dynamic and multiple feedback loops between 1 water resources 2 drinking water systems 3 productive water systems and 4 welfare status the framing is devised in the context of the systems which are found in large parts of rural africa and asia fig 1 the water resources dimension recognizes the major flows or stocks available to people in terms of rainwater surface water rivers streams springs soil moisture and groundwater the partitioning of these resources over space and time will naturally vary and be influenced by hydro climatic variability and shocks legal and policy frameworks the political economy of allocation and regulation and enforcement systems hydro climatic variability across africa is illustrated by the east african paradox where modelling projections of rainfall patterns are not consistent with observed data particularly in the long rains season march april may which has implications for the vulnerability and exposure of millions of people and their livelihood systems in the future equally the disproportionate influence of el niño events on groundwater recharge in the short rains season october november december illustrate the spatial and temporal importance of extremes to guide policy and planning on groundwater management taylor et al 2012 2013 rowell et al 2015 lyon and vigaud 2017 existing legal and policy frameworks for groundwater management are constrained by the significant gaps in africa s hydro meteorological and groundwater monitoring systems mumma et al 2011 comte et al 2016 in turn the political economy of allocating groundwater for competing users is challenged by scientific uncertainty and water based interest groups claiming historical rights or new claims with short term demands potentially not consistent with long term resource sustainability burke and moench 2000 llamas and martínez santos 2005 hope and rouse 2013 regulatory and enforcement systems are another critical but often constrained institutional response to dealing with scientific uncertainty and significant monitoring gaps to provide the checks and balances to manage groundwater sustainably while recognizing the importance and relevance of all these dimensions here we will focus only on the groundwater resource in a rural kenyan context water resources provide stock or flows of water for drinking water systems and productive water systems moderated by infrastructure investments institutional actors and information systems drinking water systems include a portfolio of technologies with our focus explicitly interested in handpumps which we discuss further below this does not exclude the wider array of piped networks kiosks vended water or self supply sources but proposes a parsimonious approach for testing the framework below productive water systems may share the same infrastructure for small scale agriculture livestock or micro enterprises as domestic water though in bulk water demands for fisheries industry or commercial agriculture rely on separate infrastructure investments infrastructure investments may be financed in multiple ways with differing risks and returns partitioning the level and mix of public or private finance at one level self supply of domestic water may be a function of private investment in labour and some materials alternatively large industrial water demands may require hundreds of thousands of dollars of investment capital geared to the expected returns of the productive activity over years or possibly decades new financing instruments consider social and private investment returns with impact investing or green bonds providing favorable forms of finance which blend both capital returns as well as social returns such as benefits to women children or protecting environmental flows or groundwater quality trémolet et al 2010 trémolet 2011 explicit in this new water financial architecture is that performance based metrics and monitoring systems are required to document and validate the societal or private returns this reflects the progress in water information systems from remote sensing mobile based technology or digital monitoring surveillance hutchings et al 2012 thomson hope and foster 2012b here we consider smart handpumps thomson hope and foster 2012a which use mobile enabled data transmitter to send data automatically on hourly usage the institutional actors for these wider water systems is extensive across irrigation utility industrial or community typologies molle and mollinga 2003 ostrom 2009 koehler et al 2015 here we consider community water management as one sub component of this wider institutional system finally welfare status incorporates both environmental concerns of ecosystem health and status along with multi dimensional welfare concerns including income and expenditure health food and nutrition as well as the performance of indicators of safely managed drinking water services the latter provide the focus in our analysis covering the quantity quality reliability and accessibility of handpumps for different social groups 3 methodology 3 1 study site the study site is located in kwale county kenya south of mombasa and adjacent to northern tanzania fig 2 the coastal climate has a bi modal rainfall pattern with an average annual precipitation of 1200 mm with inter annual and spatial variability the coastal lowland is the wettest with the climate getting drier to the west inland and north the average annual temperatures are above 28 c gok 1985 the county has a population of over 810 000 people most of whom live in rural areas 82 with over 70 living below the poverty line of less than usd 1 25 a day knbs 2006 the study area covers 2156 km2 in lunga lunga msambweni and matuga sub counties with around 300 000 residents knbs 2010 this area includes the international tourism destination of diani beach since 2013 the pace of environmental economic social and political change has increased with the establishment of two new and major economic activities in the area kwale international sugarcane company limited kiscol has been progressively rehabilitating 5500 ha of sub surface irrigated sugarcane including the commissioning of its own sugar mill in 2015 adjacent to the plantations is the country s newest and largest mining operation kwale mineral sands project the mine operated by base titanium ltd is currently projected to export 6 5 m tonnes of titanium ore by 2028 from likoni port some 30 km north of the mine site scattered around the mine site and sugarcane plantation are around 300 handpumps generally 5 m 30 m in depth providing drinking water to communities schools and health centres 3 2 sampling frame in august 2013 a waterpoint survey identified 574 handpumps all afridevs of which 45 were non functioning foster and hope 2016 a sample of 531 handpump locations was used as a sampling frame for a household survey in 2013 14 a separate water quality assessment was conducted on the functioning handpumps documenting physical water quality parameters such as ph electrical conductivity and temperature gsm enabled transmitters were installed on the 300 operational handpumps to transmit and record daily pumping to estimate water usage and functionality thomson hope and foster 2012a at each of the 531 handpumps a stratified random sample of households which currently or previously used the handpump was produced yielding 3500 survey participants that reduced to 3349 after data cleaning a pilot survey was conducted with 19 enumerators recruited from communities across the study area who administered the survey in local languages swahili 53 8 digo 42 6 duruma 2 1 other 1 5 the main survey entailed a range of themes including demographic socio economic status of household here including livelihood concerns and subjective welfare household health status water sources waterpoint management water payments water resources management governance and political engagement all the households surveyed were geo referenced for mapping purposes ethical permission to conduct this survey was provided by the university of oxford s central university research ethics committee and research permission granted by the government of kenya s national council of science and technology kenya ncst rcd 17 013 132 september 2013 all interviews were voluntary with informed consent procedures observed in the local language data have been anonymised and stored in encrypted files 3 3 data analysis the household survey identified six major water sources used by households these included handpumps n 2126 protected wells n 94 boreholes with submersible pumps n 170 piped sources n 331 unprotected wells n 339 and surface water sources n 231 this analysis largely focused on the handpumps groundwater sources as they were the dominant water supply and we had estimates of volumetric abstraction from the gsm enabled transmitters a multidimensional welfare index was constructed using 29 indicators drawn from household composition dwelling characteristics asset ownership sanitation and health and drinking water variables the weights used to compute the welfare index were generated from principal component analysis falkingham and namazie 2002 filmer and pritchett 2001 gwatkin et al 2007 vyas and kumaranayake 2006 the welfare index ranged between 0 and 1 where households scoring higher values were relatively well off compared to those scoring values close to zero we divided the welfare index into five levels with equal range i e welfare index ranging from 0 to 0 2 q1 0 2 to 0 4 q2 0 4 to 0 6 q3 0 6 to 0 8 q4 and 0 8 to 1 0 q5 each level comprised of a wealth group which we refer to as welfare quintile 1 to welfare quintile 5 households were then categorized into the five wealth groups depending on their welfare index scores to identify household distribution across welfare space this classification was used to reflect the dimensions of welfare space and associated share of households falling into each welfare quintile we further categorized the households into three groups by a simplified typology of three economic geographies in the area 1 the southern coastal belt with people living within a 5 km strip of the sea 52 of the sample whose main economic activity is fishing 2 inland and more remote areas below the shimba hills and away from the coastal margin 38 of the sample where the main economic activity is farming and 3 the small town of ukunda diani which largely serves the tourism industry along diani beach 10 of the sample a spatial welfare map was developed using kolmogorov wiener prediction method also known as kriging to provide spatial welfare predictions webster and oliver 2007 this map was later used to evaluate spatial welfare patterns around waterpoints and estimate the generalised welfare indexes of households associated with each handpump through resampling the spatial welfare patterns to 1 km grid cells using the bilinear interpolation technique in geo statistics the result from this process was the associated mean welfare index for every handpump based on a 1 km spatial resolution the spatial resolution of 1 km was chosen taking into consideration the computed distance at which spatial autocorrelation becomes more pronounced this was determined to be 7 6 km from the moran s i statistic legendre and legendre 1998 overmars et al 2003 getis 2007 given that the spatial resolution ought to be smaller than 7 6 km while at the same time large enough to ensure that majority of the cells had at least one household represented a 1 km spatial resolution was selected monthly data on volumetric usage of groundwater from each handpump was obtained from the waterpoint data transmitters which were installed on 300 handpumps while electrical conductivity data was collected using handheld ec ph temperature testers the electrical conductivity variable was re defined as binary with cut off threshold value set at 1500 μ s cm this threshold value was based on the drinking water standards that recommend a threshold value of 1500 μ s cm who 2011 data on static groundwater depth level referred to as water rest level not influenced by abstraction or recharge was obtained from the drilling records kept at the county government s offices the records were part of a major swedish development agency sida and the world bank drilling programme in the mid and late 1980s which was one of the first installations of afridev handpumps in africa records included data on location name borehole depth casing diameter static rest water level temperature ec and yield liters per hour we then had to match these handpumps records to our own records using a number of parameters like name of borehole location on map administrative unit and borehole completion record numbers we matched about 333 handpumps which had static groundwater depth level data to our database data on groundwater productive uses such as livestock watering and crop irrigation as well as information on whether the households had access to sufficient affordable reliable safe good quality water in terms of perceived taste and distance to the groundwater source was obtained from the 2014 household socio economic survey data 4 results 4 1 descriptive statistics table 1 below shows the fraction of households associated with different variables and disaggregated by sex of respondent and household head examining household drinking water profiles reveals handpumps are used for drinking water by two in three households with one in five households also using handpumps for livestock watering household perceptions of the satisfaction with drinking water services declines from physical proximity 58 to water quality taste at 40 safety at 39 and from reliability 31 to affordability 12 groundwater fom handpumps was six times more likely to provide households with drinking water compared to piped water networks though one in four households stated that groundwater was the only water supply about one in ten households depended on piped water sources which reflected the limited infrastructure found in ukunda diani and tiwi north of ukunda areas fig 2 we found no differences in comparing scores of the female headed households with the wider sample t test all values 0 10 not reported despite the descriptive data indicating higher surface water use greater dependency on groundwater and lower affordability score 4 2 welfare distribution the distribution of households that depended on groundwater sources through handpumps by the redefined welfare quintiles in the data analysis section approximated a normal distribution with a third of households in the fourth and fifth welfare quintiles while two in every five households were observed in the first and second welfare quintiles fig 3 a the spatial welfare map identified the majority of higher welfare households located in the ukunda diani area while another cluster was observed to reside inland and south of the shimba hills national reserve in lukore and mangawani locations fig 3b along the coastline but south of the ukunda diani area were found households with lower welfare indexes 4 3 groundwater and productive uses here and following we assess the intensity of welfare in each welfare quintile by counting the sub sample of households that reported using for example groundwater for livestock watering in each welfare quintile as the numerator divided by the total number of households using groundwater sources which are handpumps n 2125 in each welfare quintile the results show that the use of groundwater for livestock watering varied distinctively across the welfare quintiles the top two welfare quintiles had almost a third of the households using groundwater for livestock watering fig 4 a in contrast the bottom two welfare quintiles were half as likely as the top two quintiles to water their livestock using groundwater albeit about a third of the households in these welfare quintiles owned livestock while fewer households in kwale county chose to irrigate from groundwater 5 we observed variability in irrigation practices across the welfare quintiles with the top welfare quintiles being almost twice as likely to irrigate compared to the bottom two welfare quintiles fig 4b as such groundwater for livestock watering appeared a potential strategy to benefit lower welfare groups though it will benefit few about one in ten households in the bottom quintile 4 4 groundwater depth and welfare results indicate increasing welfare is associated with increasing depth to groundwater fig 5 the data do not provide a means to determine causality and it is plausible that higher welfare households have been able to invest in deeper and more secure groundwater sources other confound factors maybe geography related in that households living further inland practice farming and tend to be wealthier but the groundwater sources are deeper deeper boreholes have a higher failure rate which may impose a higher financial burden on the less wealthier households depending on the deeper boreholes and vice versa the median depth provided a linear profile of greater welfare with deeper boreholes a bivariate and ahistorical correlation test suggests there is a significant relationship r 0 542 n 332 p 0 001 despite the uncertainty over the historical or political processes the data showed higher welfare households gained access to deeper boreholes though how this process occurred is not known what is more certain is that lowest welfare group rely on shallower groundwater 6 m 14 m deep which may be more vulnerable to natural or human related contamination 4 5 groundwater and drinking water services access to affordable safe and reliable drinking water roughly doubled if a household was in the top rather than lowest welfare quintile this relationship did not apply to proximity fig 6 we observed a gradual increase of the fraction of households who found groundwater sources affordable in each welfare quintile households in the top welfare quintiles were twice as likely to have access to affordable groundwater sources a similar pattern held for reliability safety but not proximity where the difference between low and high welfare access was relatively minimal and overall higher in terms of access across the five categories evaluated electrical conductivity ec was lower than the recommended threshold for the majority of households across all the welfare quintiles fig 7a however the perception of taste suggested about three in every five households had access to drinking water sources with unsatisfactory taste fig 7b about one in every five households in the first to fourth welfare quintile depended on groundwater sources as the only source for drinking water while the top welfare group had about nine in ten households depending on other sources of water fig 7c given that the denominator was the number of households using groundwater sources extracted via a handpump the intensity of handpump usage was expected to mimic the welfare profile across all the quintiles handpump usage was therefore observed to be higher among households in the third welfare quintile 29 while one in ten households used handpumps as the main drinking water sources in the bottom and top welfare quintile fig 7d 4 6 groundwater usage and welfare groundwater usage was assessed using estimated volumetric data from the water data transmitters we plotted usage against welfare quintiles which were estimated from the re sampled spatial welfare maps at 1 km spatial resolution fig 8 shows a box plot of monthly total volume of groundwater abstracted from the handpumps and welfare quintiles for 2014 there was variation on monthly volume abstracted across all the welfare quintiles with a median value of around 50 000 litres per month with the upper quartile range for the second and third welfare quintiles around three times the median mapping abstraction rates from the handpumps revealed no clear pattern fig 9 further analysis may later consider seasonal patterns to understand peak demand and also the issue of attribution between drinking water and livestock water demands over space and time 4 7 estimating the share of groundwater towards household welfare in theory the share of a household s welfare to groundwater may be modelled by regressing a range of groundwater related variables independent to the welfare index comprising here of common consumables such as tea flour cooking oil soap and dwelling condition by floor wall and roof available data focus on the unique availability of handpump usage groundwater quality and groundwater usage we acknowledge the absence of broader and widely recognized indicators of welfare including education health employment and qualitative measures of equality and capabilities the analytical challenge of reconciling appropriate temporal and scalar dimensions by broader welfare indicators across individual household and community limit the utility of a more ambitious but less tractable estimation procedure of welfare here we tackle a more constrained and simple relationship with data sources of suitable temporal and spatial coherence the estimation is multidimensional by design and a multivariable regression an extension of simple linear regression procedure is chosen the model reported in table 2 provides a general estimation for all households model i male respondents model ii female respondents model iii and female headed households model iv with a statistically significant fit f 32 625 p 0 001 the results indicate about 17 per cent of the variation in a households welfare was explained by the groundwater covariates running the model for disaggregated samples yielded similar results for female headed households 19 male respondents 20 and female respondents 17 all the models were significant p 0 01 from model i all households all explanatory variables except affordability and only source were significant positive and significant include productive groundwater uses along with water quality ec and volumetric usage shallower groundwater and living in coastal or inland zones were negative associated with low welfare and significant compared to those living in ukunda diani area for models ii and iii we observed similarities for drinking water variables but a divergence for productive uses and the water rest level female respondents differed to male respondents in positive and significant coefficients for productive uses compared to male respondents who record positive but non significant estimates in model iv the female headed households positive and significant coefficients to welfare are perceived water safety not ec and volumetric usage with productive uses of groundwater large and significant predictors of welfare shallower groundwater differed from female respondents but accorded with the full sample and male respondents as being negative and significant 5 discussion four findings emerge from the results to contribute to the wider scholarship around groundwater and welfare in rural africa and the global drive to achieve safely managed drinking water under the sustainable development goals target 6 1 unicef who 2017 first groundwater depth is related with welfare in two overlapping domains a increasing welfare is strongly associated with deeper groundwater usage and b shallower groundwater dependency has a negative and significant relationship with household welfare second productive uses of groundwater is a positive significant and comparable determinant of household welfare alongside drinking water services third across four drinking water services indicators only proximity to a handpump is welfare neutral with evidence that lower welfare groups have less affordable safe or reliable drinking water services fourth gendered differences emerge in women s different use of groundwater to men with equity implications as revealed by the sub sample of female headed households an intuitive relationship emerges between increasing welfare and access to deeper groundwater supplies the likelihood that higher welfare groups all stumble upon deeper groundwater as lower groundwater users opt for shallower groundwater seems implausible while there is no evidence of the causality or socio political or economic processes that result in this finding it is consistent with strands of literature on elite capture in relation to rural water infrastructure bardhan and mookherjee 2006 geen et al 2016 and the development economics hypothesis of poverty traps barrett and swallow 2006 carter and barrett 2006 banerjee and duflo 2011 barrett and carter 2013 evidence here suggest ancillary infrastructure to support drinking and productive uses of groundwater need to focus on drilling deeper and resilient boreholes to buffer populations during droughts and dry seasons this builds on recent work on sustainable groundwater development policies that supports standardization of borehole drilling and self supply with emphasis on institutional practices taking the lead on regulating stakeholders to adopt sustainable groundwater development approaches that will impact livelihoods positively while improving rural water services delivery rwsn 2009a 2010 multiple use systems for rural water have been documented in many countries recognizing that both productive water infrastructure such as irrigation systems or drinking water systems such as piped networks or pumped systems are commonly used by both groups meinzen dick and van der hoek 2001 renwick 2001 koppen et al 2006 smits et al 2010 often dubbed as the water pays for water hypothesis the approach has gained salience from the potential financial sustainability for productive uses to increase both the value and financial resources to manage the system though the literature shows limited evidence of this in practice wider evidence points to the potential conflict over limited water during times of drought when waterpoints may be heavily over subscribed thomson et al 2019 while these conditions rarely manifest in our study area a simplistic reading would belie the potential challenges as well as opportunities from multiple water uses the findings do underline the positive relationship between livestock watering and small scale irrigation with welfare particularly for women while irrigation from groundwater is extremely limited in both potential yield from handpumps circa 1 m3 per hour and current practices 5 of sample households livestock is more widespread 21 with widespread use of handpumps for watering at some point during the year again women seem to be engaged in or more familiar with this activity than men as a coefficient in household welfare livestock watering from groundwater is high particularly for female headed households who represent a social group of concern the welfare composition of satisfaction with current drinking water services reveals a regressive pattern of higher welfare households with affordable safe and reliable water only proximity to the handpump is welfare neutral in the sense that there is relatively limited difference between welfare quintiles and that this indicator is the highest of the four in terms of coverage these findings broadly accord with the disaggregated data analysis by the global joint monitoring program who and unicef 2017 which highlight similar inequalities in global reporting our findings imply that while implementation activities are doing relatively well in locating waterpoints near everyone the services delivered are unsatisfactory in many ways this is symptomatic of the millennium development goal mdg era of infrastructure provision without ancillary investments in institutions to manage maintain and regulate services in rural areas while the data may be read in different ways it would be consistent to think of unaffordable water leading to lower welfare groups using less safe and potentially less reliable sources the increasing recognition that universal drinking water security may not be consistent with financial sustainability is emerging as a defining challenge of the sustainable development goals where the ambition for safely managed drinking water requires monitoring of services with disaggregated data of vulnerable populations to help identify and inform improved policy and practice thomson and koehler 2016 the implication for future policy and practice is that investments in safely managed drinking water require greater institutional oversight and regulation if the benefits are to be shared by lower welfare groups gendered inequalities are an increasingly key component of national and global measuring distributional impacts of services for the poor the well rehearsed role of african women in rural water management and collection thompson et al 2001 hope 2006 is reinforced by our findings with a concern on the potential marginalisation of female headed households it is noteworthy that perceived water safety is the only service indicator of significance to female headed households welfare of the four drinking water indicators while proximity and reliability are positive they are not significant for welfare suggesting a unique and singular prioritization compared to other households equally the significance of productive uses of groundwater for household welfare is noted indicating potentially welfare enhancing measures to support women who may be situated in inland areas where farming systems are more prominent than fishery based systems along the coast the social practices which moderate and reproduce these outcomes in rural settings is not well understood or adequately addressed by this research however the findings point to the need to better understand and recognize how groundwater provision to vulnerable groups may buffer exclude or lift people out of poverty across welfare dimensions the redistributive practices of access to groundwater particularly in times of high demand or drought is being documented in kenya foster and hope 2016 2017 underlining local control and management which may or may not be equitable and sustainable what our findings point to is the potential of groundwater to support productive practices but these largely accrue to higher welfare groups potentially excluding others due to the inability to purchase livestock or limited access to groundwater while this is beyond the scope of this study it is an important and weakly understood area for further analysis this should go beyond simple binary gendered differences and be centred more broadly on processes of social accumulation exclusion or loss which better capture welfare transitions rather than imposing a politically or donor favoured social group which potentially misses people of greater but hidden vulnerabilities narayan et al 2000 hulme and shepherd 2003 mehta and shah 2003 6 study limitations we acknowledge at least five limitations to the study first the observed groundwater use data from the waterpoint data transmitters provide a major but singular source of groundwater for households others include open dug wells at the household or in the community and some springs in the shimba hills inland zone we also emphasize that the litres per month metric is a proxy and embeds livestock and minor agricultural water use we have no plausible methodology to differentiating these variable uses of the handpump without heroic assumptions second the usage provides unique hourly records over a year but this period is not claimed to be representative of the variable climate but had an average rainfall of 1862 mm which is above the long term mean of 1300 mm the application of the framework in a more arid environment will likely provide further insights in a more stressed hydrological system third poverty is multidimensional with groundwater as one component of wider health welfare and economic impacts for different user groups ancillary investments in health education energy or other sectors need to be examined to have a fuller understanding of the socio ecological nature of the extent to which groundwater interacts with poverty pathways for different welfare groups over space and time fourth we recognize the uneven nature of spatial resolution of the households across the study area this has implications on the artificial nature of the welfare predictions although we control for this through geostatistical modelling creating heat maps fifth the household survey was conducted between november 2013 and january 2014 which is during the short rains and beginning of the dry season in east africa 7 conclusion unlocking the potential of groundwater for the poor has emerged as a global science and policy puzzle increasingly unpredictable climate futures a data deficit in groundwater resource monitoring and unregulated growth in industrial agricultural and municipal demand for water is placing groundwater under unprecedented stress in the absence of a plausible theoretical understanding of groundwater and welfare interactions and impacts it is likely that vulnerable and marginalized groups may be excluded from potential developmental pathways as groundwater resources are captured by competing and more powerful users in coastal kenya we find evidence that the conceptual framing of groundwater and welfare helps understand part of this dynamic and context specific puzzle welfare enhancing approaches emerge both in terms of the type and depth of groundwater infrastructure with different domestic and productive uses of groundwater with alternative welfare outcomes for different social groups the contribution of groundwater to household welfare represents a minor but important component worthy of greater political action and oversight with advances in groundwater monitoring systems new streams of data can be marshalled with historical sources to close information asymmetry gaps and guide political action to support welfare enhancing interventions

12147,the links between groundwater and welfare are highly contested unclear and confounded by political environmental and economic factors the lack of understanding of these links has wider implication on policies and strategies aimed at accelerating the sustainable development goals of safely managed drinking water services and eradicating poverty this study provides empirical evidence of the existing links between groundwater and poverty using welfare metrics versus productive uses of water groundwater table depth drinking water services and groundwater dependency with data obtained from a household socio economic survey n 3349 a water audit of water infrastructure n 570 and volumetric usage from water data transmitters n 300 results show that the bottom welfare households are characterized by greater dependency on shallow groundwater less acceptable drinking water services by taste reliability affordability or accessibility but not quantity productive use of groundwater for livestock accrues to the middle welfare quintiles with the bottom and top welfare quintiles by choice or exclusion having little engagement groundwater productive uses services and characteristics explain at least 17 of the variation in a households welfare with productive uses particularly benefiting female headed households these findings suggest that ancillary investments to improve affordability and reliability of rural water services will be needed to enhance welfare of the poor who depend on groundwater systems further such knowledge of the relationships between water and welfare can support the formulation of policies and strategies aimed at poverty reduction inclusive growth and access to safe water for all graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater water services welfare kenya 1 introduction groundwater plays an important role in human welfare particularly for vulnerable and marginalized populations in rural africa and asia moench 2002 mukherji 2005 calow et al 2010 however the relationship between groundwater and human welfare lacks conceptual clarity due to identification and measurement problems identification issues concern how people use different water resources surface water rainwater or vended water at different times for domestic bathing cooking drinking laundry or washing and productive livestock agriculture enterprise purposes measurement issues revolve around availability of acceptable data on the timing type and volume of water usage and the associated linkages to welfare welfare may be a broader conceptualization of the

development goals targets including poverty gender inequality water climate hunger health work and growth and sustainable cities and communities with the unsatisfactory progress from the millennium development goals era africa remains a region of concern and priority as it lags behind the rest of the world while groundwater resources in africa are estimated to be two orders of magnitude greater

opportunity to unlock the potential of groundwater for the poor the widespread gaps in scientific understanding on the extent nature and variability in groundwater fan et al 2013 and the systematic data deficit reflects the uncertainty in understanding groundwater and welfare interactions and impacts the broad assumptions that access to groundwater may improve health reduce collection time for women and girls promote small scale agriculture such as food gardens or livestock or other micro enterprises haller et al 2007 hunter et al 2010 namara et al 2010 prüss ustün et al 2014 may not align well with the evidence on the functionality availability or allocation of handpumps in rural african communities furthermore there exists a scarcity of high quality studies that have examined how domestic and productive uses of groundwater shape welfare for growth and development in africa baguma et al 2017 this paper aims to contribute to advancing the conceptual understanding of groundwater and welfare in three dimensions first a conceptual framework identifies the salient components and interactions between water resources including groundwater and their association with domestic and productive water uses which in turn influences different welfare outcomes and impacts second we test this framework in coastal kenya drawing upon interdisciplinary data from over 3349 households and measured handpump usage using smart handpump technology thomson hope and foster 2012a third we map and model these relationships to estimate the share of household welfare associated with groundwater and its spatial distribution in a study area of some 2000 km2 the following section introduces the conceptual framework followed by the methodology and study site section four presents the results followed by a discussion of the three major findings followed by a conclusion 2 groundwater and welfare in this section we outline a conceptual framework of groundwater and welfare the framework has four dimensions in a schematic of the dynamic and multiple feedback loops between 1 water resources 2 drinking water systems 3 productive water systems and 4 welfare status the framing is devised in the context of the systems which are found in large parts of rural africa and asia fig 1 the water resources dimension recognizes the major flows or stocks available to people in terms of rainwater surface water rivers streams springs soil moisture and groundwater the partitioning of these resources over space and time will naturally vary and be influenced by hydro climatic variability and shocks legal and policy frameworks the political economy of allocation and regulation and enforcement systems hydro climatic variability across africa is illustrated by the east african paradox where modelling projections of rainfall patterns are not consistent with observed data particularly in the long rains season march april may which has implications for the vulnerability and exposure of millions of people and their livelihood systems in the future equally the disproportionate influence of el niño events on groundwater recharge in the short rains season october november december illustrate the spatial and temporal importance of extremes to guide policy and planning on groundwater management taylor et al 2012 2013 rowell et al 2015 lyon and vigaud 2017 existing legal and policy frameworks for groundwater management are constrained by the significant gaps in africa s hydro meteorological and groundwater monitoring systems mumma et al 2011 comte et al 2016 in turn the political economy of allocating groundwater for competing users is challenged by scientific uncertainty and water based interest groups claiming historical rights or new claims with short term demands potentially not consistent with long term resource sustainability burke and moench 2000 llamas and martínez santos 2005 hope and rouse 2013 regulatory and enforcement systems are another critical but often constrained institutional response to dealing with scientific uncertainty and significant monitoring gaps to provide the checks and balances to manage groundwater sustainably while recognizing the importance and relevance of all these dimensions here we will focus only on the groundwater resource in a rural kenyan context water resources provide stock or flows of water for drinking water systems and productive water systems moderated by infrastructure investments institutional actors and information systems drinking water systems include a portfolio of technologies with our focus explicitly interested in handpumps which we discuss further below this does not exclude the wider array of piped networks kiosks vended water or self supply sources but proposes a parsimonious approach for testing the framework below productive water systems may share the same infrastructure for small scale agriculture livestock or micro enterprises as domestic water though in bulk water demands for fisheries industry or commercial agriculture rely on separate infrastructure investments infrastructure investments may be financed in multiple ways with differing risks and returns partitioning the level and mix of public or private finance at one level self supply of domestic water may be a function of private investment in labour and some materials alternatively large industrial water demands may require hundreds of thousands of dollars of investment capital geared to the expected returns of the productive activity over years or possibly decades new financing instruments consider social and private investment returns with impact investing or green bonds providing favorable forms of finance which blend both capital returns as well as social returns such as benefits to women children or protecting environmental flows or groundwater quality trémolet et al 2010 trémolet 2011 explicit in this new water financial architecture is that performance based metrics and monitoring systems are required to document and validate the societal or private returns this reflects the progress in water information systems from remote sensing mobile based technology or digital monitoring surveillance hutchings et al 2012 thomson hope and foster 2012b here we consider smart handpumps thomson hope and foster 2012a which use mobile enabled data transmitter to send data automatically on hourly usage the institutional actors for these wider water systems is extensive across irrigation utility industrial or community typologies molle and mollinga 2003 ostrom 2009 koehler et al 2015 here we consider community water management as one sub component of this wider institutional system finally welfare status incorporates both environmental concerns of ecosystem health and status along with multi dimensional welfare concerns including income and expenditure health food and nutrition as well as the performance of indicators of safely managed drinking water services the latter provide the focus in our analysis covering the quantity quality reliability and accessibility of handpumps for different social groups 3 methodology 3 1 study site the study site is located in kwale county kenya south of mombasa and adjacent to northern tanzania fig 2 the coastal climate has a bi modal rainfall pattern with an average annual precipitation of 1200 mm with inter annual and spatial variability the coastal lowland is the wettest with the climate getting drier to the west inland and north the average annual temperatures are above 28 c gok 1985 the county has a population of over 810 000 people most of whom live in rural areas 82 with over 70 living below the poverty line of less than usd 1 25 a day knbs 2006 the study area covers 2156 km2 in lunga lunga msambweni and matuga sub counties with around 300 000 residents knbs 2010 this area includes the international tourism destination of diani beach since 2013 the pace of environmental economic social and political change has increased with the establishment of two new and major economic activities in the area kwale international sugarcane company limited kiscol has been progressively rehabilitating 5500 ha of sub surface irrigated sugarcane including the commissioning of its own sugar mill in 2015 adjacent to the plantations is the country s newest and largest mining operation kwale mineral sands project the mine operated by base titanium ltd is currently projected to export 6 5 m tonnes of titanium ore by 2028 from likoni port some 30 km north of the mine site scattered around the mine site and sugarcane plantation are around 300 handpumps generally 5 m 30 m in depth providing drinking water to communities schools and health centres 3 2 sampling frame in august 2013 a waterpoint survey identified 574 handpumps all afridevs of which 45 were non functioning foster and hope 2016 a sample of 531 handpump locations was used as a sampling frame for a household survey in 2013 14 a separate water quality assessment was conducted on the functioning handpumps documenting physical water quality parameters such as ph electrical conductivity and temperature gsm enabled transmitters were installed on the 300 operational handpumps to transmit and record daily pumping to estimate water usage and functionality thomson hope and foster 2012a at each of the 531 handpumps a stratified random sample of households which currently or previously used the handpump was produced yielding 3500 survey participants that reduced to 3349 after data cleaning a pilot survey was conducted with 19 enumerators recruited from communities across the study area who administered the survey in local languages swahili 53 8 digo 42 6 duruma 2 1 other 1 5 the main survey entailed a range of themes including demographic socio economic status of household here including livelihood concerns and subjective welfare household health status water sources waterpoint management water payments water resources management governance and political engagement all the households surveyed were geo referenced for mapping purposes ethical permission to conduct this survey was provided by the university of oxford s central university research ethics committee and research permission granted by the government of kenya s national council of science and technology kenya ncst rcd 17 013 132 september 2013 all interviews were voluntary with informed consent procedures observed in the local language data have been anonymised and stored in encrypted files 3 3 data analysis the household survey identified six major water sources used by households these included handpumps n 2126 protected wells n 94 boreholes with submersible pumps n 170 piped sources n 331 unprotected wells n 339 and surface water sources n 231 this analysis largely focused on the handpumps groundwater sources as they were the dominant water supply and we had estimates of volumetric abstraction from the gsm enabled transmitters a multidimensional welfare index was constructed using 29 indicators drawn from household composition dwelling characteristics asset ownership sanitation and health and drinking water variables the weights used to compute the welfare index were generated from principal component analysis falkingham and namazie 2002 filmer and pritchett 2001 gwatkin et al 2007 vyas and kumaranayake 2006 the welfare index ranged between 0 and 1 where households scoring higher values were relatively well off compared to those scoring values close to zero we divided the welfare index into five levels with equal range i e welfare index ranging from 0 to 0 2 q1 0 2 to 0 4 q2 0 4 to 0 6 q3 0 6 to 0 8 q4 and 0 8 to 1 0 q5 each level comprised of a wealth group which we refer to as welfare quintile 1 to welfare quintile 5 households were then categorized into the five wealth groups depending on their welfare index scores to identify household distribution across welfare space this classification was used to reflect the dimensions of welfare space and associated share of households falling into each welfare quintile we further categorized the households into three groups by a simplified typology of three economic geographies in the area 1 the southern coastal belt with people living within a 5 km strip of the sea 52 of the sample whose main economic activity is fishing 2 inland and more remote areas below the shimba hills and away from the coastal margin 38 of the sample where the main economic activity is farming and 3 the small town of ukunda diani which largely serves the tourism industry along diani beach 10 of the sample a spatial welfare map was developed using kolmogorov wiener prediction method also known as kriging to provide spatial welfare predictions webster and oliver 2007 this map was later used to evaluate spatial welfare patterns around waterpoints and estimate the generalised welfare indexes of households associated with each handpump through resampling the spatial welfare patterns to 1 km grid cells using the bilinear interpolation technique in geo statistics the result from this process was the associated mean welfare index for every handpump based on a 1 km spatial resolution the spatial resolution of 1 km was chosen taking into consideration the computed distance at which spatial autocorrelation becomes more pronounced this was determined to be 7 6 km from the moran s i statistic legendre and legendre 1998 overmars et al 2003 getis 2007 given that the spatial resolution ought to be smaller than 7 6 km while at the same time large enough to ensure that majority of the cells had at least one household represented a 1 km spatial resolution was selected monthly data on volumetric usage of groundwater from each handpump was obtained from the waterpoint data transmitters which were installed on 300 handpumps while electrical conductivity data was collected using handheld ec ph temperature testers the electrical conductivity variable was re defined as binary with cut off threshold value set at 1500 μ s cm this threshold value was based on the drinking water standards that recommend a threshold value of 1500 μ s cm who 2011 data on static groundwater depth level referred to as water rest level not influenced by abstraction or recharge was obtained from the drilling records kept at the county government s offices the records were part of a major swedish development agency sida and the world bank drilling programme in the mid and late 1980s which was one of the first installations of afridev handpumps in africa records included data on location name borehole depth casing diameter static rest water level temperature ec and yield liters per hour we then had to match these handpumps records to our own records using a number of parameters like name of borehole location on map administrative unit and borehole completion record numbers we matched about 333 handpumps which had static groundwater depth level data to our database data on groundwater productive uses such as livestock watering and crop irrigation as well as information on whether the households had access to sufficient affordable reliable safe good quality water in terms of perceived taste and distance to the groundwater source was obtained from the 2014 household socio economic survey data 4 results 4 1 descriptive statistics table 1 below shows the fraction of households associated with different variables and disaggregated by sex of respondent and household head examining household drinking water profiles reveals handpumps are used for drinking water by two in three households with one in five households also using handpumps for livestock watering household perceptions of the satisfaction with drinking water services declines from physical proximity 58 to water quality taste at 40 safety at 39 and from reliability 31 to affordability 12 groundwater fom handpumps was six times more likely to provide households with drinking water compared to piped water networks though one in four households stated that groundwater was the only water supply about one in ten households depended on piped water sources which reflected the limited infrastructure found in ukunda diani and tiwi north of ukunda areas fig 2 we found no differences in comparing scores of the female headed households with the wider sample t test all values 0 10 not reported despite the descriptive data indicating higher surface water use greater dependency on groundwater and lower affordability score 4 2 welfare distribution the distribution of households that depended on groundwater sources through handpumps by the redefined welfare quintiles in the data analysis section approximated a normal distribution with a third of households in the fourth and fifth welfare quintiles while two in every five households were observed in the first and second welfare quintiles fig 3 a the spatial welfare map identified the majority of higher welfare households located in the ukunda diani area while another cluster was observed to reside inland and south of the shimba hills national reserve in lukore and mangawani locations fig 3b along the coastline but south of the ukunda diani area were found households with lower welfare indexes 4 3 groundwater and productive uses here and following we assess the intensity of welfare in each welfare quintile by counting the sub sample of households that reported using for example groundwater for livestock watering in each welfare quintile as the numerator divided by the total number of households using groundwater sources which are handpumps n 2125 in each welfare quintile the results show that the use of groundwater for livestock watering varied distinctively across the welfare quintiles the top two welfare quintiles had almost a third of the households using groundwater for livestock watering fig 4 a in contrast the bottom two welfare quintiles were half as likely as the top two quintiles to water their livestock using groundwater albeit about a third of the households in these welfare quintiles owned livestock while fewer households in kwale county chose to irrigate from groundwater 5 we observed variability in irrigation practices across the welfare quintiles with the top welfare quintiles being almost twice as likely to irrigate compared to the bottom two welfare quintiles fig 4b as such groundwater for livestock watering appeared a potential strategy to benefit lower welfare groups though it will benefit few about one in ten households in the bottom quintile 4 4 groundwater depth and welfare results indicate increasing welfare is associated with increasing depth to groundwater fig 5 the data do not provide a means to determine causality and it is plausible that higher welfare households have been able to invest in deeper and more secure groundwater sources other confound factors maybe geography related in that households living further inland practice farming and tend to be wealthier but the groundwater sources are deeper deeper boreholes have a higher failure rate which may impose a higher financial burden on the less wealthier households depending on the deeper boreholes and vice versa the median depth provided a linear profile of greater welfare with deeper boreholes a bivariate and ahistorical correlation test suggests there is a significant relationship r 0 542 n 332 p 0 001 despite the uncertainty over the historical or political processes the data showed higher welfare households gained access to deeper boreholes though how this process occurred is not known what is more certain is that lowest welfare group rely on shallower groundwater 6 m 14 m deep which may be more vulnerable to natural or human related contamination 4 5 groundwater and drinking water services access to affordable safe and reliable drinking water roughly doubled if a household was in the top rather than lowest welfare quintile this relationship did not apply to proximity fig 6 we observed a gradual increase of the fraction of households who found groundwater sources affordable in each welfare quintile households in the top welfare quintiles were twice as likely to have access to affordable groundwater sources a similar pattern held for reliability safety but not proximity where the difference between low and high welfare access was relatively minimal and overall higher in terms of access across the five categories evaluated electrical conductivity ec was lower than the recommended threshold for the majority of households across all the welfare quintiles fig 7a however the perception of taste suggested about three in every five households had access to drinking water sources with unsatisfactory taste fig 7b about one in every five households in the first to fourth welfare quintile depended on groundwater sources as the only source for drinking water while the top welfare group had about nine in ten households depending on other sources of water fig 7c given that the denominator was the number of households using groundwater sources extracted via a handpump the intensity of handpump usage was expected to mimic the welfare profile across all the quintiles handpump usage was therefore observed to be higher among households in the third welfare quintile 29 while one in ten households used handpumps as the main drinking water sources in the bottom and top welfare quintile fig 7d 4 6 groundwater usage and welfare groundwater usage was assessed using estimated volumetric data from the water data transmitters we plotted usage against welfare quintiles which were estimated from the re sampled spatial welfare maps at 1 km spatial resolution fig 8 shows a box plot of monthly total volume of groundwater abstracted from the handpumps and welfare quintiles for 2014 there was variation on monthly volume abstracted across all the welfare quintiles with a median value of around 50 000 litres per month with the upper quartile range for the second and third welfare quintiles around three times the median mapping abstraction rates from the handpumps revealed no clear pattern fig 9 further analysis may later consider seasonal patterns to understand peak demand and also the issue of attribution between drinking water and livestock water demands over space and time 4 7 estimating the share of groundwater towards household welfare in theory the share of a household s welfare to groundwater may be modelled by regressing a range of groundwater related variables independent to the welfare index comprising here of common consumables such as tea flour cooking oil soap and dwelling condition by floor wall and roof available data focus on the unique availability of handpump usage groundwater quality and groundwater usage we acknowledge the absence of broader and widely recognized indicators of welfare including education health employment and qualitative measures of equality and capabilities the analytical challenge of reconciling appropriate temporal and scalar dimensions by broader welfare indicators across individual household and community limit the utility of a more ambitious but less tractable estimation procedure of welfare here we tackle a more constrained and simple relationship with data sources of suitable temporal and spatial coherence the estimation is multidimensional by design and a multivariable regression an extension of simple linear regression procedure is chosen the model reported in table 2 provides a general estimation for all households model i male respondents model ii female respondents model iii and female headed households model iv with a statistically significant fit f 32 625 p 0 001 the results indicate about 17 per cent of the variation in a households welfare was explained by the groundwater covariates running the model for disaggregated samples yielded similar results for female headed households 19 male respondents 20 and female respondents 17 all the models were significant p 0 01 from model i all households all explanatory variables except affordability and only source were significant positive and significant include productive groundwater uses along with water quality ec and volumetric usage shallower groundwater and living in coastal or inland zones were negative associated with low welfare and significant compared to those living in ukunda diani area for models ii and iii we observed similarities for drinking water variables but a divergence for productive uses and the water rest level female respondents differed to male respondents in positive and significant coefficients for productive uses compared to male respondents who record positive but non significant estimates in model iv the female headed households positive and significant coefficients to welfare are perceived water safety not ec and volumetric usage with productive uses of groundwater large and significant predictors of welfare shallower groundwater differed from female respondents but accorded with the full sample and male respondents as being negative and significant 5 discussion four findings emerge from the results to contribute to the wider scholarship around groundwater and welfare in rural africa and the global drive to achieve safely managed drinking water under the sustainable development goals target 6 1 unicef who 2017 first groundwater depth is related with welfare in two overlapping domains a increasing welfare is strongly associated with deeper groundwater usage and b shallower groundwater dependency has a negative and significant relationship with household welfare second productive uses of groundwater is a positive significant and comparable determinant of household welfare alongside drinking water services third across four drinking water services indicators only proximity to a handpump is welfare neutral with evidence that lower welfare groups have less affordable safe or reliable drinking water services fourth gendered differences emerge in women s different use of groundwater to men with equity implications as revealed by the sub sample of female headed households an intuitive relationship emerges between increasing welfare and access to deeper groundwater supplies the likelihood that higher welfare groups all stumble upon deeper groundwater as lower groundwater users opt for shallower groundwater seems implausible while there is no evidence of the causality or socio political or economic processes that result in this finding it is consistent with strands of literature on elite capture in relation to rural water infrastructure bardhan and mookherjee 2006 geen et al 2016 and the development economics hypothesis of poverty traps barrett and swallow 2006 carter and barrett 2006 banerjee and duflo 2011 barrett and carter 2013 evidence here suggest ancillary infrastructure to support drinking and productive uses of groundwater need to focus on drilling deeper and resilient boreholes to buffer populations during droughts and dry seasons this builds on recent work on

by both groups meinzen dick and van der hoek 2001 renwick 2001 koppen et al 2006 smits et al 2010 often dubbed as the water pays for water hypothesis the approach has gained salience from the potential financial sustainability for productive uses to increase both the value and financial resources to manage the system though the literature shows limited evidence of this in practice wider evidence points to the potential conflict over limited water during times of drought when waterpoints may be heavily over subscribed thomson et al 2019 while these conditions rarely manifest in our study area a simplistic reading would belie the potential challenges as well as opportunities from multiple water uses the findings do underline the positive relationship between livestock watering and small scale irrigation with welfare particularly for women while irrigation from groundwater is extremely limited in both potential yield from handpumps circa 1 m3 per hour and current practices 5 of sample households livestock is more widespread 21 with widespread use of handpumps for watering at some point during the year again women seem to be engaged in or more familiar with this activity than men as a coefficient in household welfare livestock watering from groundwater is high particularly for female headed households who represent a social group of concern the welfare composition of satisfaction with current drinking water services reveals a regressive pattern of higher welfare households with affordable safe and reliable water only proximity to the handpump is welfare neutral in the sense that there is relatively limited difference between welfare quintiles and that this indicator is the highest of the four in terms of coverage these findings broadly accord with the disaggregated data analysis by the global joint monitoring program who and unicef 2017 which highlight similar inequalities in global reporting our findings imply that while implementation activities are doing relatively well in locating waterpoints near everyone the services delivered are unsatisfactory in many ways this is symptomatic of the millennium development goal mdg era of infrastructure provision without ancillary investments in institutions to manage maintain and regulate services in rural areas while the data may be read in different ways it would be consistent to think of unaffordable water leading to lower welfare groups using less safe and potentially less reliable sources the increasing recognition that universal drinking water security may not be consistent with financial sustainability is emerging as a defining challenge of the sustainable development goals where the ambition for safely managed drinking water requires monitoring of services with disaggregated data of vulnerable populations to help identify and inform improved policy and practice thomson and koehler 2016 the implication for future policy and practice is that investments in safely managed drinking water require greater institutional oversight and regulation if the benefits are to be shared by lower welfare groups gendered inequalities are an increasingly key component of national and global measuring distributional impacts of services for the poor the well rehearsed role of african women in rural water management and collection thompson et al 2001 hope 2006 is reinforced by our findings with a concern on the potential marginalisation of female headed households it is noteworthy that perceived water safety is the only service indicator of significance to female headed households welfare of the four drinking water indicators while proximity and reliability are positive they are not significant for welfare suggesting a unique and singular prioritization compared to other households equally the significance of productive uses of groundwater for household welfare is noted indicating potentially welfare enhancing measures to support women who may be situated in inland areas where farming systems are more prominent than fishery based systems along the coast the social practices which moderate and reproduce these outcomes in rural settings is not well understood or adequately addressed by this research however the findings point to the need to better understand and recognize how groundwater provision to vulnerable groups may buffer exclude or lift people out of poverty across welfare dimensions the redistributive practices of access to groundwater particularly in times of high demand or drought is being documented in kenya foster and hope 2016 2017 underlining local control and management which may or may not be equitable and sustainable what our findings point to is the potential of groundwater to support productive practices but these largely accrue to higher welfare groups potentially excluding others due to the inability to purchase livestock or limited access to groundwater while this is beyond the scope of this study it is an important and weakly understood area for further analysis this should go beyond simple binary gendered differences and be centred more broadly on processes of social accumulation exclusion or loss which better capture welfare transitions rather than imposing a politically or donor favoured social group which potentially misses people of greater but hidden vulnerabilities narayan et al 2000 hulme and shepherd 2003 mehta and shah 2003 6 study limitations we acknowledge at least five limitations to the study first the observed groundwater use data from the waterpoint data transmitters provide a major but singular source of groundwater for households others include open dug wells at the household or in the community and some springs in the shimba hills inland zone we also emphasize that the litres per month metric is a proxy and embeds livestock and minor agricultural water use we have no plausible methodology to differentiating these variable uses of the handpump without heroic assumptions second the usage provides unique hourly records over a year but this period is not claimed to be representative of the variable climate but had an average rainfall of 1862 mm which is above the long term mean of 1300 mm the application of the framework in a more arid environment will likely provide further insights in a more stressed hydrological system third poverty is multidimensional with groundwater as one component of wider health welfare and economic impacts for different user groups ancillary investments in health education energy or other sectors need to be examined to have a fuller understanding of the socio ecological nature of the extent to which groundwater interacts with poverty pathways for different welfare groups over space and time fourth we recognize the uneven nature of spatial resolution of the households across the study area this has implications on the artificial nature of the welfare predictions although we control for this through geostatistical modelling creating heat maps fifth the household survey was conducted between november 2013 and january 2014 which is during the short rains and beginning of the dry season in east africa 7 conclusion unlocking the potential of groundwater for the poor has emerged as a global science and policy puzzle increasingly unpredictable climate futures a data deficit in groundwater resource monitoring and unregulated growth in industrial agricultural and municipal demand for water is placing groundwater under unprecedented stress in the absence of a plausible theoretical understanding of groundwater and welfare interactions and impacts it is likely that vulnerable and marginalized groups may be excluded from potential developmental pathways as groundwater resources are captured by competing and more powerful users in coastal kenya we find evidence that the conceptual framing of groundwater and welfare helps understand part of this dynamic and context specific puzzle welfare enhancing approaches emerge both in terms of the type and depth of groundwater infrastructure with different domestic and productive uses of groundwater with alternative welfare outcomes for different social groups the contribution of groundwater to household welfare represents a minor but important component worthy of greater political action and oversight with advances in groundwater monitoring systems new streams of data can be marshalled with historical sources to close information asymmetry gaps and guide political action to support welfare enhancing interventions

26 2017 the daily average wind speed during the testing of the pss without insulation was recorded as 1 5 2 m s and with insulation was recorded as 1 4 1 6 m s it is noted that during the operation of the pss under the condition of without insulation there is a higher wind speed and it increased the heat transfer rate from the collector surface to the environment which resulted in enhancement in condensation rate it is noted that the ambient temperature for the period of the midday is the highest and the maximum temperature is recorded as 39 c the daily average ambient temperature during the testing of the pss without and with insulation was recorded as 34 to 35 c and 35 to 36 c respectively 3 2 hourly variations of water and basin temperature for the pss with and without insulation condition fig 3 a and b shows the variations of water temperature of the pss without and with insulation effect for different water depth condition from the experimental results of the pss without insulation it is found that the water depth at 1 cm reaches the maximum water temperature 60 c at 1 p m and after that it is decreased and it reached 35 c at 5 p m at 2 cm water depth water temperature reaches its maximum 58 c at 1 p m and it reached 43 c at 5 p m when the water depth increases from 1 cm to 2 cm there is a maximum temperature drop of up to 9 4 during the morning time and the maximum temperature rise of up to 23 during the evening time because of storage effect of basin water further water depth is increased as from 1 to 3 cm and 1 3 5 cm it is observed that when the water depth is increased above 2 cm water temperature decreased because of increasing the water volume in the basin the maximum water temperature of 57 and 55 c is recorded for the water depth of 3 and 3 5 cm respectively there is a maximum water temperature drop of up to 22 6 and 47 2 and maximum water temperature grows up to 31 and 21 6 are observed for without insulation condition at the

water depth of 3 and 3 5 cm respectively there is a maximum water temperature drop of up to 27 3 and 37 5 and maximum water temperature grows up to 26 and 17 are observed for without insulation condition at the water depth of 3 and 3 5 cm respectively as compared to the 1 cm water depth the daily average water temperatures of 48 49 46 and 44 c is recorded for the water depth of 1 2 3 and 3 5 cm respectively for the pss with insulation conditions variations of basin temperature for the pss without and with insulation are shown in fig 4 a and b the maximum basin temperature of 58 and 60 c is recorded for without and with insulation conditions respectively at 1 cm water depth when the water depth increased the basin temperature decreased because of increasing the volume of basin water and heat storage effect there is a maximum basin temperature drop of up to 18 28 and 38 of water depth of 2 3 and 3 5 cm respectively as compared to the 1 cm water depth at with insulation conditions and maximum basin temperature drop of up to 20 27 and 40 for the water depth of 2 3 and 3 5 cm respectively as compared to the 1 cm water depth at without insulation conditions insulation increases the basin temperature by reducing the heat transfer rate from the bottom of the still basin to the atmosphere and increasing the water depth decreased the basin temperature because of storage effect 3 3 variations of the accumulated yield for the pss with and without insulation condition the daily accumulated yield produced from the pss without and with insulation is shown in fig 5 a and b the daily freshwater production from the pss without insulation is about 0 81 kg 3 27 kg m2 0 73 kg 2 93 kg m2 0 56 kg 2 26 kg m2 and 0 39 kg 1 59 kg m2 for the water depth of 1 2 3 and 3 5 cm respectively when the water depth increased from 1 to 2 cm there is a 13 3 drop in the freshwater production further it is also found that there is a 33 3 and 65 6 drop of fresh water production rate for the water depth of 3 and 3 5 cm respectively as compared to the 1 cm water depth the daily freshwater production from the pss with insulation is about 0 93 kg 3 72 kg m2 0 85 kg 3 40 kg m2 0 67 kg 2 70 kg m2 and 0 52 kg 2 08 kg m2 for the water depth of 1 2 3 and 3 5 cm respectively from the investigational results it is noticed that an increasing the water depth resulted in decreases in the freshwater production rate the pss with insulation increases the daily freshwater production rate up to 12 2 14 16 and 16 4 for the water depth of 1 2 3 and 3 5 cm respectively as compared to the pss without insulation 3 4 variations of thermal efficiency of the pss with and without insulation condition from the thermal efficiency calculation it is found that minimum water depth in the pss produced the maximum hourly thermal efficiency and also it is found that the thermal efficiency of the pss is higher for the water depth at 3 cm for both without and with insulation conditions the maximum hourly thermal efficiency of the pss without insulation is 60 93 44 42 39 26 and 31 34 and with insulation is 69 04 55 52 47 45 and 40 97 for the water depth of 1 2 3 and 3 5 cm respectively it is found that the daily average thermal efficiency of the pss without insulation is 26 17 23 44 18 48 and 15 38 with insulation is 28 50 26 92 22 82 and 18 95 for the water depth of 1 2 3 and 3 5 cm respectively 3 5 comparison of productivity and thermal efficiency of different passive pyramid solar still the overall thermal efficiency of the solar still depends on the daily accumulated yield daily solar intensity latent heat of vaporization and condensation and the area of absorber condensing surface mathematically it is expressed a 1 η d a i l y m e w l i t a 3600 the comparison of different ppss based on their yield and thermal efficiency is tabulated in table 2 the freshwater production rate and the thermal efficiency of the ppss vary from locality to locality the pss made of the glass has the highest efficiency of 66 5 ahmed et al 2014 the pss with minimum water depth and triangular pyramid shaped solar still has increased the productivity murugavel et al 2008b ahsan et al 2014 the efficiency of the proposed pss without insulation was about 26 17 and it has a maximum distilled water production of 3 27 kg m2 similarly the pss with insulation was about 28 50 and it has a maximum distilled water production of 3 72 kg m2 there is a 12 1 and 8 17 increase in yield and thermal efficiency was achieved in the case of the pss with insulation as compared to the without insulation see table 2 4 conclusions from the experimental investigations on the pss the following conclusions are arrived from the experimental study it is found that the use of an acrylic material as a condensing cover improves the still performance by maintaining the higher temperature difference between the water and acrylic condensing cover the maximum yield from solar still without insulation at different depths of water namely 2 3 and 3 5 cm were found to be 2 8 2 26 and 1 67 kg m2 whereas the effect of insulation improved the fresh water produced higher yield and recorded as 3 38 2 94 2 06 kg m2 respectively the maximum distillate yield of 3 72 and 3 27 kg m2 is produced from the pss with and without insulation at 1 cm water depth the pss with insulation improves the daily distillate yield from 12 to 16 as compared to the pss without insulation the maximum daily thermal efficiency of the pss at 1 cm water depth is 28 50 and 26 17 at with and without insulation respectively

26 2017 the daily average wind speed during the testing of the pss without insulation was recorded as 1 5 2 m s and with insulation was recorded as 1 4 1 6 m s it is noted that during the operation of the pss under the condition of without insulation there is a higher wind speed and it increased the heat transfer rate from the collector surface to the environment which resulted in enhancement in condensation rate it is noted that the ambient temperature for the period of the midday is the highest and the maximum temperature is recorded as 39 c the daily average ambient temperature during the testing of the pss without and with insulation was recorded as 34 to 35 c and 35 to 36 c respectively 3 2 hourly variations of water and basin temperature for the pss with and without insulation

and maximum basin temperature drop of up to 20 27 and 40 for the water depth of 2 3 and 3 5 cm respectively as compared to the 1 cm water depth at without insulation conditions insulation increases the basin temperature by reducing the heat transfer rate from the bottom of the still basin to the atmosphere and increasing the water depth decreased the basin temperature because of storage effect 3 3 variations of the accumulated yield for the pss with and without insulation condition the daily accumulated yield produced from the pss without and with insulation is shown in fig 5 a and b the daily freshwater production from the pss without insulation is about 0 81 kg 3 27 kg m2 0 73 kg 2 93 kg m2 0 56 kg 2 26 kg m2 and 0 39 kg 1 59 kg m2 for the water depth of 1 2 3 and 3 5 cm respectively when the water depth increased from 1 to 2 cm there is a 13 3 drop in the freshwater production further it is also found that there is a 33 3 and 65 6 drop of fresh water production rate

insulation see table 2 4 conclusions from the experimental investigations on the pss the following conclusions are arrived from the experimental study it is found that the use of an acrylic material as a condensing cover improves the still performance by maintaining the higher temperature difference between the water and acrylic condensing cover the maximum yield from solar still without insulation at different depths of water namely 2 3 and 3 5 cm were found to be 2 8 2 26 and 1 67 kg m2 whereas the effect of insulation improved the fresh water produced higher yield and recorded as 3

12149,in this investigation the adsorption performance of orange peel op and magnetized orange peel mop as adsorbents for the confiscation of crystal violet cv dye from synthetically polluted water was examined the batch experiments were performed by varying the operational parameters like ph initial dye concentration adsorbent dose and temperature the equilibrium adsorption capacity was higher with mop 46 94 mg g 1 than op 22 73 mg g 1 the better adsorption of cv at higher ph and higher temperatures for both op and mop was observed adsorption equilibrium data of both op and mop were well fitted with langmuir isotherm and the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of mop cv was found to be higher 555 6 mg g 1 than that of op cv 138 9 mg g 1 kinetic data followed the pseudo second order p s o model suggesting that the process of cv adsorption was more inclined toward the chemisorption mechanism the electrostatic attraction between the deprotonated surface of adsorbate and cationic cv molecule was suggested to be involved in chemisorption thermodynamic inspection showed that the process of adsorption of dye onto op and mop was spontaneous and endothermic in nature and accompanied by an increase in entropy due to very high adsorption affinity low cost easy separability and regenerability the magnetically modified adsorbent mop has been established to be a very promising remedy for the elimination of cv from industrial wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorption crystal violet magnetic modification orange peel wastewater treatment 1 introduction the quality of water has rigorously worsened globally from the last few decades chiefly due to manifold increase in the human population uncontrolled usage of freshwater fast growing industrialization and unplanned urbanization schwarzenbach et al 2010 the foremost source of water pollution includes the release of untreated industrial and agricultural runoff which comprises of various toxic and noxious pollutants such as heavy metals dyes pesticides organic and inorganic pollutants fu and wang 2011 nasar and mashkoor 2019 qamruzzaman and nasar 2014a 2014b tanweer et al 2011 the presence of these pollutants in natural water bodies above the permissible limit creates a damaging effect on the environment living organisms and especially on human health among these pollutants dyes are one of the visible and easily noticeable environmental contaminants nasar and shakoor 2017 the recalcitrant nature of dye is controversial due to their aromatic structure and molecular size that lead to their high water solubility and stability various industries such as textiles tanneries paper cosmetics plastics confectionaries pharmaceutical petroleum paints etc are the major sources of dye pollution as they consume large quantities of water and ultimately generate a huge volume of contaminated wastewater kant 2012 verma et al 2012 in most cases untreated wastewater from these industries is directed straightway to the stream of water and therefore poses a severe hazard to flora and fauna munagapati and kim 2016 prüss ustün et al 2011 industrial effluent comprising even a minute amount of dyes discharge directly into the water bodies is a high priority matter of concern because it causes the change in the color of water and has long term damaging effects on the organism crini 2006 in view of the fact of severe health harm to humans due to the colored wastewater there is a crucial prerequisite for developing a robust cost effective and eco friendly method to treat the dye contaminated wastewater lee et al 2006 there are various technologies available for the treatment of wastewater like ozonation khamparia and jaspal 2017 coagulation butani and mane 2017 lee et al 2006 reverse osmosis greenlee et al 2009 photocatalytic degradation muruganandham et al 2010 oxidative degradation qamruzzaman and nasar 2015 2014c 2014a nanofiltration membranes chakraborty et al 2003 hameed et al 2008 and adsorption bhatnagar and sillanpää 2017 chen et al 2019 etc though most of the treatment methods are not at all affable either in term of cost of enactment or at the standard of performance however the adsorption one is a simple easy eco friendly efficient and low cost technique to confiscate the noxious pollutants present in the effluent however the selection of appropriate adsorbent was incessantly an exciting problem traditionally activated carbon and silica gel were used as potential adsorbents but due to their high monetary value and regeneration difficulties they become unattractive so in recent years researchers are making untiring efforts to come up with unconventional efficient and low cost adsorbents the use of agricultural waste such as terminalia arjuna sawdust shakoor and nasar 2018a sawdust mashkoor et al 2018 parab et al 2009 citrus limetta peel shakoor and nasar 2016 eggshell chowdhury et al 2013 jackfruit leaf powder saha et al 2012 grapefruit

chieng et al 2017 etc have been exploited as potential cheap cost effective cleaner and green adsorbents although agricultural wastes in their pristine forms have been employed as popular adsorbents they suffer from poor adsorption capacity and separability from aqueous media this problem considerably confines the widespread application of agro based adsorbents therefore attention has been directed toward the development of new adsorbents by suitably modifying the low cost materials in the last few years notable studies have been conducted on the preparation of magnetically modified low cost adsorbents magnetic separation is recognized as a fast proficient cost effective method and offers excellent tools for wastewater treatment the magnetic separation method is favorable not only for small scale but also for large scale applications thus tailoring the advantage of easy separability of magnetic particles and the cost effectiveness of agro wastes there is an opportunity to engineer them as a composite adsorbent furthermore the enhancement in the adsorbability of the adsorbents after their magnetic modification has also been noticed various magnetically modified agro wastes such as magnetite nanoparticles loaded fig leave alizadeh et al 2017 magnetite nanoparticles loaded azolla alizadeh et al 2017 polyaniline sawdust mashkoor and nasar 2019a κ carrageenan g poly

adsorption capacity of dyes in the light of these realities the present research work focused on the adsorption of cationic cv dye as a model pollutant using pristine orange peel op and magnetically modified orange peel mop the batch adsorption study of cv onto the op and mop were carried out as a function of adsorption time adsorbent dose temperature ph and initial concentration of dye along with thermodynamics kinetics and isotherm evaluation and the experiments were also conducted for the possible reusability of op and mop adsorbents 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials stain grade cv and analytical reagent grade ferric chloride anhydrous ferrous chloride dihydrate and sulphuric acid each obtained from fisher scientific india were used the other chemicals potassium nitrate hydrochloric acid sodium hydroxide acetic acid ammonia solution were also of analytical reagent grade and supplied by cdh india the highly pure water hpw generated by two fold distillation of deionized water was used during the entire studies op waste was collected from the local fruit vendors 2 2 preparation of adsorbents op was washed properly with hpw in order to get rid of dust grim and other surface impurities then they were oven dried for 24 h at 120 c for the removal of moisture content the dried biomass was crushed and passed through 80 bss mesh sieves to remove the coarse and agglomerated particles the powdered op was again washed until the disappearance of its color this washed op was dried in an oven at 100 c for 24 h and stored in a desiccator for experimental purposes a 10 g sample of the op powder was mixed with a solution containing 4 0 g fecl3 and 2 0 g fecl2 2h2o in 200 ml of double distilled water and homogenized by rapid stirring for 12 h at 80 c the precipitation of fe3o4 nanoparticles on the op was accomplished by a dropwise addition of 10 ammonia solution at the temperature of 80 c into the homogenized mixture with the aid of continuous stirring for further 40 min in this context it is worth to mention here that the choice of alkali in maintaining solution ph is a very crucial factor the weak alkali nh4oh is preferable over strong like naoh as the ph can be better controlled with the former one zhao et al 2008 after the completion of the reaction the suspension was endorsed to cool at room temperature finally the mop composite was separated from the reaction mixture by applying an external magnetic field the resulting mop particles were cleaned properly by ethanol followed by hpw till neutral ph and then dried at 60 c 2 3 characterization of op and mop the crystallinity of both op and mop adsorbents was examined by x ray powder diffraction xrd miniflex ii rigaku japan the nature of functional groups was analyzed by fourier transform infrared ftir spectra by using nicolet is50 thermo fisher scientific ftir spectrometer the surface morphology and elemental composition of the adsorbents were examined by scanning electron microscope energy dispersive x ray sem edax jeol jsm 6610lv japan transmission electron microscope tem and selected area electron diffraction saed patterns were obtained by jem 2100 jeol japan the thermal stability of the adsorbents was carried out by thermogravimetric analyses tga the point of zero charge pzc of the op and mop adsorbents was determined by an established solid addition method ponnusami et al 2008 it was carried out by taking 25 ml of 0 1 m kno3 solution in a series of conical flasks the initial ph phi was maintained in range of 2 0 12 0 by 0 01 m hcl naoh thereafter 0 15 g of the adsorbent was added to the solutions and kept in the dark place at room temperature for 2 days the final ph phf of the solutions was measured and the graph δph phi phf vs phi were plotted for both the adsorbents from the plot the values of pzc were evaluated further details have been described elsewhere mashkoor and nasar 2019a 2 4 adsorption experiments to estimate the efficiency of op and mop for the adsorption of cv from simulated contaminated water batch experiments were carried out the influence of adsorbent dose medium ph initial cv concentration adsorbent adsorbate contact time and temperature on the adsorption of cv was investigated the experiments were conducted in 50 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 25 ml of cv dye solution of concentration 50 mg l 1 and 0 025 g of the adsorbent dose at a fixed ph of 8 after the accomplishment of equilibrium the spent adsorbent was separated by an external magnet and about 2 ml of the solution was transferred to the cuvette with the aid of dropper the residual concentration of the cv in the solution was recorded by uv vis spectrophotometer evolution 201 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo fisher at λ max of 585 nm the adsorption capacity q in mg g 1 and removal efficiency r of cv by op and mop were calculated by employing the following equations 1 q c o c t v w 2 r c o c e c 0 100 where co ct and ce respectively represent the initial at any time and equilibrium concentrations of cv dye in mg l 1 w and v are the mass of the adsorbent in g and volume of cv solution in l respectively 2 5 desorption studies the desorption studies were carried out by using the common desorbing agents viz 0 1 m hcl 0 1 m h2so4 0 1 m ch3cooh 0 1 m naoh ethanol and hpw the adsorbents after adsorption were washed several times with hpw to remove traces of unadsorbed dye the cv loaded adsorbents were then kept in 25 ml of above desorbents and left for 4 h thereafter the adsorbents were separated out and the desorbed concentration of the cv was computed spectrophotometrically and percent desorption was estimated as follows 3 desorption m desorbed m adsorbed 100 where madsorbed and mdesorbed are the amounts mg l 1 of cv adsorbed and desorbed respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of op and mop the xrd patterns of the op and mop shown in fig s1 evidently explicates the presence of amorphous materials due to hemicellulose and lignin in the op fig s1 a the presence of crystalline peaks at 15 3 and 22 3 proposed the existence of cellulosic material the xrd pattern of the mop fig s1 b exhibited all the attributes of op along with the emergence of sharp and small intermittent peaks associated with the iron oxide at 30 8 36 9 41 2 49 56 53 26 55 4 61 82 and 75 12 which may be accounted for the successful magnetization of the op and enhancement in the degree of crystallinity in mop over op the tga analysis of both op and mop was carried out to address their thermal stability and the outcomes are displayed in fig s2 the tga curves specify the significant improvement in the thermal stability of the mop with respect to op the first weight loss step in the thermogram of op and mop might be due to the loss of moisture in the adsorbents and then by the decomposition of hemicellulose cellulose and lignin mashkoor and nasar 2019b shakoor and nasar 2018a this figure clearly indicates that the thermal stability mop is comparable with that of op up to a temperature of about 255 c but increases significantly at higher temperatures the improved thermal stability of mop over op is due to the inclusion of stable iron oxide particles the changes that ensue on the surface morphology of op due to magnetization can understand by comparing sem micrographs of op and mop the sem images of the unadsorbed and adsorbed op and mop are shown in fig 1 the surface morphology of op has been perceived to be mainly displayed pleated and porous surface fig 1 a fig 1 c clearly specifies that after the magnetization the surface of adsorbent exhibited a predominance of smaller particles of different sizes distributed haphazardly upon the matrix this was due to the inclusion of nanoparticle in the matrix and significantly enhances the overall surface area of the magnetized adsorbent filled pores and the comparatively smooth and even surface of the adsorbed op and mop fig 1 b and d clearly points out that cv molecules get successfully adsorbed over the surface of the adsorbents edax analysis of op fig s4 a represented the peaks of c 47 73 wt 54 89 at o 52 21 wt 45 08 at and si 0 06 wt 0 03 at in the spectrum of magnetized op fig s4 c it was observed that the signals of c and o were present from the precursor of op whereas the presence of fe peak at 6 4 and 7 1 kev are associated to the binding energies of iron and the presence of oxygen peak at 0 6 kev affirms the successful modification of op by iron oxide bishnoi et al 2018 after adsorption of cv change in the composition of elements in both the adsorbents has been observed which shows the achievement of successful adsorption as presented in figs s4 b and d the tem micrographs for the op with and without magnetization are shown in fig 2 the tem images clearly indicate that the mop has achieved significant improvement in surface characteristics as the size of most of the particles reduced to the range of about 7 10 nm against that of op 80 121 nm further it has also been observed that fine compact and monodispersed distribution of magnetic particles on the surface of op have been successfully accomplished the selected area electron diffraction saed patterns figs s3 a and b shows that there are bright spots arranged in the form of concentric circles which indicated the more crystalline nature of the mop compared to the diffused pattern of the saed image of the op reza and ahmaruzzaman 2015 saed pattern of op and mop was also supported by xrd analysis fig 3 shows the ftir spectra of the op mop cv op and cv mop the spectra represented that op is decorated with a variety of different functional groups and their active involvement in magnetization and cv sequestration the broad peak in the spectrum of op observed at 3411 cm 1 is attributed to the overlapping of stretching vibration of o h of alcohol which was relocated in mop owing to the participation of the hydroxyl group ali et al 2018 stretching vibrations of aldehydic c h were apparent from the appearance of bands at 2884 cm 1 op and 2921 cm 1 mop wahab et al 2010 the occurrence of the steep band at 1589 and 1618 cm 1 in op and mop respectively was ascribed to co stretching of carboxylate ion kataria and garg 2018 the emergence of the peak at 1419 op and 1398 mop cm 1 revealed c h stretching vibration of methyl and methoxy group kataria and garg 2018 both c o stretching and o h deformation of carboxylic acids were apparent from the advent of the peak at 1308 cm 1 op and 1243 cm 1 mop basu et al 2017 the other weak to the medium bands in 1265 to 1046 cm 1 may be assigned to c n stretching of amines or c o stretching of the carboxylic group alizadeh et al 2017 el messaoudi et al 2016 the shifting and relocation in the peaks of op from 3411 2884 1589 1419 1308 1022 and 586 cm 1 to 3399 2916 1622 1407 1307 1012 and 566 cm 1 in cv op respectively and mop peaks from 3362 2921 1618 1398 1243 1011 and 581 cm 1 to 3384 2912 1617 1382 1230 1013 and 565 cm 1 in cv mop respectively confirms the active involvement of the corresponding functional groups in the cv sequestration 3 2 effect of adsorbent dosage to examine the role of adsorbent dose on adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of cv from aqueous media the adsorbent dose of op and mop were varied from 0 04 to 10 g l 1 at an initial cv concentration of 50 mg l 1 fig 4 illustrates the profile for cv adsorption on op and mop as a function of adsorbent dosage from the figure it was detected that the removal efficiency of cv increased markedly from 55 0 to 86 7 and 73 4 to 91 1 as the adsorbents dose increases from 0 4 to 2 g for op and 0 4 to 1 g for mop respectively beyond that the increase in removal efficiency of cv turns to be very low as both the adsorbents surface and cv concentration settles to equilibrium with each other thereby further enhancement in the dose does not enhance the removal efficiency to any considerable extent the increased removal efficiency with increasing adsorbent dose may be endorsed to the larger surface area and the easy accessibility of more active adsorbing sites on the other hand a remarkable decrease in adsorption capacity from 68 8 to 4 6 mg g 1 for op and 91 8 to 4 9 mg g 1 for mop with the increase of adsorbent dose from 0 4 to 10 g l 1 was observed this may be ascribed to the fact that the increased adsorbent concentration most likely raises the adsorbent interactions such as agglomeration and aggregation which leads to a substantial reduction in the overall surface area of the adsorbent and subsequently reduces its adsorption capacity on both op and mop furthermore phenomena like agglomeration and aggregation create the hindrance for cv molecules to reach the vacant sites of the adsorbent by considering the above facts the optimum values of adsorbent doses i e 2 and 1 g l 1 were respectively chosen for the adsorption of cv onto the op and mop these adsorbents dose correspond to 21 7 and 45 6 mg g 1 of adsorption capacity and 86 7 and 91 1 of removal efficiency of the cv of concentration 50 mg l 1 onto the op and mop respectively 3 3 effect of ph ph is one of the crucial parameters in the adsorption process the effect of ph on the adsorption capacity of cv onto the op and mop was scrutinized in the ph range of 3 11 at an adsorbent dose of 2 and 1 g l 1 respectively and 50 mg l 1 of initial cv concentration and the results are graphically illustrated in fig 5 it has been observed that the adsorption of cv was highly dependent on the initial ph of the solution as can be seen in fig 5 the adsorption capacity increases significantly from 11 1 to 21 7 mg g 1 for op and 28 1 45 6 mg g 1 for mop with an increase in the ph from 3 to 8 and become almost stagnant afterward up to ph of 11 the maximum adsorption capacity of 21 7 and 45 6 mg g 1 for op and mop respectively was observed at ph 8 this could be well elucidated by understanding the influence of ph on the adsorbent surface and pzc depending upon the ph of the solution the surface of the adsorbent undergoes protonation or deprotonation at ph pzc pzc of op is 6 5 and for mop is 7 fig 5 inset the surface of adsorbent accomplishes negative charge which resulted in the deprotonation of the functional groups present on the surface of the adsorbent and consequently acted as the attracting sites for the cationic cv molecules thus at higher ph this cationic dye is susceptible to better adsorption as clearly observed in fig 5 while at ph pzc more protons are available to protonate the surface functional group and provided positively charged binding sites for the cationic cv molecules and thus lead to the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged adsorbent surface and cationic cv dye molecule which dissuaded the adsorption of cv onto the op and mop 3 4 effect of contact time and kinetic study the amount of cv adsorbed onto the pristine and magnetized op was studied as a function of adsorbate adsorbent contact time at five different initial concentrations 25 50 87 5 100 150 mg l 1 of cv at 303 k the results are shown in fig 6 it is apparent from the figure that the adsorption of cv increased rapidly at an initial stage continuing up to 30 min and then gradually slows down and reached to equilibrium point in 90 and 70 min with an adsorbing capacity of 21 7 and 45 6 mg g 1 for op and mop respectively the high initial uptake of cv on both the adsorbents is ascribed to the abundant availability of active vacant adsorbing sites on the adsorbent surface and with the continuous occupancy of these adsorbing sites the adsorption rate slows down it is also evident from fig 6 that the adsorption capacity of cv onto the op and mop increases with the increase in the initial concentrations of cv this is due to the increase in the requisite driving force which accelerates the mass transfer rate of cv onto the op and mop adsorbents the kinetics of the adsorption of cv onto the op and mop was observed by carrying the time dependent studies various kinetics models viz pseudo first order p f o pseudo second order p s o intraparticle diffusion ipd elovich elv and liquid film diffusion lfd mashkoor and nasar 2019b tan and hameed 2017 were applied to interpret the experimental data to regulate the governing mechanism for the adsorption of dye from aqueous media the linear forms of different models are presented in table s2 the values of kinetic parameters for the adsorption of cv onto the op and mop as found from these kinetic equations are presented in table 1 a good agreement between the theoretical adsorption capacities calculated from the p s o kinetics model with the experimental adsorption capacity for both the adsorbents together with higher r2 values revealed that the kinetics of the adsorption process followed this model which suggested that the rate limiting step was a chemical sorption chemisorption between the adsorbate and adsorbent under the studied experimental conditions ho and mckay 1998 the p s o plot for op and mop displayed in fig s5 specifies that the plot of t qt versus t is linear at all concentrations of cv a similar trend of p s o kinetics has also been reported in the previous studies for the adsorption of cv dye onto the different magnetically modified as well as native adsorbents as given in table 3 the values of p s o kinetics parameters as stated for various adsorbents are summarized in this table to further identify the adsorption kinetics behavior of cv dye onto the op and mop the ipd and lfd models were also exploited the plot of the former model qt versus t1 2 based on the experimental data shown in fig 7 and the values of the parameters associated with this model are given in table 1 as the plot fig 7 does not pass through the origin shows that the intraparticle diffusion is not the rate determining step further this plot illustrates the multi linearity and by and large represented by two regions separated by the intersection of linear plots which indicates that the adsorption of cv on both the adsorbents was accompanied by two steps the first sharper region shows the instantaneous external surface adsorption while the second region is attributed to the gradual adsorption stage of intraparticle diffusion and the attainment of equilibrium this inferred that both the external surface adsorption and intraparticle diffusion possibly controlled the kinetics of cv onto the op and mop moreover a linear plot of ln 1 f vs t passing through origin is indicative of the lfd controlled adsorption as the plot not shown did not have zero intercepts table 1 the experimental outcome clearly confirms the unsuitability of this kinetic model 3 5 adsorption isotherm the study of adsorption isotherms is important to elucidate how adsorbate molecules interact with the adsorbent surface the outcomes of the present equilibrium adsorption study have been explored with three commonly used models viz langmuir freundlich and temkin models foo and hameed 2010 to illustrate the interaction of cv with op and mop langmuir model assumes that the structure of adsorbent is homogeneous where all adsorption sites are identical and energetically comparable and demonstrates the establishment of monolayer coverage of adsorbate molecules over the adsorbent surface the linearized equation of this model is given in table s2 furthermore the favorability of the adsorption is expressed by the separation factor rl 1 1 k l c o the values of rl shows that the adsorption is considered as irreversible rl 0 favorable 0 rl 1 linear rl 1 and unfavorable rl 1 the freundlich isotherm was employed to define the heterogeneous systems and reversible adsorption which does not confine to the monolayer coverage the linear form of this isotherm is also presented in table s2 temkin adsorption isotherm presumes that the adsorbent adsorbate interaction in the adsorption process is accompanying with the linear reduction in the heat of adsorption with the coverage of the adsorbent surface the linear form of this isotherm is given in table s2 the generated isotherm data for the adsorption of cv onto the op and mop were analyzed in the light of these isotherms and outcomes so obtained are given in table 2 this table exhibits a reasonable fit to the langmuir model fig s6 confirmed by r2 values closer to unity 0 995 and 0 991 respectively this suggests that the adsorption of cv onto the op and mop as a monolayer coverage and constant adsorption energy the value of maximum monolayer adsorption capacity qm as found at 303 k is also given in table 2 freundlich and temkin isotherm models exhibit lower values of r2 for both the adsorbents signifying their incompatibility for inferring adsorption of cv onto the op and mop further the values of rl was lies in the range of 0 1 at all initial cv concentration indicating a high degree of favorability of the adsorption process several research studies have been explored on the removal of cv onto the various types of modified and pristine inexpensive adsorbents as given in table 3 these adsorbents also obey langmuir s adsorption isotherm and the reported langmuir parameters by these researchers have been compiled and compared with our results in this table this table clearly shows that qm value accompanying with mop is the best one 3 6 adsorption thermodynamics the results of the thermodynamic studies showed that the adsorption of cv increases with increasing temperature from 303 k to 333 k in order to examine a closer insight into the nature of the adsorption of cv onto the op and mop the thermodynamic factors such as the changes in the standard gibb s free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs accompanying with the adsorption process were determined by using the equations given in table s2 values of δg at different temperatures 303 333 k evaluated from eq s9 and other thermodynamic factors such as δh and δs as obtained from respective plots fig s7 are listed in table s1 this table shows that the thermodynamic behavior of both adsorbents op and mop towards cv is the same the negative δg values increase with the rise of temperature which reveals that the adsorption of cv is thermodynamically feasible under the adopted laboratory conditions the positive values of δh and δs for both the adsorbents indicate that the process is endothermic in nature and associated with the increase in the degree of randomness at the adsorbate adsorbent interface during cv adsorption 3 7 desorption studies for an adsorbent to be used for practical purposes it is essential that it should be easily regenerable for several cycles after adsorption hence adsorption desorption experiments were conducted several times to check the regenerability of the cv loaded op and mop adsorbents five diverse media namely viz 0 1 m hcl 0 1 m h2so4 0 1 m ch3cooh 0 1 m naoh ethanol and hpw were used for this purpose among these 0 1 m hcl and ethanol were proved to be the promising media for regenerating op and mop adsorbents as shown in fig s8 both 0 1 m hcl and ethanol were observed to have a competitive role during desorption the performance of ethanol is better for mop while 0 1 m hcl is the most suitable one for op thus it can be concluded that the mop adsorbent is quite stable with a reasonable regeneration rate and excellent efficiency and hence is adequate to be used for practical purposes 4 mechanism it was confirmed from the ftir analysis fig 3 that the adsorbent consists of a large number of oxygen carrying functional groups it is reasonable to predict that these functional groups can provide considerable adsorption sites for the adsorption of cationic cv dye as discussed in section 3 3 the ph of the solution has strongly influenced the extent of interaction since the properties of the adsorbent surface varied greatly under various ph when the ph of the solution was higher than pzc the electrostatic interaction was mainly playing a crucial role in the adsorption of the cationic cv molecules with negatively charged carboxylate groups while if the ph of the solution was less than pzc the surface functional groups were protonated hence dissuaded the adsorption process it was also observed from fig 5 that the considerable adsorption of cv also occurred in an acidic medium that may be accounted to be due to hydrogen bonding with a hydroxyl group these results corroborate the findings of ftir analysis which showed the obvious shift in the peaks after adsorption of cv alongside intraparticle diffusion through pores takes part in the adsorption process but may not be conferred as the rate limiting step 5 conclusion the present research study demonstrates the improvement in the adsorption performance of op after magnetization for the sequestration of cv from aqueous media it was found that adsorption of cv was dependent on several batch factors such as adsorbate adsorbent contact time ph of the solution initial cv concentration and temperature of the system the adsorption capacity for op and mop was observed to increase with the increase of initial cv concentration and equilibrium was attained in 90 and 70 min respectively isotherm and kinetics studies for both the adsorbents revealed that langmuir isotherm and p s o kinetic models were validated with the experimental adsorption data the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of mop 555 6 mg g 1 was significantly higher than that of op 138 9 mg g 1 it was found that the decolorization of cv on both the adsorbents was mainly occurred by the process of chemisorption with the concomitant participation of the physical force of attraction the thermodynamic examination suggested that the adsorption was feasible and accompanying with adsorption of heat and increase of entropy for both the adsorbents desorption study of cv from op and mop was found to be maximum with hydrochloric acid and the mop shows excellent regenerability over op up to five adsorption desorption cycles in view of the potential adsorption ability of mop over op easy separability excellent reusability the present study submits that mop is a novel effective and economically feasible for the elimination of dyes from wastewater declaration of competing

12149,in this investigation the adsorption performance of orange peel op and magnetized orange peel mop as adsorbents for the confiscation of crystal violet cv dye from synthetically polluted water was examined the batch experiments were performed by varying the operational parameters like ph initial dye concentration adsorbent dose and temperature the equilibrium adsorption capacity was higher with mop 46 94 mg g 1 than op 22 73 mg g 1 the better adsorption of cv at higher ph and higher temperatures for both op and mop was observed adsorption equilibrium data of both op and mop were well fitted with langmuir isotherm and the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of mop cv was found to be higher 555 6 mg g 1 than that of op cv 138 9 mg g 1 kinetic data followed the pseudo second order p s o model suggesting that the process of cv adsorption was more inclined toward the chemisorption mechanism the electrostatic attraction between the deprotonated surface of adsorbate and cationic cv molecule was suggested to be involved in chemisorption thermodynamic inspection showed that the process of adsorption of dye onto op and mop was spontaneous and endothermic in nature and accompanied by an increase in entropy due to very high adsorption affinity low cost easy separability and regenerability the magnetically modified adsorbent mop has been established to be a very promising remedy for the elimination of cv from industrial wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorption crystal violet magnetic modification orange peel wastewater treatment 1 introduction the quality of water has rigorously worsened globally from the last few decades chiefly due to manifold increase in the human population uncontrolled usage of freshwater fast growing industrialization and unplanned urbanization schwarzenbach et al 2010 the foremost source of water pollution includes the release of untreated industrial and agricultural runoff which comprises of various toxic and noxious pollutants such as heavy metals dyes pesticides organic and inorganic pollutants fu and wang 2011 nasar and mashkoor 2019 qamruzzaman and nasar 2014a 2014b tanweer et al 2011 the presence of these pollutants in natural water bodies above the permissible limit creates a damaging effect on the environment living organisms and especially on human health among these pollutants dyes are one of the visible and easily noticeable environmental contaminants nasar and shakoor 2017 the recalcitrant nature of dye is controversial due to their aromatic structure and molecular size that lead to their high water solubility and stability various industries such as textiles tanneries paper cosmetics plastics confectionaries pharmaceutical petroleum paints etc are the major sources of dye pollution as they consume large quantities of water and ultimately generate a huge volume of contaminated wastewater kant 2012 verma et al 2012 in most cases untreated wastewater from these industries is directed straightway to the stream of water and therefore poses a severe hazard to flora and fauna munagapati and kim 2016 prüss ustün et al 2011 industrial effluent comprising even a minute amount of dyes discharge directly into the water bodies is a high priority matter of concern because it causes the change in the color of water and has long term damaging effects on the organism crini 2006 in view of the fact of severe health harm to humans due to the colored wastewater there is a crucial prerequisite for developing a robust cost effective and eco friendly method to treat the dye contaminated wastewater lee et al 2006 there are various technologies available for the treatment of wastewater like ozonation khamparia and jaspal 2017 coagulation butani and mane 2017 lee et al 2006 reverse osmosis greenlee et al 2009 photocatalytic degradation muruganandham et al 2010 oxidative degradation qamruzzaman and nasar 2015 2014c 2014a nanofiltration membranes chakraborty et al 2003 hameed et al 2008 and adsorption bhatnagar and sillanpää 2017 chen et al 2019 etc though most of the treatment methods are not at all affable either in term of cost of enactment or at the standard of performance however the adsorption one is a simple easy eco friendly efficient and low cost technique to confiscate the noxious pollutants present in the effluent however the selection of appropriate adsorbent was incessantly an exciting problem traditionally activated carbon and silica gel were used as potential adsorbents but due to their high monetary value and regeneration difficulties they become unattractive so in recent years researchers are making untiring efforts to come up with unconventional efficient and low cost adsorbents the use of agricultural waste such as terminalia arjuna sawdust shakoor and nasar 2018a sawdust mashkoor et al 2018 parab et al 2009 citrus limetta peel shakoor and nasar 2016 eggshell chowdhury et al 2013 jackfruit leaf powder saha et al 2012 grapefruit peel saeed et al 2010 tomato plant root kannan et al 2009 cucumis sativus peel shakoor and nasar 2017 corncob song et al 2019 punica granatum peel shakoor and nasar 2018b artocarpus camansi peel chieng et al 2017 etc have been exploited as potential cheap cost effective cleaner and green adsorbents although agricultural wastes in their pristine forms have been employed as popular adsorbents they suffer from poor adsorption capacity and separability from aqueous media this problem considerably confines the widespread application of agro based adsorbents therefore attention has been directed toward the development of new adsorbents by suitably modifying the low cost materials in the last few years notable studies have been conducted on the preparation of magnetically modified low cost adsorbents magnetic separation is recognized as a fast proficient cost effective method and offers excellent tools for wastewater treatment the magnetic separation method is favorable not only for small scale but also for large scale applications thus tailoring the advantage of easy separability of magnetic particles and the cost effectiveness of agro wastes there is an opportunity to engineer them as a composite adsorbent furthermore the enhancement in the adsorbability of the adsorbents after their magnetic modification has also been noticed various magnetically modified agro wastes such as magnetite nanoparticles loaded fig leave alizadeh et al 2017 magnetite nanoparticles loaded azolla alizadeh et al 2017 polyaniline sawdust mashkoor and nasar 2019a κ carrageenan g poly methacrylic acid fe3o4 gholami et al 2016 magnetic chitosan acetic acid beads yan et al 2013 magnetic chitosan glutamic acid beads yan et al 2013 h2so4 cucumis sativus smitha et al 2017 epichlorohydrin corncob song et al 2019 naoh artocarpus camansi peel chieng et al 2017 naoh rice husk chakraborty et al 2011 etc were efficiently used as adsorbents and presented outstanding adsorption capacity of dyes in the light of these realities the present research work focused on the adsorption of cationic cv dye as a model pollutant using pristine orange peel op and magnetically modified orange peel mop the batch adsorption study of cv onto the op and mop were carried out as a function of adsorption time adsorbent dose temperature ph and initial concentration of dye along with thermodynamics kinetics and isotherm evaluation and the experiments were also conducted for the possible reusability of op and mop adsorbents 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials stain grade cv and analytical reagent grade ferric chloride anhydrous ferrous chloride dihydrate and sulphuric acid each obtained from fisher scientific india were used the other chemicals potassium nitrate hydrochloric acid sodium hydroxide acetic acid ammonia solution were also of analytical reagent grade and supplied by cdh india the highly pure water hpw generated by two fold distillation of deionized water was used during the entire studies op waste was collected from the local fruit vendors 2 2 preparation of adsorbents op was washed properly with hpw in order to get rid of dust grim and other surface impurities then they were oven dried for 24 h at 120 c for the removal of moisture content the dried biomass was crushed and passed through 80 bss mesh sieves to remove the coarse and agglomerated particles the powdered op was again washed until the disappearance of its color this washed op was dried in an oven at 100 c for 24 h and stored in a desiccator for experimental purposes a 10 g sample of the op powder was mixed with a solution containing 4 0 g fecl3 and 2 0 g fecl2 2h2o in 200 ml of double distilled water and homogenized by rapid stirring for 12 h at 80 c the precipitation of fe3o4 nanoparticles on the op was accomplished by a dropwise addition of 10 ammonia solution at the temperature of 80 c into the homogenized mixture with the aid of continuous stirring for further 40 min in this context it is worth to mention here that the choice of alkali in maintaining solution ph is a very crucial factor the weak alkali nh4oh is preferable over strong like naoh as the ph can be better controlled with the former one zhao et al 2008 after the completion of the reaction the suspension was endorsed to cool at room temperature finally the mop composite was separated from the reaction mixture by applying an external magnetic field the resulting mop particles were cleaned properly by ethanol followed by hpw till neutral ph and then dried at 60 c 2 3 characterization of op and mop the crystallinity of both op and mop adsorbents was examined by x ray powder diffraction xrd miniflex ii rigaku japan the nature of functional groups was analyzed by fourier transform infrared ftir spectra by using nicolet is50 thermo fisher scientific ftir spectrometer the surface morphology and elemental composition of the adsorbents were examined by scanning electron microscope energy dispersive x ray sem edax jeol jsm 6610lv japan transmission electron microscope tem and selected area electron diffraction saed patterns were obtained by jem 2100 jeol japan the thermal stability of the adsorbents was carried out by thermogravimetric analyses tga the point of zero charge pzc of the op and mop adsorbents was determined by an established solid addition method ponnusami et al 2008 it was carried out by taking 25 ml of 0 1 m kno3 solution in a series of conical flasks the initial ph phi was maintained in range of 2 0 12 0 by 0 01 m hcl naoh thereafter 0 15 g of the adsorbent was added to the solutions and kept in the dark place at room temperature for 2 days the final ph phf of the solutions was measured and the graph δph phi phf vs phi were plotted for both the adsorbents from the plot the values of pzc were evaluated further details have been described elsewhere mashkoor and nasar 2019a 2 4 adsorption experiments to estimate the efficiency of op and mop for the adsorption of cv from simulated contaminated water batch experiments were carried out the influence of adsorbent dose medium ph initial cv concentration adsorbent adsorbate contact time and temperature on the adsorption of cv was investigated the experiments were conducted in 50 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 25 ml of cv dye solution of concentration 50 mg l 1 and 0 025 g of the adsorbent dose at a fixed ph of 8 after the accomplishment of equilibrium the spent adsorbent was separated by an external magnet and about 2 ml of the solution was transferred to the cuvette with the aid of dropper the residual concentration of the cv in the solution was recorded by uv vis spectrophotometer evolution 201 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo fisher at λ max of 585 nm the adsorption capacity q in mg g 1 and removal efficiency r of cv by op and mop were calculated by employing the following equations 1 q c o c t v w 2 r c o c e c 0 100 where co ct and ce respectively represent the initial at any time and equilibrium concentrations of cv dye in mg l 1 w and v are the mass of the adsorbent in g and volume of cv solution in l respectively 2 5 desorption studies the desorption studies were carried out by using the common desorbing agents viz 0 1 m hcl 0 1 m h2so4 0 1 m ch3cooh 0 1 m naoh ethanol and hpw the adsorbents after adsorption were washed several times with hpw to remove traces of unadsorbed dye the cv loaded adsorbents were then kept in 25 ml of above desorbents and left for 4 h thereafter the adsorbents were separated out and the desorbed concentration of the cv was computed spectrophotometrically and percent desorption was estimated as follows 3 desorption m desorbed m adsorbed 100 where madsorbed and mdesorbed are the amounts mg l 1 of cv adsorbed and desorbed respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of op and mop the xrd patterns of the op and mop shown in fig s1 evidently explicates the presence of amorphous materials due to hemicellulose and lignin in the op fig s1 a the presence of crystalline peaks at 15 3 and 22 3 proposed the existence of cellulosic material the xrd pattern of the mop fig s1 b exhibited all the attributes of op along with the emergence of sharp and small intermittent peaks associated with the iron oxide at 30 8 36 9 41 2 49 56 53 26 55 4 61 82 and 75 12 which may be accounted for the successful magnetization of the op and enhancement in the degree of crystallinity in mop over op the tga analysis of both op and mop was carried out to address their thermal stability and the outcomes are displayed in fig s2 the tga curves specify the significant improvement in the thermal stability of the mop with respect to op the first weight loss step in the thermogram of op and mop might be due to the loss of moisture in the adsorbents and then by the decomposition of hemicellulose cellulose and lignin mashkoor and nasar 2019b shakoor and nasar 2018a this figure clearly indicates that the thermal stability mop is comparable with that of op up to a temperature of about 255 c but increases significantly at higher temperatures the improved thermal stability of mop over op is due to the inclusion of stable iron oxide particles the changes that ensue on the surface morphology of op due to magnetization can understand by comparing sem micrographs of op and mop the sem images of the unadsorbed and adsorbed op and mop are shown in fig 1 the surface morphology of op has been perceived to be mainly displayed pleated and porous surface fig 1 a fig 1 c clearly specifies that after the magnetization the surface of adsorbent exhibited a predominance of smaller particles of different sizes distributed haphazardly upon the matrix this was due to the inclusion of nanoparticle in the matrix and significantly enhances the overall surface area of the magnetized adsorbent filled pores and the comparatively smooth and even surface of the adsorbed op and mop fig 1 b and d clearly points out that cv molecules get successfully adsorbed over the surface of the adsorbents edax analysis of op fig s4 a represented the peaks of c 47 73 wt 54 89 at o 52 21 wt 45 08 at and si 0 06 wt 0 03 at in the spectrum of magnetized op fig s4 c it was observed that the signals of c and o were present from the precursor of op whereas the presence of fe peak at 6 4 and 7 1 kev are associated to the binding energies of iron and the presence of oxygen peak at 0 6 kev affirms the successful modification of op by iron oxide bishnoi et al 2018 after adsorption of cv change in the composition of elements in both the adsorbents has been observed which shows the achievement of successful adsorption as presented in figs s4 b and d the tem micrographs for the op with and without magnetization are shown in fig 2 the tem images clearly indicate that the mop has achieved significant improvement in surface characteristics as the size of most of the particles reduced to the range of about 7 10 nm against that of op 80 121 nm further it has also been observed that fine compact and monodispersed distribution of magnetic particles on the surface of op have been successfully accomplished the selected area electron diffraction saed patterns figs s3 a and b shows that there are bright spots arranged in the form of concentric circles which indicated the more crystalline nature of the mop compared to the diffused pattern of the saed image of the op reza and ahmaruzzaman 2015 saed pattern of op and mop was also supported by xrd analysis fig 3 shows the ftir spectra of the op mop cv op and cv mop the spectra represented that op is decorated with a variety of different functional groups and their active involvement in magnetization and cv sequestration the broad peak in the spectrum of op observed at 3411 cm 1 is attributed to the overlapping of stretching vibration of o h of alcohol which was relocated in mop owing to the participation of the hydroxyl group ali et al 2018 stretching vibrations of aldehydic c h were apparent from the appearance of bands at 2884 cm 1 op and 2921 cm 1 mop wahab et al 2010 the occurrence of the steep band at 1589 and 1618 cm 1 in op and mop respectively was ascribed to co stretching of carboxylate ion kataria and garg 2018 the emergence of the peak at 1419 op and 1398 mop cm 1 revealed c h stretching vibration of methyl and methoxy group kataria and garg 2018 both c o stretching and o h deformation of carboxylic acids were apparent from the advent of the peak at 1308 cm 1 op and 1243 cm 1 mop basu et al 2017 the other weak to the medium bands in 1265 to 1046 cm 1 may be assigned to c n stretching of amines or c o stretching of the carboxylic group alizadeh et al 2017 el messaoudi et al 2016 the shifting and relocation in the peaks of op from 3411 2884 1589 1419 1308 1022 and 586 cm 1 to 3399 2916 1622 1407 1307 1012 and 566 cm 1 in cv op respectively and mop peaks from 3362 2921 1618 1398 1243 1011 and 581 cm 1 to 3384 2912 1617 1382 1230 1013 and 565 cm 1 in cv mop respectively confirms the active involvement of the corresponding functional groups in the cv sequestration 3 2 effect of adsorbent dosage to examine the role of adsorbent dose on adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of cv from aqueous media the adsorbent dose of op and mop were varied from 0 04 to 10 g l 1 at an initial cv concentration of 50 mg l 1 fig 4 illustrates the profile for cv adsorption on op and mop as a function of adsorbent dosage from the figure it was detected that the removal efficiency of cv increased markedly from 55 0 to 86 7 and 73 4 to 91 1 as the adsorbents dose increases from 0 4 to 2 g for op and 0 4 to 1 g for mop respectively beyond that the increase in removal efficiency of cv turns to be very low as both the adsorbents surface and cv concentration settles to equilibrium with each other thereby further enhancement in the dose does not enhance the removal efficiency to any considerable extent the increased removal efficiency with increasing adsorbent dose may be endorsed to the larger surface area and the easy accessibility of more active adsorbing sites on the other hand a remarkable decrease in adsorption capacity from 68 8 to 4 6 mg g 1 for op and 91 8 to 4 9 mg g 1 for mop with the increase of adsorbent dose from 0 4 to 10 g l 1 was observed this may be ascribed to the fact that the increased adsorbent concentration most likely raises the adsorbent interactions such as agglomeration and aggregation which leads to a substantial reduction in the overall surface area of the adsorbent and subsequently reduces its adsorption capacity on both op and mop furthermore phenomena like agglomeration and aggregation create the hindrance for cv molecules to reach the vacant sites of the adsorbent by considering the above facts the optimum values of adsorbent doses i e 2 and 1 g l 1 were respectively chosen for the adsorption of cv onto the op and mop these adsorbents dose correspond to 21 7 and 45 6 mg g 1 of adsorption capacity and 86 7 and 91 1 of removal efficiency of the cv of concentration 50 mg l 1 onto the op and mop respectively 3 3 effect of ph ph is one of the crucial parameters in the adsorption process the effect of ph on the adsorption capacity of cv onto the op and mop was scrutinized in the ph range of 3 11 at an adsorbent dose of 2 and 1 g l 1 respectively and 50 mg l 1 of initial cv concentration and the results are graphically illustrated in fig 5 it has been observed that the adsorption of cv was highly dependent on the initial ph of the solution as can be seen in fig 5 the adsorption capacity increases significantly from 11 1 to 21 7 mg g 1 for op and 28 1 45 6 mg g 1 for mop with an increase in the ph from 3 to 8 and become almost stagnant afterward up to ph of 11 the maximum adsorption capacity of 21 7 and 45 6 mg g 1 for op and mop respectively was observed at ph 8 this could be well elucidated by understanding the influence of ph on the adsorbent surface and pzc depending upon the ph of the solution the surface of the adsorbent undergoes protonation or deprotonation at ph pzc pzc of op is 6 5 and for mop is 7 fig 5 inset the surface of adsorbent accomplishes negative charge which resulted in the deprotonation of the functional groups present on the surface of the adsorbent and consequently acted as the attracting sites for the cationic cv molecules thus at higher ph this cationic dye is susceptible to better adsorption as clearly observed in fig 5 while at ph pzc more protons are available to protonate the surface functional group and provided positively charged binding sites for the cationic cv molecules and thus lead to the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged adsorbent surface and cationic cv dye molecule which dissuaded the adsorption of cv onto the op and mop 3 4 effect of contact time and kinetic study the amount of cv adsorbed onto the pristine and magnetized op was studied as a function of adsorbate adsorbent contact time at five different initial concentrations 25 50 87 5 100 150 mg l 1 of cv at 303 k the results are shown in fig 6 it is apparent from the figure that the adsorption of cv increased rapidly at an initial stage continuing up to 30 min and then gradually slows down and reached to equilibrium point in 90 and 70 min with an adsorbing capacity of 21 7 and 45 6 mg g 1 for op and mop respectively the high initial uptake of cv on both the adsorbents is ascribed to the abundant availability of active vacant adsorbing sites on the adsorbent surface and with the continuous occupancy of these adsorbing sites the adsorption rate slows down it is also evident from fig 6 that the adsorption capacity of cv onto the op and mop increases with the increase in the initial concentrations of cv this is due to the increase in the requisite driving force which accelerates the mass transfer rate of cv onto the op and mop adsorbents the kinetics of the adsorption of cv onto the op and mop was observed by carrying the time dependent studies various kinetics models viz pseudo first order p f o pseudo second order p s o intraparticle diffusion ipd elovich elv and liquid film diffusion lfd mashkoor and nasar 2019b tan and hameed 2017 were applied to interpret the experimental data to regulate the governing mechanism for the adsorption of dye from aqueous media the linear forms of different models are presented in table s2 the values of kinetic parameters for the adsorption of cv onto the op and mop as found from these kinetic equations are presented in table 1 a good agreement between the theoretical adsorption capacities calculated from the p s o kinetics model with the experimental adsorption capacity for both the adsorbents together with higher r2 values revealed that the kinetics of the adsorption process followed this model which suggested that the rate limiting step was a chemical sorption chemisorption between the adsorbate and adsorbent under the studied experimental conditions ho and mckay 1998 the p s o plot for op and mop displayed in fig s5 specifies that the plot of t qt versus t is linear at all concentrations of cv a similar trend of p s o kinetics has also been reported in the previous studies for the adsorption of cv dye onto the different magnetically modified as well as native adsorbents as given in table 3 the values of p s o kinetics parameters as stated for various adsorbents are summarized in this table to further identify the adsorption kinetics behavior of cv dye onto the op and mop the ipd and lfd models were also exploited the plot of the former model qt versus t1 2 based on the experimental data shown in fig 7 and the values of the parameters associated with this model are given in table 1 as the plot fig 7 does not pass through the origin shows that the intraparticle diffusion is not the rate determining step further this plot illustrates the multi linearity and by and large represented by two regions separated by the intersection of linear plots which indicates that the adsorption of cv on both the adsorbents was accompanied by two steps the first sharper region shows the instantaneous external surface adsorption while the second region is attributed to the gradual adsorption stage of intraparticle diffusion and the attainment of equilibrium this inferred that both the external surface adsorption and intraparticle diffusion possibly controlled the kinetics of cv onto the op and mop moreover a linear plot of ln 1 f vs t passing through origin is indicative of the lfd controlled adsorption as the plot not shown did not have zero intercepts table 1 the experimental outcome clearly confirms the unsuitability of this kinetic model 3 5 adsorption isotherm the study of adsorption isotherms is important to elucidate how adsorbate molecules interact with the adsorbent surface the outcomes of the present equilibrium adsorption study have been explored with three commonly used models viz langmuir freundlich and temkin models foo and hameed 2010 to illustrate the interaction of cv with op and mop langmuir model assumes that the structure of adsorbent is homogeneous where all adsorption sites are identical and energetically comparable and demonstrates the establishment of monolayer coverage of adsorbate molecules over the adsorbent surface the linearized equation of this model is given in table s2 furthermore the favorability of the adsorption is expressed by the separation factor rl 1 1 k l c o the values of rl shows that the adsorption is considered as irreversible rl 0 favorable 0 rl 1 linear rl 1 and unfavorable rl 1 the freundlich isotherm was employed to define the heterogeneous systems and reversible adsorption which does not confine to the monolayer coverage the linear form of this isotherm is also presented in table s2 temkin adsorption isotherm presumes that the adsorbent adsorbate interaction in the adsorption process is accompanying with the linear reduction in the heat of adsorption with the coverage of the adsorbent surface the linear form of this isotherm is given in table s2 the generated isotherm data for the adsorption of cv onto the op and mop were analyzed in the light of these isotherms and outcomes so obtained are given in table 2 this table exhibits a reasonable fit to the langmuir model fig s6 confirmed by r2 values closer to unity 0 995 and 0 991 respectively this suggests that the adsorption of cv onto the op and mop as a monolayer coverage and constant adsorption energy the value of maximum monolayer adsorption capacity qm as found at 303 k is also given in table 2 freundlich and temkin isotherm models exhibit lower values of r2 for both the adsorbents signifying their incompatibility for inferring adsorption of cv onto the op and mop further the values of rl was lies in the range of 0 1 at all initial cv concentration indicating a high degree of favorability of the adsorption process several research studies have been explored on the removal of cv onto the various types of modified and pristine inexpensive adsorbents as given in table 3 these adsorbents also obey langmuir s adsorption isotherm and the reported langmuir parameters by these researchers have been compiled and compared with our results in this table this table clearly shows that qm value accompanying with mop is the best one 3 6 adsorption thermodynamics the results of the thermodynamic studies showed that the adsorption of cv increases with increasing temperature from 303 k to 333 k in order to examine a closer insight into the nature of the adsorption of cv onto the op and mop the thermodynamic factors such as the changes in the standard gibb s free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs accompanying with the adsorption process were determined by using the equations given in table s2 values of δg at different temperatures 303 333 k evaluated from eq s9 and other thermodynamic factors such as δh and δs as obtained from respective plots fig s7 are listed in table s1 this table shows that the thermodynamic behavior of both adsorbents op and mop towards cv is the same the negative δg values increase with the rise of temperature which reveals that the adsorption of cv is thermodynamically feasible under the adopted laboratory conditions the positive values of δh and δs for both the adsorbents indicate that the process is endothermic in nature and associated with the increase in the degree of randomness at the adsorbate adsorbent interface during cv adsorption 3 7 desorption studies for an adsorbent to be used for practical purposes it is essential that it should be easily regenerable for several cycles after adsorption hence adsorption desorption experiments were conducted several times to check the regenerability of the cv loaded op and mop adsorbents five diverse media namely viz 0 1 m hcl 0 1 m h2so4 0 1 m ch3cooh 0 1 m naoh ethanol and hpw were used for this purpose among these 0 1 m hcl and ethanol were proved to be the promising media for regenerating op and mop adsorbents as shown in fig s8 both 0 1 m hcl and ethanol were observed to have a competitive role during desorption the performance of ethanol is better for mop while 0 1 m hcl is the most suitable one for op thus it can be concluded that the mop adsorbent is quite stable with a reasonable regeneration rate and excellent efficiency and hence is adequate to be used for practical purposes 4 mechanism it was confirmed from the ftir analysis fig 3 that the adsorbent consists of a large number of oxygen carrying functional groups it is reasonable to predict that these functional groups can provide considerable adsorption sites for the adsorption of cationic cv dye as discussed in section 3 3 the ph of the solution has strongly influenced the extent of interaction since the properties of the adsorbent surface varied greatly under various ph when the ph of the solution was higher than pzc the electrostatic interaction was mainly playing a crucial role in the adsorption of the cationic cv molecules with negatively charged carboxylate groups while if the ph of the solution was less than pzc the surface functional groups were protonated hence dissuaded the adsorption process it was also observed from fig 5 that the considerable adsorption of cv also occurred in an acidic medium that may be accounted to be due to hydrogen bonding with a hydroxyl group these results corroborate the findings of ftir analysis which showed the obvious shift in the peaks after adsorption of cv alongside intraparticle diffusion through pores takes part in the adsorption process but may not be conferred as the rate limiting step 5 conclusion the present research study demonstrates the improvement in the adsorption performance of op after magnetization for the sequestration of cv from aqueous media it was found that adsorption of cv was dependent on several batch factors such as adsorbate adsorbent contact time ph of the solution initial cv concentration and temperature of the system the adsorption capacity for op and mop was observed to increase with the increase of initial cv concentration and equilibrium was attained in 90 and 70 min respectively isotherm and kinetics studies for both the adsorbents revealed that langmuir isotherm and p s o kinetic models were validated with the experimental adsorption data the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of mop 555 6 mg g 1 was significantly higher than that of op 138 9 mg g 1 it was found that the decolorization of cv on both the adsorbents was mainly occurred by the process of chemisorption with the concomitant participation of the physical force of attraction the thermodynamic examination suggested that the adsorption was feasible and accompanying with adsorption of heat and increase of entropy for both the adsorbents desorption study of cv from op and mop was found to be maximum with hydrochloric acid and the mop shows excellent regenerability over op up to five adsorption desorption cycles in view of the potential adsorption ability of mop over op easy separability excellent reusability the present study submits that mop is a novel effective and economically feasible for the elimination of dyes from wastewater declaration of competing
