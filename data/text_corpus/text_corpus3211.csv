16055,in surface waters photogenerated transients e g hydroxyl radicals carbonate radicals singlet oxygen and the triplet states of dissolved organic matter are known to play a role in the transformation of biorecalcitrant carbamazepine cbz small diketones such as acetylacetone acac and butanedione bd are naturally abundant and have been proven to be effective precursors of carbon and oxygen centered radicals however the photochemical kinetics and mechanisms of coexisting diketones and cbz are barely known herein the effects of acac and bd on the photochemical conversion of cbz were investigated compared with h2o2 which was the main oh precursor in the environment an enhancing effect was observed for the degradation of cbz by the addition of diketones the enhancing effect of diketones was ph dependent and much more significant than h2o2 under simulated solar irradiation on the basis of the identification of transient species and the competition kinetic model organic peroxyl radicals were found to play a dominant role in cbz photodegradation and the second order rate constants of the reaction between cbz and peroxyl radicals were determined to be approximately 107 108 m 1s 1 furthermore mutagenic acridine was found to be the major cumulative intermediate with a yield of 30 in the presence of diketones which might be an environmental concern this work indicates that the coexistence of diketones and persistent organic pollutants might lead to some detrimental effects on aquatic environments if the water is exposed to sunlight graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords carbamazepine acetylacetone butanedione photodegradation peroxyl radicals 1 introduction over the past two decades the presence of pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps in aquatic environments has led to concerns about their cumulative threat to the ecological security evgenidou et al 2015 wu et al 2014 yang et al 2011 carbamazepine cbz a nitrogen containing aromatic heterocyclic compound with stable structure has been widely used for peripheral neuralgia manic depression and other psychiatric diseases li et al 2021 owing to its extensive use and improper disposal cbz is becoming one of the most frequently detected pharmaceutical residues in water bodies at levels of ng l 1 μg l 1 and an indicator of ppcps contamination of the aquatic environment de laurentiis et al 2012 tixier et al 2003 although the concentration of cbz is low long term exposure might have an adverse effect on bacteria algae invertebrates and fish donner et al 2013 vernouillet et al 2010 european legislation on the classification and labeling of chemicals has recognized cbz with potential toxic effects to aquatic organisms and ecosystems bessa et al 2019 therefore it is of great significance and urgency to explore the environmental fate of cbz photodegradation under solar irradiation has been considered a very important attenuation pathway for ppcps in the natural aquatic environment vione et al 2014 although previous studies have shown that cbz had a high photostability dai et al 2012 yazdanbakhsh et al 2019 the observed photolysis rates of cbz in natural waters could be enhanced via photosensitized processes involving photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris including hydroxyl radicals oh singlet oxygen 1o2 superoxide radicals o2 and triplet excited state dom 3dom berg et al 2019 de laurentiis et al 2012 jasper and sedlak 2013 h2o2 dom nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 coexisting with cbz in water were indicated to be capable of promoting the formation of ppris which were reported to have a great influence on the photodegradation of cbz in natural waters or engineered water treatment systems involving uv based advanced oxidation technologies donner et al 2013 liu et al 2015 lu and hu 2019 small diketones such as butanedione denoted bd and acetylacetone denoted acac are widely found in nature hallagan 2017 shibamoto 2014 for example small diketones are natural products of biofermentation shibamoto 2014 in addition they are also important ring opening products of the photolysis of natural organic matter nom and oxidation of aromatic compounds prasse et al 2020 zhong et al 2017 concentrations of diketones have been reported to be tens of μm in atmospheric cloud water and approximately 100 µg l 1 of dicarbonyl products were detected after ozone oxidation in the urban water treatment process faust et al 1997 zhong et al 2017 the yields of dicarbonyl products in the oxidation of phenols were up to 46 prasse et al 2020 therefore the coexistence of diketones and pharmaceuticals in the sunlit surface waters is highly possible in recent years diketones are of interest due to their redox properties and photochemical activity houska et al 2021 lim et al 2022 marrero ortiz et al 2019 marron et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 2014 zeng and arnold found that dicarbonyl structures could preferentially generate harmful disinfection byproducts in chlorination zeng and arnold 2014 zhang and coworkers reported that small diketones were more efficient and target selective for the degradation of dyes under uv irradiation and could be used as potential photoactivators zhang et al 2014 in our previous work zhang et al 2017 we found that acac accelerated the photodecomposition of several pharmaceuticals e g cbz oxytetracycline and tetracycline however the degradation mechanisms as well as the environmental fate of cbz by diketones are still barely known herein we systematically investigated the photodegradation of cbz by two diketones i e acac and bd with h2o2 as a reference the main objectives of this study are i to compare the effects of diketones and h2o2 on the kinetics of cbz photolysis ii to clarify the roles of reactive species and photolysis mechanisms of cbz in uv diketone processes and iii to identify the main byproducts of cbz in various photochemical processes the results are expected to be helpful to better understand the fate of cbz in aquatic systems and enhance the fundamental understanding of the photochemical interactions of diketones and micropollutants 2 materials

photodegradation of cbz were extracted for identification 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of diketones on the photodegradation of cbz in natural waters the thermal and the photo induced decomposition of h2o2 lead to the formation of oh which has been proved to have a significant impact on the fate of ppcps gligorovski et al 2015 diketones are effective sources of alkoxy radicals through the photolytic cleavage via the norrish reaction faust et al 1997 the formed alkoxy radicals immediately react in a bimolecular reaction with dissolved oxygen which are virtually diffusion controlled and usually irreversible von sonntag and schuchmann 1991 to produce peroxyl radicals as described in scheme 1 although these alkoxy peroxyl radicals are less reactive than oh the greater selectivity and longer diffusion distance would compensate zhang and huang 2020 in addition diketones have higher absorption coefficients as well as spectral overlap with sunlight than h2o2 fig s2 therefore diketones might also exert a considerable influence on the photo transformation of pharmaceuticals the above speculation was well supported by the photodegradation of cbz with xe lamp simulated sunlight the degradation of cbz followed pseudo first order kinetics with r 2 values greater than 0 97 fig s3 and the k 1 values pseudo first order degradation rate constants were showed in fig 1 the promotion effect of diketones was significantly better than that of h2o2 in the same conditions for example the k 1 values of cbz in ultrapure water in xe acac and xe bd processes were 2 2 and 4 9 times higher than those in xe h2o2 respectively replaced ultrapure water with real river water significantly reduced the accelerating effects of diketones and completely suppressed the effect of h2o2 which might result from the quenching effects of inorganic carbon ic 28 2 mg l and dom abs 254 nm 0 03 or the photon filtering of dom table s1 nevertheless the k 1 values of cbz in real river water with the addition of acac and bd were still 4 7 times and 3 2 times higher than those of h2o2 respectively fig 1 to facilitate more detailed investigation of the kinetics and mechanism medium pressure mercury lamp uv was used as light source as shown in fig 2 the addition of diketones or h2o2 significantly accelerated the photolysis rate of cbz as expected under uv irradiation as the concentration of acac increased from 25 μm to 100 μm the degradation rate of cbz increased from 0 017 min 1 to 0 037 min 1 which were 2 8 and 6 2 times higher than that of the control respectively fig 2a the performance of uv bd process was similar to that of uv acac when the concentrations of acac and bd were in the range of 25 100 μm compared to diketones the addition of h2o2 has a high promotion effect for the degradation of cbz the k 1 values of cbz in the uv h2o2 system were 2 3 times higher than those in the uv diketone processes at the same dosage fig 2a however when the light intensity was gradually reduced the performance of h2o2 showed a rapid decrease fig 2b diketones did not seem to be sensitive to the light intensity in the range of 1 42 6 25 mw cm 2 and the promotion effects of diketones for cbz degradation were close to that of h2o2 at 1 42 mw cm 2 fig 2b which might be related to the spectrum of action and the number of photons absorbed by h2o2 and diketones fig s4 showed the uv vis spectra of cbz h2o2 acac and bd aqueous solutions as well as the emission spectra of mercury lamp although cbz had two large absorption peaks at 285 and 210 nm it has a high photostability which was consistent with a previous study ф254 nm 0 0006 mol einstein 1 ulliman et al 2018 acac had a high absorption peak at 274 nm and was two orders of magnitude higher than bd or h2o2 exhibiting a better resistance to inner filter effects caused by cbz bd and h2o2 have higher photolysis quantum yields than acac according to the absorption of uv photons and the performance of cbz degradation in natural waters h2o2 has been found in seawater rain lakes and sewage lagoons at concentrations up to 10 5 m cooper et al 1988 which was an important source of oh through photolysis fenton and photo fenton processes and played key roles in the indirect photolysis of ppcps gligorovski et al 2015 these results above preliminarily demonstrate that diketones would also exert a considerable influence on the indirect photolysis of cbz when they are coexisted in surface waters 3 2 effects of the water matrix the effects of the water matrix e g no3 so4 2 h2po4 and cl on cbz photodegradation in uv diketone systems were studied at an initial ph of 7 0 fig 2c so4 2 h2po4 and cl had negligible effects on all photochemical processes the addition of no3 0 1 mm 10 mm significantly enhanced the photodegradation of cbz figs 2c and s5 hco3 10 mm inhibited the degradation by up to above 20 in uv diketone and uv h2o2 processes in aquatic environments the photolysis of no3 is an important source of oh which can generate oh with a quantum yield of 0 090 mack and bolton 1999 the steady state concentration of oh in natural waters containing 5 50 ppm no3 was reported as 5 10 16 m russi et al 1982 under the given conditions in this work the steady state concentration of oh after the addition of 0 1 mm no3 was estimated as 2 19 10 13 m table 1 which accounted for 71 contributions of the cbz degradation in uv no3 process hco3 is an effective oh scavenger that reacts with oh to form carbonate radicals co3 k2 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 sanchez polo et al 2013 which has a relatively low reactivity with cbz k2 4 2 106 m 1 s 1 and is approximately 1000 times less reactive than oh k2 7 0 109 m 1 s 1 wojnarovits et al 2020 therefore hco3 exhibited an inhibitory effect in addition the ability of solution ph buffering induced by hco3 might also matter 3 3 effects of solution ph during the degradation of cbz the solution ph gradually decreased from 7 0 to 4 5 in uv diketone systems the inhibitory effect of hco3 mentioned above indicated that the degradation of cbz might be related to solution ph as shown in fig 2d uv and uv h2o2 systems were minimally influenced by ph while the uv diketone processes were ph dependent and much favorable in acidic conditions when the solution ph increased from 3 0 to 11 0 the k 1 values in uv acac and uv bd processes decreased by 70 and 81 respectively solution ph could affect the protonated deprotonated species distributions leading to differences in photolysis kinetics cbz pka1 1 0 pka2 13 9 and bd pka 14 0 remained neutral in the ph range of 3 0 to 11 0 bizi 2019 acac has a pk a of 9 0 zhang et al 2014 the protonated enol structure of acac was supposed to play a crucial role in the decolorization of dyes due to the poor performance when the solution ph 9 0 zhang et al 2014 in this work the degradation of cbz by both uv acac and uv bd was ph dependent and showed a gradual inhibition from ph 3 0 to 11 0 the observed ph effects seemed to have little relationship with the speciation of cbz or diketones which might be of relevance to the acid base properties of the key active species or acid catalyzed reaction mechanism in the attack of cbz 3 4 photolysis mechanism of cbz in the uv diketone processes 3 4 1 identification of key active species the excited triplet ppcps could be quenched by o2 through either energy transfer to generate 1o2 or charge transfer to form o2 the photoreactions of many ppcps involve a self sensitized photooxidation process via 1o2 or other reactive oxygen species ros the addition of diketones significantly promoted the consumption of do and the k 1 values of do consumption were 0 028 min 1 and 0 017 min 1 in the uv acac and uv bd processes respectively fig 3a the rapid depletion of do suggested that reactive oxygen species might be involved in the degradation of cbz in uv diketone in addition during the degradation of cbz diketones were also continuously consumed fig s6 the carbon centered free radicals generated from the direct photolysis of diketones might also play a role to identify the key active species for cbz degradation a series of scavenging and quenching experiments were performed nbt is a typical indicator of o2 which reacts with o2 to produce an intermediate with an absorption peak at 530 nm bielski et al 1980 as shown in fig 3b no absorption peak at 530 nm was observed with the addition of nbt in uv diketone systems which demonstrated that o2 was not the decisive species tba was a well known oh scavenger but cannot quench acetyl per oxyl radicals 2 4 hd contained two c c double bonds which were easily attacked by free radicals for example 2 4 hd could react rapidly with oh k 2 9 16 109 m 1 s 1 and with aroyloxyl radicals k 2 5 108 m 1 s 1 kim et al 2020 ffa was commonly used to detect 1o2 the reaction rate constants of ffa and 1o2 and oh were 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 and 1 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively ter halle and richard 2006 on the basis of these rate constants 2 4 hd can scavenge both oh and acetyl per oxyl radicals while tba only scavenges oh which could be utilized to differentiate the contributions of oh and peroxyl radicals to the degradation of compounds oh is well known to be the key species in the uv h2o2 system as shown in fig 3c the addition of tba completely inhibited the degradation of cbz in the uv h2o2 process as expected and decreased the k 1 values by 21 28 in the uv diketone the addition of 2 4 hd completely inhibited the degradation of cbz for both uv diketone and uv h2o2 these results above suggest that carbon centered radicals and might be the main active species in uv diketone the addition of ffa also completely inhibited the degradation of cbz for the uv diketone processes which indicates that 1o2 might matter however it was not consistent with the results obtained in ar purged experiments ar purging significantly enhanced the k 1 values of cbz in the uv and uv acac processes but had little effect on the photodegradation of cbz in the uv bd process the inhibiting effects of do in the uv and uv acac processes indicate the role of the triplet excited states in the transformation of cbz furthermore dmpo was used as an electron spin trapping agent to identify free radical species as shown in fig 3d dmpo oh signals were captured as expected in the uv h2o2 system αn αβ h 14 8 g no 1o2 signal was detected in the uv diketone indicating that 1o2 was not a primary active species the dmpo adduct in the irradiated bd solution was identified as dmpo ch3c o αn 15 2 g and αβ h 18 7 g which was in agreement with previous studies rota et al 1997 nakao et al 1999 2000 wu et al 2020 in addition dmpo ch3c o was observed at ph 3 0 and ph 7 0 but was almost undetectable at ph 11 0 fig s7 which was consistent with the effect of ph on the photolysis of cbz in uv bd system fig 2d in contrast almost no signals corresponding to dmpo adducts was observed for the irradiated acac solution at ph 3 0 7 0 or 11 0 fig s7 previous studies used high molar ratio of dmpo and acac 100 200 1 in n2 purged solution and the acetyl radical signal with weak intensity was observed wu et al 2019 2020 zhang et al 2014 whether the difference in the intensity of dmpo adducts between uv acac and uv bd system stems from the yields of acetyl radicals or the interference of dmpo on the production of radicals is inconclusive which warrants a further study 3 4 2 the contributions of oh and peroxyl radicals in aqueous solution approximately 77 of bd molecules existed in the hydrated form bell and mcdougall 1960 scheme 1 the photolysis of bd could lead to the formation of acetyl radicals ch3c o or hydrated acetyl radicals ch3c oh 2 and the photolysis quantum yield was reported to be 0 93 at 313 nm faust et al 1997 the presence of do in solution approximately 0 25 mm could scavenge these carbon centered radicals at diffusion controlled rates ingold 1969 leading to the formation of peroxyacetyl radicals ch3c o oo and ch3c oh 2oo similarly photolysis of acac might produce various organic peroxyl radicals the generation of oh and peroxyl radicals in various photochemical processes were determined with tpa and abts as probing molecules text s1 and fig s8 as shown in table 1 in the uv h2o2 and uv no3 systems the oh steady state concentrations oh ss were 5 22 10 13 m and 2 19 10 13 m respectively which were the major contributors to cbz degradation the contributions of the direct uv photolysis were small 8 18 in these photochemical systems in uv diketone the oh ss were in the range of 1 0 10 14 m to 2 4 10 14 m and the contributions of oh ss in the photodegradation of cbz were estimated to be less than 10 the steady state concentrations of peroxyl radicals pr ss 1 9 7 3 10 12 m were two orders of magnitude higher than those of oh ss and the contributions were above 70 these results suggest that peroxyl radicals were the key reactive species for cbz degradation in uv diketone ch3c o oo is known to have a strong oxidation ability e0 1 60 v zhang and huang 2020 the electron transfer rate constants of ch3c o oo with ascorbate n n n n tetramethyl p phenylenediamine tmpd and abts were reported in the range of 8 3 108 to 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 in water schuchmann and von sonntag 1988 the bimolecular reaction rate constant of ch3c o oo with cbz was estimated to be 107 108 m 1 s 1 table 1 which was 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of abts or tmpd 3 4 3 degradation products and mechanism in the uv diketone systems the photodegradation intermediates of cbz were identified by lc ms ms and the byproduct molecular weight was assigned on the basis of the pseudomolecular ions m h and m na the top 6 intermediates with high abundance were manually investigated in uv uv diketone and uv h2o2 processes table s2 the peak area of structural isomers was summed based on the same m z but different retention times in lc ms chromatograms for simplification the detected intermediates were numbered from p1 to p10 in fig 4 p1 m z 253 10 p2 m z 251 08 and p6 m z 180 08 had a very high peak intensity in the direct photolysis of cbz fig 4a in uv acac and uv bd irradiated cbz solutions the distribution of phototransformation products showed similarity as well as evolutionary behavior fig 4b and c the abundance of p1 m z 253 10 p2 m z 251 08 and p3 m z 225 10 peaked at 5 min and then decreased while the abundance of p4 m z 223 09 p5 m z 196 07 and p6 m z 180 08 continued to increase over the whole reaction 20 min fig 4b and c in uv h2o2 system p1 m z 253 10 and p2 m z 251 08 was the main phototransformation intermediate fig 4d several groups have studied the photochemical behavior of cbz bo et al 2019 calisto et al 2011 challis et al 2014 de laurentiis et al 2012 donner et al 2013 10 11 epoxycarbamazepine m z 253 10 and acridine m z 180 08 were observed as the main products for direct photolysis khetan and collins 2007 the epoxide yield was approximately 25 on cbz and the photochemical yield of mutagenic acridine was in 3 0 3 5 range de laurentiis et al 2012 khetan and collins 2007 10 11 dihydro 10 11 trans dihydroxy cbz m z 253 10 was also formed upon direct photolysis with a yield of 1 4 which was the main product of oh attack with a yield of 9 0 de laurentiis et al 2012 the products detected here in the uv and uv h2o2 processes were consistent with those previously reported to further confirm that p6 m z 180 08 was acridine known for the mutagenic and carcinogenic activity ali et al 2018 a commercially available acridine was used the identical retention time and the ms2 mass fragmentation spectra proved that p6 m z 180 08 which accumulated in uv diketone systems was acridine figs s9 and s10 after 20 min irradiation the yields of acridine in uv acac and uv bd systems were 55 6 and 34 1 respectively which were much higher than those in uv 7 9 and uv h2o2 0 3 fig 5 these results showed that diketones not only accelerated cbz transformation but also led to changes in the product distribution which might pose greater toxicity than direct photolysis the reaction pathways for accelerated photolysis of cbz in the uv h2o2 or uv diketone processes were proposed based on the detected intermediates scheme 2 oh was the major species in the uv h2o2 process as previously described aromatic ring and n heterocyclic ring hydroxylated cbz p1a and p1b m z 253 10 were the primary intermediates and hydroxylation p1a m z 253 10 p1b m z 253 10 p7a m z 271 11 and ring opening p7b m z 271 11 p8c m z 269 09 were the main pathways in contrast to the uv h2o2 system the reaction mechanism in uv diketone was nonhydroxyl radical attack in the cbz molecule a seven membered ring containing an olefinic bond is obviously more active than benzene rings peroxyl radicals were prone to attack at the olefinic double bond on the heterocyclic ring and formed 10 11 epoxide cbz p1c m z 253 10 p1c was then oxidized to generate p1d m z 253 10 then the cho group connected to the heterocycle of p1d was removed to form p3 m z 225 10 or p4 m z 223 09 subsequently acridine p6 m z 180 08 was formed through the removal of conh2 acridine had high stability and easily accumulated as described in fig 4b and c moreover five membered ring compounds p2a p2b and p2c m z 251 08 which might form through the interaction of amino nitrogen and adjacent benzene were also proposed in all photochemical processes 4 conclusions photochemical reactions in surface waters are a major pathway in the fate of cbz h2o2 no3 no2 and dom are believed to have important photochemical activity influencing the fate of ppcps the results in this work demonstrated that small diketones were able to affect the photolysis of cbz both acac and bd could enhance the photolysis of cbz under uv irradiation as well as in surface water under simulated sunlight irradiation peroxyl radicals derived from the cleavage of diketones were the main species and accounted for 70 contributions of cbz degradation these peroxyl radicals were prone to attack the olefin bond of cbz resulting in a different product distribution from that of direct photolysis most importantly an increasing proportion of acridine yield 30 which has been known for the mutagenic and carcinogenic activity was observed in the presence of diketones in surface waters almost all free organic radicals that are formed thermally photochemically or during oxidation processes react rapidly with oxygen to form the corresponding peroxyl radicals this work pointed out the importance of indirect photolysis pathways involving peroxyl radicals which could not be overlooked when assessing the photochemical fate of ppcps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this

16055,in surface waters photogenerated transients e g hydroxyl radicals carbonate radicals singlet oxygen and the triplet states of dissolved organic matter are known to play a role in the transformation of biorecalcitrant carbamazepine cbz small diketones such as acetylacetone acac and butanedione bd are naturally abundant and have been proven to be effective precursors of carbon and oxygen centered radicals however the photochemical kinetics and mechanisms of coexisting diketones and cbz are barely known herein the effects of acac and bd on the photochemical conversion of cbz were investigated compared with h2o2 which was the main oh precursor in the environment an enhancing effect was observed for the degradation of cbz by the addition of diketones the enhancing effect of diketones was ph dependent and much more significant than h2o2 under simulated solar irradiation on the basis of the identification of transient species and the competition kinetic model organic peroxyl radicals were found to play a dominant role in cbz photodegradation and the second order rate constants of the reaction between cbz and peroxyl radicals were determined to be approximately 107 108 m 1s 1 furthermore mutagenic acridine was found to be the major cumulative intermediate with a yield of 30 in the presence of diketones which might be an environmental concern this work indicates that the coexistence of diketones and persistent organic pollutants might lead to some detrimental effects on aquatic environments if the water is exposed to sunlight graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords carbamazepine acetylacetone butanedione photodegradation peroxyl radicals 1 introduction over the past two decades the presence of pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps in aquatic environments has led to concerns about their cumulative threat to the ecological security evgenidou et al 2015 wu et al 2014 yang et al 2011 carbamazepine cbz a nitrogen containing aromatic heterocyclic compound with stable structure has been widely used for peripheral neuralgia manic depression and other psychiatric diseases li et al 2021 owing to its extensive use and improper disposal cbz is becoming one of the most frequently detected pharmaceutical residues in water bodies at levels of ng l 1 μg l 1 and an indicator of ppcps contamination of the aquatic environment de laurentiis et al 2012 tixier et al 2003 although the concentration of cbz is low long term exposure might have an adverse effect on bacteria algae invertebrates and fish donner et al 2013 vernouillet et al 2010 european legislation on the classification and labeling of chemicals has recognized cbz with potential toxic effects to aquatic organisms and ecosystems bessa et al 2019 therefore it is of great significance and urgency to explore the environmental fate of cbz photodegradation under solar irradiation has been considered a very important attenuation pathway for ppcps in the natural aquatic environment vione et al 2014 although previous studies have shown that cbz had a high photostability dai et al 2012 yazdanbakhsh et al 2019 the observed photolysis rates of cbz in natural waters could be enhanced via photosensitized processes involving photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris including hydroxyl radicals oh singlet oxygen 1o2 superoxide radicals o2 and triplet excited state dom 3dom berg et al 2019 de laurentiis et al 2012 jasper and sedlak 2013 h2o2 dom nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 coexisting with cbz in water were indicated to be capable of promoting the formation of ppris which were reported to have a great influence on the photodegradation of cbz in natural waters or engineered water treatment systems involving uv based advanced oxidation technologies donner et al 2013 liu et al 2015 lu and hu 2019 small diketones such as butanedione denoted bd and acetylacetone denoted acac are widely found in nature hallagan 2017 shibamoto 2014 for example small diketones are natural products of biofermentation shibamoto 2014 in addition they are also important ring opening products of the photolysis of natural organic matter nom and oxidation of aromatic compounds prasse et al 2020 zhong et al 2017 concentrations of diketones have been reported to be tens of μm in atmospheric cloud water and approximately 100 µg l 1 of dicarbonyl products were detected after ozone oxidation in the urban water treatment process faust et al 1997 zhong et al 2017 the yields of dicarbonyl products in the oxidation of phenols were up to 46 prasse et al 2020 therefore the coexistence of diketones and pharmaceuticals in the sunlit surface waters is highly possible in recent years diketones are of interest due to their redox properties and photochemical activity houska et al 2021 lim et al 2022 marrero ortiz et al 2019 marron et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 2014 zeng and arnold found that dicarbonyl structures could preferentially generate harmful disinfection byproducts in chlorination zeng and arnold 2014 zhang and coworkers reported that small diketones were more efficient and target selective for the degradation of dyes under uv irradiation and could be used as potential photoactivators zhang et al 2014 in our previous work zhang et al 2017 we found that acac accelerated the photodecomposition of several pharmaceuticals e g cbz oxytetracycline and tetracycline however the degradation mechanisms as well as the environmental fate of cbz by diketones are still barely known herein we systematically investigated the photodegradation of cbz by two diketones i e acac and bd with h2o2 as a reference the main objectives of this study are i to compare the effects of diketones and h2o2 on the kinetics of cbz photolysis ii to clarify the roles of reactive species and photolysis mechanisms of cbz in uv diketone processes and iii to identify the main byproducts of cbz in various photochemical processes the results are expected to be helpful to better understand the fate of cbz in aquatic systems and enhance the fundamental understanding of the photochemical interactions of diketones and micropollutants 2 materials

photodegradation of cbz were extracted for identification 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of diketones on the photodegradation of cbz in natural waters the thermal and the photo induced decomposition of h2o2 lead to the formation of oh which has been proved to have a significant impact on the fate of ppcps gligorovski et al 2015 diketones are effective sources of alkoxy radicals through the photolytic cleavage via the norrish reaction faust et al 1997 the formed alkoxy radicals immediately react in a bimolecular reaction with dissolved oxygen which are virtually diffusion controlled and usually irreversible von sonntag and schuchmann 1991 to produce peroxyl radicals as described in scheme 1 although these alkoxy peroxyl radicals are less reactive than oh the greater selectivity and longer diffusion distance would compensate zhang and huang 2020 in addition diketones have higher absorption coefficients as well as spectral overlap with sunlight than h2o2 fig s2 therefore diketones might also exert a considerable influence on the photo transformation of pharmaceuticals the above speculation was well supported by the photodegradation of cbz with xe lamp simulated sunlight the degradation of cbz followed pseudo first order kinetics with r 2 values greater than 0 97 fig s3 and the k 1 values pseudo first order degradation rate constants were showed in fig 1 the promotion effect of diketones was significantly better than that of h2o2 in the same conditions for example the k 1 values of cbz in ultrapure water in xe acac and xe bd processes were 2 2 and 4 9 times higher than those in xe h2o2 respectively replaced ultrapure water with real river water significantly reduced the accelerating effects of diketones and completely suppressed the effect of h2o2 which might result from the quenching effects of inorganic carbon ic 28 2 mg l and dom abs 254 nm 0 03 or the photon filtering of dom table s1 nevertheless the k 1 values of cbz in real river water with the addition of acac and bd were still 4 7 times and 3 2 times higher than those of h2o2 respectively fig 1 to facilitate more detailed investigation of the kinetics and mechanism medium pressure mercury lamp uv was used as light source as shown in fig 2 the addition of diketones or h2o2 significantly accelerated the photolysis rate of cbz as expected under uv irradiation as the concentration of acac increased from 25 μm to 100 μm the degradation rate of cbz increased from 0 017 min 1 to 0 037 min 1 which were 2 8 and 6 2 times higher than that of the control respectively fig 2a the performance of uv bd process was similar to that of uv acac when the concentrations of acac and bd were in the range of 25 100 μm compared to diketones the addition of h2o2 has a high promotion effect for the degradation of cbz the k 1 values of cbz in the uv h2o2 system were 2 3 times higher than those in the uv diketone processes at the same dosage fig 2a however when the light intensity was gradually reduced the performance of h2o2 showed a rapid decrease fig 2b diketones did not seem to be sensitive to the light intensity in the range of 1 42 6 25 mw cm 2 and the promotion effects of diketones for cbz degradation were close to that of h2o2 at 1 42 mw cm 2 fig 2b which might be related to the spectrum of action and the number of photons absorbed by h2o2 and diketones fig s4 showed the uv vis spectra of cbz h2o2 acac and bd aqueous solutions as well as the emission spectra of mercury lamp although cbz had two large absorption peaks at 285 and 210 nm it has a high photostability which was consistent with a previous study ф254 nm 0 0006 mol einstein 1 ulliman et al 2018 acac had a high absorption peak at 274 nm and was two orders of magnitude higher than bd or h2o2 exhibiting a better resistance to inner filter effects caused by cbz bd and h2o2 have higher photolysis quantum yields than acac according to the absorption of uv photons and the performance of cbz degradation in natural waters h2o2 has been found in seawater rain lakes and sewage lagoons at concentrations up to 10 5 m cooper et al 1988 which was an important source of oh through photolysis fenton and photo fenton processes and played key roles in the indirect photolysis of ppcps gligorovski et al 2015 these results above preliminarily demonstrate that diketones would also exert a considerable influence on the indirect photolysis of cbz when they are coexisted in surface waters 3 2 effects of the water matrix the effects of the water matrix e g no3 so4 2 h2po4 and cl on cbz photodegradation in uv diketone systems were studied at an initial ph of 7 0 fig 2c so4 2 h2po4 and cl had negligible effects on all photochemical processes the addition of no3 0 1 mm 10 mm significantly enhanced the photodegradation of cbz figs 2c and s5 hco3 10 mm inhibited the degradation by up to above 20 in uv diketone and uv h2o2 processes in aquatic environments the photolysis of no3 is an important source of oh which can generate oh with a quantum yield of 0 090 mack and bolton 1999 the steady state concentration of oh in natural waters containing 5 50 ppm no3 was reported as 5 10 16 m russi et al 1982 under the given conditions in this work the steady state concentration of oh after the addition of 0 1 mm no3 was estimated as 2 19 10 13 m table 1 which accounted for 71 contributions of the cbz degradation in uv no3 process hco3 is an effective oh scavenger that reacts with oh to form carbonate radicals co3 k2 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 sanchez polo et al 2013 which has a relatively low reactivity with cbz k2 4 2 106 m 1 s 1 and is approximately 1000 times less reactive than oh k2 7 0 109 m 1 s 1 wojnarovits et al 2020 therefore hco3 exhibited an inhibitory effect in addition the ability of solution ph buffering induced by hco3 might also matter 3 3 effects of solution ph during the degradation of cbz the solution ph gradually decreased from 7 0 to 4 5 in uv diketone systems the inhibitory effect of hco3 mentioned above indicated that the degradation of cbz might be related to solution ph as shown in fig 2d uv and uv h2o2 systems were minimally influenced by ph while the uv diketone processes were ph dependent and much favorable in acidic conditions when the solution ph increased from 3 0 to 11 0 the k 1 values in uv acac and uv bd processes decreased by 70 and 81 respectively solution ph could affect the protonated deprotonated species distributions leading to differences in photolysis kinetics cbz pka1 1 0 pka2 13 9 and bd pka 14 0 remained neutral in the ph range of 3 0 to 11 0 bizi 2019 acac has a pk a of 9 0 zhang et al 2014 the protonated enol structure of acac was supposed to play a crucial role in the decolorization of dyes due to the poor performance when the solution ph 9 0 zhang et al 2014 in this work the degradation of cbz by both uv acac and uv bd was ph dependent and showed a gradual inhibition from ph 3 0 to 11 0 the observed ph effects seemed to have little relationship with the speciation of cbz or diketones which might be of relevance to the acid base properties of the key active species or acid catalyzed reaction mechanism in the attack of cbz 3 4 photolysis mechanism of cbz in the uv diketone processes 3 4 1 identification of key active species the excited triplet ppcps could be quenched by o2 through either energy transfer to generate 1o2 or charge transfer to form o2 the photoreactions of many ppcps involve a self sensitized photooxidation process via 1o2 or other reactive oxygen species ros the addition of diketones significantly promoted the consumption of do and the k 1 values of do consumption were 0 028 min 1 and 0 017 min 1 in the uv acac and uv bd processes respectively fig 3a the rapid depletion of do suggested that reactive oxygen species might be involved in the degradation of cbz in uv diketone in addition during the degradation of cbz diketones were also continuously consumed fig s6 the carbon centered free radicals generated from the direct photolysis of diketones might also play a role to identify the key active species for cbz degradation a series of scavenging and quenching experiments were performed nbt is a typical indicator of o2 which reacts with o2 to produce an intermediate with an absorption peak at 530 nm bielski et al 1980 as shown in fig 3b no absorption peak at 530 nm was observed with the addition of nbt in uv diketone systems which demonstrated that o2 was not the decisive species tba was a well known oh scavenger but cannot quench acetyl per oxyl radicals 2 4 hd contained two c c double bonds which were easily attacked by free radicals for example 2 4 hd could react rapidly with oh k 2 9 16 109 m 1 s 1 and with aroyloxyl radicals k 2 5 108 m 1 s 1 kim et al 2020 ffa was commonly used to detect 1o2 the reaction rate constants of ffa and 1o2 and oh were 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 and 1 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively ter halle and richard 2006 on the basis of these rate constants 2 4 hd can scavenge both oh and acetyl per oxyl radicals while tba only scavenges oh which could be utilized to differentiate the contributions of oh and peroxyl radicals to the degradation of compounds oh is well known to be the key species in the uv h2o2 system as shown in fig 3c the addition of tba completely inhibited the degradation of cbz in the uv h2o2 process as expected and decreased the k 1 values by 21 28 in the uv diketone the addition of 2 4 hd completely inhibited the degradation of cbz for both uv diketone and uv h2o2 these results above suggest that carbon centered radicals and might be the main active species in uv diketone the addition of ffa also completely inhibited the degradation of cbz for the uv diketone processes which indicates that 1o2 might matter however it was not consistent with the results obtained in ar purged experiments ar purging significantly enhanced the k 1 values of cbz in the uv and uv acac processes but had little effect on the photodegradation of cbz in the uv bd process the inhibiting effects of do in the uv and uv acac processes indicate the role of the triplet excited states in the transformation of cbz furthermore dmpo was used as an electron spin trapping agent to identify free radical species as shown in fig 3d dmpo oh signals were captured as expected in the uv h2o2 system αn αβ h 14 8 g no 1o2 signal was detected in the uv diketone indicating that 1o2 was not a primary active species the dmpo adduct in the irradiated bd solution was identified as dmpo ch3c o αn 15 2 g and αβ h 18 7 g which was in agreement with previous studies rota et al 1997 nakao et al 1999 2000 wu et al 2020 in addition dmpo ch3c o was observed at ph 3 0 and ph 7 0 but was almost undetectable at ph 11 0 fig s7 which was consistent with the effect of ph on the photolysis of cbz in uv bd system fig 2d in contrast almost no signals corresponding to dmpo adducts was observed for the irradiated acac solution at ph 3 0 7 0 or 11 0 fig s7 previous studies used high molar ratio of dmpo and acac 100 200 1 in n2 purged solution and the acetyl radical signal with weak intensity was observed wu et al 2019 2020 zhang et al 2014 whether the difference in the intensity of dmpo adducts between uv acac and uv bd system stems from the yields of acetyl radicals or the interference of dmpo on the production of radicals is inconclusive which warrants a further study 3 4 2 the contributions of oh and peroxyl radicals in aqueous solution approximately 77 of bd molecules existed in the hydrated form bell and mcdougall 1960 scheme 1 the photolysis of bd could lead to the formation of acetyl radicals ch3c o or hydrated acetyl radicals ch3c oh 2 and the photolysis quantum yield was reported to be 0 93 at 313 nm faust et al 1997 the presence of do in solution approximately 0 25 mm could scavenge these carbon centered radicals at diffusion controlled rates ingold 1969 leading to the formation of peroxyacetyl radicals ch3c o oo and ch3c oh 2oo similarly photolysis of acac might produce various organic peroxyl radicals the generation of oh and peroxyl radicals in various photochemical processes were determined with tpa and abts as probing molecules text s1 and fig s8 as shown in table 1 in the uv h2o2 and uv no3 systems the oh steady state concentrations oh ss were 5 22 10 13 m and 2 19 10 13 m respectively which were the major contributors to cbz degradation the contributions of the direct uv photolysis were small 8 18 in these photochemical systems in uv diketone the oh ss were in the range of 1 0 10 14 m to 2 4 10 14 m and the contributions of oh ss in the photodegradation of cbz were estimated to be less than 10 the steady state concentrations of peroxyl radicals pr ss 1 9 7 3 10 12 m were two orders of magnitude higher than those of oh ss and the contributions were above 70 these results suggest that peroxyl radicals were the key reactive species for cbz degradation in uv diketone ch3c o oo is known to have a strong oxidation ability e0 1 60 v zhang and huang 2020 the electron transfer rate constants of ch3c o oo with ascorbate n n n n tetramethyl p phenylenediamine tmpd and abts were reported in the range of 8 3 108 to 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 in water schuchmann and von sonntag 1988 the bimolecular reaction rate constant of ch3c o oo with cbz was estimated to be 107 108 m 1 s 1 table 1 which was 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of abts or tmpd 3 4 3 degradation products and mechanism in the uv diketone systems the photodegradation intermediates of cbz were identified by lc ms ms and the byproduct molecular weight was assigned on the basis of the pseudomolecular ions m h and m na the top 6 intermediates with high abundance were manually investigated in uv uv diketone and uv h2o2 processes table s2 the peak area of structural isomers was summed based on the same m z but different retention times in lc ms chromatograms for simplification the detected intermediates were numbered from p1 to p10 in fig 4 p1 m z 253 10 p2 m z 251 08 and p6 m z 180 08 had a very high peak intensity in the direct photolysis of cbz fig 4a in uv acac and uv bd irradiated cbz solutions the distribution of phototransformation products showed similarity as well as evolutionary behavior fig 4b and c the abundance of p1 m z 253 10 p2 m z 251 08 and p3 m z 225 10 peaked at 5 min and then decreased while the abundance of p4 m z 223 09 p5 m z 196 07 and p6 m z 180 08 continued to increase over the whole reaction 20 min fig 4b and c in uv h2o2 system p1 m z 253 10 and p2 m z 251 08 was the main phototransformation intermediate fig 4d several groups have studied the photochemical behavior of cbz bo et al 2019 calisto et al 2011 challis et al 2014 de laurentiis et al 2012 donner et al 2013 10 11 epoxycarbamazepine m z 253 10 and acridine m z 180 08 were observed as the main products for direct photolysis khetan and collins 2007 the epoxide yield was approximately 25 on cbz and the photochemical yield of mutagenic acridine was in 3 0 3 5 range de laurentiis et al 2012 khetan and collins 2007 10 11 dihydro 10 11 trans dihydroxy cbz m z 253 10 was also formed upon direct photolysis with a yield of 1 4 which was the main product of oh attack with a yield of 9 0 de laurentiis et al 2012 the products detected here in the uv and uv h2o2 processes were consistent with those previously reported to further confirm that p6 m z 180 08 was acridine known for the mutagenic and carcinogenic activity ali et al 2018 a commercially available acridine was used the identical retention time and the ms2 mass fragmentation spectra proved that p6 m z 180 08 which accumulated in uv diketone systems was acridine figs s9 and s10 after 20 min irradiation the yields of acridine in uv acac and uv bd systems were 55 6 and 34 1 respectively which were much higher than those in uv 7 9 and uv h2o2 0 3 fig 5 these results showed that diketones not only accelerated cbz transformation but also led to changes in the product distribution which might pose greater toxicity than direct photolysis the reaction pathways for accelerated photolysis of cbz in the uv h2o2 or uv diketone processes were proposed based on the detected intermediates scheme 2 oh was the major species in the uv h2o2 process as previously described aromatic ring and n heterocyclic ring hydroxylated cbz p1a and p1b m z 253 10 were the primary intermediates and hydroxylation p1a m z 253 10 p1b m z 253 10 p7a m z 271 11 and ring opening p7b m z 271 11 p8c m z 269 09 were the main pathways in contrast to the uv h2o2 system the reaction mechanism in uv diketone was nonhydroxyl radical attack in the cbz molecule a seven membered ring containing an olefinic bond is obviously more active than benzene rings peroxyl radicals were prone to attack at the olefinic double bond on the heterocyclic ring and formed 10 11 epoxide cbz p1c m z 253 10 p1c was then oxidized to generate p1d m z 253 10 then the cho group connected to the heterocycle of p1d was removed to form p3 m z 225 10 or p4 m z 223 09 subsequently acridine p6 m z 180 08 was formed through the removal of conh2 acridine had high stability and easily accumulated as described in fig 4b and c moreover five membered ring compounds p2a p2b and p2c m z 251 08 which might form through the interaction of amino nitrogen and adjacent benzene were also proposed in all photochemical processes 4 conclusions photochemical reactions in surface waters are a major pathway in the fate of cbz h2o2 no3 no2 and dom are believed to have important photochemical activity influencing the fate of ppcps the results in this work demonstrated that small diketones were able to affect the photolysis of cbz both acac and bd could enhance the photolysis of cbz under uv irradiation as well as in surface water under simulated sunlight irradiation peroxyl radicals derived from the cleavage of diketones were the main species and accounted for 70 contributions of cbz degradation these peroxyl radicals were prone to attack the olefin bond of cbz resulting in a different product distribution from that of direct photolysis most importantly an increasing proportion of acridine yield 30 which has been known for the mutagenic and carcinogenic activity was observed in the presence of diketones in surface waters almost all free organic radicals that are formed thermally photochemically or during oxidation processes react rapidly with oxygen to form the corresponding peroxyl radicals this work pointed out the importance of indirect photolysis pathways involving peroxyl radicals which could not be overlooked when assessing the photochemical fate of ppcps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this

further enhance the separation efficiency by capturing soluble substances jar tests confirmed the feasibility of activated carbon adsorption which could also roughen the surface of aggregates further over one year operation of a 300 m3 d ems equipment provided optimum operation strategies and evidence of system effectiveness more than 80 of particulate organics and 60 of soluble organics were removed within 10 min at an energy consumption of only 0 036 kwh m3 the characteristics of sludge were clarified in terms of organic concentration extracellular polymeric substances composition and micro community analysis the anaerobic experiments further demonstrated the potential value of the concentrated products surprisingly the developed ems system exhibited significant advantages in time consumption and space occupation with competitive operating cost and energy consumption overall the results of this study posed the ems process for up concentration as a potential approach to organics

changing from a consumer to a producer has been of great importance for wastewater treatment plants wwtps around the world carbon neutrality is becoming an ultimate goal towards sustainable wwtps among all the valuable resources energy is attracting full attention smith et al 2018 hao et al 2015 organic content embedded in wastewater enables wwtps to achieve self sufficiency by recovering energy to feed its treatment the anaerobic digestion process is an important process to recover energy resources from excess sludge li et al 2021 however the amount of excess sludge depends heavily on the influent organic concentration in some cases the produced sludge is often not enough to generate an equal amount of energy to satisfy the carbon neutral operation of wwtps besides strict temperature requirements pose challenges for the direct application of anaerobic treatment in some regions guven et al 2019 new processes for carbon redirection and energy conversion provide new possibilities the up concentration process is an innovation among them the produced sludge smaller in volume and higher in concentration will benefit subsequent treatment processes it is essential for a more sophisticated municipal wastewater management alloul et al 2018 the past decades have seen the rapid development of up concentration processes such as high rate activated sludge hras system and chemical enhanced primary treatment cept hars system refers to an activated sludge system operated at both short solids retention time and hydraulic retention time hrt consequently extracellular adsorption intracellular storage and bio flocculation were the dominant metabolic pathways for organics rahman et al 2019 the cept system is an improvement pattern of traditional primary sedimentation tanks by adding coagulants to accelerate the collision and thus enhance the capture of organics dong et al 2019 however such gravity driven processes for the separation of solid and liquid are weak links to efficient wastewater treatment demonstrations which consume tremendous time and space he et al 2021 also undesirable separation processes may induce poor effluent quality and diluted sludge schwaminger et al 2019 to improve sedimentation performance media like gravel and biological nutrient removal sludge were added but a breakthrough has not occurred mancell egala et al 2017 membrane technologies including high load membrane bioreactor hlmbr and direct filtration driven by pressure thermal and electric have drawn great attention hube et al 2020 faust et al 2014 however membrane fouling control strategies have not been well optimized which need to be further investigated for future practical applications magnetic force is a compelling alternative to gravity in the presence of the magnetic field materials with different magnetic moments experience different forces and the separation process could be finished in seconds schwaminger et al 2019 gómez pastora et al 2017 originated from the mining industry magnetic separation ms has been widely applied in the treatment of magnetic industrial wastewater as well as nonmagnetic surface water lv et al 2019 li et al 2012 attributed to its advantages in efficiency water treatment capacity could be greatly increased and thus reducing the footprint for separation in wwtps zhou et al 2019 it could be inferred that the proper application of ms in the up concentration of municipal wastewater could remarkably improve efficiency generally in the treatment of non magnetic wastewater a magnetization step is necessary through coagulation or flocculation reaction magnetic seeds and contaminants will grow as magnetic aggregates next a magnetic field will be applied by a magnetic drum or column to finish the separation process he et al 2021 as for the up concentration of municipal wastewater several issues need to be addressed immediately i the magnetization process is based on coagulation and flocculation which is insufficient to capture the soluble substances this will not only be a waste of energy potential contained in the sewage but also be more crucial in the subsequent nitrogen removal processes wang et al 2022 shim et al 2021 lotti et al 2014 pijuan et al 2020 observed that an increase of cod from 60 to 250 mg l caused a deterioration of the anammox process in a mixed community ii for the sake of energy recovery the sludge is a product as important as the effluent innovative magnetic technology will endow sludge with a unique structure and composition explore the influence of residual additives like coagulants and magnetic seeds on the performance of sludge treatment is also an essential research topic shewa et al 2020 iii theoretical feasibility is not equal to practical feasibility scaling up from laboratory to pilot scale is an essential step in promoting the real application of the technology operation parameters should be optimized based on realistic conditions while the stability of the system against fluctuations in feed wastewater quality and quantity need to be explored besides economic and energy information gained from pilot equipment will be more convincing the main objective of this study was to achieve efficient up concentration of municipal wastewater treatment with an enhanced magnetic separation ems technology the adsorption process is reported to be effective for organics with small molecular weight younker and walsh 2016 herein adsorption by activated carbon ac is expected to address the first issue initially laboratory experiments were conducted to confirm the hypothesis about ac addition then a pilot scale ems system was continuously operated for over one year the long term performance under various situations of the enlarged demonstration was investigated the characteristics of the concentrated sludge were studied through morphology images and composition analysis specifically biochemical methane potential bmp and biochemical acid potential bap tests were employed to estimate the digestibility of sludge samples kianmehr et al 2012 finally to evaluate the feasibility of engineering applications a techno economical comparison was conducted between the ems system and another two reported up concentration systems 2 methods and materials 2 1 raw wastewater and chemicals the raw sewage was from a municipal wwtp in beijing p r china the influent quality could be divided into two stages table s1 in the first stage the quality of wastewater was typical middle strength in northern china it was used for both jar tests and pilot operations in the second stage affected by nearby transportation construction the concentration of sewage was reduced poly aluminum chloride pac al2o3 29 w w and anion polyacrylamide pam mw 16 000 000 18 000 000 were used as coagulant and flocculant respectively magnetite d50 of 31 54 μm and purity of fe3o4 98 was used as magnetic seeds ac with d50 of 24 95 μm was chosen as adsorbents the chemicals were purchased from sichuan scimee co ltd and shanghai buyin co ltd 2 2 experimental procedures in jar tests a four batch coagulation mixer zr4 4 was used for jar tests in the ms experiment raw sewage 500 ml pac 20 mg l magnetite 200 mg l were dosed into the mixer simultaneously at the beginning then the solution was mixed at 200 rpm for 2 min in the ems experiment the only difference was 20 mg l ac was dosed together with pac and magnetite simultaneously after the mixing stage in the coagulation process 2 mg l pam was dosed in both ems and ms experiments followed by 10 minutes flocculation mixing at 40 rpm in kinetics experiments the dosage of chemicals and the duration of coagulation mixing kept consistent except that the duration of flocculation mixing was adjusted from 0 to 15 min for characterization analysis floc samples were obtained with droppers without tip one minute from the end finally a bar magnet was used to fish the flocs for 30 s and the residual was the effluent all experiments were performed in triplicate and the results demonstrated the reproducibility of the data 2 3 pilot scale ems system setup pilot scale equipment with a capacity of 300 m3 d was installed at the same wwtp in beijing p r china the whole equipment was integrated into a 6000 mm 2900 mm 2430 mm l h b container fig s1 the pilot scale ems system consisted of four main parts fig 1 magnetization device magnetic separation device chemical dosing device and magnetite recovery device firstly raw sewage pac ac and magnetic seeds were feed into the first unit of the magnetization device at a certain proportion simultaneously under rapid agitation small magnetic flocs formed soon secondly the freshly formed flocs flew into the second unit for further growth at this stage stirring intensity was restricted at a relatively low level barely preventing flocs from settling then the mixture flew into the magnetic separation device in which the magnetic flocs were captured by a magnetic drum separator in the meantime purified effluent was produced finally the magnetic sludge that remained in the magnetic separation device entered the magnetite recovery device the flocs were broken into pieces by a high speed shearing machine the magnetic seeds were recovered by another magnet drum separator and can be recycled the residue was the product concentrated organics according to the manufacturer s instructions a one time dose of 25 kg magnetite ensured quick start up and the amount of fresh magnetite for replenishment was around 5 mg l treated sewage the one time dosing and replenishment maintained the concentration of magnetite in the reaction tank at approximately two times the average concentration of ss in the raw wastewater i e 200 mg l in our experiment besides the recovery rate was estimated as 95 98 which was within the range recommended by the manufacturer more information about magnetite dosing was provided in supplementary information sampling points were also marked in fig 1 influent effluent and sludge were sampled three times a day and mixed for testing every two days during the operation the cod balance was closing according to eq 1 1 v i n f c o d i n f v e f f c o d e f f v s l u d g e c o d s l u d g e o t h e r s where v inf and v eff are the average treatment capacity m3 h v sludge is the average sludge production rate m3 h and cod inf cod eff and cod sludge are the average cod concentration in influent effluent and sludge respectively mg l hence others included the cod deposited in the reactor cod lost in the biological assimilation and rounding error 2 4 analytical methods concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod total phosphorus tp ammonia nh4 n total nitrogen tn total solids ts and volatile solids vs were measured according to the standard methods cnepa china national environmental protection agent 2002 the turbidity was measured by a turbidimeter 2100n hach usa total cod and membrane filtered nominal pore size of 0 45 μm cod scod were tested the difference between the total cod and the scod will be referred to as particulate cod pcod fluorescence spectra of raw sewage and effluent were obtained using a luminescence spectrometer l 2700 hitachi limited japan the samples without dilution were scanned with excitation wavelengths of 200 400 nm and an interval of 5 nm to collect the emission spectra 250 450 nm interval 5 nm the parafac was used to model the excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence data data pre treatment and analysis were conducted according to previous reports wang et al 2021 the size of flocs was determined by a laser diffraction instrument mastersizer 3000 malvern uk the zeta potential was measured by zeta sizer malvern uk morphological images were obtained via both digital microscope and scanning electron microscope sem su8010 hitachi the extracellular polymeric substance eps was divided into soluble microbial products smp loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps according to the modified thermal extraction method reported by teng et al 2020 protein and humic acid were quantified according to the modified lowry approach and the polysaccharide content was tested via the phenol sulfuric acid approach ma et al 2020 the truseqtm dna sample prep kit was adopted to extract the microbial dna of the concentrated sludge according to the manufacture s introduction the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified via the primer pair 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 806r 5 ggactach vgggtwtctaat 3 targeting the v3 v4 region an illumina hiseq2500 platform was applied to sequence for the amplicons the flash was utilized to merge the paired end raw reads and the qiime was used to filter quantitatively and capture clean tags the uparse was adopted for clustering the operational taxonomic units otus with a 97 similarity cutoff the uchime version 7 0 was employed for identifying and removing the chimeric sequences the bmp and bap tests were utilized to evaluate the energy potential of the concentrated sludge commercialized facilities and recommended methods from the manufacturer were used for bmp tests ampts ii bioprocess control sweden jin et al 2017 bap reactors were the same as our recent reports liu et al 2021 the waste activated sludge was obtained at the same wwtp while operating the pilot ems was used as a control sample in our anaerobic experiments since the anaerobic digestibility of was is largely affected by the characteristics of raw wastewater and the treatment process of different treatment plants hafuka et al 2020 detailed information about the substrate inoculum and experimental procedures was included in the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 feasibility study of ac addition in ms tests ac is one of the most commercialized adsorption materials and has been demonstrated to provide enhanced performance in organic removal wang et al 2020 thus in jar tests the effects of ac addition on ms and the underlying mechanisms were firstly studied in this section the corresponding results were shown in fig 2 in the ms system 64 4 of total cod was removed especially the particulate fraction 71 3 as a result turbidity decreased from over 250 ntu to less than 2 ntu after magnets fishing in addition ems could further improve the cod removal rate to 78 5 by capturing soluble fraction which was limited to as low as 15 mg l in the effluent eem fluorescence spectra of raw sewage ms effluent and ems effluent were measured and investigated through the parafac model fig 2b qualitatively showed that the characteristic peaks at ex em of 220 275 345 nm acknowledged as indicators for protein like substance were much lower in ems effluent jia et al 2017 table 1 described the decomposed four components named c1 to c4 and more information was provided in the supplementary information as can be seen from fig 2c the intensity of components representing tryptophan like protein c1 humic c3 and fulvic acid c4 decreased 9 83 8 79 and 9 5 in the ems effluent respectively tyrosine like protein marked as c2 was the only exception with a small increment of 1 2 a possible explanation is that tyrosine like protein doesn t fluoresce in the presence of tryptophan like protein because the emission energy of tyrosine residues is transferred to the excitation energy of adjacent tryptophan residues ignatev and tuhkanen 2019 albani 2004 yamashita and tanoue 2003 as a result the measured fluorescence intensity of tyrosine like proteins in the ems effluent increased when tryptophan like proteins were significantly removed several previous investigations on the combination effect of coagulation and adsorption have reported similar results in detail the coagulation process was used to target the larger more negatively charged fractions of organic matters while ac was used to adsorbed the smaller neutral charged and or aromatic organic fractions younker and walsh 2016 zhang et al 2018 observed better removal of melanoidins and breakdown products of lignins in ac ballasted coagulation since ac reinforced the interaction between fe iii species and dissolved organic matters by providing more reaction sites to further clarify the mechanism of ac zeta potentials of flocs in the ms and ems system were analyzed results demonstrated that the flocs in ms were lightly negative charged 7 72 1 23 mv while ac changed the flocs from negative to positive and further reduced the absolute value 3 42 1 23 mv younker and walsh 2016 also observed a weak change in zeta potentials of the coagulation system with the addition of adsorbents they suggested that the mechanism of adsorbent particles attached to the flocs was enmeshment rather than charge neutralization what s more it was stated that particles with zeta potentials less than 10 mv were unstable and prone to rapidly coagulating kumari and gupta 2020 literature studies about natural organic matters showed that the maximum removal rate has been achieved in a zeta potential window between 10 mv and 5 mv henderson et al 2006 the difference in the size distribution of flocs at the end of 12 minute agitation was depicted in fig 3 a two typical sizes 28 μm 177 μm were observed in the flocs of the ems system red line while only one peak appeared in 33 μm in ms flocs black line it should be noted that the growth of flocs in ballasted coagulation system followed a growth breakage stable pattern and the increasing dosage of adsorbent was correlated to increasing in shearing resistance but decreasing in floc size he et al 2019 younker and walsh 2016 the addition of ac in the ems system could reinforce the interaction between coagulants and organics by providing more reaction sites zhang et al 2018 it could be observed that ac and magnetite were incorporated into the floc fig 3b the low turbidity after magnet fishing also confirmed the above statement fig 3c provided further information obtained by sem ms flocs were flatter and smoother in appearance while ems flocs were mostly spherical in shape and irregular in appearance except for the adsorption capacity of ac the formed flocs with rough surfaces and various sizes are beneficial to fishing colloidal substances and adsorbing soluble substances the removal kinetics of cod is essential in real applications which could also provide insight into the mechanism of the coagulation and adsorption process fig s4 in ms the capture rate of pcod increased considerably in the first 6 to 8 min and slowed down at 10 min while the capture of scod was less than 20 during the whole experiment and showed weak fluctuations fig s4a this is in accordance with the engineering experience that typical reaction times for ms ranged within 10 min in ems the performance of pcod removal was similar to that in ms which was consistent with the observation that most of the floc formation occurred during 6 8 min while the removal rate of scod kept increasing with fluctuation during the whole process 15 min this phenomenon was consistent with that of uyak et al 2007 who observed a contact time of 20 30 min was required for the dissolved organics to reach an equilibrium state in the adsorption process considering that the initial motivation of adopting ms is swiftness only 0 15 min was studied in this study longer reaction time will weaken the advantages of the ms system at this stage it is confirmed that the addition of ac could improve the cod capture performance of ms within 10 min specifically ac captured extra proteins and humus and roughened the surface of magnetic flocs the zeta potential size distribution and kinetics also provided information about the underlying mechanism in the future there are surplus adsorption capacity calling for researches on ac recycling 3 2 system performance of the pilot scale ems system 3 2 1 determination of key parameters pac dosage ac dosage and hrt were the main operating parameters and were optimized in the first four months fig 4 a listed the design experiment sequence and each condition lasted for two weeks it should be noted that the dosage of pam was fixed at 2 mg l in all experiments for ms without ac the dosage of pac was optimized in the first 5 conditions results indicated that 79 7 8 5 of pcod and 33 7 5 9 of scod were removed at the pac dosage of 20 mg l the corresponding total cod in the effluent reached the lowest point further increment of pac dosage 30 40 50 mg l had a detrimental effect on the removal rate of cod and effluent quality this was caused by re stabilization when pac was over dosed this was also reported by other studies tang et al 2015 bakar and halim 2013 in the typical coagulation sedimentation process coagulant iron salts such as fecl3 doses were generally around 100 mg l diamantis et al 2013 in our work magnetite benefits the formation of flocs as well as reduces the demand for coagulants thus the pac dosage of 20 mg l was selected in the following optimization the influence of ac dosage was then estimated fig 4c shows the cod mass balance for different ac dosages 0 10 and 20 mg l when 20 mg l ac was dosed in the ems the effluent cod accounted for less than 30 of total feeding cod and the soluble fraction in the effluent was less than 20 most cod more than 60 was recovered in the sludge and the calculated others fraction was less than 10 coagulation and adsorption are generally considered to be physical processes with a short reaction time during which biological assimilation could be neglected taboada santos et al 2020 the representativeness of sampling might introduce chance errors but should not affect the average value obtained by the two week repeated experiments for each condition as a result the deposited sludge in the corners of the reactor was supposed to be the main contributor to the others part as the experiment progressed the declining others part also supported the above hypothesis since no cleaning measures were conducted and the dead zone was gradually filled it should be noted that the deposited part could be considered as concentrated product if reasonable recovery was performed however no recovery was applied in our study so it is assigned as others it could be expected that the real loss rate will be lower in full scale operation with recovery processes finally hrt of 10 and 20 min were tested with ac dosage at both 10 and 20 mg l as depicted in fig 4d the removal rate of scod increased with longer hrt at an ac dosage of 10 mg l when ac dosage was raised to 20 mg l the influence of hrt was weakened interestingly higher pcod removal rates were observed with lower ac dosage and shorter hrt these results might be related to the breakage of the flocs when prolonging agitation time he et al 2019 besides flocs cored by ac but without magnetite were more likely to occur in higher ac dosage thus in practical applications better performance could be achieved by flexibly adjusting the dosage of ac according to the relative concentrations of pcod and scod in the influent considering the cod removal performance and the treatment capacity the dosage of both pac and ac was determined as 20 mg l respectively hrt of 10 min was selected in the following long term operation 3 2 2 long term performance under fluctuated conditions in the first stage with higher inflow concentration table s1 the pilot ems system was operated for two months under the above optimized conditions apart from cod the behavior of ss tp tn and ammonia were also monitored and system performances were depicted in fig 5 a and b pcod ss and tp showed similar removal performance around 80 indicating a similar removal mechanism by coagulation it should be noted that po4 3 could chemically precipitate with metal ions that existed in the coagulant which could further enhance the removal rate of tp an et al 2017 besides poor removal rates of tn and ammonia were observed in the effluent of ems the scod tn declined to less than 3 while ammonia accounted for over 80 of tn to reach the discharge standard subsequent treatment processes are still needed but traditional biotechnology was not suitable under such characteristics of the effluent autotrophic biotechnology and electrochemistry process could be considered as proper denitrification process yuan et al 2021 fang et al 2018 in the second stage of the long term operation nearby subway construction struck the drainage system and the cod in raw sewage were mostly ranged between 100 mg l to 200 mg l with soluble fraction accounted for more than 60 table s1 in this situation the removal rate of cod decreased to evaluate the system performance more accurately the effluent quality was employed as an indicator since the inflow concentration decreased we attempted to raise the treatment capacity as well as reduce the dosage of pac and ac fig 5c after 20 days of running the treatment capacity was raised to 1 5 times by shortening hrt to 6 7 min in the next 20 days the dosage of ac was further reduced to 10 mg l the removal of scod and pcod showed no obvious differences in the last 60 days the dosages of ac and pac were further reduced the removal of scod was affected especially when pac was limited to 10 mg l it is indicated that both ac and formed flocs played important roles in the adsorption process further reduction on pac destroyed the performance of ems during days 80 to 100 the total cod in the effluent rose to over 100 mg l insufficient coagulation led to inadequate incorporation of magnetite and therefore the formed flocs cannot be separated effectively linear correlation analysis was conducted through the data of the whole year operation pearson correlation coefficients with p value 0 05 were highlighted in fig 5d pac is the premise of the ems system and has a positive effect on the removal of both pcod and scod the positive correlation between pac dosage ③ and the ratio of scod to cod in the effluent ii indicates that particulate substances were removed by pac mainly when it comes to ac there is no correlation between ac dosage ④ and total cod i in the effluent while a negative correlation was observed between ac dosage ④ and the proportion of scod in the effluent ii the reason was that ac induced the transformation of cod from the soluble phase to the solid phase what s more ac harms the removal of pcod indicating the occurrence of non magnetic fragments adjusting mixing strength in the second coagulation tank might be a plausible solution in this section two typical working conditions with different inflow concentrations were studied low in strength and large in quantity are typical situations for wwtps due to rainfall or emergencies this study confirmed that ems could be adapted to these situations economically by increasing the capacity and reducing the dosage of chemicals pac dosage of 20 mg l was a minimum requirement to ensure magnetite incorporation and magnetic separation successfully the correlation analysis also confirmed that conclusion 3 3 products characterization the most important innovation of the ems system was the possibility of energy neutralization by anaerobic digestion of the gained sludge thus in this section the characteristics of the products were studied firstly the concentration of the sludge was evaluated and results were shown in fig 6 compared to ms pac 20 mg l no ac system more cod 18 800 mg l was contained in the concentrated sludge obtained from ems pac 20 mg l ac 20 mg l system mainly in the particulate phase besides ems sludge was richer in both ts and vs since both adsorbed organics and extra ac entered the sludge the ratio of vs to ts decreased with the dosage of ac eps is of great importance when evaluating the sludge properties since it is expected to influence the flocculation performance as well as the subsequent anaerobic digestion process ajao et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 fig 6b depicts the composition and bonding degree of eps in both ms and ems systems smp and tb eps are the dominating existing form and the addition of ac further reinforced the bonding degree as for composition the ratio of protein to carbohydrate p c was smaller than 1 only in lb eps but greater than 1 in both smp and tb eps additionally the addition of ac further reduced p c in all three parts thus it is implied that i ac adsorbed more carbohydrate than protein and ii the adsorbed carbohydrate was less tightly bound than protein the relative abundance of bacterial phyla in ems and ms was shown in fig 6c similarly firmicutes was the most dominant phylum together with proteobacteria bacteroidota actinobacteriota and campilobacterota accounting for more than 90 in both samples this composition is consistent with data from other prominent up concentration systems faust et al 2015 observed that proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes accounted for more than 90 abundance in their hlmbr system jang et al 2017 reported that bacteroidetes proteobacteria chloroflexi and firmicutes accounted for over 70 in a fe3 attended coagulation sedimentation system the most significant difference between ems and ms was that the relative abundance of bacteroidota was higher in ems 24 2 than that of ms 11 4 since bacteroidetes was involved in eps production and floc formation the high abundance could promote better bio flocculation albertsen et al 2013 furthermore bacteroidetes was also an important species containing hydrolytic bacteria as well as acidogenic and fermentative bacteria which was conducive to the anaerobic process subsequently li et al 2018 anaerobic methane production is one of the most feasible methods for energy recovery from organics contained in municipal wastewater bmp tests were performed with was ms and ems sludge to evaluate their energetic potential and the results are shown in fig 7 a at the same inoculum ratio inoculum substrate vs vs of 2 1 the bmp of ems sludge and ms sludge were 192 and 263 nml gvs respectively which was higher than that of was when the inoculum ratio raised to 4 1 the bmp of was increased to 172 nml gvs not shown in this study which was still lower than that of ms sludge since improved ch4 production was usually reported at higher inoculation ratios jiang et al 2021 cao et al 2020 the worse methanogenic performance of was was indicated by the bmp results it should be stated that all substrates including was and ems sludge have the potential with higher methanogenic geng et al 2022 xu et al 2021 kooijman et al 2017 observed a 250 nml ch4 g vs methane production from cept sludge and taboada santos et al 2020 reported higher production of 295 nml ch4 g vs from hras sludge accordingly it can be assumed that i the inhibitory effect on the anaerobic digestibility of pac and pam in the magnetic sludge was not obvious and could be neglect kimura et al 2021 and ii the residual magnetite and ac may facilitate the anaerobic digestibility on the one hand magnetite could enrich iron reducing bacteria responsible for sludge hydrolysis on the other hand ac was believed to enhance syntrophic metabolism between iron reducing bacteria and methanogens attributed to its high electrical conductivity and large surface area peng et al 2018 the energy potential of ems sludge was demonstrated by bmp tests further investigation is still needed for a more sophisticated treatment for ems sludge anaerobic fermentation has been well recognized as an effective sludge treatment process wu et al 2016 in the bap tests the scod and volatile fatty acid vfa production of ms sludge was higher than that of was and reached the maximum 170 mg scod g vs and 50 mg vfa g vs respectively on the 5th day fig 7b the reasons for this phenomenon are as follows on the one hand organic matter recovered via ms was raw and easily degradable whereas waste sludge is mainly composed of bacterial cells kimura et al 2021 on the other hand magnetite could promote the solubilization hydrolysis and acidification processes through the dissimilatory iron reduction process zhao et al 2018 the acidification production of ems sludge was lower than that of ms a possible cause is that ac could significantly promote vfas degradation and shorten the lag time of methanogenesis ma et al 2020 furthermore the vfa composition on the 5th day was shown in fig 7c ethanol was observed in the fermentation reactor with ems sludge ethanol type fermentation was reported to promote the methanogenic process by stimulating direct interspecies electron transfer li et al 2020 ac was reported to serve as a support medium to ensure stable ethanol type fermentation and improve ethanol yields by the removal of toxic compounds lee et al 2011 guo et al 2008 in this section the characteristic of ms and ems sludge was clarified the composition analysis confirmed that during the ems process more soluble substances especially carbohydrates were bounded to aggregates bacteroidota was more abundant in ems sludge which is reported to be associated with floc formation and later anaerobic processes both ems and ms sludge performed better than waste sludge in bmp and bap tests due to the residual magnetite specifically ems sludge performed better in methanogenesis while ms dominated the hydrolysis the intriguing influence of ac on fermentation type is worth further study it should be noted that the bmp and bap tests were conducted without any pretreatment or process control hence the results only suggest the feasibility of recovering energy and vfas from the produced sludge the optimal anaerobic conditions and the maximum yield need to be further studied for example ph control alkali pretreatment and co digestion with food waste are reported to be beneficial jin et al 2016 wu et al 2016 3 4 application insights 3 4 1 energy and economic evaluation energy consumption is one of the important indexes to evaluate the feasibility of engineering applications the main energy consumption of this pilot scale ems was mainly attributed to stirrer in the coagulation device 0 014 kwh m3 magnetic separation device 0 008 kwh m3 and magnetite recovery device 0 009 kwh m3 the chemical dosing and controlling system accounted for 0 004 kwh m3 thus the total energy consumption was 0 036 kwh m3 the operational costs included electricity and chemicals considering that the average price of industrial electricity in beijing is 0 1233 kwh the electricity cost was calculated as 0 004 m3 additionally the chemicals contributed 0 031 m3 in which ac and magnetite accounted for 56 and 9 respectively the unit price used in the calculation was 1250 cny t for pac 25 000 cny t for pam 6000 cny t for ac and 4000 cny t for magnetite respectively the prices of these chemicals were reasonable with little difference from some recent reports li et al 2022 jin et al 2020 wang et al 2018 herein the operational cost was estimated as 0 035 m3 in previous research taboada santos et al 2020 conducted a comprehensive comparison between cept and hras about their energy consumptions some results fig 8 were extracted and compared with ems here calculation procedure was provided in si firstly ems and cept exhibited advantages in conserving energy since no aeration was needed nevertheless the energy consumption of ems was slightly higher than that of cept since ms equipment caused extra energy consumption fig 8a secondly hras has the lowest operating cost in cept and ems chemicals contributed a lot for example commercial ac used in our experiment accounted for about 50 of the total operational cost at an ac dosage of 20 mg l recycle of ac or seeking alternatives were promising methods for cost reduction finally the most significant advantage of ems is the short hrt presented in fig 8c less time in the reaction stage was required by the non biological processes the hrt in the separation stage reduced to negligible levels since no need for a time consuming sedimentation tank this means that for a rough estimate based on a tank depth of 5 m a wwtp with a treatment capacity of 100 000 tons per day would occupy 148 m2 when adopting ems as up concentration technology while 640 m2 and 2500 m2 would be required for cept and hras respectively 3 4 2 future of n in ems effluent when organics were stored in the concentrates n was allowed to flow through in the ems system thus efficient cn separation was achieved redirecting c and n mass flow with the up concentration process was believed to achieve energy neutrality and resource recovery in wwtps gong et al 2018 recent advancements in mainstream autotrophic denitrification enhanced the viability of this idea gu et al 2018 xie et al 2018 the ems effluent was fed to two anaerobic ammonia oxidation reactors and over 80 ammonia removal rates were observed both in biofilm and granular reactors in preliminary experiments song et al 2021 besides the concept of the circular economy led to a new direction studies of ammonia treatment are no longer limited to the removal but focused more on recycling many technologies including struvite precipitation membrane enrichment and microalgae are competitive in ammonia recovery xiang et al 2020 recent pilot scale demonstrations bode well for the future serna garcía et al 2021 molinuevo salces et al 2020 4 conclusions this study investigated the feasibility of ems in the up concentration of municipal wastewater for organic recovery the addition of adsorbents could enhance the performance mainly by capturing polysaccharides and humic acid during the one year operation of the pilot scale ems system operation strategies were optimized and more than 70 cod was removed within 10 min it was also confirmed that the ems system could be adapted to the situation where influent was low in strength and large in quantity concentrated sludge produced by ems contained over 18 g l cod and is a feasible feedstock for resource and energy recovery by anaerobic processes the developed ems system exhibited significant advantages in time consumption with competitive energy consumption and operation costs in general ems can be a promising

16056,the up concentration process has been demonstrated as an attractive approach to carbon neutral wastewater treatment innovation in the separation processes can help eliminate the current heavy dependence on gravity and credible pilot scale verification is crucial for application promotion we hereby proposed a pilot scale enhanced magnetic separation ems system as an up concentration step to maximize energy recovery from municipal wastewater the design of ems was based on the hypothesis that magnetic driven separation could be a breakthrough in separation speed and adsorption could further enhance the separation efficiency by capturing soluble substances jar tests confirmed the feasibility of activated carbon adsorption which could also roughen the surface of aggregates further over one year operation of a 300 m3 d ems equipment provided optimum operation strategies and evidence of system effectiveness more than 80 of particulate organics and 60 of soluble organics were removed within 10 min at an energy consumption of only 0 036 kwh m3 the characteristics of sludge were clarified in terms of organic concentration extracellular polymeric substances composition and micro community analysis the anaerobic experiments further demonstrated the potential value of the concentrated products surprisingly the developed ems system exhibited significant advantages in time consumption and space occupation with competitive operating cost and energy consumption overall the results of this study posed the ems process for up concentration as a potential approach to organics

changing from a consumer to a producer has been of great importance for wastewater treatment plants wwtps around the world carbon neutrality is becoming an ultimate goal towards sustainable wwtps among all the valuable resources energy is attracting full attention smith et al 2018 hao et al 2015 organic content embedded in wastewater enables wwtps to achieve self sufficiency by recovering energy to feed its treatment the anaerobic digestion process is an important process to recover energy resources from excess sludge li et al 2021 however the amount of excess sludge depends heavily on the influent organic concentration in some cases the produced sludge is often not enough to generate an equal amount of energy to satisfy the carbon neutral operation of wwtps besides strict temperature requirements pose challenges for the direct application of anaerobic treatment in some regions guven et al 2019 new processes for carbon redirection and energy conversion provide new possibilities the up concentration process is an innovation among them the produced sludge smaller in volume and higher in concentration will benefit subsequent treatment processes it is essential for a more sophisticated municipal wastewater management alloul et al 2018 the past decades have seen the rapid development of up concentration processes such as high rate activated sludge hras system and chemical enhanced primary treatment cept hars system refers to an activated sludge system operated at both short solids retention time and hydraulic retention time hrt consequently extracellular adsorption intracellular storage and bio flocculation were the dominant metabolic pathways for organics rahman et al 2019 the cept system is an improvement pattern of traditional primary sedimentation tanks by adding coagulants to accelerate the collision and thus enhance the capture of organics dong et al 2019 however such gravity driven processes for the separation of solid and liquid are weak links to efficient wastewater treatment demonstrations which consume tremendous time and space he et al 2021 also undesirable separation processes may induce poor effluent quality and diluted sludge schwaminger et al 2019 to improve sedimentation performance media like gravel and biological nutrient removal sludge were added but a breakthrough has not occurred mancell egala et al 2017 membrane technologies including high load membrane bioreactor hlmbr and direct filtration driven by pressure thermal and electric have drawn great attention hube et al 2020 faust et al 2014 however membrane fouling control strategies have not been well optimized which need to be further investigated for future practical applications magnetic force is a compelling alternative to gravity in the presence of the magnetic field materials with different magnetic moments experience different forces and the separation process could be finished in seconds schwaminger et al 2019 gómez pastora et al 2017 originated from the mining industry magnetic separation ms has been widely applied in the treatment of magnetic industrial wastewater as well as nonmagnetic surface water lv et al 2019 li et al 2012 attributed to its advantages in efficiency water treatment capacity could be greatly increased and thus reducing the footprint for separation in wwtps zhou et al 2019 it could be inferred that the proper application of ms in the up concentration of municipal wastewater could remarkably improve efficiency generally in the treatment of non magnetic wastewater a magnetization step is necessary through coagulation or flocculation reaction magnetic seeds and contaminants will grow as magnetic aggregates next a magnetic field will be applied by a magnetic drum or column to finish the separation process he et al 2021 as for the up concentration of municipal wastewater several issues need to be addressed immediately i the magnetization process is based on coagulation and flocculation which is insufficient to capture the soluble substances this will not only be a waste of energy potential contained in the sewage but also be more crucial in the subsequent nitrogen removal processes wang et al 2022 shim et al 2021 lotti et al 2014 pijuan et al 2020 observed that an increase of cod from 60 to 250 mg l caused a deterioration of the anammox process in a mixed community ii for the sake of energy recovery the sludge is a product as important as the effluent innovative magnetic technology will endow sludge with a unique structure and composition explore the influence of residual additives like coagulants and magnetic seeds on the performance of sludge treatment is also an essential research topic shewa et al 2020 iii theoretical feasibility is not equal to practical feasibility scaling up from laboratory to pilot scale is an essential step in promoting the real application of the technology operation parameters should be optimized based on realistic conditions while the stability of the system against fluctuations in feed wastewater quality and quantity need to be explored besides economic and energy information gained from pilot equipment will be more convincing the main objective of this study was to achieve efficient up concentration of municipal wastewater treatment with an enhanced magnetic separation ems technology the adsorption process is reported to be effective for organics with small molecular weight younker and walsh 2016 herein adsorption by activated carbon ac is expected to address the first issue initially laboratory experiments were conducted to confirm the hypothesis about ac addition then a pilot scale ems system was continuously operated for over one year the long term performance under various situations of the enlarged demonstration was investigated the characteristics of the concentrated sludge were studied through morphology images and composition analysis specifically biochemical methane potential bmp and biochemical acid potential bap tests were employed to estimate the digestibility of sludge samples kianmehr et al 2012 finally to evaluate the feasibility of engineering applications a techno economical comparison was conducted between the ems system and another two reported up concentration systems 2 methods and materials 2 1 raw wastewater and chemicals the raw sewage was from a municipal wwtp in beijing p r china the influent quality could be divided into two stages table s1 in the first stage the quality of wastewater was typical middle strength in northern china it was used for both jar tests and pilot operations in the second stage affected by nearby transportation construction the concentration of sewage was reduced poly aluminum chloride pac al2o3 29 w w and anion polyacrylamide pam mw 16 000 000 18 000 000 were used as coagulant and flocculant respectively magnetite d50 of 31 54 μm and purity of fe3o4 98 was used as magnetic seeds ac with d50 of 24 95 μm was chosen as adsorbents the chemicals were purchased from sichuan scimee co ltd and shanghai buyin co ltd 2 2 experimental procedures in jar tests a four batch coagulation mixer zr4 4 was used for jar tests in the ms experiment raw sewage 500 ml pac 20 mg l magnetite 200 mg l were dosed into the mixer simultaneously at the beginning then the solution was mixed at 200 rpm for 2 min in the ems experiment the only difference was 20 mg l ac was dosed together with pac and magnetite simultaneously after the mixing stage in the coagulation process 2 mg l pam was dosed in both ems and ms experiments followed by 10 minutes flocculation mixing at 40 rpm in kinetics experiments the dosage of chemicals and the duration of coagulation mixing kept consistent except that the duration of flocculation mixing was adjusted from 0 to 15 min for characterization analysis floc samples were obtained with droppers without tip one minute from the end finally a bar magnet was used to fish the flocs for 30 s and the residual was the effluent all experiments were performed in triplicate and the results demonstrated the reproducibility of the data 2 3 pilot scale ems system setup pilot scale equipment with a capacity of 300 m3 d was installed at the same wwtp in beijing p r china the whole equipment was integrated into a 6000 mm 2900 mm 2430 mm l h b container fig s1 the pilot scale ems system consisted of four main parts fig 1 magnetization device magnetic separation device chemical dosing device and magnetite recovery device firstly raw sewage pac ac and magnetic seeds were feed into the first unit of the magnetization device at a certain proportion simultaneously under rapid agitation small magnetic flocs formed soon secondly the freshly formed flocs flew into the second unit for further growth at this stage stirring intensity was restricted at a relatively low level barely preventing flocs from settling then the mixture flew into the magnetic separation device in which the magnetic flocs were captured by a magnetic drum separator in the meantime purified effluent was produced finally the magnetic sludge that remained in the magnetic separation device entered the magnetite recovery device the flocs were broken into pieces by a high speed shearing machine the magnetic seeds were recovered by another magnet drum separator and can be recycled the residue was the product concentrated organics according to the manufacturer s instructions a one time dose of 25 kg magnetite ensured quick start up and the amount of fresh magnetite for replenishment was around 5 mg l treated sewage the one time dosing and replenishment maintained the concentration of magnetite in the reaction tank at approximately two times the average concentration of ss in the raw wastewater i e 200 mg l in our experiment besides the recovery rate was estimated as 95 98 which was within the range recommended by the manufacturer more information about magnetite dosing was provided in supplementary information sampling points were also marked in fig 1 influent effluent and sludge were sampled three times a day and mixed for testing every two days during the operation the cod balance was closing according to eq 1 1 v i n f c o d i n f v e f f c o d e f f v s l u d g e c o d s l u d g e o t h e r s where v inf and v eff are the average treatment capacity m3 h v sludge is the average sludge production rate m3 h and cod inf cod eff and cod sludge are the average cod concentration in influent effluent and sludge respectively mg l hence others included the cod deposited in the reactor cod lost in the biological assimilation and rounding error 2 4 analytical methods concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod total phosphorus tp ammonia nh4 n total nitrogen tn total solids ts and volatile solids vs were measured according to the standard methods cnepa china national environmental protection agent 2002 the turbidity was measured by a turbidimeter 2100n hach usa total cod and membrane filtered nominal pore size of 0 45 μm cod scod were tested the difference between the total cod and the scod will be referred to as particulate cod pcod fluorescence spectra of raw sewage and effluent were obtained using a luminescence spectrometer l 2700 hitachi limited japan the samples without dilution were scanned with excitation wavelengths of 200 400 nm and an interval of 5 nm to collect the emission spectra 250 450 nm interval 5 nm the parafac was used to model the excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence data data pre treatment and analysis were conducted according to previous reports wang et al 2021 the size of flocs was determined by a laser diffraction instrument mastersizer 3000 malvern uk the zeta potential was measured by zeta sizer malvern uk morphological images were obtained via both digital microscope and scanning electron microscope sem su8010 hitachi the extracellular polymeric substance eps was divided into soluble microbial products smp loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps according to the modified thermal extraction method reported by teng et al 2020 protein and humic acid were quantified according to the modified lowry approach and the polysaccharide content was tested via the phenol sulfuric acid approach ma et al 2020 the truseqtm dna sample prep kit was adopted to extract the microbial dna of the concentrated sludge according to the manufacture s introduction the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified via the primer pair 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 806r 5 ggactach vgggtwtctaat 3 targeting the v3 v4 region an illumina hiseq2500 platform was applied to sequence for the amplicons the flash was utilized to merge the paired end raw reads and the qiime was used to filter quantitatively and capture clean tags the uparse was adopted for clustering the operational taxonomic units otus with a 97 similarity cutoff the uchime version 7 0 was employed for identifying and removing the chimeric sequences the bmp and bap tests were utilized to evaluate the energy potential of the concentrated sludge commercialized facilities and recommended methods from the manufacturer were used for bmp tests ampts ii bioprocess control sweden jin et al 2017 bap reactors were the same as our recent reports liu et al 2021 the waste activated sludge was obtained at the same wwtp while operating the pilot ems was used as a control sample in our anaerobic experiments since the anaerobic digestibility of was is largely affected by the characteristics of raw wastewater and the treatment process of different treatment plants hafuka et al 2020 detailed information about the substrate inoculum and experimental procedures was included in the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 feasibility study of ac addition in ms tests ac is one of the most commercialized adsorption materials and has been demonstrated to provide enhanced performance in organic removal wang et al 2020 thus in jar tests the effects of ac addition on ms and the underlying mechanisms were firstly studied in this section the corresponding results were shown in fig 2 in the ms system 64 4 of total cod was removed especially the particulate fraction 71 3 as a result turbidity decreased from over 250 ntu to less than 2 ntu after magnets fishing in addition ems could further improve the cod removal rate to 78 5 by capturing soluble fraction which was limited to as low as 15 mg l in the effluent eem fluorescence spectra of raw sewage ms effluent and ems effluent were measured and investigated through the parafac model fig 2b qualitatively showed that the characteristic peaks at ex em of 220 275 345 nm acknowledged as indicators for protein like substance were much lower in ems effluent jia et al 2017 table 1 described the decomposed four components named c1 to c4 and more information was provided in the supplementary information as can be seen from fig 2c the intensity of components representing tryptophan like protein c1 humic c3 and fulvic acid c4 decreased 9 83 8 79 and 9 5 in the ems effluent respectively tyrosine like protein marked as c2 was the only exception with a small increment of 1 2 a possible explanation is that tyrosine like protein doesn t fluoresce in the presence of tryptophan like protein because the emission energy of tyrosine residues is transferred to the excitation energy of adjacent tryptophan residues ignatev and tuhkanen 2019 albani 2004 yamashita and tanoue 2003 as a result the measured fluorescence intensity of tyrosine like proteins in the ems effluent increased when tryptophan like proteins were significantly removed several previous investigations on the combination effect of coagulation and adsorption have reported similar results in detail the coagulation process was used to target the larger more negatively charged fractions of organic matters while ac was used to adsorbed the smaller neutral charged and or aromatic organic fractions younker and walsh 2016 zhang et al 2018 observed better removal of melanoidins and breakdown products of lignins in ac ballasted coagulation since ac reinforced the interaction between fe iii species and dissolved organic matters by providing more reaction sites to further clarify the mechanism of ac zeta potentials of flocs in the ms and ems system were analyzed results demonstrated that the flocs in ms were lightly negative charged 7 72 1 23 mv while ac changed the flocs from negative to positive and further reduced the absolute value 3 42 1 23 mv younker and walsh 2016 also observed a weak change in zeta potentials of the coagulation system with the addition of adsorbents they suggested that the mechanism of adsorbent particles attached to the flocs was enmeshment rather than charge neutralization what s more it was stated that particles with zeta potentials less than 10 mv were unstable and prone to rapidly coagulating kumari and gupta 2020 literature studies about natural organic matters showed that the maximum removal rate has been achieved in a zeta potential window between 10 mv and 5 mv henderson et al 2006 the difference in the size distribution of flocs at the end of 12 minute agitation was depicted in fig 3 a two typical sizes 28 μm 177 μm were observed in the flocs of the ems system red line while only one peak appeared in 33 μm in ms flocs black line it should be noted that the growth of flocs in ballasted coagulation system followed a growth breakage stable pattern and the increasing dosage of adsorbent was correlated to increasing in shearing resistance but decreasing in floc size he et al 2019 younker and walsh 2016 the addition of ac in the ems system could reinforce the interaction between coagulants and organics by providing more reaction sites zhang et al 2018 it could be observed that ac and magnetite were incorporated into the floc fig 3b the low turbidity after magnet fishing also confirmed the above statement fig 3c provided further information obtained by sem ms flocs were flatter and smoother in appearance while ems flocs were mostly spherical in shape and irregular in appearance except for the adsorption capacity of ac the formed flocs with rough surfaces and various sizes are beneficial to fishing colloidal substances and adsorbing soluble substances the removal kinetics of cod is essential in real applications which could also provide insight into the mechanism of the coagulation and adsorption process fig s4 in ms the capture rate of pcod increased considerably in the first 6 to 8 min and slowed down at 10 min while the capture of scod was less than 20 during the whole experiment and showed weak fluctuations fig s4a this is in accordance with the engineering experience that typical reaction times for ms ranged within 10 min in ems the performance of pcod removal was similar to that in ms which was consistent with the observation that most of the floc formation occurred during 6 8 min while the removal rate of scod kept increasing with fluctuation during the whole process 15 min this phenomenon was consistent with that of uyak et al 2007 who observed a contact time of 20 30 min was required for the dissolved organics to reach an equilibrium state in the adsorption process considering that the initial motivation of adopting ms is swiftness only 0 15 min was studied in this study longer reaction time will weaken the advantages of the ms system at this stage it is confirmed that the addition of ac could improve the cod capture performance of ms within 10 min specifically ac captured extra proteins and humus and roughened the surface of magnetic flocs the zeta potential size distribution and kinetics also provided information about the underlying mechanism in the future there are surplus adsorption capacity calling for researches on ac recycling 3 2 system performance of the pilot scale ems system 3 2 1 determination of key parameters pac dosage ac dosage and hrt were the main operating parameters and were optimized in the first four months fig 4 a listed the design experiment sequence and each condition lasted for two weeks it should be noted that the dosage of pam was fixed at 2 mg l in all experiments for ms without ac the dosage of pac was optimized in the first 5 conditions results indicated that 79 7 8 5 of pcod and 33 7 5 9 of scod were removed at the pac dosage of 20 mg l the corresponding total cod in the effluent reached the lowest point further increment of pac dosage 30 40 50 mg l had a detrimental effect on the removal rate of cod and effluent quality this was caused by re stabilization when pac was over dosed this was also reported by other studies tang et al 2015 bakar and halim 2013 in the typical coagulation sedimentation process coagulant iron salts such as fecl3 doses were generally around 100 mg l diamantis et al 2013 in our work magnetite benefits the formation of flocs as well as reduces the demand for coagulants thus the pac dosage of 20 mg l was selected in the following optimization the influence of ac dosage was then estimated fig 4c shows the cod mass balance for different ac dosages 0 10 and 20 mg l when 20 mg l ac was dosed in the ems the effluent cod accounted for less than 30 of total feeding cod and the soluble fraction in the effluent was less than 20 most cod more than 60 was recovered in the sludge and the calculated others fraction was less than 10 coagulation and adsorption are generally considered to be physical processes with a short reaction time during which biological assimilation could be neglected taboada santos et al 2020 the representativeness of sampling might introduce chance errors but should not affect the average value obtained by the two week repeated experiments for each condition as a result the deposited sludge in the corners of the reactor was supposed to be the main contributor to the others part as the experiment progressed the declining others part also supported the above hypothesis since no cleaning measures were conducted and the dead zone was gradually filled it should be noted that the deposited part could be considered as concentrated product if reasonable recovery was performed however no recovery was applied in our study so it is assigned as others it could be expected that the real loss rate will be lower in full scale operation with recovery processes finally hrt of 10 and 20 min were tested with ac dosage at both 10 and 20 mg l as depicted in fig 4d the removal rate of scod increased with longer hrt at an ac dosage of 10 mg l when ac dosage was raised to 20 mg l the influence of hrt was weakened interestingly higher pcod removal rates were observed with lower ac dosage and shorter hrt these results might be related to the breakage of the flocs when prolonging agitation time he et al 2019 besides flocs cored by ac but without magnetite were more likely to occur in higher ac dosage thus in practical applications better performance could be achieved by flexibly adjusting the dosage of ac according to the relative concentrations of pcod and scod in the influent considering the cod removal performance and the treatment capacity the dosage of both pac and ac was determined as 20 mg l respectively hrt of 10 min was selected in the following long term operation 3 2 2 long term performance under fluctuated conditions in the first stage with higher inflow concentration table s1 the pilot ems system was operated for two months under the above optimized conditions apart from cod the behavior of ss tp tn and ammonia were also monitored and system performances were depicted in fig 5 a and b pcod ss and tp showed similar removal performance around 80 indicating a similar removal mechanism by coagulation it should be noted that po4 3 could chemically precipitate with metal ions that existed in the coagulant which could further enhance the removal rate of tp an et al 2017 besides poor removal rates of tn and ammonia were observed in the effluent of ems the scod tn declined to less than 3 while ammonia accounted for over 80 of tn to reach the discharge standard subsequent treatment processes are still needed but traditional biotechnology was not suitable under such characteristics of the effluent autotrophic biotechnology and electrochemistry process could be considered as proper denitrification process yuan et al 2021 fang et al 2018 in the second stage of the long term operation nearby subway construction struck the drainage system and the cod in raw sewage were mostly ranged between 100 mg l to 200 mg l with soluble fraction accounted for more than 60 table s1 in this situation the removal rate of cod decreased to evaluate the system performance more accurately the effluent quality was employed as an indicator since the inflow concentration decreased we attempted to raise the treatment capacity as well as reduce the dosage of pac and ac fig 5c after 20 days of running the treatment capacity was raised to 1 5 times by shortening hrt to 6 7 min in the next 20 days the dosage of ac was further reduced to 10 mg l the removal of scod and pcod showed no obvious differences in the last 60 days the dosages of ac and pac were further reduced the removal of scod was affected especially when pac was limited to 10 mg l it is indicated that both ac and formed flocs played important roles in the adsorption process further reduction on pac destroyed the performance of ems during days 80 to 100 the total cod in the effluent rose to over 100 mg l insufficient coagulation led to inadequate incorporation of magnetite and therefore the formed flocs cannot be separated effectively linear correlation analysis was conducted through the data of the whole year operation pearson correlation coefficients with p value 0 05 were highlighted in fig 5d pac is the premise of the ems system and has a positive effect on the removal of both pcod and scod the positive correlation between pac dosage ③ and the ratio of scod to cod in the effluent ii indicates that particulate substances were removed by pac mainly when it comes to ac there is no correlation between ac dosage ④ and total cod i in the effluent while a negative correlation was observed between ac dosage ④ and the proportion of scod in the effluent ii the reason was that ac induced the transformation of cod from the soluble phase to the solid phase what s more ac harms the removal of pcod indicating the occurrence of non magnetic fragments adjusting mixing strength in the second coagulation tank might be a plausible solution in this section two typical working conditions with different inflow concentrations were studied low in strength and large in quantity are typical situations for wwtps due to rainfall or emergencies this study confirmed that ems could be adapted to these situations economically by increasing the capacity and reducing the dosage of chemicals pac dosage of 20 mg l was a minimum requirement to ensure magnetite incorporation and magnetic separation successfully the correlation analysis also confirmed that conclusion 3 3 products characterization the most important innovation of the ems system was the possibility of energy neutralization by anaerobic digestion of the gained sludge thus in this section the characteristics of the products were studied firstly the concentration of the sludge was evaluated and results were shown in fig 6 compared to ms pac 20 mg l no ac system more cod 18 800 mg l was contained in the concentrated sludge obtained from ems pac 20 mg l ac 20 mg l system mainly in the particulate phase besides ems sludge was richer in both ts and vs since both adsorbed organics and extra ac entered the sludge the ratio of vs to ts decreased with the dosage of ac eps is of great importance when evaluating the sludge properties since it is expected to influence the flocculation performance as well as the subsequent anaerobic digestion process ajao et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 fig 6b depicts the composition and bonding degree of eps in both ms and ems systems smp and tb eps are the dominating existing form and the addition of ac further reinforced the bonding degree as for composition the ratio of protein to carbohydrate p c was smaller than 1 only in lb eps but greater than 1 in both smp and tb eps additionally the addition of ac further reduced p c in all three parts thus it is implied that i ac adsorbed more carbohydrate than protein and ii the adsorbed carbohydrate was less tightly bound than protein the relative abundance of bacterial phyla in ems and ms was shown in fig 6c similarly firmicutes was the most dominant phylum together with proteobacteria bacteroidota actinobacteriota and campilobacterota accounting for more than 90 in both samples this composition is consistent with data from other prominent up concentration systems faust et al 2015 observed that proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes accounted for more than 90 abundance in their hlmbr system jang et al 2017 reported that bacteroidetes proteobacteria chloroflexi and firmicutes accounted for over 70 in a fe3 attended coagulation sedimentation system the most significant difference between ems and ms was that the relative abundance of bacteroidota was higher in ems 24 2 than that of ms 11 4 since bacteroidetes was involved in eps production and floc formation the high abundance could promote better bio flocculation albertsen et al 2013 furthermore bacteroidetes was also an important species containing hydrolytic bacteria as well as acidogenic and fermentative bacteria which was conducive to the anaerobic process subsequently li et al 2018 anaerobic methane production is one of the most feasible methods for energy recovery from organics contained in municipal wastewater bmp tests were performed with was ms and ems sludge to evaluate their energetic potential and the results are shown in fig 7 a at the same inoculum ratio inoculum substrate vs vs of 2 1 the bmp of ems sludge and ms sludge were 192 and 263 nml gvs respectively which was higher than that of was when the inoculum ratio raised to 4 1 the bmp of was increased to 172 nml gvs not shown in this study which was still lower than that of ms sludge since improved ch4 production was usually reported at higher inoculation ratios jiang et al 2021 cao et al 2020 the worse methanogenic performance of was was indicated by the bmp results it should be stated that all substrates including was and ems sludge have the potential with higher methanogenic geng et al 2022 xu et al 2021 kooijman et al 2017 observed a 250 nml ch4 g vs methane production from cept sludge and taboada santos et al 2020 reported higher production of 295 nml ch4 g vs from hras sludge accordingly it can be assumed that i the inhibitory effect on the anaerobic digestibility of pac and pam in the magnetic sludge was not obvious and could be neglect kimura et al 2021 and ii the residual magnetite and ac may facilitate the anaerobic digestibility on the one hand magnetite could enrich iron reducing bacteria responsible for sludge hydrolysis on the other hand ac was believed to enhance syntrophic metabolism between iron reducing bacteria and methanogens attributed to its high electrical conductivity and large surface area peng et al 2018 the energy potential of ems sludge was demonstrated by bmp tests further investigation is still needed for a more sophisticated treatment for ems sludge anaerobic fermentation has been well recognized as an effective sludge treatment process wu et al 2016 in the bap tests the scod and volatile fatty acid vfa production of ms sludge was higher than that of was and reached the maximum 170 mg scod g vs and 50 mg vfa g vs respectively on the 5th day fig 7b the reasons for this phenomenon are as follows on the one hand organic matter recovered via ms was raw and easily degradable whereas waste sludge is mainly composed of bacterial cells kimura et al 2021 on the other hand magnetite could promote the solubilization hydrolysis and acidification processes through the dissimilatory iron reduction process zhao et al 2018 the acidification production of ems sludge was lower than that of ms a possible cause is that ac could significantly promote vfas degradation and shorten the lag time of methanogenesis ma et al 2020 furthermore the vfa composition on the 5th day was shown in fig 7c ethanol was observed in the fermentation reactor with ems sludge ethanol type fermentation was reported to promote the methanogenic process by stimulating direct interspecies electron transfer li et al 2020 ac was reported to serve as a support medium to ensure stable ethanol type fermentation and improve ethanol yields by the removal of toxic compounds lee et al 2011 guo et al 2008 in this section the characteristic of ms and ems sludge was clarified the composition analysis confirmed that during the ems process more soluble substances especially carbohydrates were bounded to aggregates bacteroidota was more abundant in ems sludge which is reported to be associated with floc formation and later anaerobic processes both ems and ms sludge performed better than waste sludge in bmp and bap tests due to the residual magnetite specifically ems sludge performed better in methanogenesis while ms dominated the hydrolysis the intriguing influence of ac on fermentation type is worth further study it should be noted that the bmp and bap tests were conducted without any pretreatment or process control hence the results only suggest the feasibility of recovering energy and vfas from the produced sludge the optimal anaerobic conditions and the maximum yield need to be further studied for example ph control alkali pretreatment and co digestion with food waste are reported to be beneficial jin et al 2016 wu et al 2016 3 4 application insights 3 4 1 energy and economic evaluation energy consumption is one of the important indexes to evaluate the feasibility of engineering applications the main energy consumption of this pilot scale ems was mainly attributed to stirrer in the coagulation device 0 014 kwh m3 magnetic separation device 0 008 kwh m3 and magnetite recovery device 0 009 kwh m3 the chemical dosing and controlling system accounted for 0 004 kwh m3 thus the total energy consumption was 0 036 kwh m3 the operational costs included electricity and chemicals considering that the average price of industrial electricity in beijing is 0 1233 kwh the electricity cost was calculated as 0 004 m3 additionally the chemicals contributed 0 031 m3 in which ac and magnetite accounted for 56 and 9 respectively the unit price used in the calculation was 1250 cny t for pac 25 000 cny t for pam 6000 cny t for ac and 4000 cny t for magnetite respectively the prices of these chemicals were reasonable with little difference from some recent reports li et al 2022 jin et al 2020 wang et al 2018 herein the operational cost was estimated as 0 035 m3 in previous research taboada santos et al 2020 conducted a comprehensive comparison between cept and hras about their energy consumptions some results fig 8 were extracted and compared with ems here calculation procedure was provided in si firstly ems and cept exhibited advantages in conserving energy since no aeration was needed nevertheless the energy consumption of ems was slightly higher than that of cept since ms equipment caused extra energy consumption fig 8a secondly hras has the lowest operating cost in cept and ems chemicals contributed a lot for example commercial ac used in our experiment accounted for about 50 of the total operational cost at an ac dosage of 20 mg l recycle of ac or seeking alternatives were promising methods for cost reduction finally the most significant advantage of ems is the short hrt presented in fig 8c less time in the reaction stage was required by the non biological processes the hrt in the separation stage reduced to negligible levels since no need for a time consuming sedimentation tank this means that for a rough estimate based on a tank depth of 5 m a wwtp with a treatment capacity of 100 000 tons per day would occupy 148 m2 when adopting ems as up concentration technology while 640 m2 and 2500 m2 would be required for cept and hras respectively 3 4 2 future of n in ems effluent when organics were stored in the concentrates n was allowed to flow through in the ems system thus efficient cn separation was achieved redirecting c and n mass flow with the up concentration process was believed to achieve energy neutrality and resource recovery in wwtps gong et al 2018 recent advancements in mainstream autotrophic denitrification enhanced the viability of this idea gu et al 2018 xie et al 2018 the ems effluent was fed to two anaerobic ammonia oxidation reactors and over 80 ammonia removal rates were observed both in biofilm and granular reactors in preliminary experiments song et al 2021 besides the concept of the circular economy led to a new direction studies of ammonia treatment are no longer limited to the removal but focused more on recycling many technologies including struvite precipitation membrane enrichment and microalgae are competitive in ammonia recovery xiang et al 2020 recent pilot scale demonstrations bode well for the future serna garcía et al 2021 molinuevo salces et al 2020 4 conclusions this study investigated the feasibility of ems in the up concentration of municipal wastewater for organic recovery the addition of adsorbents could enhance the performance mainly by capturing polysaccharides and humic acid during the one year operation of the pilot scale ems system operation strategies were optimized and more than 70 cod was removed within 10 min it was also confirmed that the ems system could be adapted to the situation where influent was low in strength and large in quantity concentrated sludge produced by ems contained over 18 g l cod and is a feasible feedstock for resource and energy recovery by anaerobic processes the developed ems system exhibited significant advantages in time consumption with competitive energy consumption and operation costs in general ems can be a promising

16057,light as an environmental factor can affect the process of anaerobic digestion but there is no systematic study in municipal wastewater sludge mesophilic digestion in this study the effects of light on the performance of the anaerobic digestion system and photo anaerobic microbiota pam were evaluated in lighted anaerobic batch digesters labrs the methane yield from the reactor under the dark condition labr0 was 179 2 ml ch4 g cod which was lower than 305 4 ml ch4 g cod and 223 0 ml ch4 g cod n 3 p 0 05 from reactors under the light intensity of 3600 lm labr1 and 7200 lm labr2 respectively the dominant genera in the bacterial and archaeal communities were bacillus and methanosarcina under light conditions enterococcus and methanobacterium under dark conditions and these two bacteria acted as electroactive bacterial genera indicating that light changes the combination of direct interspecies electron transfer diet microbial partners and activates the diet pathway for methane production the electron conduction pathways analysis further suggests that biological diet bdiet between microbial biomass rather than diet via conductive material cdiet between microbes and conductive materials is promoted and behaves as the dominant factor enhancing methane production under light conditions the morphology of microorganisms and the amount and properties of eps corroborate these views our findings are guided to anaerobic digester constructions under the outdoor environment with light exposure graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mesophilic digestion light exposure conductive material diet pathway extracellular polymeric substance 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is an effective method for organic matter removal from wastewater and biogas generation mccarty et al 2011 generally the ad process consists of hydrolysis fermentation and methane production in which the microorganisms involved in ad constitute anaerobic microbial systems lee et al 2012 among them the interspecies electron transfer iet between methanogens and fermentation bacteria performs an integral role in methane production stams and plugge 2009 hydrogen and formate as electron carriers between the two types of bacteria constitute the indirect interspecies electron transfer iiet of microorganisms due to gas partial pressure and substance concentration gradient limitation iiet exhibits certain instability in methane production lovley 2011 in contrast direct interspecies electron transfer diet can transmit electrons between the methanogenic co culture microorganisms via biological extracellular conducting mediums such as conductive pili cytochromes bdiet and conductive materials cdiet feng et al 2018 shrestha and rotaru 2014 simply electroactive bacteria act as electron donors to oxidize fermentation intermediates such as volatile fatty acids to produce acetic acid hydrogen ions and electrons followed by certain methanogens directly accept extracellular electrons to reduce co2 to methane with less electron loss recently many studies have reported increased methane production in the ad process by using different conductive materials such as activated carbon lee et al 2016 biochar li et al 2020 and nickel foam guo et al 2020 however most studies focus on developing new materials to reach higher conductivity and more stable internal features paritosh et al 2020 while ignoring the effects of external environmental conditions most conventional anaerobic digestion systems were operated under dark or low light conditions at laboratory scales yang et al 2009 which led to a lack of experience in carrying out ad under light conditions the lighted up flow anaerobic sludge blanket luasb method under mesophilic conditions has been reported to treat wastewater and organic production sawayama et al 1999 as reported by tada and sawayama the methane yield from the thermophilic anaerobic digestion reactor exposed to incandescent light for 10 consecutive days was higher than that from the unirradiated reactor tada and sawayama 2004 anaerobic digestion of pig manure produced about 5 6 times more methane through photo fermentation yin et al 2014 moreover enhanced ad was observed for a dual irradiation process involving aerobic thermophilic irradiation pretreatment and intermittent irradiation anaerobic digestion yang et al 2011 the illuminated bioreactor with effective photon number showed a higher methanogenic capacity for ammonia rich waste zhu et al 2021 existing research suggests that light exposure may be a potential option in promoting different types of anaerobic digestion solar energy a clean and renewable energy source that can be restored and replenished after consumption does not produce secondary pollution and can be used directly in production dincer 2000 light can be considered for the construction of outdoor scale up equipment as an environmental factor however there are limited studies on how light influences internal mechanisms of methane production as a natural signal light can drive the individual behavior of microorganisms and change the structure and function of the microbial communities gomelsky and hoff 2011 such as phototaxis and negative phototaxis of bacteria to facilitate their growth clarke 2010 for example synechocystis showed different phototaxis under different wavelengths chau et al 2017 previous studies have shown that certain photosynthetic bacteria such as rhodopseudomonas palustris guzman et al 2019 and prosthecochloris aestaurii ha et al 2017 possessed the electroactive needed in diet and the latter has been proved to be able to form a photosynthetic diet pdiet with geobacter sulfurreducens huang et al 2019 however the microbial system of anaerobic digestion under the influence and shaping of light remains relatively unknown several questions remain unclear whether light influences the ad process by changing the microbial system in ad is there a diet pathway that affects biogas production in the lighted anaerobic digestion system to our knowledge there have been no specific studies to answer these questions in this study our major objective was to study the effects of light factors on the mesophilic anaerobic digestion of municipal sludge we used conductive carbon felt as the growth carrier for anaerobic microorganisms and the intermediate conductor of direct interspecies electron transfer in constructing a light anaerobic batch reactor specifically our study includes 1 comparing the performance of anaerobic digestion system with or without light 2 investigating composition and function characteristics of the microbial community in anaerobic digestion system under different light intensities 3 elucidating electron transfer mechanism in anaerobic digestion system by light influence the obtained results can help us to comprehend the internal changes of diet in the anaerobic digestion process under the combined action of light and conductive material that contribute to the further utilization of anaerobic digestion and the expanded application of the diet process in practical anaerobic engineering 2 materials and methods 2 1 lighted anaerobic batch reactors set up a series of cylindrical lighted anaerobic batch reactors labr height 150 mm diameter 100 mm made of polymethylmethacrylate with a 1 l of effective volume fig s1 were used for studying the performance of the anaerobic system under different light conditions an upper plate with fluorine rubber ring

sludge was taken as seed sludge from an anaerobic tank at jiangxinzhou wastewater treatment plant in nanjing jiangsu province china after being collected in an airtight container sludge was stored at 4 c for use until no more biogas was produced the total suspended sludge tss of the anaerobic sludge was about 16 000 mg l and the ratio of volatile suspended sludge vss to tss was 0 56 inoculation

solution and seed sludge was 7 16 and 6 56 respectively before being added to the reactor the inoculation liquid was purged with pure nitrogen gas to create an anaerobic environment after the reactor was assembled carrying on adding nitrogen gas to generate a deoxygenation headspace the carbon felt was immersed in ethanol for ultrasonic treatment and kept in acetone solution followed by drying at 100 c for 4 h to enhance its hydrophilicity and remove impurities before use wang et al 2018 to ensure the uniformity of microbial community nutrients and temperature required for the growth of the photo anaerobic microbiota pam continuous mixing was carried out at 250 rpm by the magnetic stirrer the temperature was kept constant at room 35 2 c biogas production was monitored daily and stopped stirring to replace the supernatant liquid with the new substrate solution when the yield was stable three batches of anaerobic digestion were conducted in each reactor under the same conditions after the start up period relevant indicators were tested in stable period after the biogas production was stabilizing 2 3 test contents and methods 2 3 1 reactor performance the biogas composition was

by stepwise dehydration with 10 30 50 70 and 90 ethanol and coating with electronically conductive gold to facilitate imaging a field emission scanning electron microscope sem zeiss auriga germany was utilized to observe the micromorphology of pam due to the process of diet being closely associated with the extracellular proteins of microorganisms semenec et al 2018 the proteins of pam were

indices were calculated to indicate species richness and diversity from different light conditions 2 3 4 microbial conductivity analysis the conductivity of the anaerobic microbial community was determined by the electrochemical method using two gold flakes as electrodes with a 0 5 mm non conductive gap as previously described zhao et al 2016 the bacteria on the carbon felt was centrifuged at

degree of compactness with cells extracellular polymeric substances eps of microorganisms on carbon felt can be divided into loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps microbial suspensions were prepared by placing the carbon felt in centrifuge tube containing 50 ml of distilled water and shaking at 250 r min two types of eps were extracted by a series of steps including centrifugation ultrasonic treatment and thermal extraction zhang et al 2015 briefly the prepared suspension was centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min and the sediments at the bottom were resuspended in 0 05 w w nacl solution and then sonicated at 20 khz for 2 min afterwards the suspensions were shaken horizontally in a thermostat incubator at 150 rpm for 15 min the liquid was centrifuged at 8000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was collected as the lb eps the residual sediments were resuspended at their initial volume for the second time using a 0 05 w w nacl solution sonicated at 20 khz for 2 min and subsequently heated at 60 c for 30 min the suspension was centrifuged at 12 000 g for 20 min and the supernatant was collected as the tb eps at the end both eps fractions were filtered through 0 45 μm acetate cellulose membranes stored at 20 c qian et al 2021 the total organic carbon toc of lb eps and tb eps was measured with a toc analyzer analytikjena multi n c 2100s germany bca protein assay kit sangon biotech china was used to measure the total protein content of the eps polysaccharide content was determined by the anthrone method loewus 1952 the composition of lb eps and tb eps were analyzed by three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra using a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi fl4500 japan the different excitation ex range and emission em field was set ex from 200 to 400 nm em from 200 to 600 nm and the sampling intervals were 5 nm with a scan rate at 2400 nm min moreover the fluorescence region integration fri technique was adopted to analyze the fluorescence protein compositions of eps quantitatively the details were described in supporting information chen et al 2003 an electrochemistry workstation chi 660e ch instrument usa with a three electrode system was employed to measure the electron donating capacity edc and electron accepting capacity eac of eps a glassy carbon cylinder was applied to serve as an electrochemical reactor with an effective volume of 20 ml also the working electrode we the counter electrode and reference electrode adopted a square platinum sheet with an area of 1 cm2 and ag agcl soaking in saturated potassium chloride respectively 0 1 m pbs was appended to the reactor firstly mediated electrochemical reduction mer containing 0 2 ml of diquat dibromide monohydrate dq 10 mm and mediated electrochemical oxidation meo containing 0 2 ml 3 ethylbenzthiazoline 6 sulfonic acid ammonium salt abts 10 mm were carried in 0 49 v and 0 61 v of the working electrode potential to determine eac and edc respectively aeschbacher et al 2010 then eps samples in different amounts 0 02 0 03 0 04 and 0 05 mg were added to the reactor to measure the amount of electron transfer 2 4 statistical methods

standard deviation were calculated for the triplicate batches the significant analysis of the data was performed using a t test a pairwise comparison microsoft office excel 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 anaerobic digestion performance the performance of the reactor under different light conditions can be reflected by characteristics such as methane production methanogenic properties can indicate the adaptability of the anaerobic microbiome in the process of ad feng et al 2018 fig 1 showed the cumulative methane production and methane fitted yield for each reactor the lag phase of the initial stage is the time for the anaerobic microorganisms to adapt to the new environment and colonize on the carbon felt in the start up stage the lag phase was 2 30 and 2 29 days in the labr1 and labr2 respectively shorter than 3 19 days of the reactor under the dark condition suggesting that microorganisms can quickly adapt to anaerobic digestion when exposed to light methane production by labr0 was stabilized for 16 days and the cycle in stable period lasted 8 days which was longer than those under light illumination 12 and 14 days of start up period both 7 days of stable period for labr1 and labr2 previous studies have found that adding conductive materials can reduce the lag phase through the diet process gahlot et al 2020 and the even shorter lag time under the condition of controlling conductive materials may be due to the expansion of this process with light exposure the maximum methane production rate mmpr reflected the adaptedness of anaerobic microorganisms as shown in table 1 in the start up stage the mmpr was 85 2 ml ch4 l d in darkness and increased to 167 3 ml ch4 l d and 92 3 ml ch4 l d with illumination in labr1 and labr2 it suggests that light exposure can enhance the adaptability of ad microorganisms this was also proved by the ultimate methane production ump which was highest for labr1 with 1165 ml ch4 l and was only 662 ml ch4 l under dark conditions in this study carbon felt was added to the system as a conductive material and the ump value was higher than the traditional ad system of the previous study indicating that it is possible to exist cdiet process promoted methane production however there is another possible type of electron transfer from electroactive bacteria to methanogenic bacteria by bdiet rotaru et al 2014 indicating that electroactive bacteria can well adapt and enrich under light conditions notably with the increase of light intensity both mmpr and ump decreased although lag phase time was shorter which may be due to the resistance of the diet process the influence of light on anaerobic digestion was further reflected in the cyclic batches during the stable period the cumulative methane production of the stable stage cycle was fitted by the improved gompertz equation as shown in fig 1b less than 0 2 days of the lag time indicated that the microorganisms in all ad systems were well adapted methane yield was calculated by methane production and cod input song et al 2004 which was 305 4 ml ch4 g cod in labr1 and 223 0 ml ch4 g cod in labr2 higher than 179 2 ml ch4 g cod in darkness table 1 previous research reported a theoretical methane yield of 350 ml ch4 g cod in ad song et al 2019 which is close to the theoretical value under the light conditions of our study low methane yield indicates low electron transfer efficiency from the substrate to methane identical to the traditional ad process electrons are mainly transferred through iiet pathway in the reactor which will cause a large loss of electrons and it can be inferred that the addition of light changed the electron transfer pathway activating the diet process in the reactor in addition the mmpr of the stable period was significantly higher than that of the start up stage reaching a maximum of 249 2 ml ch4 l d in light an 82 increase compared to mmpr under the dark condition this is consistent with the change of ump suggesting that the dark environment has a limited effect on the methane production via diet although the cdiet pathway exists in both conditions cod removal amount and efficiency were higher from ad under the light condition of our study fig s3 84 6 91 3 and 86 1 in three reactors respectively suggesting that light may promote the enrichment of electroactive bacteria related to substrate degradation in ad systems and intensive light exposure may lead to environmental resistance to the growth of electroactive microorganisms which also explains the change of methane production mentioned above 3 2 characteristics of anaerobic microorganism 3 2 1 electrochemical characterization cv was measured to verify the electron transfer capacity of microbiota with carbon felt under different operating conditions and the apparent electron transfer rate etr constant kapp was calculated the height of the current peak reflects the electrochemical activity of electroactive bacteria and redox substances microorganisms can change the redox environment through the secretion of specific tiny molecules such as cytochrome quinone flavin and humic substances yang et al 2012 as shown in fig 2 the peak current density of oxidation of labr0 was 1 20 ma cm2 and the peak current density of oxidation was above 1 60 ma cm2 under the light condition scanning at 140 mv s in previous studies certain cytochromes have been shown to be used for electron transfer from microorganisms to electrodes such as omce omcs and omcz pessanha et al 2006 in this study the oxidation peaks were found at 0 233 v 0 263 v and 0 479 v within the potential ranges of omcz from 0 630 v to 0 270 v and omcs from 0 570 v to 0 250 v this indicates that light promotes the secretion of microbial conductive substances which further promotes the diet pathways for methane production in addition the oxidation peaks of 0 48 v fig 2c e may relate to the glucose oxidation potential according to the previous study jin and taniguchi 2007 the lack of 0 48 v peak in labr0 may be due to the order of oxidation reaction interestingly although the peak was not apparent the oxidation peak in labr2 appeared at 0 26 v and 0 48 v which were the oxidation peak potential of labr0 and labr1 respectively this indicates that the oxidation reactions occurring in the other two reactors may coexist in labr2 the effects of change of scanning rate on the peak current indicate that the electron transfer process is controlled as the scan rate increased the fitting linear changes were manifested in the potential and current changes of oxidation peak and reduction peak suggesting the peak potential and the scan rate conformed to the zero order kinetic equation according to the laviron s theory the kapp value of each reactor was calculated from two redox peaks table 2 lists the αn 1 α n values and kapp for three reactors a larger kapp value existed in labr0 about 160 times and 3 7 times compared with labr1 and labr2 indicating that etr can be triggered faster under dark conditions which did not seem to match the results obtained for the methane production rate higher kapp value for labr0 may be caused by the more significant promotion of other pathways for methane production by light rather than just through electron exchange between microorganisms and conductive materials lin et al tested ad under carbon fiber modification by changing temperature and substrate lin et al 2020 and the deviation of kapp indicated that the use of etr alone was insufficient to reflect the promoting role of diet in ad their results also showed that when the reactor used complex substrates e g propionate higher kapp values did not always correspond with methane production rates or process stability although the correlation between reactor performance and kapp is not sufficient to fully justify the diet process in ad it still supports a causal relationship while cyclic voltammetry cv only detects electron exchange between the microbe and the conductive material conductivity measurements characterize the ability of biomass to conduct electrons van steendam et al 2019 in this study the conductivity of biomass on carbon felt in labr1 and labr2 reactors were 18 6 0 9 μs cm and 8 7 0 8 μs cm mean standard deviation n 3 about 5 7 and 2 6 times higher that of the control reactor labr0 3 29 0 4 μs cm fig 3 b past studies have shown that the increase in the conductivity of aggregates can be potential evidence for the establishment of diet during enrichment zhao et al 2016 changes in conductivity were also observed by the analysis of eis fig s4 combined with cv analysis the cdiet between the microbe and the conductive material under light conditions may not be the main factor pathway of methane production but the promoted bdiet between biomass improves methane production 3 2 2 morphological characterization sem was used to observe the morphological changes of microorganisms and biomass on carbon felt under different light conditions fig 4 three groups of carbon felt samples at the stabilization stage of the reactor 8 7 and 7 days later respectively were selected for scanning the morphology of the microbial aggregates was different between groups with or without light conditions clear rod shaped bacteria could be found in all three groups but the biomass in labr1 and labr2 increased significantly fig 4b 2 and c 2 the biomass on carbon felt collected at the stable period increased to 2 87 0 15 103 mg l n 3 with light exposure fig s5 there were significant differences p 0 01 student s t test between the light reactors and the non light reactor table s1 with the increase of light intensity the biomass in the solution increased significantly table s2 the trend was greater than the biomass on the carbon felt indicating a saturated load of microbes attached to the carbon felt however the lower gas production of labr2 than that of labr1 is probably because more microorganisms in the solution consumed the substrate and led to inefficient methane production in addition compared with the dark conditions higher heterogeneity was present in the biomass of the other two reactors the bacteria in labr0 were longer in size while others were shorter rod shaped bacteria moreover cell cell contact via intimate extracellular associations existed between bacteria in labr1 and labr2 this connection could be potential evidence for diet ha et al 2017 the more viscous surface also reflected the heterogeneity of biomass under light conditions caused by the secretion of a large number of eps the secretion of eps increased the adhesion between cells and promoted electron exchange to a certain extent clsm tested the occurrence of proteins in eps secreted by biomass and clearly stained proteins were observed in all eps fig s6 however the protein distribution in labr0 was more dispersed while that in labr1 and labr2 was denser the profile showed the thickness of different eps protein layers the protein layer for labr0 reactor was significantly thinner than the other two 58 μm versus 92 μm and 83 μm the thickness difference can be attributed to the secretion of redox proteins such as cytochrome by electroactive bacteria which can accelerate electron transfer between bacteria this may explain the difference in the conductivity of biomass under different conditions detailed analysis of eps can be referred to section 3 2 3 3 2 3 characterization of extracellular polymeric substances eps is mainly composed of extracellular polysaccharides and proteins it plays a significant character in the construction of microbial communities therefore the analysis of eps can provide further insight into the impact of light on the growth strategy of microbial communities on carbon felt the total amount of eps was 63 4 3 6 mg toc l in the dark state and increased with the enhancement of light intensity 73 5 2 4 mg toc l and 72 3 1 7 mg toc l fig 5 which showed significant difference among dark and light environments p 0 01 the number of eps can be increased by heme c an important component of c cytochrome in eps which is related to diet wang et al 2019 however eps secreted in large quantities under strong light conditions also may be a means for the microbial community to resist light radiation in addition eps was categorized into two types i e lb eps and tb eps according to the adhesion between eps and cells the tb eps lb eps ratio was 6 6 on average in labr1 and tb eps was also greater than twice the lb eps in the other two reactors 2 1 and 3 9 in labr0 and labr2 indicating that light exposure tremendously promoted the secretion of tb eps which played a more significant role in microbial population response as for the components of lb eps and tb eps polysaccharides showed a stable variation level and the main changing component was protein the ratio of protein to polysaccharide carbohydrate p c could reflect the surface properties of eps and the average value was 4 1 3 7 3 7 in lb eps and 3 0 3 7 3 5 in tb eps for labr0 labr1 and labr2 reactors respectively the protein content in different eps layers was higher than that of polysaccharides due to the low energy level inhibiting the storage of energy in the form of ps resulting in the low ps content in eps during the anaerobic process liu et al 2021 the main organic matter content in eps was detected by the 3d eem spectrum and the influences of different illumination on the organic matter content in eps were compared qian et al 2021 fig s7 the fluorescence region was categorized into five regions according to the excitation and emission boundaries the main peak positions of tb eps were protein like substances ex em 265 280 330 350 nm region iv and the apparent changes were observed between each reactor the peak positions of lb eps were found in aromatic proteins i ex em 280 285 330 340 nm region i and protein like substances ex em 270 280 300 320 nm region iv with no evident changes among reactors fri calculations were performed for five regions and showed that the fluorescence intensity of tb eps was greater than lb eps and the changes of protein like substances were also congruent with the above results table s3 this further confirms that light may mainly alter the structure of tb eps to enhance eps electroactive and electron shuttle capacity 3 3 microbial analysis the α diversity of the microbial community on the carbon felt showed a difference in community structure whether from bacteria or archaea cluster analysis suggested that labr1 and labr2 shared more otus at the bacterial and archaea levels labr0 and labr1 had 52 otus together at the bacterial level with 375 and 632 unique otus respectively fig 6 d labr0 and labr2 had 57 otus in common but labr1 and labr2 shared 108 otus at the archaea level the otu differences were more prominent and there were 50 otus in common between the two communities under light conditions only 24 and 18 otus for labr0 vs labr1 and labr2 fig 6e chao1 index indicated the richness of the community and showed that labr1 had the highest bacterial richness while its archaeal richness was the lowest among the three groups simpson and shannon index reflected the evenness of community species bacteria in the community sacrificed part of the richness to obtain higher uniformity under the dark condition in contrast the archaea communities under dark conditions showed high richness and evenness table s4 and s5 analysis of α diversity showed that bacteria and archaea communities had different growth strategies under light conditions the relative abundance of microorganisms provided more direct evidence to explain the community changes and the methanogenic capacity in the reactors in labr0 the most dominant bacteria phylum was firmicutes 58 5 followed by proteobacteria 21 9 chloroflexi 9 0 bacteroidetes 7 3 and synergistetes 1 2 fig 6a however as the same dominant phylum firmicutes occupied a higher proportion in labr1 and labr2 92 9 and 76 5 respectively it suggests that the illumination selectively enriches the firmicutes phylum rather than the proteobacteria in addition the total of firmicutes and proteobacteria abundances in these two communities was similar 98 0 and 94 which was greater than this value in dark conditions 80 3 according to previous studies most electroactive bacteria have been confirmed to belong to firmicutes and proteobacteria logan 2009 high abundance of firmicutes and proteobacteria facilitates the microbial community to promote the diet process the effect of light on the bacterial community was more obvious at the genus level fig 6b under the dark condition enterococcus was enriched on carbon felt 22 4 of total abundance while it was barely observed under light conditions instead bacillus became the dominant genus accounting for 81 3 and 34 2 of total abundance for labr1 and labr2 respectively similar to our study enterococcus was found on carbon cloth for ad in the previous study and enterococcus gallinarum showed electrochemically active and capable of extracellular electron transfer dang et al 2016 this confirms the underlying advantages of carbon based materials in facilitating anaerobic digestion bacillus sp was also found to reduce hexavalent chromium with electrochemical activity beretta et al 2019 suggesting bacteria that can implement diet existed regardless of the light but the enrichment strategies were different light seemed to select bacillus whose enrichment was better promoted under the low light condition in addition there was no enrichment of model exoelectrogens geobacter species on carbon felt which mainly metabolized short chain fatty acids like acetate du et al 2018 the substrate type also determines bacterial growth to a certain extent so clostridium can exist as an electroactive bacterium capable of metabolizing glucose in this study interestingly some genera only appeared in dark or light conditions clostridium acetoanaerobium found only under the dark condition can produce acetic acid from hydrogen and carbon dioxide which may affect the amount of substrate in the diet process to produce methane in addition a small number of advenella and comamonas were found in labr0 which was previously reported to be electrically active for applying to microbial fuel cells ni et al 2020 yu et al 2015 tepidiphilus and hydrogenispora which existed only under light conditions were also enriched in the glucose fed anaerobic environment for fermentation and the latter can metabolize glucose to produce acetic acid ethanol and hydrogen liu et al 2014 poddar et al 2014 indicating that hydrogen trophic methanogenesis also existed even if diet promoted methane production the archaea community of the same samples was investigated to confirm our hypothesis fig 6c similar to bacteria archaea community types varied greatly between light and dark conditions methanobacterium was dominated in the darkness while illumination promoted the enrichment of methanosarcina previous studies have reported they are methanogens that act as electron receptors during diet through bio electrochemical connections with their partners kato et al 2012 with the increase of light intensity the relative abundance of methanosarcina showed an increasing trend 81 7 and 98 0 for labr1 and labr2 respectively which is correspondent to the results obtained by tada et al on high temperature digestion tada et al 2006 furthermore diet was already proved to exist between geobacter and methanosarcina in a co culture methane production environment rotaru et al 2014 and the reduction in co2 content compared to the control observed by yin et al after adding geobacter inoculum to the ad reactor suggested that methanosarcina obtained the electrons transferred from geobacter and consumed co2 for methane production yin et al 2016 hence in association with the analysis at the bacterial level the results showed that methanosarcina formed diet syntrophic partners with bacilllus in the system under light conditions the dominant archaea with relative abundance higher than 1 were methanosarcina methanobacterium methanomassiliicoccus methanosaeta whose abundance was significantly different between light and dark conditions further elucidating which microorganisms can be enriched on conductive materials under light and participate in diet for anaerobic methanogenesis is of great significance for the transformation of methanogenic digesters based on the diet concept under different environmental conditions 3 4 discussion through the construction of light anaerobic batch reactors and anaerobic digestion treatment this study showed that the performance and stability of the anaerobic systems were improved and the microbial community on carbon felt changed significantly under light exposure sem morphological images of microbiota on carbon felt showed higher heterogeneity and the period of accumulation was shorter the biomass content showed that light promoted the biomass accumulation in both the carbon felt and the solution but the biomass on the carbon felt may be saturated with the increase of light intensity 16s rdna sequence data revealed that enterococcus acetoanaerobium and bacillus were the dominant bacteria under dark and light conditions respectively combined with the archaea results the possible combinations of diet microorganisms in ad systems were methanobacterium and enterococcus in darkness and methanosarcina and bacilllus in lightness clsm results also showed different thicknesses of protein layers existed on the surface of microorganisms which is consistent with our eps results the differences in the components of various eps layers can be explained by the following mechanism 1 the large reduction of tb eps in labr0 is attribute to the release of the lb eps layer and the lower level of polysaccharide reduced its adhesion 2 the diet combination of microorganisms is more dependent on the inner protein for electron transport under light and the reduction of protein in tb eps may be detrimental to electron transport over long distances which in agree with the etr mentioned above 3 glucose is inadequate to produce excess energy when being metabolized resulting in less energy storing polysaccharides as shown in fig 7 the electron transfer capacity of eps varied at different light conditions suggested the various redox properties three groups of eps were tested for receiving and donating electron ability with eps in labr1 having the largest electron exchange capacity eec of 0 320 0 042 μmol e mg eps the sum of edc and eac followed by labr2 and labr0 0 244 0 047 and 0 120 0 011 μmol e mg eps respectively the larger eac and edc values reflected the stronger electronic exchange capacity of eps which was more conducive to long distance electron transmission previous studies have found a linear correlation between eac and edc and protein concentration ye et al 2018 in this study the variation trend of eec was consistent with the results obtained by tb eps which further indicated that proteins in tb eps could build an electronic bridge between microorganisms to establish diet for higher system performance light can change the environment of an anaerobic methanogenic system our study found that light completely altered the morphology and construction of the anaerobic digestion microbial community combined with the test of electrochemical characteristics our results suggested that the stimulation of methane production by light exposure attributed to many factors including the gain of diet the amount and thickness of eps and the electrical conductivity the changes in ad system caused by light exposure have been studied before but little is known on the anaerobic digestion of wastewater by light with conductive materials as the carrier under the condition of a medium temperature this is the first study to explore the effects of light on ad focusing on the microbial and electron transfer baek et al noted the ability to alter the methanogenic environment of anaerobic digestion under carbon brush conditions even without electrochemical stimulation baek et al 2021 but expanded anaerobic digesters may not be able to support the high cost of materials therefore it is promising to combine it with light to improve methane production further 4 conclusion the study found the methane yield of sequencing batch anaerobic digestion reactor under 3600 lm labr1 and 7200 lm labr2 was 1 70 and 1 24 times that under the dark condition labr0 respectively and other properties such as lag time were also improved bacillus as an electroactive bacterial genus accounted for 81 3 and 34 2 in labr1 and labr2 and the dominant genus was enterococcus in labr0 in archaeal communities methanobacterium was dominated in darkness while illumination promoted the enrichment of methanosarcina our results indicated that light can change the combinations of the diet microorganisms and activate the diet pathways for methane production combined with the analysis of cv and conductivity measurements the diet between the microbe and the conductive material under light conditions might not be the main factor determining methane production but the promoted diet between biomass improved methane production in addition the amount of eps increased under light conditions and the change in the structure of tb eps was likely to be the major factor that enhances the electron transfer capability of eps as far as we know this study is the first effort to investigate microbial enrichment on conductive materials for full insight into mesophilic conditions in the future light exposure can be considered as an effective strategy to improve the methane production from anaerobic microbial systems and the optimal light

16057,light as an environmental factor can affect the process of anaerobic digestion but there is no systematic study in municipal wastewater sludge mesophilic digestion in this study the effects of light on the performance of the anaerobic digestion system and photo anaerobic microbiota pam were evaluated in lighted anaerobic batch digesters labrs the methane yield from the reactor under the dark condition labr0 was 179 2 ml ch4 g cod which was lower than 305 4 ml ch4 g cod and 223 0 ml ch4 g cod n 3 p 0 05 from reactors under the light intensity of 3600 lm labr1 and 7200 lm labr2 respectively the dominant genera in the bacterial and archaeal communities were bacillus and methanosarcina under light conditions enterococcus and methanobacterium under dark conditions and these two bacteria acted as electroactive bacterial genera indicating that light changes the combination of direct interspecies electron transfer diet microbial partners and activates the diet pathway for methane production the electron conduction pathways analysis further suggests that biological diet bdiet between microbial biomass rather than diet via conductive material cdiet between microbes and conductive materials is promoted and behaves as the dominant factor enhancing methane production under light conditions the morphology of microorganisms and the amount and properties of eps corroborate these views our findings are guided to anaerobic digester constructions under the outdoor environment with light exposure graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mesophilic digestion light exposure conductive material diet pathway extracellular polymeric substance 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is an effective method for organic matter removal from wastewater and biogas generation mccarty et al 2011 generally the ad process consists of hydrolysis fermentation and methane production in which the microorganisms involved in ad constitute anaerobic microbial systems lee et al 2012 among them the interspecies electron transfer iet between methanogens and fermentation bacteria performs an integral role in methane production stams and plugge 2009 hydrogen and formate as electron carriers between the two types of bacteria constitute the indirect interspecies electron transfer iiet of microorganisms due to gas partial pressure and substance concentration gradient limitation iiet exhibits certain instability in methane production lovley 2011 in contrast direct interspecies electron transfer diet can transmit electrons between the methanogenic co culture microorganisms via biological extracellular conducting mediums such as conductive pili cytochromes bdiet and conductive materials cdiet feng et al 2018 shrestha and rotaru 2014 simply electroactive bacteria act as electron donors to oxidize fermentation intermediates such as volatile fatty acids to produce acetic acid hydrogen ions and electrons followed by certain methanogens directly accept extracellular electrons to reduce co2 to methane with less electron loss recently many studies have reported increased methane production in the ad process by using different conductive materials such as activated carbon lee et al 2016 biochar li et al 2020 and nickel foam guo et al 2020 however most studies focus on developing new materials to reach higher conductivity and more stable internal features paritosh et al 2020 while ignoring the effects of external environmental conditions most conventional anaerobic digestion systems were operated under dark or low light conditions at laboratory scales yang et al 2009 which led to a lack of experience in carrying out ad under light conditions the lighted up flow anaerobic sludge blanket luasb method under mesophilic conditions has been reported to treat wastewater and organic production sawayama et al 1999 as reported by tada and sawayama the methane yield from the thermophilic anaerobic digestion reactor exposed to incandescent light for 10 consecutive days was higher than that from the unirradiated reactor tada and sawayama 2004 anaerobic digestion of pig manure produced about 5 6 times more methane through photo fermentation yin et al 2014 moreover enhanced ad was observed for a dual irradiation process involving aerobic thermophilic irradiation pretreatment and intermittent irradiation anaerobic digestion yang et al 2011 the illuminated bioreactor with effective photon number showed a higher methanogenic capacity for ammonia rich waste zhu et al 2021 existing research suggests that light exposure may be a potential option in promoting different types of anaerobic digestion solar energy a clean and renewable energy source that can be restored and replenished after consumption does not produce secondary pollution and can be used directly in production dincer 2000 light can be considered for the construction of outdoor scale up equipment as an environmental factor however there are limited studies on how light influences internal mechanisms of methane production as a natural signal light can drive the individual behavior of microorganisms and change the structure and function of the microbial communities gomelsky and hoff 2011 such as phototaxis and negative phototaxis of bacteria to facilitate their growth clarke 2010 for example synechocystis showed different phototaxis under different wavelengths chau et al 2017 previous studies have shown that certain photosynthetic bacteria such as rhodopseudomonas palustris guzman et al 2019 and prosthecochloris aestaurii ha et al 2017 possessed the electroactive needed in diet and the latter has been proved to be able to form a photosynthetic diet pdiet with geobacter sulfurreducens huang et al 2019 however the microbial system of anaerobic digestion under the influence and shaping of light remains relatively unknown several questions remain unclear whether light influences the ad process by changing the microbial system in ad is there a diet pathway that affects biogas production in the lighted anaerobic digestion system to our knowledge there have been no specific studies to answer these questions in this study our major objective was to study the effects of light factors on the mesophilic anaerobic digestion of municipal sludge we used conductive carbon felt as the growth carrier for anaerobic microorganisms and the intermediate conductor of direct interspecies electron transfer in constructing a light anaerobic batch reactor specifically our study includes 1 comparing the performance of anaerobic digestion system with or without light 2 investigating composition and function characteristics of the microbial community in anaerobic digestion system under different light intensities 3 elucidating electron transfer mechanism in anaerobic digestion system by light influence the obtained results can help us to comprehend the internal changes of diet in the anaerobic digestion process under the combined action of light and conductive material that contribute to the further utilization of anaerobic digestion and the expanded application of the diet process in practical anaerobic engineering 2 materials and methods 2 1 lighted anaerobic batch reactors set up a series of cylindrical lighted anaerobic batch reactors labr height 150 mm diameter 100 mm made of polymethylmethacrylate with a 1 l of effective volume fig s1 were used for studying the performance of the anaerobic system under different light conditions an upper plate with fluorine rubber ring was covered on the labr to seal the reactor two holes on the plate were covered by the n butyl rubber stopper for biogas sampling and electrode placement the biogas outlet was connected to the 1l gas sampling bag tedlar sigma aldrich saint louis mi usa for the gas collection the side of labr was appressed with the white lamp belt led 3030 and led 5050 oujia instrument china as the cold light source the lamp belt 5 w m produced the visible light with the light angle of 120 and was enwound uniformly with 0 lm no electricity as dark contrast 3600 lm and 7200 lm 9 104 lux and 1 8 105 lux under the irradiation area of 0 04 m2 as the same order of magnitude of sunlight respectively corresponding to the reactors named labr0 labr1 and labr2 respectively each labr was added with one carbon felt 5 cm 10 cm 0 2 cm nzet co ltd china which was clamped on a stainless steel clip for ease of microbial fixation and testing as the conductive material 2 2 operation of batch experiment anaerobic sludge was taken as seed sludge from an anaerobic tank at jiangxinzhou wastewater treatment plant in nanjing jiangsu province china after being collected in an airtight container sludge was stored at 4 c for use until no more biogas was produced the total suspended sludge tss of the anaerobic sludge was about 16 000 mg l and the ratio of volatile suspended sludge vss to tss was 0 56 inoculation

solution and seed sludge was 7 16 and 6 56 respectively before being added to the reactor the inoculation liquid was purged with pure nitrogen gas to create an anaerobic environment after the reactor was assembled carrying on adding nitrogen gas to generate a deoxygenation headspace the carbon felt was immersed in ethanol for ultrasonic treatment and kept in acetone solution followed by drying at 100 c for 4 h to enhance its hydrophilicity and remove impurities before use wang et al 2018 to ensure the uniformity of microbial community nutrients and temperature required for the growth of the photo anaerobic microbiota pam continuous mixing was carried out at 250 rpm by the magnetic stirrer the temperature was kept constant at room 35 2 c biogas production was monitored daily and stopped stirring to replace the supernatant liquid with the new substrate solution when the yield was stable three batches of anaerobic digestion were conducted in each reactor under the same conditions after the start up period relevant indicators were tested in stable period after the biogas production was stabilizing 2 3 test contents and methods 2 3 1 reactor performance the biogas composition was analyzed by a gas chromatograph gc 7900 tianmei china equipped with a flame ionization detector fid the amount of methane production was calculated according to the measured volume and content of

biogas production ml μm is the maximum biogas production rate and λ is the lag time the chemical oxygen demand cod was measured using the standard method young et al 2005 at the beginning and end of each batch methane yield was obtained by dividing methane production by cod input tss and vss were measured by standard methods association 2 3 2 micromorphological and electrochemical measurements when biogas was produced steadily in the stable phase carbon felt was taken out and rinsed with pbs to remove the outer unstuck sludge and then fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde in pbs solution followed by stepwise dehydration with 10 30 50 70 and 90 ethanol and coating with electronically conductive gold to facilitate imaging a field emission scanning electron microscope sem zeiss auriga germany was utilized to observe the micromorphology of pam due to the process of diet being closely associated with the extracellular proteins of microorganisms semenec et al 2018 the proteins of pam were surveyed by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm different groups of pams were stained using fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc sigma st louis mo and observed under the excitation emission wavelengths

and chimera removed using the dada2 plugin and otu clustering procedure following the vsearch callahan et al 2016 rognes et al 2016 through the shared and unique otus the chao1 and shannon diversity indices were calculated to indicate species richness and diversity from different light conditions 2 3 4 microbial conductivity analysis the conductivity of the anaerobic microbial community was determined by the electrochemical method using two gold flakes as electrodes with a 0 5 mm non conductive gap as previously described zhao et al 2016 the bacteria on the carbon felt was centrifuged at 1000 rpm to form bacterial suspension and the suspension was then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min after rinsing three times with 0 1 m sodium chloride solution the aggregate samples were placed on a gold electrode across a non conductive gap a gradient voltage of 0 3 v to 0 3 v was applied at both electrodes through the electrochemical workstation with a phase step of 0 025 v fig 3a showed the diagrammatic drawing of the conductance measurement after emerging exponential decay of the instantaneous ionic current a period of at least 120 s last in the steady state current of each voltage with a sampling period of one second a current voltage curve was created by the time average current corresponding to each voltage malvankar et al 2011 the conductivity of pams σ s m was estimated by the

degree of compactness with cells extracellular polymeric substances eps of microorganisms on carbon felt can be divided into loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps microbial suspensions were prepared by placing the carbon felt in centrifuge tube containing 50 ml of distilled water and shaking at 250 r min two types of eps were extracted by a series of steps including centrifugation ultrasonic treatment and thermal extraction zhang et al 2015 briefly the prepared suspension was centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min and the sediments at the bottom were resuspended in 0 05 w w nacl solution and then sonicated at 20 khz for 2 min afterwards the suspensions were shaken horizontally in a thermostat incubator at 150 rpm for 15 min the liquid was centrifuged at 8000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was collected as the lb eps the residual sediments were resuspended at their initial volume for the second time using a 0 05 w w nacl solution sonicated at 20 khz for 2 min and subsequently heated at 60 c for 30 min the suspension was centrifuged at 12 000 g for 20 min and the supernatant was collected as the tb eps at the end both eps fractions were filtered through 0 45 μm acetate cellulose membranes stored at 20 c qian et al 2021 the total organic carbon toc of lb eps and tb eps was measured with a toc analyzer analytikjena multi n c 2100s germany bca protein assay kit sangon biotech china was used to measure the total protein content of the eps polysaccharide content was determined by the anthrone method loewus 1952 the composition of lb eps and tb eps were analyzed by three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra using a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi fl4500 japan the different excitation ex range and emission em field was set ex from 200 to 400 nm em from 200 to 600 nm and the sampling intervals were 5 nm with a scan rate at 2400 nm min moreover the fluorescence region integration fri technique was adopted to analyze the fluorescence protein compositions of eps quantitatively the details were described in supporting information chen et al 2003 an electrochemistry workstation chi 660e ch instrument usa with a three electrode system was employed to measure the electron donating capacity edc and electron accepting capacity eac of eps a glassy carbon cylinder was applied to serve as an electrochemical reactor with an effective volume of 20 ml also the working electrode we the counter electrode and reference electrode adopted a square platinum sheet with an area of 1 cm2 and ag agcl soaking in saturated potassium chloride respectively 0 1 m pbs was appended to the reactor firstly mediated electrochemical reduction mer containing 0 2 ml of diquat dibromide monohydrate dq 10 mm and mediated electrochemical oxidation meo containing 0 2 ml 3 ethylbenzthiazoline 6 sulfonic acid ammonium salt abts 10 mm were carried in 0 49 v and 0 61 v of the working electrode potential to determine eac and edc respectively aeschbacher et al 2010 then eps samples in different amounts 0 02 0 03 0 04 and 0 05 mg were added to the reactor to measure the amount of electron transfer 2 4 statistical methods

standard deviation were calculated for the triplicate batches the significant analysis of the data was performed using a t test a pairwise comparison microsoft office excel 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 anaerobic digestion performance the performance of the reactor under different light conditions can be reflected by characteristics such as methane production methanogenic properties can indicate the adaptability of the anaerobic microbiome in the process of ad feng et al 2018 fig 1 showed the cumulative methane production and methane fitted yield for each reactor the lag phase of the initial stage is the time for the anaerobic microorganisms to adapt to the new environment and colonize on the carbon felt in the start up stage the lag phase was 2 30 and 2 29 days in the labr1 and labr2 respectively shorter than 3 19 days of the reactor under the dark condition suggesting that microorganisms can quickly adapt to anaerobic digestion when exposed to light methane production by labr0 was stabilized for 16 days and the cycle in stable period lasted 8 days which was longer than those under light illumination 12 and 14 days of start up period both 7 days of stable period for labr1 and labr2 previous studies have found that adding conductive materials can reduce the lag phase through the diet process gahlot et al 2020 and the even shorter lag time under the condition of controlling conductive materials may be due to the expansion of this process with light exposure the maximum methane production rate mmpr reflected the adaptedness of anaerobic microorganisms as shown in table 1 in the start up stage the mmpr was 85 2 ml ch4 l d in darkness and increased to 167 3 ml ch4 l d and 92 3 ml ch4 l d with illumination in labr1 and labr2 it suggests that light exposure can enhance the adaptability of ad microorganisms this was also proved by the ultimate methane production ump which was highest for labr1 with 1165 ml ch4 l and was only 662 ml ch4 l under dark conditions in this study carbon felt was added to the system as a conductive material and the ump value was higher than the traditional ad system of the previous study indicating that it is possible to exist cdiet process promoted methane production however there is another possible type of electron transfer from electroactive bacteria to methanogenic bacteria by bdiet rotaru et al 2014 indicating that electroactive bacteria can well adapt and enrich under light conditions notably with the increase of light intensity both mmpr and ump decreased although lag phase time was shorter which may be due to the resistance of the diet process the influence of light on anaerobic digestion was further reflected in the cyclic batches during the stable period the cumulative methane production of the stable stage cycle was fitted by the improved gompertz equation as shown in fig 1b less than 0 2 days of the lag time indicated that the microorganisms in all ad systems were well adapted methane yield was calculated by methane production and cod input song et al 2004 which was 305 4 ml ch4 g cod in labr1 and 223 0 ml ch4 g cod in labr2 higher than 179 2 ml ch4 g cod in darkness table 1 previous research reported a theoretical methane yield of 350 ml ch4 g cod in ad song et al 2019 which is close to the theoretical value under the light conditions of our study low methane yield indicates low electron transfer efficiency from the substrate to methane identical to the traditional ad process electrons are mainly transferred through iiet pathway in the reactor which will cause a large loss of electrons and it can be inferred that the addition of light changed the electron transfer pathway activating the diet process in the reactor in addition the mmpr of the stable period was significantly higher than that of the start up stage reaching a maximum of 249 2 ml ch4 l d in light an 82 increase compared to mmpr under the dark condition this is consistent with the change of ump suggesting that the dark environment has a limited effect on the methane production via diet although the cdiet pathway exists in both conditions cod removal amount and efficiency were higher from ad under the light condition of our study fig s3 84 6 91 3 and 86 1 in three reactors respectively suggesting that light may promote the enrichment of electroactive bacteria related to substrate degradation in ad systems and intensive light exposure may lead to environmental resistance to the growth of electroactive microorganisms which also explains the change of methane production mentioned above 3 2 characteristics of anaerobic microorganism 3 2 1 electrochemical characterization cv was measured to verify the electron transfer capacity of microbiota with carbon felt under different operating conditions and the apparent electron transfer rate etr constant kapp was calculated the height of the current peak reflects the electrochemical activity of electroactive bacteria and redox substances microorganisms can change the redox environment through the secretion of specific tiny molecules such as cytochrome quinone flavin and humic substances yang et al 2012 as shown in fig 2 the peak current density of oxidation of labr0 was 1 20 ma cm2 and the peak current density of oxidation was above 1 60 ma cm2 under the light condition scanning at 140 mv s in previous studies certain cytochromes have been shown to be used for electron transfer from microorganisms to electrodes such as omce omcs and omcz pessanha et al 2006 in this study the oxidation peaks were found at 0 233 v 0 263 v and 0 479 v within the potential ranges of omcz from 0 630 v to 0 270 v and omcs from 0 570 v to 0 250 v this indicates that light promotes the secretion of microbial conductive substances which further promotes the diet pathways for methane production in addition the oxidation peaks of 0 48 v fig 2c e may relate to the glucose oxidation potential according to the previous study jin and taniguchi 2007 the lack of 0 48 v peak in labr0 may be due to the order of oxidation reaction interestingly although the peak was not apparent the oxidation peak in labr2 appeared at 0 26 v and 0 48 v which were the oxidation peak potential of labr0 and labr1 respectively this indicates that the oxidation reactions occurring in the other two reactors may coexist in labr2 the effects of change of scanning rate on the peak current indicate that the electron transfer process is controlled as the scan rate increased the fitting linear changes were manifested in the potential and current changes of oxidation peak and reduction peak suggesting the peak potential and the scan rate conformed to the zero order kinetic equation according to the laviron s theory the kapp value of each reactor was calculated from two redox peaks table 2 lists the αn 1 α n values and kapp for three reactors a larger kapp value existed in labr0 about 160 times and 3 7 times compared with labr1 and labr2 indicating that etr can be triggered faster under dark conditions which did not seem to match the results obtained for the methane production rate higher kapp value for labr0 may be caused by the more significant promotion of other pathways for methane production by light rather than just through electron exchange between microorganisms and conductive materials lin et al tested ad under carbon fiber modification by changing temperature and substrate lin et al 2020 and the deviation of kapp indicated that the use of etr alone was insufficient to reflect the promoting role of diet in ad their results also showed that when the reactor used complex substrates e g propionate higher kapp values did not always correspond with methane production rates or process stability although the correlation between reactor performance and kapp is not sufficient to fully justify the diet process in ad it still supports a causal relationship while cyclic voltammetry cv only detects electron exchange between the microbe and the conductive material conductivity measurements characterize the ability of biomass to conduct electrons van steendam et al 2019 in this study the conductivity of biomass on carbon felt in labr1 and labr2 reactors were 18 6 0 9 μs cm and 8 7 0 8 μs cm mean standard deviation n 3 about 5 7 and 2 6 times higher that of the control reactor labr0 3 29 0 4 μs cm fig 3 b past studies have shown that the increase in the conductivity of aggregates can be potential evidence for the establishment of diet during enrichment zhao et al 2016 changes in conductivity were also observed by the analysis of eis fig s4 combined with cv analysis the cdiet between the microbe and the conductive material under light conditions may not be the main factor pathway of methane production but the promoted bdiet between biomass improves methane production 3 2 2 morphological characterization sem was used to observe the morphological changes of microorganisms and biomass on carbon felt under different light conditions fig 4 three groups of carbon felt samples at the stabilization stage of the reactor 8 7 and 7 days later respectively were selected for scanning the morphology of the microbial aggregates was different between groups with or without light conditions clear rod shaped bacteria could be found in all three groups but the biomass in labr1 and labr2 increased significantly fig 4b 2 and c 2 the biomass on carbon felt collected at the stable period increased to 2 87 0 15 103 mg l n 3 with light exposure fig s5 there were significant differences p 0 01 student s t test between the light reactors and the non light reactor table s1 with the increase of light intensity the biomass in the solution increased significantly table s2 the trend was greater than the biomass on the carbon felt indicating a saturated load of microbes attached to the carbon felt however the lower gas production of labr2 than that of labr1 is probably because more microorganisms in the solution consumed the substrate and led to inefficient methane production in addition compared with the dark conditions higher heterogeneity was present in the biomass of the other two reactors the bacteria in labr0 were longer in size while others were shorter rod shaped bacteria moreover cell cell contact via intimate extracellular associations existed between bacteria in labr1 and labr2 this connection could be potential evidence for diet ha et al 2017 the more viscous surface also reflected the heterogeneity of biomass under light conditions caused by the secretion of a large number of eps the secretion of eps increased the adhesion between cells and promoted electron exchange to a certain extent clsm tested the occurrence of proteins in eps secreted by biomass and clearly stained proteins were observed in all eps fig s6 however the protein distribution in labr0 was more dispersed while that in labr1 and labr2 was denser the profile showed the thickness of different eps protein layers the protein layer for labr0 reactor was significantly thinner than the other two 58 μm versus 92 μm and 83 μm the thickness difference can be attributed to the secretion of redox proteins such as cytochrome by electroactive bacteria which can accelerate electron transfer between bacteria this may explain the difference in the conductivity of biomass under different conditions detailed analysis of eps can be referred to section 3 2 3 3 2 3 characterization of extracellular polymeric substances eps is mainly composed of extracellular polysaccharides and proteins it plays a significant character in the construction of microbial communities therefore the analysis of eps can provide further insight into the impact of light on the growth strategy of microbial communities on carbon felt the total amount of eps was 63 4 3 6 mg toc l in the dark state and increased with the enhancement of light intensity 73 5 2 4 mg toc l and 72 3 1 7 mg toc l fig 5 which showed significant difference among dark and light environments p 0 01 the number of eps can be increased by heme c an important component of c cytochrome in eps which is related to diet wang et al 2019 however eps secreted in large quantities under strong light conditions also may be a means for the microbial community to resist light radiation in addition eps was categorized into two types i e lb eps and tb eps according to the adhesion between eps and cells the tb eps lb eps ratio was 6 6 on average in labr1 and tb eps was also greater than twice the lb eps in the other two reactors 2 1 and 3 9 in labr0 and labr2 indicating that light exposure tremendously promoted the secretion of tb eps which played a more significant role in microbial population response as for the components of lb eps and tb eps polysaccharides showed a stable variation level and the main changing component was protein the ratio of protein to polysaccharide carbohydrate p c could reflect the surface properties of eps and the average value was 4 1 3 7 3 7 in lb eps and 3 0 3 7 3 5 in tb eps for labr0 labr1 and labr2 reactors respectively the protein content in different eps layers was higher than that of polysaccharides due to the low energy level inhibiting the storage of energy in the form of ps resulting in the low ps content in eps during the anaerobic process liu et al 2021 the main organic matter content in eps was detected by the 3d eem spectrum and the influences of different illumination on the organic matter content in eps were compared qian et al 2021 fig s7 the fluorescence region was categorized into five regions according to the excitation and emission boundaries the main peak positions of tb eps were protein like substances ex em 265 280 330 350 nm region iv and the apparent changes were observed between each reactor the peak positions of lb eps were found in aromatic proteins i ex em 280 285 330 340 nm region i and protein like substances ex em 270 280 300 320 nm region iv with no evident changes among reactors fri calculations were performed for five regions and showed that the fluorescence intensity of tb eps was greater than lb eps and the changes of protein like substances were also congruent with the above results table s3 this further confirms that light may mainly alter the structure of tb eps to enhance eps electroactive and electron shuttle capacity 3 3 microbial analysis the α diversity of the microbial community on the carbon felt showed a difference in community structure whether from bacteria or archaea cluster analysis suggested that labr1 and labr2 shared more otus at the bacterial and archaea levels labr0 and labr1 had 52 otus together at the bacterial level with 375 and 632 unique otus respectively fig 6 d labr0 and labr2 had 57 otus in common but labr1 and labr2 shared 108 otus at the archaea level the otu differences were more prominent and there were 50 otus in common between the two communities under light conditions only 24 and 18 otus for labr0 vs labr1 and labr2 fig 6e chao1 index indicated the richness of the community and showed that labr1 had the highest bacterial richness while its archaeal richness was the lowest among the three groups simpson and shannon index reflected the evenness of community species bacteria in the community sacrificed part of the richness to obtain higher uniformity under the dark condition in contrast the archaea communities under dark conditions showed high richness and evenness table s4 and s5 analysis of α diversity showed that bacteria and archaea communities had different growth strategies under light conditions the relative abundance of microorganisms provided more direct evidence to explain the community changes and the methanogenic capacity in the reactors in labr0 the most dominant bacteria phylum was firmicutes 58 5 followed by proteobacteria 21 9 chloroflexi 9 0 bacteroidetes 7 3 and synergistetes 1 2 fig 6a however as the same dominant phylum firmicutes occupied a higher proportion in labr1 and labr2 92 9 and 76 5 respectively it suggests that the illumination selectively enriches the firmicutes phylum rather than the proteobacteria in addition the total of firmicutes and proteobacteria abundances in these two communities was similar 98 0 and 94 which was greater than this value in dark conditions 80 3 according to previous studies most electroactive bacteria have been confirmed to belong to firmicutes and proteobacteria logan 2009 high abundance of firmicutes and proteobacteria facilitates the microbial community to promote the diet process the effect of light on the bacterial community was more obvious at the genus level fig 6b under the dark condition enterococcus was enriched on carbon felt 22 4 of total abundance while it was barely observed under light conditions instead bacillus became the dominant genus accounting for 81 3 and 34 2 of total abundance for labr1 and labr2 respectively similar to our study enterococcus was found on carbon cloth for ad in the previous study and enterococcus gallinarum showed electrochemically active and capable of extracellular electron transfer dang et al 2016 this confirms the underlying advantages of carbon based materials in facilitating anaerobic digestion bacillus sp was also found to reduce hexavalent chromium with electrochemical activity beretta et al 2019 suggesting bacteria that can implement diet existed regardless of the light but the enrichment strategies were different light seemed to select bacillus whose enrichment was better promoted under the low light condition in addition there was no enrichment of model exoelectrogens geobacter species on carbon felt which mainly metabolized short chain fatty acids like acetate du et al 2018 the substrate type also determines bacterial growth to a certain extent so clostridium can exist as an electroactive bacterium capable of metabolizing glucose in this study interestingly some genera only appeared in dark or light conditions clostridium acetoanaerobium found only under the dark condition can produce acetic acid from hydrogen and carbon dioxide which may affect the amount of substrate in the diet process to produce methane in addition a small number of advenella and comamonas were found in labr0 which was previously reported to be electrically active for applying to microbial fuel cells ni et al 2020 yu et al 2015 tepidiphilus and hydrogenispora which existed only under light conditions were also enriched in the glucose fed anaerobic environment for fermentation and the latter can metabolize glucose to produce acetic acid ethanol and hydrogen liu et al 2014 poddar et al 2014 indicating that hydrogen trophic methanogenesis also existed even if diet promoted methane production the archaea community of the same samples was investigated to confirm our hypothesis fig 6c similar to bacteria archaea community types varied greatly between light and dark conditions methanobacterium was dominated in the darkness while illumination promoted the enrichment of methanosarcina previous studies have reported they are methanogens that act as electron receptors during diet through bio electrochemical connections with their partners kato et al 2012 with the increase of light intensity the relative abundance of methanosarcina showed an increasing trend 81 7 and 98 0 for labr1 and labr2 respectively which is correspondent to the results obtained by tada et al on high temperature digestion tada et al 2006 furthermore diet was already proved to exist between geobacter and methanosarcina in a co culture methane production environment rotaru et al 2014 and the reduction in co2 content compared to the control observed by yin et al after adding geobacter inoculum to the ad reactor suggested that methanosarcina obtained the electrons transferred from geobacter and consumed co2 for methane production yin et al 2016 hence in association with the analysis at the bacterial level the results showed that methanosarcina formed diet syntrophic partners with bacilllus in the system under light conditions the dominant archaea with relative abundance higher than 1 were methanosarcina methanobacterium methanomassiliicoccus methanosaeta whose abundance was significantly different between light and dark conditions further elucidating which microorganisms can be enriched on conductive materials under light and participate in diet for anaerobic methanogenesis is of great significance for the transformation of methanogenic digesters based on the diet concept under different environmental conditions 3 4 discussion through the construction of light anaerobic batch reactors and anaerobic digestion treatment this study showed that the performance and stability of the anaerobic systems were improved and the microbial community on carbon felt changed significantly under light exposure sem morphological images of microbiota on carbon felt showed higher heterogeneity and the period of accumulation was shorter the biomass content showed that light promoted the biomass accumulation in both the carbon felt and the solution but the biomass on the carbon felt may be saturated with the increase of light intensity 16s rdna sequence data revealed that enterococcus acetoanaerobium and bacillus were the dominant bacteria under dark and light conditions respectively combined with the archaea results the possible combinations of diet microorganisms in ad systems were methanobacterium and enterococcus in darkness and methanosarcina and bacilllus in lightness clsm results also showed different thicknesses of protein layers existed on the surface of microorganisms which is consistent with our eps results the differences in the components of various eps layers can be explained by the following mechanism 1 the large reduction of tb eps in labr0 is attribute to the release of the lb eps layer and the lower level of polysaccharide reduced its adhesion 2 the diet combination of microorganisms is more dependent on the inner protein for electron transport under light and the reduction of protein in tb eps may be detrimental to electron transport over long distances which in agree with the etr mentioned above 3 glucose is inadequate to produce excess energy when being metabolized resulting in less energy storing polysaccharides as shown in fig 7 the electron transfer capacity of eps varied at different light conditions suggested the various redox properties three groups of eps were tested for receiving and donating electron ability with eps in labr1 having the largest electron exchange capacity eec of 0 320 0 042 μmol e mg eps the sum of edc and eac followed by labr2 and labr0 0 244 0 047 and 0 120 0 011 μmol e mg eps respectively the larger eac and edc values reflected the stronger electronic exchange capacity of eps which was more conducive to long distance electron transmission previous studies have found a linear correlation between eac and edc and protein concentration ye et al 2018 in this study the variation trend of eec was consistent with the results obtained by tb eps which further indicated that proteins in tb eps could build an electronic bridge between microorganisms to establish diet for higher system performance light can change the environment of an anaerobic methanogenic system our study found that light completely altered the morphology and construction of the anaerobic digestion microbial community combined with the test of electrochemical characteristics our results suggested that the stimulation of methane production by light exposure attributed to many factors including the gain of diet the amount and thickness of eps and the electrical conductivity the changes in ad system caused by light exposure have been studied before but little is known on the anaerobic digestion of wastewater by light with conductive materials as the carrier under the condition of a medium temperature this is the first study to explore the effects of light on ad focusing on the microbial and electron transfer baek et al noted the ability to alter the methanogenic environment of anaerobic digestion under carbon brush conditions even without electrochemical stimulation baek et al 2021 but expanded anaerobic digesters may not be able to support the high cost of materials therefore it is promising to combine it with light to improve methane production further 4 conclusion the study found the methane yield of sequencing batch anaerobic digestion reactor under 3600 lm labr1 and 7200 lm labr2 was 1 70 and 1 24 times that under the dark condition labr0 respectively and other properties such as lag time were also improved bacillus as an electroactive bacterial genus accounted for 81 3 and 34 2 in labr1 and labr2 and the dominant genus was enterococcus in labr0 in archaeal communities methanobacterium was dominated in darkness while illumination promoted the enrichment of methanosarcina our results indicated that light can change the combinations of the diet microorganisms and activate the diet pathways for methane production combined with the analysis of cv and conductivity measurements the diet between the microbe and the conductive material under light conditions might not be the main factor determining methane production but the promoted diet between biomass improved methane production in addition the amount of eps increased under light conditions and the change in the structure of tb eps was likely to be the major factor that enhances the electron transfer capability of eps as far as we know this study is the first effort to investigate microbial enrichment on conductive materials for full insight into mesophilic conditions in the future light exposure can be considered as an effective strategy to improve the methane production from anaerobic microbial systems and the optimal light

16058,the characteristics of dissolved organic matter dom play an important role in the formation and speciation of carcinogenic disinfection byproducts this study investigated changes in the characteristics and reactivity of dom caused by the magnetic ion exchange resins miex doc and miex gold using fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem with parallel factor parafac analysis and orbitrap mass spectrometry orbitrap ms with unknown screening analysis a five component parafac model was developed and validated from 208 eems of raw and miex treated water samples the two resins exhibited preferential removal of the humic like components 67 87 removal and successfully removed protein like components to a lesser extent 5 61 removal unknown screening analysis indicated removal of most condensed aromatic structures and lignin like features that had high o c values and refractory characteristics of lipid like features by miex treatments miex preferentially removed dom molecules with more oxidized and shorter ch2 chains the two resins had similar performance in trihalomethanes formation potential removal but miex gold achieved greater haloacetonitriles formation potential removal owing to its larger pore opening over 100 chocl dbp features were commonly found in all the samples while tens of chocl dbps were uniquely formed in the samples with and without pre treatments by miex treatments by miex before chlorination resulted in more intermediate chocl dbps formed after chlorination compared to chlorinated raw waters by optical spectroscopic analysis together with orbitrap ms molecular characterization we were able to confirm both quantitative and qualitative changes in dom properties by miex treatment related to dbp formation graphical abstract

chlorine at water treatment plants wtps and organic precursors primarily dissolved organic matter dom results in the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps dbps have been associated with adverse human health effects including and cancer gan et al 2013 singer and bilyk 2002 generally wtps can meet water quality standards and reduce human health risks from dbps by changing disinfection practices and or removing precursors prior to disinfection li and mitch 2018 due to the complex nature of dbp formation removal of precursors may be preferable to switching disinfectants and can be achieved via conventional treatments including coagulation and sand filtration however changes in raw water characteristics and expansion into impaired water sources have resulted in rising dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations evans et al 2005 that are outside the original design specifications of many existing wtps these changes in raw water have rendered conventional treatment at those wtps insufficient to satisfactorily remove dom and subsequent dbps in response additional treatment is often required to remove dom to achieve regulatory compliance for dbps in drinking water magnetic

second generation miex gold resin also has the same structure and functional group as miex doc resin but the average pore size of miex gold resin 2 35 µm is larger than that of miex doc resin 2 24 µm

golubovic 2015 and in bromide removal in a laboratory study soyluoglu et al 2020 while another laboratory study found similar performance between the two resins in terms of removal of doc and some dbp precursors jutaporn et al 2020 variability in the performance of these resins can be attributed to the complex and variable nature of dom specifically more study is needed to determine when the larger pores of miex gold resin would be beneficial and how miex treatment affects dom composition dom is a complex mixture of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons with various functional groups and a range of molecular weight bioavailability and reactivity lavonen et al 2015 characteristics of dom play an important role in the formation and speciation of dbps and in the performance of removal treatments

optical properties and molecular composition of dom in one single study lavonen et al 2015 mangal et al 2017 and molecular characterization with non target analysis by orbitrap ms has not been conducted on miex treated samples accordingly this study aims to investigate the spectroscopic characteristics molecular composition and reactivity of dom before and after treatment with miex resins therefore we conducted experiments to compare precursors removal by miex resins using a wide range of water sources over a one year period parafac analysis was used to resolve the seasonal and spatial variability in dom fluorescence in the water sources and evaluate how dom quality changed with miex treatment compared to coagulation non target analysis using orbitrap mass spectrometry was also conducted to investigate the transformation of dom after chlorination and formation of unknown dbps with and without miex treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sampling water samples were collected from three sampling locations along the phong river and two raw water intakes of wtps in khon kaen province of thailand supplementary fig s1 the phong river is located in the northeastern

doc resin 0 4 0 5 meq ml soyluoglu et al 2020 for isotherm study resin contact experiments were conducted using 1 10 ml l resin in january 2020 then the mixing time of 30 min and the effective resin dose erd of 3 ml l was chosen based on the preliminary doc removal results from jar test experiments as no further doc removal was achieved when the mixing time was extended beyond 30 min and with the resin dose greater than 3 ml l supplementary fig 2 the 30 min contact time was used in previously miex studies chen et al 2019 johnson and singer 2004 the erd of 3 ml l is equivalent to 333 bed volume

conducted in november 2020 to compare profiles of coagulated dom and miex treated dom following a procedure reported by singer and bilyk 2002 the optimum coagulant doses of 40 mg l for raw water and 5

procedure for dbps can be found in a previous study jutaporn et al 2021 four thms including chloroform cf bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm bromoform bf were selected as representative of regulated carbonaceous dbps c dbps three haloacetonitriles hans including dichloroacetonitrile dcan trichloroacetonitrile tcan and dibromoacetonitrile dban were also selected as a representative of nitrogenous dbps n dbps all samples were extracted and analyzed by gc ecd in duplicates the average values and standard deviations from four measurements were reported 2 4 parafac modeling dom in the samples was characterized using fluorescence eem for which the spectra was collected using fp 8200 spectrofluorometer jasco by scanning excitation wavelengths from 200 to 500 nm in 5 nm intervals and emission wavelengths from 250 to 550 nm in 1 nm intervals the sample eems were corrected for its instrument specific and inner filtering effect blank subtracted and normalized to the area under the water raman peak reporting eem data in raman units ru nm 1 according to a procedure previously reported poojamnong et al 2020 all samples were analyzed in duplicate and average values were reported parafac analysis was applied to decompose the eem dataset into individual components for the raw waters parafac resolved the seasonal and spatial variability in fluorescent dom in the river to account for impacts from agricultural municipal and industrial effluent discharge parafac analysis was used to track changes in the dom composition after miex treatment to associate dom components with dbp fp the parafac model was developed using matlab r2016a mathworks and domfluor toolbox following the procedure by stedmon and bro 2008 briefly the steps in developing of parafac

development 4 model validation through split half analysis and random initialization 5 quantitative comparison of the components spectra with openfluor online database murphy et al 2014 after 4 outliers from instrumentational error were determined and removed the total number of eems in the model were 208 including 56 eems from raw samples 140 eems from miex treated samples 4 eems from coagulated samples and 8 eems from miex coagulated samples 2 5 unknown screening analysis for unknown screening analysis dom in 500 ml of each sample and deionized water di water as a blank was concentrated by solid phase extraction method using bond elut ppl cartridge 3 ml with 500 mg of sorbent agilent technologies santa clara ca usa this cartridge has achieved high levels of dom recovery during extraction from the phong river using procedures described in prasert et al 2021 the dom adsorbed on the cartridge was slowly eluted by 10 ml of meoh and the extracts were stored at 20 c in darkness doc recovery was measured from 1 ml of the extracts meoh was dried from the extracts using laminar flow of high purity nitrogen gas and the extracted dom was redissolved in di water using sonication the doc recovery was calculated from doc in the extract divided by doc in the samples doc recoveries in this study were in the range of 40 76 supplementary table s1 si which is comparable to previously reported ranges dittmar et al 2008 the extracted samples and di extracted blank were analyzed by orbitrap mass spectrometry q exactive plus thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa at

kendrick mass analysis using ch2 scale for alkylation families were also applied and calculated from eqs 4 and 5 changes of dom features were analyzed semi quantitatively using 30 of intensity changes

and suva of the water from the five sampling locations ranged from 5 7 to 7 2 mg c l and 1 66 to 2 81 l mg m respectively and generally increased with distance from the origin supplementary table s2 the increase of doc and suva along the river indicates that the dissolved aromatic carbon content of dom increased with the impacts from effluent discharge seasonal variations of doc and tdn concentrations in raw water samples indicated highest concentrations typically occurred in july fig 1 a and b the highest and lowest annual average doc concentrations were at locations ps 7 19 mg l and at kt 5 71 mg l respectively overall even the highest downstream suva values were still lower than that of other water sources in the other regions of thailand 3 1 3 4 l mg m tongchang et al 2018 the high doc and the low suva characteristics of the phong river suggest that coagulation has limited ability to remove the dom archer and singer 2006 based on the point of diminishing returns for doc removal in preliminary experiments assessing the effect of resin dose supplementary fig 2 an erd of 3 ml l was chosen for the study fitting of the doc removal data found showed that the freundlich isotherm described the data well r2 0 81 0 98 text s1 and supplementary table s3 with the erd of 3 ml l and the contact time of 30 min the two resins effectively removed doc from the raw waters doc of the miex treated water was reduced by 51 80 average 62 7 1 and 50 78 average 61 7 3 for miex doc and gold resins respectively fig 1c the high doc removal efficiency observed in this study across variable initial doc concentrations was consistent with previous studies doederer et al 2018 rajca et al 2017b there was no significant difference p 0 05 between doc removal efficiency of the two resins compared to low doc removal achieved by pacl coagulation at wtps 10 in a previous study jutaporn et al 2021 the effectiveness of the resins for the removal of doc suggests a potential benefit of using miex treatment for this water source the concentration of tdn fluctuated more than doc fig 1b the tdn concentration of the raw waters ranged from 0 60 1 29 mg l which was a twofold variation nitrate contributed to more than 90 of tdn in all samples which indicates that complete nitrification has taken place the sampling locations with the highest and lowest annual average tdn concentration were at ps 1 06 mg l and at ms 0 79 mg l respectively the ps sampling location was impacted from both municipal and industrial effluent discharges the highest annual average doc concentration was also observed at this location with the erd of 3 ml l treatment by miex doc and gold resins achieved tdn removal in the range of 17 55 annual average 34 7 8 and 16 55 annual average 36 9 3 respectively fig 1d thus the two miex resins were moderately effective in tdn removal across all the samples independent of their initial tdn concentration and the season there was no significant difference between the tdn removal efficiency of the two resins p 0 05 additionally the two resins exhibited greater removal efficiency for doc compared to tdn p 0 05 in agreement with previous research gan et al 2013 3 3 monitoring dom changes using eem parafac analysis out of the dataset containing 212 eems generated from raw miex treated and coagulated waters four outliers from instrument error or artifacts were identified and removed parafac models with 2 7 components were initially explored and a five component model was validated for a range of treatment conditions using four way split half validation and random initialization stedmon and bro 2008 the split half validations showed that the excitation and emission loadings between the complete dataset and one of the independent halves of the five component model significantly overlapped with tucker s congruence coefficients tcc 0 95 supplementary fig s3 indicating five is the proper number of components for this dataset residual eems of the five component model contained no distinctive peak and explained more than 99 6 of the variance the residual sum of squares error sse in both the excitation and emission dimensions was 86 10 for the random initialization of five component model each component exhibited typical spectral features of a true fluorophore for example multiple distinct emission peaks 410 484 414 358 and 306 nm table 1 were observed in the spectra of the components every component had the excitation spectrum tailing well into the emission spectrum with a slight overlap supplementary fig s3 murphy et al 2013 the excitation and emission loadings of each component were compared to the spectra previously published in the openfluor online database and the description was determined based on spectra with corresponding tcc 0 95 table 1 three of the components c1 c2 and c3 are humic like with either terrestrial or anthropogenic origin while two components c4 and c5 are protein like materials with fluorescence peak positions resembling those of tryptophan like and tyrosine like fluorophores respectively the standard deviation of the maximum fluorescence intensities fmax of the five components from duplicate measurements of a sample ranged between 0 01 4 89 with average values of 0 29 0 32 0 86 0 75 and 1 03 for c1 c2 c3 c4 and c5 respectively after the five component model was validated the seasonal and spatial variability in dom in phong river was tracked using their fmax the fmax provides information regarding relative concentrations of each component in the water however the direct comparison in the concentrations of each component was not possible due to an unknown quantum efficiency of each fluorophore baghoth et al 2011 the fmax values of the five components of the raw water at each sampling location along phong river varied greatly in 2020 supplementary fig s4 with lower fmax values observed during from january to may and elevated fmax values from july to september the fluctuation of fmax in the three humic like components was greater than that of the two protein like components water samples at hs upstream unpolluted water had lower fmax values compared to other sampling locations supplementary fig s4 the highest fmax values of c1 and c2 were observed at location ps in september ps is the sampling location impacted by agricultural activities municipalities and industrial discharge ps also had the highest annual average doc concentration 7 2 mg l supplementary table s2 the highest fmax values of c3 and c4 were observed in july at kt which is the wtp farthest downstream in jul average rainfall 5 04 mm day thai meteorological department c5 presented the lowest fmax across sampling locations and seasons the annual average fmax of the five components indicates that the raw water of phong river is enriched in humic substances three humic like components c1 c2 and c3 contributed to 78 86 of the total fmax for the raw water while the protein like component c4 and c5 contributed to only 14 22 fig 2 this finding has also been confirmed in previous research characterizing dom in the phong river jutaporn et al 2021 prasert et al 2021 the average total fmax was lower at hs unpolluted water 20 3 ru then it gradually increased along the river as the river received discharge from agricultural activities municipalities and industries fig 2 thus fmax can be a good indicator for the level of contamination and effect from effluent discharge into the river the highest total fmax 31 4 ru was observed at ps then it decreased slightly to 30 6 ru at kt the trend of fmax increasing along the river and then slightly decreasing at kt was similar to that of doc fig 1c after miex treatment with an erd of 3 ml l fmax values decreased substantially the total fmax ranged from 5 9 8 2 ru and 5 7 7 6 ru for the waters treated by miex doc and miex gold resins respectively fig 2 a change in the dom composition was also observed after miex treatment and the two resins exhibited preferential removal of the humic like components 67 87 removal they also successfully removed protein like components to a lesser extent 5 61 removal consistent with previous studies jutaporn et al 2019 2020 miex treatment has been previously reported to preferentially remove hydrophobic dom and moderately remove hydrophilic dom phetrak et al 2016 singer and bilyk 2002 in this study miex treatment produced treated waters with lower hydrophobicity and were enriched in protein like dom from a microbial origin 3 4 changes of molecular level dom by unknown screening analysis during one sampling event in november 2020 the unknown screening analysis using orbitrap ms was conducted for the upstream unpolluted surface water hs and for the raw water of the wtps np and kt most of dom peaks were found in m z range below 500 in all the raw water samples indicating similar abundance of molecular dom along the phong river supplementary fig 5a s5c these observations were similar to a previous report of phong river dom prasert et al 2021 and several studies of dom in natural water analyzed by orbitrap ms na phatthalung et al 2021 phungsai et al 2018 rakruam et al 2021 yuthawong et al 2017 after treatment by miex doc and gold resins the pattern of dom mass spectra substantially changed supplementary fig 6 indicating the treatment affected molecular dom composition after molecular formula identification over 2000 dom features were assigned molecular formulae and the features with carbon hydrogen and oxygen heteroatom cho features were the most abundant class in all the water samples in terms of both number and absolute intensity supplementary figs 7 and s8 followed other heteroatom classes such as chon chocl chos and chons respectively the existence of chocl features in natural water lavonen et al 2013 prasert et al 2021 and in this river phungsai et al 2019 have been previously reported and can be attributed to natural gribble 2003 or anthropogenic chlorinated molecules the number supplementary figs 7a s7c and sum of absolute intensities supplementary figs s8a s8c of dom features decreased after miex treatments indicating removal of dom features sums of intensity in the samples pre treated by miex gold were relatively lower than those of miex doc in all three samples implying slightly better effect on molecular doc removal a result consistent with fmax and haloacetonitrile formation potential han fp removal levels to comprehensively analyze dissimilarities of those several thousand dom features multidimensional scaling was implemented using intensity of dom features in all the samples np and kt raw waters were clustered in a similar area fig 3 a while hs was distanced from those two samples this finding not only implies differences of molecular dom phungsai et al 2019 in hs which is an upstream sample compared to np and kt but also implies effects of changes of dom by activities above np and kt this is also consistent with slightly lower doc levels at hs compared to kt and np fig 1a in addition since locations np and kt were 62 7 km apart this similarity in dom features in the samples implies persistent dom presence along this stretch of the river large distances were found between raw water and water treated by miex doc and gold as well as after chlorination fig 3b and c thus miex treatment substantially affected dom features while chlorination moderately affected it comparing distances of dom features in chlorinated samples with and without treatments by miex fig 3c vs d the distances between them indicate differences in dom features including chlorinated dbps even if the number of dom features was not substantially changed by the treatments their absolute intensity was notably different after the treatment as water samples had similar matrices based on doc levels we analyzed changes with a semi quantitative approach using 30 change in intensity for dom features following each treatment in that analysis supplementary fig 9 over 600 cho features decreased or were totally removed by both miex doc and gold treatments while another nearly 600 features were refractory to both miex resins these observations were similarly found in all three raw waters indicating similar efficiency of miex resins to cho features in the phong river less than 100 features were uniquely decreased or totally removed by miex doc or gold hence the doc removal by both resins would likely be similar over the year fig 1a and c semiquantitative changes to cho features by miex gold in kt raw water as illustrated by van krevelen diagram dbe o c vs cos and kendrick mass plots fig 4 were similar to other samples supplementary fig 10 s12 according to the van krevelen diagram most of the condensed aromatic structures were totally removed or decreased by miex gold while lignin like features with higher o c values were totally removed or decreased fig 4a lipid like features were hardly adsorbed to miex gold consistent with the lower removal of protein like components compared to humic like components fig 2 those lipid like and lignin like refractory features were those with negative cos reduced molecules in fig 4b as those refractory features were less oxidized the number of oh functional groups would be limited and might not be able to be removed via anion exchange mechanisms in contrast positive cos features were decreased and more positive cos were totally removed by miex gold those higher degree of oxidation features would contain more oxygen acidic functional group resulting in more preference toward anion exchange dom removal by miex were not found selectivity on degree of unsaturation dbe o c by analyzing removal of cho features as illustrated by kendrick mass analysis in ch2 scale fig 4c it was found that cho features with lower nominal kendrick mass or a fewer number of ch2 were totally removed by miex treatment while higher numbers of ch2 were decreased or refractory to miex treatment in each alkylation series this observation indicates effects of ch2 chain on removals by miex treatment as longer chain associates with larger molecular size that were refractory to sorption by miex resin these observations were similar in both miex doc and gold and all the water samples supplementary fig 10 s12 allpike et al 2005 reported preferential removal of low molecular weight dom from 1 10 000 dalton by miex resin while our results imply more insight on preferentially removal of fewer ch2 molecules in alkylation families with more oxidized character 3 5 dbp formation potential and removal by miex similar to doc and fmax patterns the annual average trihalomethane formation potential thm fp of the raw water was lowest at the upstream hs location 324 μg l and generally increased downstream the river fig 5 a the highest annual average thm fp was found at location ps 451 μg l while at the farthest downstream location of kt the thm fp in the raw water of the wtp decreased slightly 391 μg l the decrease in thm fp indicates the lower concentration of precursors as the river flows from ps to kt distance 62 7 km this pattern can be attributed to self purification and lack of point source discharges over this stretch cf was the thm contributing the most to total thm fp accounting for 67 86 of the total thm fp of the raw waters comparable to other studies jutaporn et al 2021 ratpukdi et al 2019 considering all bimonthly samples the lowest thm fp was observed at hs in may 205 μg l while the highest thm fp was found at ps in july 789 μg l the annual average han fp of the untreated water was much lower than the thm fp fig 5b among all bimonthly samples the han fp of the untreated water ranged from 1 9 11 μg l lower han fp compared to thm fp was expected since tdn was lower than doc by approximately 10 fold fig 1a and b with 90 of the tdn being nitrates thus the fraction of organic nitrogen an important precursor of n dbps must be small for han speciation dcan accounted for the majority 77 97 of total han formed under chlorination similar to a previous study ratpukdi et al 2019 unlike the thm fp there was no significant difference p 0 05 in han fp of the raw waters among the sampling locations the miex treatment substantially decreased thm fp and han fp in all waters tested fig 5a and b the thm fp removal ranged from 51 84 and 54 89 following treatment with 3 ml l of miex doc and miex gold resins respectively the two resins preferentially removed precursors of cf as the average contribution of cf to total thm fp decreased from 79 in the untreated waters to 64 in the miex treated waters this result implies that dom remaining after miex treatment was more amenable to bromide substitution than the untreated dom there was no significant difference between the performance in thm fp removal by the two resins p 0 05 this result implies that the difference in pore size of the two resin had marginal impact on thm fp removal as confirmed in a previous study jutaporn et al 2020 the miex treatment also removed han fp but to the lesser extent han fp removal was in the range of 14 72 and 16 88 for miex doc and miex gold resins respectively the preferential removal of precursors of c dbps thms and haas over n dbps halonitromethanes and hans by miex resin was previously reported gan et al 2013 jutaporn et al 2020 kanan et al 2021 and is consistent with the lower removal of tryptophan and tyrosine like component c4 and c5 fig 2 fig 5 b shows that for hs np and ps waters the average han fp of the water treated by miex gold resin was slightly lower than that treated by miex doc resin kt water was the only case that han fp of the water treated by miex gold resin was higher than that treated by miex doc resin notably when the data from 30 experiments conducted for one year 5 sampling locations and 6 times of sampling was used for statistical analysis the han fp of the water treated by miex gold resin was significantly lower than that treated by miex doc resin mann whitney test p 0 05 the main precursors of n dbps are dissolved organic nitrogen e g amino acids and proteins which falls in the biopolymer category due to their greater molecular weight 20 000 g mol compared to humic acid 1000 g mol gibert et al 2013 the tryptophan like and tyrosine like dom were positively correlated with biopolymer fraction of dom baghoth et al 2011 since the two resins have the same functional group for dom removal and the only difference is the larger pore opening of miex gold resin 2 35 μm compared to 2 24 μm for miex doc jutaporn et al 2020 it can be deduced that the enlarged pore size can enhance han fp removal in miex gold resin further study on molecular size distribution of dom is needed to investigate whether miex gold resin can remove dom of the larger molecular size than miex doc resin during one sampling event in november 2020 the removal of thm fp and han fp by pacl coagulation and miex followed by coagulation was conducted for the water sources of the upstream and downstream wtps np and kt the optimum pacl doses as determined based on the point of diminishing returns for doc removal in jar test experiments were 40 mg l and 5 mg l for the raw waters and the miex treated waters respectively in these two raw waters 40 mg l pacl coagulation achieved 29 33 removal of thm fp fig 6 a which is similar to the removal efficiency of coagulation at the full scale wtps using the same water source jutaporn et al 2021 but lower than other water sources in thailand musikavong et al 2013 this behavior was owing to the nature of dom in the phong river in which the low suva makes coagulation relatively ineffective at dom removal the miex treatment outperformed coagulation in removal of thm fp 70 79 consistent with previous studies boyer and singer 2005 drikas et al 2003 this result is explained by the greater removal of humic substances by miex treatment compared to coagulation rucka et al 2020 the greater performance of miex is due to its capacity to adsorb both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds over a wide range of molecular weights singer and bilyk 2002 thus the miex treatment can remove dom recalcitrant to removal by coagulation with the miex treatment the coagulant demand was reduced from 40 to 5 mg l the benefit of miex treatment in reducing coagulant demand has been previously reported jarvis et al 2008 singer and bilyk 2002 moreover the additional thm fp removal attained after miex treatment by subsequent coagulation was minimal averaging an additional 0 1 2 8 which agrees well with previous studies drikas et al 2003 watson et al 2015 this indicates that pacl coagulation did not preferentially remove precursors of thms in this water source for han fp the removal efficiency ranged from 23 29 by coagulation 17 54 by miex doc and 30 64 by miex gold unlike thm fp removal the subsequent coagulation resulted in additional removal of han fp and this behavior was more evident in water from np upstream wtp fig 6b the combined treatment at np provided 46 and 34 additional removal of han fp after pretreatment by miex doc and miex gold respectively while only 4 and 3 additional removal of han fp was observed using water from kt downstream wtp this additional han fp removal in the combined treatment indicates that the precursors of hans have a larger molecular weight than that of thms and thus could not be effectively removed by miex treatment on the other hand coagulation predominantly removes dom with higher molecular weight drikas et al 2003 morran et al 2004 the han precursors remaining after miex treatment was more amendable to removal by coagulation overall these results suggest that including miex in the water treatment process at wtps using phong river as the water source can reduce the coagulant demand and improve the quality of treated water for both thms and hans we further investigated effects of chlorination on molecular dom from the samples pre treated by miex doc or gold without coagulation water chlorination substantially affected molecular dom since mass spectra patterns substantially changed supplementary figs 5d s5f over 1000 cho features were decreased or totally removed by chlorination of raw water and water previously treated by miex supplementary fig 13a numbers of decreased or totally removed cho features in all three chlorinated raw waters were higher than chlorinated samples pre treated by miex this finding indicates more cl2 reactive compounds or potential dbp precursors were present in the raw waters compared to samples treated by miex around 200 cho features were increased or newly formed considered as dbps in the samples pre treatment by miex supplementary fig 13a while only around 100 cho features were increased or newly formed in the chlorinated raw waters fig 7 reveals cho features changed by chlorination of kt samples with and without pre treatment by miex gold results for other samples are provided in supplementary fig 14 s16 it is apparent that chlorine unselectively reacted with most cho features in kt raw water fig 7a and b in contrast as shown in fig 7b and d only those molecules with fewer ch2 higher oxidation state and refractory to miex gold treatment fig 4b and c were reactive to chlorine fig 7b and d this observation implies the limitation of miex in removal of less oxidized dbp precursors in addition the cho dbps formed i e high cos in fig 7d after chlorination were the same formulae as those features removed previously by miex gold before chlorination hence those decreased or totally removed molecules would potentially contain cho features formed by chlorine but their removal by chlorine was faster this results in the intensity decreasing by less than 30 in summary cho dbp features were consisted primarily of positively oxidized and short ch2 chain molecules in addition to cho features almost 200 chocl features were increased or newly formed by chlorination supplementary fig 13b these chocl features were intermediate dbps with molecular weights ranging between 100 and 1000 da among the analytical range of orbitrap ms the numbers of chocl dbps in chlorinated raw waters were lower than samples pre treated by miex supplementary fig 12b as thm fp and han fp in raw waters were higher than the miex treated samples fig 5a and b raw waters would contain more thm and han precursors and less intermediate dbp precursors compared to the pre treated samples many chocl dbp features were commonly found in all chlorinated raw water samples fig 8 a this indicates the existence of identical dbp precursors found in all raw waters the hs sample contained the most unique chocl dbp features with 24 unique features fig 8a this is consistent with differences in dom features of hs compared to np and kt these 24 chocl dbp features would originate from unique precursors only found in hs samples and those precursors might be degraded along with the river comparing among water samples with and without miex treatments fig 8b d more than 100 chocl dbp features were found in all the samples with and without miex treatments suggesting formation of common dbps with their precursors unable to be removed by miex resins in addition around 60 dbps were uniquely formed in the chlorinated samples pre treated by miex resins and not found in chlorinated raw waters with fewer dom features available for chlorine in the pre treated samples unique dbp formation in the miex treated samples would be due to reactions of chlorine with other precursors left in the treated samples only around 30 chocl dbp features were formed in chlorinated raw waters and not formed in pre treated samples these dbps would originate from precursors which can be removed by miex treatments 4 conclusions in this study the spectroscopic characteristics molecular composition and reactivity of dom under chlorination before and after miex treatments provided the following insight into changes in dom quality and quantity with miex treatments for dom in thailand s phong river with and without miex treatment five statistically significant fluorescent components were obtained through parafac analysis in which three are humic like with a terrestrial or anthropogenic origin while two are protein like fluorophores the two resins showed preferential removal of humic like components over protein like components the miex treatment substantially removed doc and thm fp in all waters tested and removed han fp but to the lesser extent miex gold resin achieved greater han fp removal than miex doc resin owing to its larger pore opening the miex treatment outperformed coagulation in removal of thm fp the coagulant demand was decreased by eight times with miex pre treatment the thm fp removal attained after miex treatment by subsequent coagulation was minimal but 3 34 additional removal of han fp by subsequent coagulation was observed sum of intensities in the samples pre treated by miex gold were relatively lower than miex doc implying slightly better molecular dom removal the miex treatments removed condensed aromatic structures lignin like features with higher o c values lipid like features the miex treatment preferentially removed dom molecules with more oxidized and shorter chains the miex treatment could effectively decrease thm fp and han fp but numbers of intermediate dbps were higher in the samples pre treated by miex with some precursor removal by miex chlorine was available for other precursors remaining after miex treatments and formed unique dbps only found in miex pre treated samples overall types of dom humic like vs protein like molecular size carbon oxidation state and number of ch2 in dom features play important roles in the miex treatments and subsequent dbp formation under chlorination credit authorship

16058,the characteristics of dissolved organic matter dom play an important role in the formation and speciation of carcinogenic disinfection byproducts this study investigated changes in the

potential removal owing to its larger pore opening over 100 chocl dbp features were commonly found in all the samples while tens of chocl dbps were uniquely formed in the samples with and without pre treatments by miex treatments by miex before chlorination resulted in more intermediate chocl dbps formed after chlorination compared to chlorinated raw waters by optical spectroscopic analysis together with orbitrap ms molecular characterization we were able to confirm both quantitative and qualitative changes in dom properties by miex treatment related to dbp formation graphical abstract

chlorine at water treatment plants wtps and organic precursors primarily dissolved organic matter dom results in the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps dbps have been associated with adverse human health effects including and cancer gan et al 2013 singer and bilyk 2002 generally wtps can meet water quality standards and reduce human health risks from dbps by changing disinfection practices and or removing precursors prior to disinfection li and mitch 2018 due to the complex nature of dbp formation removal of precursors may be preferable to switching disinfectants and can be achieved via conventional treatments including coagulation and sand filtration however changes in raw water characteristics and expansion into impaired water sources have resulted in rising dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations evans et al 2005 that are outside the original design specifications of many existing wtps these changes in raw water have rendered conventional treatment at those wtps insufficient to satisfactorily remove dom and subsequent dbps in response additional treatment is often required to remove dom to achieve regulatory compliance for dbps in drinking water magnetic ion exchange miex resin is a strong base macroporous anion exchange resin with quaternary amide functional groups neale and schäfer 2009 that has been increasingly used for dbp precursor control first generation miex doc resin effectively removes dom including dbp precursors from various water sources and has been successfully employed in many full scale wtps arias paic et al 2016 gan et al 2013 second generation miex gold resin also has the same structure and functional group as miex doc resin but the average pore size of miex gold resin 2 35 µm is larger than that of miex doc resin 2 24 µm jutaporn et al 2020 the larger pore openings of miex gold resin can enhance the removal of high molecular weight doc miex gold resin performed better in doc removal at a full scale wtp gibson and golubovic 2015 and in bromide removal in a laboratory study soyluoglu et al 2020 while another laboratory study found similar performance between the two resins in terms of removal of doc and some dbp precursors jutaporn et al 2020 variability in the performance of these resins can be attributed to the complex and variable nature of dom specifically more study is needed to determine when the larger pores of miex gold resin would be beneficial and how miex treatment affects dom composition dom is a complex mixture of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons with various functional groups and a range of molecular weight bioavailability and reactivity lavonen et al 2015 characteristics of dom play an important role in the formation and speciation of dbps and in the performance of removal treatments however characterizing dom can be challenging fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem with parallel factor parafac analysis has been successfully used to characterize dom sources properties and efficacy of dom removal in wtps baghoth et al 2011 vera et al 2017 florescent proxies can be used to determine dom reactivity with chlorine and dbp formation potential dbp fp jutaporn et al 2020 maqbool et al 2020 pifer and fairey 2014 2012 the eem technique also has advantages of minimal sample preparation rapid measurement and suitability for online monitoring goffin et al 2019 non target unknown screening analysis by high resolution and accurate mass spectrometry hr am ms is another promising method for molecular characterization of dom in water from several thousand dom features with

optical properties and molecular composition of dom in one single study lavonen et al 2015 mangal et al 2017 and molecular characterization with non target analysis by orbitrap ms has not been conducted on miex treated samples accordingly this study aims to investigate the spectroscopic characteristics molecular composition and reactivity of dom before and after treatment with miex resins therefore we conducted experiments to compare precursors removal by miex resins using a wide range of water sources over a one year period parafac analysis was used to resolve the seasonal and spatial variability in dom fluorescence in the water sources and evaluate how dom quality changed with miex treatment compared to coagulation non target analysis using orbitrap mass spectrometry was also conducted to investigate the transformation of dom after chlorination and formation of unknown dbps with and without miex treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sampling water samples were collected from three sampling locations along the phong river and two raw water intakes of wtps in khon kaen province of thailand supplementary fig s1 the phong river is located in the northeastern region of thailand and is a major source for industrial agricultural and tap water supplies the 136 km river originates from ubol ratana dam and discharges to the chi river downstream of khon kaen city bimonthly grab samples 6 l were collected using pre cleaned high density polyethylene hdpe bottles over a period of one year in 2020 spanning the wet and dry seasons average rainfalls 0 0 1 37 and 4 70 6 97 mm day respectively thai meteorological department immediately after arrival at the laboratory removal of suspended solid was carried out using carbon free glass fiber filters gf f whatman with a nominal pore size cut off of 0 7 µm the filtered samples were stored at 4 c in the dark and were allowed to reach room temperature 25 3 c prior to miex contact experiments and water quality parameters analysis the sampling locations in the river include upstream unpolluted surface water hs surface water impacted by agricultural activities ms raw water of an upstream wtp impacted by agricultural activities and industrial discharge np surface water impacted by municipality and industrial discharge ps and a downstream wtp kt the two wtps including the upstream np capacity 25 100

to evaluate adsorptive characteristics of dom by miex resin the miex contact dbp formation potential dbp fp experiments and fluorescence eem measurement were conducted on every sample the coagulation experiments and the molecular characterization of dom and unknown dbps analysis by orbitrap ms were done for the samples collected in november 2 2 miex contact experiments miex doc and miex gold resins were obtained from ixom australia the resins were stored in 5 nacl solution and were rinsed throughout with di water before use the two resins contain quaternary amide functional groups with a magnetic content of 20 25 w w and their particle size in the range of 100 400 µm ixom watercare 2019 the ion exchange capacity of miex gold resin 0 4 0 55 meq ml is slightly higher than that of miex doc resin 0 4 0 5 meq ml soyluoglu et al 2020 for isotherm study resin contact experiments were conducted using 1 10 ml l resin in january 2020 then the mixing time of 30 min and the effective resin dose erd of 3 ml l was chosen based on the preliminary doc removal results from jar test experiments as no further doc removal was achieved when the mixing time was extended beyond 30 min and with the resin dose greater than 3 ml l supplementary fig 2 the 30 min contact time was used in previously miex studies chen et al 2019 johnson and singer 2004 the erd of 3 ml l is equivalent to 333 bed volume bv treatment which is slightly higher than 400 600 bv in practice for the treatment of drinking water when operated in continuous mode gibson and golubovic 2015 but it is in the same range with other studies conducted in batch operation 2 10 ml l rajca et al 2017a singer and bilyk 2002 the determined erd was used for the rest of the resin contact experiments coagulation using pacl was also conducted in november 2020 to compare profiles of coagulated dom and miex treated dom following a procedure reported by singer and bilyk 2002 the optimum coagulant doses of 40 mg l for raw water and 5 mg l for miex treated water were determined by jar test experiments the treated water was filtered again with gf f to remove any fine resin beads that might interfere with the analysis for each sample the resin experiments were conducted in duplicate and the average value was reported 2 3 water quality parameters analysis the water samples were measured for their ph ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uva254 dissolved organic carbon doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn after suspended solid removal uva254 was measured with dr6000 spectrophotometer hach usa doc and tdn concentrations were acquired using multi n c 2100 toc analyzer analytik jena ag germany then specific uv absorbance suva was calculated as the uva254 value normalized to doc concentration of the respective sample for formation potential fp tests water samples before and after miex treatment were chlorinated using sodium hypochlorite naocl loba chemie pvt ltd according to the uniform formation conditions ufc method summers et al 1996 the residual free chlorine after 24 h incubation at 20 c was measured using a portable colorimeter ii hach dr300 usa the samples with the residual chlorine of 1 0 2 mg l were selected for liquid liquid extraction with methyl tert butyl ether mtbe and dbp analysis following u s epa method 551 1 with slight modification ratpukdi et al 2019 us epa 1995 the details of the analytical procedure for dbps can be found in a previous study jutaporn et al 2021 four thms including chloroform cf bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm bromoform bf were selected as representative of regulated carbonaceous dbps c dbps three haloacetonitriles hans including dichloroacetonitrile dcan trichloroacetonitrile tcan and dibromoacetonitrile dban were also selected as a representative of nitrogenous dbps n dbps all samples were extracted and analyzed by gc ecd in duplicates the average values and standard deviations from four measurements were reported 2 4 parafac modeling dom in the samples was characterized using fluorescence eem for which the spectra was collected using fp 8200 spectrofluorometer jasco by scanning excitation wavelengths from 200 to 500 nm in 5 nm intervals and emission wavelengths from 250 to 550 nm in 1 nm intervals the sample eems were corrected for its instrument specific and inner filtering effect blank subtracted and normalized to the area under the water raman peak reporting eem data in raman units ru nm 1 according to a procedure previously reported poojamnong et al 2020 all samples were analyzed in duplicate and average values were reported parafac analysis was applied to decompose the eem dataset into individual components for the raw waters parafac resolved the seasonal and spatial variability in fluorescent dom in the river to account for impacts from agricultural municipal and industrial effluent discharge parafac analysis was used to track changes in the dom composition after miex treatment to associate dom components with dbp fp the parafac model was developed using matlab r2016a mathworks and domfluor toolbox following the procedure by stedmon and bro 2008 briefly the steps in developing of parafac model from the corrected eems include 1 scatter removal eliminating of ex 250 nm rayleigh and raman scatter peaks 2 outlier analysis by examination of loading and leverage plots 3 preliminary model development 4 model validation through split half analysis and random initialization 5 quantitative comparison of the components spectra with openfluor online database murphy et al 2014 after 4 outliers from instrumentational error were determined and removed the total number of eems in the model were 208 including 56 eems from raw samples 140 eems from miex treated samples 4 eems from coagulated samples and 8 eems from miex coagulated samples 2 5 unknown screening analysis for unknown screening analysis dom in 500 ml of each sample and deionized water di water as a blank was concentrated by solid phase extraction method using bond elut ppl cartridge 3 ml with 500 mg of sorbent agilent technologies santa clara ca usa this cartridge has achieved high levels of dom recovery during extraction from the phong river using procedures described in prasert et al 2021 the dom adsorbed on the cartridge was slowly eluted by 10 ml of meoh and the extracts were stored at 20 c in darkness doc recovery was measured from 1 ml of the extracts meoh was dried from the extracts using laminar flow of high purity nitrogen gas and the extracted dom was redissolved in di water using sonication the doc recovery was calculated from doc in the extract divided by doc in the samples doc recoveries in this study were in the range of 40 76 supplementary table s1 si which is comparable to previously reported ranges dittmar et al 2008 the extracted samples and di extracted blank were analyzed by orbitrap mass spectrometry q exactive plus thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa at

thermo fisher scientific in triplicates electrospray ionization was conducted in negative mode and full scan mass range was 100 1000 m z we followed analytical conditions optimized by urai et al 2014

ensure identification only formula assigned features with isotopes 13c1 12cn 1 were allowed for further analysis features with chlorine atom also further validated its identification with existences of its 37cl isotope peak intensities of features in each sample were used to analyze dissimilarity using multidimensional scaling mds in ibm spss statistics 28 0 ibm armonk ny usa distances among the samples were calculated by euclidean distance and more distance among the samples imply their dissimilarity molecular characteristics were calculated from numbers of atoms in each sample including

kendrick mass analysis using ch2 scale for alkylation families were also applied and calculated from eqs 4 and 5 changes of dom features were analyzed semi quantitatively using 30 of intensity changes

and suva of the water from the five sampling locations ranged from 5 7 to 7 2 mg c l and 1 66 to 2 81 l mg m respectively and generally increased with distance from the origin supplementary table s2 the increase of doc and suva along the river indicates that the dissolved aromatic carbon content of dom increased with the impacts from effluent discharge seasonal variations of doc and tdn concentrations in raw water samples indicated highest concentrations typically occurred in july fig 1 a and b the highest and lowest annual average doc concentrations were at locations ps 7 19 mg l and at kt 5 71 mg l respectively overall even the highest downstream suva values were still lower than that of other water sources in the other regions of thailand 3 1 3 4 l mg m tongchang et al 2018 the high doc and the low suva characteristics of the phong river suggest that coagulation has limited ability to remove the dom archer and singer 2006 based on the point of diminishing returns for doc removal in preliminary experiments assessing the effect of resin dose supplementary fig 2 an erd of 3 ml l was chosen for the study fitting of the doc removal data found showed that the freundlich isotherm described the data well r2 0 81 0 98 text s1 and supplementary table s3 with the erd of 3 ml l and the contact time of 30 min the two resins effectively removed doc from the raw waters doc of the miex treated water was reduced by 51 80 average 62 7 1 and 50 78 average 61 7 3 for miex doc and gold resins respectively fig 1c the high doc removal efficiency observed in this study across variable initial doc concentrations was consistent with previous studies doederer et al 2018 rajca et al 2017b there was no significant difference p 0 05 between doc removal efficiency of the two resins compared to low doc removal achieved by pacl coagulation at wtps 10 in a previous study jutaporn et al 2021 the effectiveness of the resins for the removal of doc suggests a potential benefit of using miex treatment for this water source the concentration of tdn fluctuated more than doc fig 1b the tdn concentration of the raw waters ranged from 0 60 1 29 mg l which was a twofold variation nitrate contributed to more than 90 of tdn in all samples which indicates that complete nitrification has taken place the sampling locations with the highest and lowest annual average tdn concentration were at ps 1 06 mg l and at ms 0 79 mg l respectively the ps sampling location was impacted from both municipal and industrial effluent discharges the highest annual average doc concentration was also observed at this location with the erd of 3 ml l treatment by miex doc and gold resins achieved tdn removal in the range of 17 55 annual average 34 7 8 and 16 55 annual average 36 9 3 respectively fig 1d thus the two miex resins were moderately effective in tdn removal across all the samples independent of their initial tdn concentration and the season there was no significant difference between the tdn removal efficiency of the two resins p 0 05 additionally the two resins exhibited greater removal efficiency for doc compared to tdn p 0 05 in agreement with previous research gan et al 2013 3 3 monitoring dom changes using eem parafac analysis out of the dataset containing 212 eems generated from raw miex treated and coagulated waters four outliers from instrument error or artifacts were identified and removed parafac models with 2 7 components were initially explored and a five component model was validated for a range of treatment conditions using four way split half validation and random initialization stedmon and bro 2008 the split half validations showed that the excitation and emission loadings between the complete dataset and one of the independent halves of the five component model significantly overlapped with tucker s congruence coefficients tcc 0 95 supplementary fig s3 indicating five is the proper number of components for this dataset residual eems of the five component model contained no distinctive peak and explained more than 99 6 of the variance the residual sum of squares error sse in both the excitation and emission dimensions was 86 10 for the random initialization of five component model each component exhibited typical spectral features of a true fluorophore for example multiple distinct emission peaks 410 484 414 358 and 306 nm table 1 were observed in the spectra of the components every component had the excitation spectrum tailing well into the emission spectrum with a slight overlap supplementary fig s3 murphy et al 2013 the excitation and emission loadings of each component were compared to the spectra previously published in the openfluor online database and the description was determined based on spectra with corresponding tcc 0 95 table 1 three of the components c1 c2 and c3 are humic like with either terrestrial or anthropogenic origin while two components c4 and c5 are protein like materials with fluorescence peak positions resembling those of tryptophan like and tyrosine like fluorophores respectively the standard deviation of the maximum fluorescence intensities fmax of the five components from duplicate measurements of a sample ranged between 0 01 4 89 with average values of 0 29 0 32 0 86 0 75 and 1 03 for c1 c2 c3 c4 and c5 respectively after the five component model was validated the seasonal and spatial variability in dom in phong river was tracked using their fmax the fmax provides information regarding relative concentrations of each component in the water however the direct comparison in the concentrations of each component was not possible due to an unknown quantum efficiency of each fluorophore baghoth et al 2011 the fmax values of the five components of the raw water at each sampling location along phong river varied greatly in 2020 supplementary fig s4 with lower fmax values observed during from january to may and elevated fmax values from july to september the fluctuation of fmax in the three humic like components was greater than that of the two protein like components water samples at hs upstream unpolluted water had lower fmax values compared to other sampling locations supplementary fig s4 the highest fmax values of c1 and c2 were observed at location ps in september ps is the sampling location impacted by agricultural activities municipalities and industrial discharge ps also had the highest annual average doc concentration 7 2 mg l supplementary table s2 the highest fmax values of c3 and c4 were observed in july at kt which is the wtp farthest downstream in jul average rainfall 5 04 mm day thai meteorological department c5 presented the lowest fmax across sampling locations and seasons the annual average fmax of the five components indicates that the raw water of phong river is enriched in humic substances three humic like components c1 c2 and c3 contributed to 78 86 of the total fmax for the raw water while the protein like component c4 and c5 contributed to only 14 22 fig 2 this finding has also been confirmed in previous research characterizing dom in the phong river jutaporn et al 2021 prasert et al 2021 the average total fmax was lower at hs unpolluted water 20 3 ru then it gradually increased along the river as the river received discharge from agricultural activities municipalities and industries fig 2 thus fmax can be a good indicator for the level of contamination and effect from effluent discharge into the river the highest total fmax 31 4 ru was observed at ps then it decreased slightly to 30 6 ru at kt the trend of fmax increasing along the river and then slightly decreasing at kt was similar to that of doc fig 1c after miex treatment with an erd of 3 ml l fmax values decreased substantially the total fmax ranged from 5 9 8 2 ru and 5 7 7 6 ru for the waters treated by miex doc and miex gold resins respectively fig 2 a change in the dom composition was also observed after miex treatment and the two resins exhibited preferential removal of the humic like components 67 87 removal they also successfully removed protein like components to a lesser extent 5 61 removal consistent with previous studies jutaporn et al 2019 2020 miex treatment has been previously reported to preferentially remove hydrophobic dom and moderately remove hydrophilic dom phetrak et al 2016 singer and bilyk 2002 in this study miex treatment produced treated waters with lower hydrophobicity and were enriched in protein like dom from a microbial origin 3 4 changes of molecular level dom by unknown screening analysis during one sampling event in november 2020 the unknown screening analysis using orbitrap ms was conducted for the upstream unpolluted surface water hs and for the raw water of the wtps np and kt most of dom peaks were found in m z range below 500 in all the raw water samples indicating similar abundance of molecular dom along the phong river supplementary fig 5a s5c these observations were similar to a previous report of phong river dom prasert et al 2021 and several studies of dom in natural water analyzed by orbitrap ms na phatthalung et al 2021 phungsai et al 2018 rakruam et al 2021 yuthawong et al 2017 after treatment by miex doc and gold resins the pattern of dom mass spectra substantially changed supplementary fig 6 indicating the treatment affected molecular dom composition after molecular formula identification over 2000 dom features were assigned molecular formulae and the features with carbon hydrogen and oxygen heteroatom cho features were the most abundant class in all the water samples in terms of both number and absolute intensity supplementary figs 7 and s8 followed other heteroatom classes such as chon chocl chos and chons respectively the existence of chocl features in natural water lavonen et al 2013 prasert et al 2021 and in this river phungsai et al 2019 have been previously reported and can be attributed to natural gribble 2003 or anthropogenic chlorinated molecules the number supplementary figs 7a s7c and sum of absolute intensities supplementary figs s8a s8c of dom features decreased after miex treatments indicating removal of dom features sums of intensity in the samples pre treated by miex gold were relatively lower than those of miex doc in all three samples implying slightly better effect on molecular doc removal a result consistent with fmax and haloacetonitrile formation potential han fp removal levels to comprehensively analyze dissimilarities of those several thousand dom features multidimensional scaling was implemented using intensity of dom features in all the samples np and kt raw waters were clustered in a similar area fig 3 a while hs was distanced from those two samples this finding not only implies differences of molecular dom phungsai et al 2019 in hs which is an upstream sample compared to np and kt but also implies effects of changes of dom by activities above np and kt this is also consistent with slightly lower doc levels at hs compared to kt and np fig 1a in addition since locations np and kt were 62 7 km apart this similarity in dom features in the samples implies persistent dom presence along this stretch of the river large distances were found between raw water and water treated by miex doc and gold as well as after chlorination fig 3b and c thus miex treatment substantially affected dom features while chlorination moderately affected it comparing distances of dom features in chlorinated samples with and without treatments by miex fig 3c vs d the distances between them indicate differences in dom features including chlorinated dbps even if the number of dom features was not substantially changed by the treatments their absolute intensity was notably different after the treatment as water samples had similar matrices based on doc levels we analyzed changes with a semi quantitative approach using 30 change in intensity for dom features following each treatment in that analysis supplementary fig 9 over 600 cho features decreased or were totally removed by both miex doc and gold treatments while another nearly 600 features were refractory to both miex resins these observations were similarly found in all three raw waters indicating similar efficiency of miex resins to cho features in the phong river less than 100 features were uniquely decreased or totally removed by miex doc or gold hence the doc removal by both resins would likely be similar over the year fig 1a and c semiquantitative changes to cho features by miex gold in kt raw water as illustrated by van krevelen diagram dbe o c vs cos and kendrick mass plots fig 4 were similar to other samples supplementary fig 10 s12 according to the van krevelen diagram most of the condensed aromatic structures were totally removed or decreased by miex gold while lignin like features with higher o c values were totally removed or decreased fig 4a lipid like features were hardly adsorbed to miex gold consistent with the lower removal of protein like components compared to humic like components fig 2 those lipid like and lignin like refractory features were those with negative cos reduced molecules in fig 4b as those refractory features were less oxidized the number of oh functional groups would be limited and might not be able to be removed via anion exchange mechanisms in contrast positive cos features were decreased and more positive cos were totally removed by miex gold those higher degree of oxidation features would contain more oxygen acidic functional group resulting in more preference toward anion exchange dom removal by miex were not found selectivity on degree of unsaturation dbe o c by analyzing removal of cho features as illustrated by kendrick mass analysis in ch2 scale fig 4c it was found that cho features with lower nominal kendrick mass or a fewer number of ch2 were totally removed by miex treatment while higher numbers of ch2 were decreased or refractory to miex treatment in each alkylation series this observation indicates effects of ch2 chain on removals by miex treatment as longer chain associates with larger molecular size that were refractory to sorption by miex resin these observations were similar in both miex doc and gold and all the water samples supplementary fig 10 s12 allpike et al 2005 reported preferential removal of low molecular weight dom from 1 10 000 dalton by miex resin while our results imply more insight on preferentially removal of fewer ch2 molecules in alkylation families with more oxidized character 3 5 dbp formation potential and removal by miex similar to doc and fmax patterns the annual average trihalomethane formation potential thm fp of the raw water was lowest at the upstream hs location 324 μg l and generally increased downstream the river fig 5 a the highest annual average thm fp was found at location ps 451 μg l while at the farthest downstream location of kt the thm fp in the raw water of the wtp decreased slightly 391 μg l the decrease in thm fp indicates the lower concentration of precursors as the river flows from ps to kt distance 62 7 km this pattern can be attributed to self purification and lack of point source discharges over this stretch cf was the thm contributing the most to total thm fp accounting for 67 86 of the total thm fp of the raw waters comparable to other studies jutaporn et al 2021 ratpukdi et al 2019 considering all bimonthly samples the lowest thm fp was observed at hs in may 205 μg l while the highest thm fp was found at ps in july 789 μg l the annual average han fp of the untreated water was much lower than the thm fp fig 5b among all bimonthly samples the han fp of the untreated water ranged from 1 9 11 μg l lower han fp compared to thm fp was expected since tdn was lower than doc by approximately 10 fold fig 1a and b with 90 of the tdn being nitrates thus the fraction of organic nitrogen an important precursor of n dbps must be small for han speciation dcan accounted for the majority 77 97 of total han formed under chlorination similar to a previous study ratpukdi et al 2019 unlike the thm fp there was no significant difference p 0 05 in han fp of the raw waters among the sampling locations the miex treatment substantially decreased thm fp and han fp in all waters tested fig 5a and b the thm fp removal ranged from 51 84 and 54 89 following treatment with 3 ml l of miex doc and miex gold resins respectively the two resins preferentially removed precursors of cf as the average contribution of cf to total thm fp decreased from 79 in the untreated waters to 64 in the miex treated waters this result implies that dom remaining after miex treatment was more amenable to bromide substitution than the untreated dom there was no significant difference between the performance in thm fp removal by the two resins p 0 05 this result implies that the difference in pore size of the two resin had marginal impact on thm fp removal as confirmed in a previous study jutaporn et al 2020 the miex treatment also removed han fp but to the lesser extent han fp removal was in the range of 14 72 and 16 88 for miex doc and miex gold resins respectively the preferential removal of precursors of c dbps thms and haas over n dbps halonitromethanes and hans by miex resin was previously reported gan et al 2013 jutaporn et al 2020 kanan et al 2021 and is consistent with the lower removal of tryptophan and tyrosine like component c4 and c5 fig 2 fig 5 b shows that for hs np and ps waters the average han fp of the water treated by miex gold resin was slightly lower than that treated by miex doc resin kt water was the only case that han fp of the water treated by miex gold resin was higher than that treated by miex doc resin notably when the data from 30 experiments conducted for one year 5 sampling locations and 6 times of sampling was used for statistical analysis the han fp of the water treated by miex gold resin was significantly lower than that treated by miex doc resin mann whitney test p 0 05 the main precursors of n dbps are dissolved organic nitrogen e g amino acids and proteins which falls in the biopolymer category due to their greater molecular weight 20 000 g mol compared to humic acid 1000 g mol gibert et al 2013 the tryptophan like and tyrosine like dom were positively correlated with biopolymer fraction of dom baghoth et al 2011 since the two resins have the same functional group for dom removal and the only difference is the larger pore opening of miex gold resin 2 35 μm compared to 2 24 μm for miex doc jutaporn et al 2020 it can be deduced that the enlarged pore size can enhance han fp removal in miex gold resin further study on molecular size distribution of dom is needed to investigate whether miex gold resin can remove dom of the larger molecular size than miex doc resin during one sampling event in november 2020 the removal of thm fp and han fp by pacl coagulation and miex followed by coagulation was conducted for the water sources of the upstream and downstream wtps np and kt the optimum pacl doses as determined based on the point of diminishing returns for doc removal in jar test experiments were 40 mg l and 5 mg l for the raw waters and the miex treated waters respectively in these two raw waters 40 mg l pacl coagulation achieved 29 33 removal of thm fp fig 6 a which is similar to the removal efficiency of coagulation at the full scale wtps using the same water source jutaporn et al 2021 but lower than other water sources in thailand musikavong et al 2013 this behavior was owing to the nature of dom in the phong river in which the low suva makes coagulation relatively ineffective at dom removal the miex treatment outperformed coagulation in removal of thm fp 70 79 consistent with previous studies boyer and singer 2005 drikas et al 2003 this result is explained by the greater removal of humic substances by miex treatment compared to coagulation rucka et al 2020 the greater performance of miex is due to its capacity to adsorb both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds over a wide range of molecular weights singer and bilyk 2002 thus the miex treatment can remove dom recalcitrant to removal by coagulation with the miex treatment the coagulant demand was reduced from 40 to 5 mg l the benefit of miex treatment in reducing coagulant demand has been previously reported jarvis et al 2008 singer and bilyk 2002 moreover the additional thm fp removal attained after miex treatment by subsequent coagulation was minimal averaging an additional 0 1 2 8 which agrees well with previous studies drikas et al 2003 watson et al 2015 this indicates that pacl coagulation did not preferentially remove precursors of thms in this water source for han fp the removal efficiency ranged from 23 29 by coagulation 17 54 by miex doc and 30 64 by miex gold unlike thm fp removal the subsequent coagulation resulted in additional removal of han fp and this behavior was more evident in water from np upstream wtp fig 6b the combined treatment at np provided 46 and 34 additional removal of han fp after pretreatment by miex doc and miex gold respectively while only 4 and 3 additional removal of han fp was observed using water from kt downstream wtp this additional han fp removal in the combined treatment indicates that the precursors of hans have a larger molecular weight than that of thms and thus could not be effectively removed by miex treatment on the other hand coagulation predominantly removes dom with higher molecular weight drikas et al 2003 morran et al 2004 the han precursors remaining after miex treatment was more amendable to removal by coagulation overall these results suggest that including miex in the water treatment process at wtps using phong river as the water source can reduce the coagulant demand and improve the quality of treated water for both thms and hans we further investigated effects of chlorination on molecular dom from the samples pre treated by miex doc or gold without coagulation water chlorination substantially affected molecular dom since mass spectra patterns substantially changed supplementary figs 5d s5f over 1000 cho features were decreased or totally removed by chlorination of raw water and water previously treated by miex supplementary fig 13a numbers of decreased or totally removed cho features in all three chlorinated raw waters were higher than chlorinated samples pre treated by miex this finding indicates more cl2 reactive compounds or potential dbp precursors were present in the raw waters compared to samples treated by miex around 200 cho features were increased or newly formed considered as dbps in the samples pre treatment by miex supplementary fig 13a while only around 100 cho features were increased or newly formed in the chlorinated raw waters fig 7 reveals cho features changed by chlorination of kt samples with and without pre treatment by miex gold results for other samples are provided in supplementary fig 14 s16 it is apparent that chlorine unselectively reacted with most cho features in kt raw water fig 7a and b in contrast as shown in fig 7b and d only those molecules with fewer ch2 higher oxidation state and refractory to miex gold treatment fig 4b and c were reactive to chlorine fig 7b and d this observation implies the limitation of miex in removal of less oxidized dbp precursors in addition the cho dbps formed i e high cos in fig 7d after chlorination were the same formulae as those features removed previously by miex gold before chlorination hence those decreased or totally removed molecules would potentially contain cho features formed by chlorine but their removal by chlorine was faster this results in the intensity decreasing by less than 30 in summary cho dbp features were consisted primarily of positively oxidized and short ch2 chain molecules in addition to cho features almost 200 chocl features were increased or newly formed by chlorination supplementary fig 13b these chocl features were intermediate dbps with molecular weights ranging between 100 and 1000 da among the analytical range of orbitrap ms the numbers of chocl dbps in chlorinated raw waters were lower than samples pre treated by miex supplementary fig 12b as thm fp and han fp in raw waters were higher than the miex treated samples fig 5a and b raw waters would contain more thm and han precursors and less intermediate dbp precursors compared to the pre treated samples many chocl dbp features were commonly found in all chlorinated raw water samples fig 8 a this indicates the existence of identical dbp precursors found in all raw waters the hs sample contained the most unique chocl dbp features with 24 unique features fig 8a this is consistent with differences in dom features of hs compared to np and kt these 24 chocl dbp features would originate from unique precursors only found in hs samples and those precursors might be degraded along with the river comparing among water samples with and without miex treatments fig 8b d more than 100 chocl dbp features were found in all the samples with and without miex treatments suggesting formation of common dbps with their precursors unable to be removed by miex resins in addition around 60 dbps were uniquely formed in the chlorinated samples pre treated by miex resins and not found in chlorinated raw waters with fewer dom features available for chlorine in the pre treated samples unique dbp formation in the miex treated samples would be due to reactions of chlorine with other precursors left in the treated samples only around 30 chocl dbp features were formed in chlorinated raw waters and not formed in pre treated samples these dbps would originate from precursors which can be removed by miex treatments 4 conclusions in this study the spectroscopic characteristics molecular composition and reactivity of dom under chlorination before and after miex treatments provided the following insight into changes in dom quality and quantity with miex treatments for dom in thailand s phong river with and without miex treatment five statistically significant fluorescent components were obtained through parafac analysis in which three are humic like with a terrestrial or anthropogenic origin while two are protein like fluorophores the two resins showed preferential removal of humic like components over protein like components the miex treatment substantially removed doc and thm fp in all waters tested and removed han fp but to the lesser extent miex gold resin achieved greater han fp removal than miex doc resin owing to its larger pore opening the miex treatment outperformed coagulation in removal of thm fp the coagulant demand was decreased by eight times with miex pre treatment the thm fp removal attained after miex treatment by subsequent coagulation was minimal but 3 34 additional removal of han fp by subsequent coagulation was observed sum of intensities in the samples pre treated by miex gold were relatively lower than miex doc implying slightly better molecular dom removal the miex treatments removed condensed aromatic structures lignin like features with higher o c values lipid like features the miex treatment preferentially removed dom molecules with more oxidized and shorter chains the miex treatment could effectively decrease thm fp and han fp but numbers of intermediate dbps were higher in the samples pre treated by miex with some precursor removal by miex chlorine was available for other precursors remaining after miex treatments and formed unique dbps only found in miex pre treated samples overall types of dom humic like vs protein like molecular size carbon oxidation state and number of ch2 in dom features play important roles in the miex treatments and subsequent dbp formation under chlorination credit authorship

16059,the possibility of stimulating direct interspecies electron transfer diet within aggregates of methanogenic digesters respectively with ethanol glycol and glycerol as a primary substrate was investigated to better understand the mechanisms of alcohol compounds stimulating diet aggregates fed with ethanol glycol and glycerol were electrically conductive 10 4 19 4 us cm with a temperature dependence of metallic like conductivity close examination of transmission electron microscope images observed the potential interspecies connected networks assembled by filaments within these aggregates further investigations via metatranscriptomics found that genes for electrically conductive pili e pili log2fpkm 9 39 10 96 and c type cytochromes 8 90 9 64 were highly expressed within aggregates glycerol fed aggregates exhibited the highest gene expression for e pili while glycol fed aggregates exhibited the highest gene expression for c type cytochromes methanothrix species were dominant and metabolically active within aggregates genes encoding the enzymes involved in carbon dioxide reduction were highly expressed in methanothrix species suggesting that they participated in diet in addition transcript abundance of genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenase and nadh quinone oxidoreductase in alcohol dehydrogenation closely associated with nadh nad transformation within glycol and glycerol fed aggregates was generally higher than that within ethanol fed aggregates these results and the fact that nadh nad transformation was very linked to the atp synthesis complex that further supported the formation of extracellular electrical connection components e pili and membrane bound multi heme c type cytochromes mhcs provided a possibility that alcohol compounds comprised of hydroxy groups could stimulate diet and more hydroxy groups comprised were better for this stimulation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords direct interspecies electron transfer electrically conductive aggregates glycol glycerol metatranscriptomics alcohol dehydrogenation 1 introduction recent discovery that electron donating syntrophs and electron accepting methanogens exchange electrons via direct interspecies electron transfer diet is a revolutionary event for anaerobic digestion rotaru et al 2014a 2014b one of the few large scale bio energy strategies appels et al 2011 holm nielsen et al 2009 diet challenges the long held over the past more than 50 years hypothesis that electron transfer from syntrophs to methanogens primarily depends on diffusion of electron carrying molecules hydrogen and formate bryant et al 1967 dong and stams 1995 stams and plugge 2009 trafficking in hydrogen or formate is a relatively slow and close range way felchner zwirello et al 2012 ishii et al 2005 no engineering strategy to speed up interspecies hydrogen or formate transfer is readily apparent in contrast diet mediated by electrically conductive pili e pili ueki et al 2018 or membrane bound multi heme c type cytochromes mhcs liu et al 2018 provides rapider and long range electron transport lovley 2017 zhao et al 2020d more excitingly engineering strategies for designing the novel digesters to encourage diet have been practiced zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2020d for instance the inclusion of carbon based conductive materials serving as electron conduits to promote diet can dramatically improve the performances and stability of anaerobic digestion zhao et al 2020d however the application of carbon based conductive materials is still limited by material types and sizes addition modes and economic evaluations zhao et al 2020d initially feeding digesters with ethanol seems likely to be another strategy for enhancing anaerobic digestion via promoting diet zhao et al 2016a 2016b digesters initially developed with ethanol enriched dieters formed highly conductive aggregates and metabolized subsequent propionate and butyrate faster than that without ethanol zhao et al 2016b despite that the mechanisms of ethanol stimulating diet within aggregates are still enigmatic engineering strategies of initially pretreating organic wastes to produce ethanol for sustaining diet have been documented in laboratory and large scale digesters for a diversity of organic wastes li et al 2020 zhao and zhang 2019 zhao et al 2017b 2018 2020a zhao et al 2020b zhu et al 2019 metagenomics was previously conducted to reveal the potential diet based syntrophic metabolism within ethanol fed aggregates zhao et al 2020b remarkably the abundance of pila gene known to encode the type iv pilin monomer protein pila assembling geobacter sulfurreducens e pili lovley et al 2020 dramatically increased zhao et al 2020b suggesting that ethanol stimulated dieters to produce more e pili the formation of extracellular electrical connection components usually consumes the cell energy of dieters liu et al 2012 which depends on the atp synthesis complex driving the transport of protons via transmembrane gradient of proton remarkably metatranscriptomic analysis in a co culture of g metallireducens with methanothrix harundinacea found that the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde ethanol dehydrogenation in g metallireducens proceeded the transformation of nadh nad by alcohol dehydrogenase and nadh quinone oxidoreductase rotaru et al 2014a the transformation of nadh nad is very linked to the transport of protons and electron bird et al 2011 therefore proceeding nadh nad transformation may stimulate atp synthesis complex that further supports the formation of extracellular electrical connection components this is most likely an important mechanism of stimulating diet within aggregates in the presence of ethanol warranting further investigations the function of nadh nad transformation by alcohol dehydrogenase and nadh quinone oxidoreductase in stimulating diet within ethanol fed aggregates is readily apparent rotaru et al 2014a therefore it is reasonably assumed that other alcohol compounds comprised of hydroxy groups are also capable of stimulating diet within aggregates similar to the function of ethanol one potential evidence to support this hypothesis was that study zhao et al 2017a in a semi continuous digester with butanol as a primary substrate found that methanothrix species were dominant and geobacter species accounted for approximately 10 of the bacterial communities another potential evidence was that study mei et al 2018 in an up flow packed bed digester treating fructose and polyethylene glycol found that the novel species of geobacter bin gac1 were dominant and metabolically active containing the genes for e pili and c type cytochromes however both studies ignored the possibility that alcohol compounds comprised of hydroxy groups could stimulate diet within aggregates the first objective of this study was to clarify the possibility that diet could be stimulated within aggregates fed with alcohol compounds comprised of hydroxy groups the second objective was to further explore the link between nadh nad transformation in alcohol dehydrogenation and the formation of extracellular electrical connection components to better understand the mechanisms of alcohol compounds stimulating diet to address both objectives three up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb digesters respectively with ethanol glycol and glycerol as a primary substrate were conducted to perform the side by side comparisons of aggregate characteristics aggregate conductance and gene expression via metatranscriptomics the results showed that glycerol fed aggregates exhibited the higher potential of diet than ethanol and glycol fed aggregates providing a promising route for achieving the better diet that should be highlighted in the engineering design of anaerobic digestion 2 materials and methods 2 1 aggregate culture aggregate culture was continuously conducted in three cylindrical glass uasb digesters each of which had a working volume of 1000 ml internal diameter of 70 mm and height of 300 mm each of the three uasb digesters received a 300 ml of seed sludge as inoculum the seed sludge was collected from a large scale anaerobic digester treating municipal sludge in dalian china the total solid ts and volatile solid vs of which was 13 700 180 mg l mean standard deviation n 3 and 9150 150 mg l respectively each of the three uasb digesters had a gas sampling bag and a sludge sampling port and was operated at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 23 h and a temperature of 37 0 c one of the three uasb digesters was fed with ethanol as a primary substrate to form the ethanol fed aggregates the composition per liter of the initial feedstocks was ethanol 3 04 ml corresponding to a chemical oxygen demand cod concentration of 5000 mg l nh4cl 0 48 g kh2po4 0 11 g nahco3 0 50 g trace element solution 10 ml vitamin solution 10 ml the detailed composition of trace element and vitamin solution had been previously described zhao et al 2015a another two of the three uasb digesters were respectively fed with glycol glycerol as a primary substrate to form the glycol glycerol fed aggregates except glycol 3 52 ml corresponding to 5000 mgcod l glycerol 3 28 ml corresponding to 5000 mgcod l the composition of the initial feedstocks of glycol glycerol fed uasb digester was same as that of ethanol fed uasb digester apparently with the same concentration of cod in these feedstocks glycerol contains the most mole number of hydroxy groups 0 027 mol gcod glycerol among all the substrates followed by glycol 0 026 mol gcod glycol and ethanol 0 010 mol gcod ethanol therefore if alcohol compounds comprised of hydroxy groups could stimulate diet within aggregates it was reasonably assumed that more hydroxy groups comprised glycol glycerol would be better for this stimulation which led to a higher efficiency of anaerobic digestion all the feedstocks were deoxygenated by flushing nitrogen gas for 20 min and stored under the anaerobic conditions at 4 c before use during the start up stage the organic loading rate olr of the three uasb digesters was 5 22 kgcod m3 d fig 1 after the 46 day culture the cod removal efficiencies of the three uasb digesters reached more than 90 fig 1b indicating that the start up of the three uasb digesters was finished afterwards the olr of the three uasb digesters was gradually increased by changing the concentration of cod in the feedstocks fig 1 2 2 analytical methods ts vs and cod were determined with standard methods for examination of water and wastewater metabolic intermediates of ethanol acetate propionate and butyrate were determined by a gas chromatograph gc with a flame ionization detector

detector tcd tianmei gc 7900p tcd china zhao et al 2015b morphology of aggregates was observed by a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s 4800 japan zhao et al 2020c and a transmission electron microscope tem hitachi ht7700 japan wang et al 2018 the detailed measurements of sem and tem are provided in supporting information 2 3 aggregate conductance measurements electrical conductivity of aggregates was determined by a two chamber microbial fuel cell mfc malvankar et al 2012a each of the two chambers had a working volume of 120 ml the anode was comprised of two platinum electrodes 2 2 cm 1 5 cm 6 6 cm2 of the total geometric area separated by a 0 6 mm non conductive gap malvankar et al 2012a the two platinum electrodes were fixed on a glass substrate to support the connection of aggregates with the spilt anode and to bridge the non conductive gap the cathode was comprised of conductive carbon fibers diameter of 3 cm 5 pieces anodic electrolyte 70 ml was same as the feedstocks section 2 2 and cathodic electrolyte was 50 mm k3 fe cn 6 solution electricity generation was recorded by a data acquisition card zhouzheng daqm 4200 china to ensure aggregates to bridge the non conductive gap microscopic images of aggregates on the spilt anode were checked after electricity generation by a metallographic microscope axio observer axioscope 5 germany to measure the electrical conductivity of aggregates the connection between anode and cathode was removed and the split anode was connected with an electrochemical workstation chenhua chi 660 china with a voltage ramp of 0 1 0 1 v in steps of 0 025 v zhao et al 2016b to achieve a current voltage response resistance temperature response of aggregates was determined by a physical property measurement system ppms 9 quantum design usa morita et al 2011 the temperature was varied from 290 k corresponding to 17 c up to 310 k corresponding to 37 c in steps of 1 k morita et al 2011 four probe electrical conductance measurement was conducted to measure the resistance at each temperature morita et al 2011 the freeze dried aggregates were gently crushed to form a homogeneous layer and placed on the four electrodes which were placed into the vacuum chamber of ppms 9 a fixed current 200 ua was applied to the two outer electrodes and the potential drop between the two inner electrodes was measured 2 4 metatranscriptomic sequencing total rna of aggregates was extracted according to the standard procedures after quality test rrna were removed from the total rna to enrich mrna then mrna was fragmented into the short fragments with fragmentation buffer and used as the templates to synthesize the single strand cdna with the random hexamer primers zheng et al 2021 afterwards buffer dntps and dna polymerase i and rnase h were used to synthesize the double strand cdna ampure xp beads were used to purify the double strand cdna which then were resolved for the end repair adding poly a and performing sequencing adapter ligation zheng et al 2021 the products were purified by ampure xp beads before pcr amplification finally quantified libraries could be prepared for the paired end sequencing by a hiseq 2000 system illumina 2 5 metatranscriptomic analysis metatranscriptomic raw reads were quality checked with a trimmomactic software parameters leading 3 trailing 3 slidingwindow

kilobase per million fpkm holmes et al 2017 protein coding sequences from the assembly of metatranscriptomic contigs were predicated using metagenemark using the default settings lukashin and borodovsky 1998 for each predicted protein coding sequence functional information was collected by a sequence similarity search against the ncbi nonredundant protein sequence nr database the sequences with reliable hits in nr database were also compared against kegg orthology ogata et al 1999 the differentially expressed genes were determined by the difference value of the transcript abundance log2fpkm 3 results and discussion 3 1 methanogenic performances of three uasb digesters to explore that aggregates fed with alcohol compounds comprised of more hydroxy groups could keep syntrophic metabolism more stable which might be linked to the better stimulation of diet methanogenic performances of the three uasb digesters in response to the high olr impacts were investigated fig 1 and fig s1 see supporting information there was no significant difference p 0 05 in methane production rate fig 1a and cod removal efficiency fig 1b among the three uasb digesters before the olr was increased to 15 65 kgcod m3 d however when the olr reached 15 65 kgcod m3 d the syntrophic metabolism in ethanol fed digester gradually broke down fig 1 and fig s1 with no methane was detected fig 1a meanwhile the cod removal efficiency in glycol fed digester dramatically declined from 88 5 0 2 to 62 5 0 3 fig 1b with a significant p 0 05 accumulation of metabolic intermediates such as acetate fig s1 the syntrophic metabolism in glycol fed digester finally broke down when the olr was increased to 20 87 kgcod m3 d fig 1 and fig s1 in contrast despite that the olr was further increased finally to 31 30 kgcod m3 d the syntrophic metabolism in glycerol fed digester was always kept steadily fig 1 with an average cod removal efficiency more than 95 fig 1b and an average concentration of metabolic intermediates lower than 2500 mgcod l fig s1 the degradation pathway of ethanol glycol and glycerol is generally same including the initial conversion of alcohols to aldehydes alcohol dehydrogenation and further conversion of aldehydes to carboxylates ferrero et al 2018 im et al 2019 rotaru et al 2014a apparently in addition to the mole number of hydroxy groups comprised the difference in the metabolic carboxylates in the degradation pathway of ethanol glycol and glycerol might be another important factor influencing the methanogenic performances specifically propionate was the primary carboxylate in syntrophic conversion of glycerol to methane while acetate was the primary carboxylate in syntrophic conversion of ethanol glycol to methane despite that propionate was a thermodynamically important intermediate these was no evident accumulation of propionate detected in glycerol fed digester fig s1 suggesting a high efficiency working mode of syntrophic metabolism within aggregates the high efficiency syntrophic metabolism usually depends on the effective interspecies electron transfer way therefore it was reasonably assumed that diet was a primary working mode of syntrophic metabolism within glycerol fed aggregates the stimulation of diet within glycerol fed aggregates was not simply attributed to the thermodynamic significance of substrate as previous studies feng et al 2021 liu et al 2020 yin and wu 2019 since the standard heat of combustion δh 25 c and 101 kpa of ethanol 14 22 kj gcod ethanol glycol 14 86 kj gcod glycol and glycerol 14 79 kj gcod glycerol was nearly same however an interesting phenomenon was that the methanogenic performances in response to the high olr impacts were consistent with mole number of hydroxy groups comprised as follows glycerol 0 027 mol gcod glycerol glycol 0 026 mol gcod glycol ethanol 0 010 mol gcod ethanol 3 2 general characteristics of aggregates all the three uasb digesters formed the aggregates with an average diameter of 200 300 um fig s2 see supporting information they were black and roughly elliptoid fig s2a1 b1 and c1 primarily comprised of the bamboo like species fig s2a2 b2 and c2 closely related to methanothrix species further investigations via tem were to observe the morphology of cells within these aggregates although it was hard to evaluate the in situ state of cells after drying and immobilization close examination of tem images still observed the potential interspecies connected networks assembled by the filaments between cells fig 2 see the arrows the similar phenomenons were previously observed within aggregates comprised of two geobacter species summers et al 2010 as well as geobacter metallireducens with methanosarcina barkeri wang et al 2018 that exchanged electrons via e pili despite that the types pili or archaella and electrical conductivity of these filaments were unclear cells within glycerol fed aggregates fig 2c producing more filaments to form a denser network than that within ethanol and glycol fed aggregates fig 2a and b was readily apparent 3 3 electrical conductance of aggregates the interspecies connected networks assembled by filaments fig 2 provided a potential of cell to cell electron exchange via e pili within aggregates a direct approach to clarify this potential is to determine the electrical conductivity of aggregates morita et al 2011 since there is a much stronger correlation between aggregate conductance and transcript abundance of genes for e pili holmes et al 2016 to ensure the aggregates to have a steady connection with the spilt anode and to bridge the non conductive gap electricity generation fig s3 see supporting information and microscopic images of aggregates bridging the non conductive gap fig s4 see supporting information were recorded to our surprise the maximum current density generated by glycerol fed aggregates reached 65 8 ma m2 which was approximately 2 8 and 15 7 folds higher than that by ethanol 23 8 ma m2 and glycol 4 2 ma m2 fed aggregates respectively fig s2 despite that the link between electricity generation and diet was still unclear g metallireducens and g hydrogenophilus generating the relatively higher current densities were found to be capable of growing with m barkeri via diet while g bremensis g humireducens and g uraniireducens known to generate the relatively lower current densities were not rotaru et al 2015 aggregates in the three uasb digesters exhibited an evidently linear r2 0 90 current voltage response fig 3 similar to the aggregates in an uasb digester treating brewery wastes in which diet was the primary working mode of syntrophic metabolism morita et al 2011 the electrical conductivity of ethanol fed aggregates was 10 4 0 5 us cm also comparable to that of aggregates in the uasb digester treating brewery wastes 6 1 7 2 us cm morita et al 2011 the electrical conductivity of glycol fed aggregates 12 7 0 2 us cm was slightly higher than that of ethanol fed aggregates which however reached 19 4 0 3 us cm within glycerol fed aggregates the high electrical conductivity fig 3 reflected that there was a conductive matrix within aggregates in which cells exchanged electrons via their extracellular electrical connection components e pili or mhcs morita et al 2011 shrestha et al 2014 aggregate conductance has been primarily described as two types metallic like conductance malvankar et al 2011 morita et al 2011 and redox conductance li et al 2017 liu et al 2021 electron transfer between cells via e pili exhibits a metallic like conductance malvankar et al 2011 morita et al 2011 while the redox conductance is most likely attributed to the reason that electron transfer from cell to cell is conducted by a succession of electron transfer reactions via the redox proteins snider et al 2012 one of the significant differences between the two types of aggregate conductance is most likely involved in a mechanism that electrons are delocalized or not li et al 2017 malvankar et al 2012b specifically in the metallic like conductance electrons are delocalized and move without any need for the thermal activation malvankar et al 2012b in contrast in the redox conductance electrons are not delocalized and move with the need for the thermal activation malvankar et al 2012b therefore the relatively higher temperature is more beneficial for electron transfer with the redox conductance liu et al 2021 malvankar et al 2012b to further evaluate this nature the resistance temperature response of aggregates was conducted fig 4 aggregates in the three uasb digesters generally exhibited an increase in the resistance when temperature was increased fig 4 consistent with the metallic like conductance that was derived from a hallmark of delocalized electrons scattered by high energy phonons malvankar et al 2012b the metallic like conductance suggested a possibility that cells within these aggregates exchanged electrons primarily via e pili however the linear relationship in the resistance temperature response of glycerol fed aggregates r2 0 48 was the least among these aggregates fig 4 suggesting that cells also exchanged electrons via mhcs with a redox conductance that influenced the resistance temperature response 3 4 metatranscriptomic identification of diet within aggregates expression for the total genes closely related to e pili and c type cytochromes as described in previous studies mei et al 2018 zheng et al 2021 is shown in fig 5 table s1 see supporting information and table s2 see supporting information genes encoding the type iv pilus assembly proteins pila pilb pilc pile pilm piln pilo pilp pilq and pily1 were highly expressed log2fpkm 9 39 10 96 within aggregates of the three uasb digesters fig 5 and table s1 the transcript abundance of these genes within glyrecol fed aggregates 10 96 was significantly higher than that within ethanol 9 39 and glycol 9 65 fed aggregates fig 5 pila was the most dominant expression of these genes 8 94 9 70 table s1 see the shaded text and number deleting pila can prevent e pilus expression in g sulfurreducens lovley et al 2005 therefore the relatively higher expression of pila gene within glycerol fed aggregates 9 70 further supported the hypothesis derived from the electrical conductivity data fig 3 and tem images fig 2 that cells within glycerol fed aggregates produced more e pili to form the interspecies electrically connected networks furthermore the transcript abundance of pilb pilc pile pilm piln pilo pilp pilq and pily1 gene within glycerol fed aggregates was higher than that within glycol fed aggregates followed by ethanol fed aggregates table s1 in addition to e pili genes for c type cytochromes were also highly expressed 8 90 9 64 within aggregates of the three uasb digesters fig 5 and table s2 see supporting information unlike the gene expression for e pili the transcript abundance for genes for c type cytochromes within glycol fed aggregates 9 64 was close to that within glycerol 9 42 fed aggregates but higher than that within ethanol fed aggregates 8 90 fig 5 suggesting that cells within glycol fed aggregates produced more mhcs as their extracellular electrical connection components microbial composition fig 6 and expression of the top 50 genes table 1 and table s3 see supporting information within aggregates were analyzed to gain insight into the microbial factors linked to the potential diet methanothrix species were dominant fig 6 and metabolically active within aggregates of the three uasb digesters table 1 and table s3 genes encoding the enzymes involved in carbon dioxide reduction such as methyl coenzyme m reductase tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase and 5 10 methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase were highly expressed in methanothrix species table 1 and table s3 see the shaded text and number consistently an evidently reduced peak with a potential ranging from 0 25 v to 0 34 v close to the reduced potential of co2 ch4 0 41 v was detected in these aggregates based on cyclic voltammetry cv scan fig s5 see supporting information these results and the fact that methanothrix species were not capable of metabolizing hydrogen and formate to methane suggested that they primarily participated in directly accepting electrons for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane methanothrix species may benefit from diet because the conversion of acetate to methane yields little energy and they grow slowly on acetate holmes et al 2017 an evidence to support this was that genes encoding the enzymes involved in energy metabolism v a type h na transporting atpase were also highly expressed in methanothrix species table 1 and table s3 see the shaded text and number methanobacterium species known as the hydrogen formate utilizing methanogens were secondly dominant in ethanol and glycol fed aggregates the abundance of which however declined in glycerol fed aggregates fig 6 their decline was accompanied by a significant increase in the abundance of methanoculleus species fig 6 capable of metabolizing a diversity of substrates to methane such as hydrogen formate 2 propanol 2 butanol and cyclopentanol dianou et al 2001 despite that genes encoding the enzymes involved in carbon dioxide reduction were also highly expressed in methanoculleus species table 1 and table s3 see the shaded text and number it was still unclear that methanoculleus species were capable of directly accepting electrons via diet however it should be pointed out that the gene encoding archaeal type iv pilus assembly protein pila was highly expressed in methanoculleus species within glycerol fed aggregates table s2 see the shaded text and number suggesting that methanoculleus species produced e archaella the e archaella of archaea and their role in extracellular electron transfer are still enigmatic for instance methanospirillum hungatei has been known as the only archaea species the archaella of which are electrically conductive walker et al 2019 whereas m hungatei could not grow via diet in a co culture with g metallireducens rotaru et al 2014a desulfovibrio species were the dominant electron donating syntrophs within ethanol and glycol fed aggregates and the abundance of desulfovibrio species within glycol fed aggregates was more than 15 higher than that within ethanol fed aggregates fig 6 the capacity of extracellular electron transfer to fe iii oxides or electrodes by desulfovibrio species had been previously evaluated lovley and holmes 2022 despite that there was no defined evidence indicating that desulfovibrio species were capable of participating in diet desulfovibrio species highly expressed the genes for c type cytochromes within glycol fed aggregates table s2 see the shaded text and number suggesting that desulfovibrio species participated in diet primarily via mhcs consistent with this metatranscriptomic analysis of methanogenic aggregates from the coastal zones also showed that desulfovibrio species highly expressed the genes for mhcs in the potential diet based syntrophic metabolism zheng et al 2021 the abundance of desulfovibrio species declined within glycerol fed aggregates fig 6 and their decline was accompanied by a significant increase in the abundance of anaerovibrio and selenomonas species fig 6 the anaerobic fermentation species capable of metabolizing glycerol to propionate de vries et al 1974 although the capacity of anaerovibrio and selenomonas species participating in diet had been never evaluated their capacity of extracellular electron transfer to fumarate via mhcs had been reported de vries et al 1974 3 5 potential mechanisms of stimulating diet within aggregates multiple line of evidence involved in electrical conductivity fig 3 and fig 4 microbial composition fig 6 and gene expression for e pili fig 5 and table s1 c type cytochromes fig 5 and table s2 and carbon dioxide reduction table 1 and table s3 indicated that cells within ethanol glycol and glycerol fed aggregates might exchange electrons via diet the primary reason might be attributed to the hydroxy groups of alcohol compounds and their intracellular metabolism alcohol dehydrogenation an evidence to support this hypothesis was that feeding the aggregates with glycerol 0 027 mol gcod glycerol exhibited the relatively higher electrical conductivity fig 3 and gene expression for e pili fig 5 and table s1 than glycol 0 026 mol gcod glycol followed by ethanol 0 010 mol gcod ethanol and feeding the aggregates with glycol glycerol exhibited the relatively higher gene expression for c type cytochromes than ethanol fig 5 and table s2 therefore it seemed likely that alcohol compounds comprised of more hydroxy groups could stimulate the electron donating syntrophs to produce more extracellular electrical connection components another evidence to support the function of alcohol dehydrogenation in stimulating diet within these aggregates was that the transcript abundance of genes encoding the enzymes involved in carbon dioxide reduction and acetate decarboxylation within glycol and glycerol fed aggregates was generally lower than that within ethanol fed aggregates while the transcript abundance of genes encoding the enzymes involved in alcohol dehydrogenation was opposite fig 7 table s4 table s5 and table s6 see supporting information these results suggested a possibility that alcohol compounds comprised of hydroxy groups could stimulate diet within aggregates as expected from the previous studies rotaru et al 2014a zhao et al 2020 genes encoding the enzymes involved in alcohol dehydrogenation alcohol dehydrogenase and nadh quinone oxidoreductase were highly expressed within aggregates of the three uasb digesters fig 7 and table s6 it was unclear that the transcript abundance of genes for alcohol dehydrogenase within glycerol fed aggregates 8 10 was significantly lower than that within ethanol fed aggregates 10 78 while glycerol fed aggregates 11 84 had the highest transcript abundance of genes for nadh quinone oxidoreductase that directly functioned the nadh nad transformation among these aggregates fig 7 apparently gene expression for alcohol dehydrogenation within glycol and glycerol fed aggregates was generally higher than that within ethanol fed aggregates fig 7 and table s6 suggesting that alcohol compounds comprised of more hydroxy groups could more effectively stimulate the nadh nad transformation these results and the phenomenons that feeding the aggregates with glycerol glycol exhibited the higher gene expression for e pili fig 5 and table s1 or c type cytochromes fig 5 and table s2 than ethanol further supported the hypothesis that there was a link between nadh nad transformation and the formation of extracellular electrical connection components the most likely explanation was that the electron donating syntrophs initially metabolizing the hydroxy groups alcohol dehydrogenation proceeded the transformation of nadh nad by alcohol dehydrogenase and nadh quinone oxidoreductase rotaru et al 2014a the rapid transformation of nadh nad stimulated the atp synthesis complex that drove the transport of protons via transmembrane gradient of proton to yield more energy bird et al 2011 for the formation extracellular electrical connection components to participated in diet although the aggregates of the three uasb digesters exhibited a relatively high electrical conductivity fig 3 the types pili or archaella and electrical conductivity of the filaments within these aggregates should be examined to further clarify this explanation 3 6 implications the aggregates fed with glycerol exhibited the relatively higher potential of diet than that fed with ethanol and glycol which kept the syntrophic metabolism in the uasb digester more stable in response to the high olr impacts fig 1 and fig s1 therefore it seems likely that initially pretreating the organic wastes to produce ethanol or ethnaol type fermentation pretreatment is just one of the best strategies for enhancing anaerobic digestion via stimulating diet li et al 2020 zhao and zhang 2019 zhao et al 2017b 2018 2020a zhao et al 2020b zhu et al 2019 developing the novel strategies to optimize the methanogenic substrates towards alcohol compounds comprised of more hydroxy groups for maximizing the potential of diet should be considered for instance yeast fermentation for glycerol production wang et al 2001 zhao et al 2015c seems likely to be a better strategy in terms of the high efficiency and stable conversion of organic wastes to methane than ethanol type fermentation pretreatment however the economic evaluations of continuous addition of yeast for glycerol production needs further investigations 4 conclusions the study presented here demonstrated that glycol glycerol could stimulate diet within aggregates similar to that with ethanol as a primary substrate providing a possibility that alcohol compounds comprised of hydroxy groups could stimulate diet within aggregates this was likely because that initially metabolizing the hydroxy groups of alcohol compounds alcohol dehydrogenation proceeded nadh nad transformation by alcohol dehydrogenase and nadh quinone oxidoreductase which further supported the formation of extracellular electrical connection components e pili and mhcs in addition alcohol compounds comprised of more hydroxy groups could stimulate the better diet within aggregates providing a promising strategy for enhancing anaerobic digestion via optimizing the methanogenic substrates towards alcohol compounds comprised of

16059,the possibility of stimulating direct interspecies electron transfer diet within aggregates of methanogenic digesters respectively with ethanol glycol and glycerol as a primary substrate was investigated to better understand the mechanisms of alcohol compounds stimulating diet aggregates fed with ethanol glycol and glycerol were electrically conductive 10 4 19 4 us cm with a temperature dependence of metallic like conductivity close examination of transmission electron microscope images observed the potential interspecies connected networks assembled by filaments within these aggregates further investigations via metatranscriptomics found that genes for electrically conductive pili e pili log2fpkm 9 39 10 96 and c type cytochromes 8 90 9 64 were highly expressed within aggregates glycerol fed aggregates exhibited the highest gene expression for e pili while glycol fed aggregates exhibited the highest gene expression for c type cytochromes methanothrix species were dominant and metabolically active within aggregates genes encoding the enzymes involved in carbon dioxide reduction were highly expressed in methanothrix species suggesting that they participated in diet in addition transcript abundance of genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenase and nadh quinone oxidoreductase in alcohol dehydrogenation closely associated with nadh nad transformation within glycol and glycerol fed aggregates was generally higher than that within ethanol fed aggregates these results and the fact that nadh nad transformation was very linked to the atp synthesis complex that further supported the formation of extracellular electrical connection components e pili and membrane bound multi heme c type cytochromes mhcs provided a possibility that alcohol compounds comprised of hydroxy groups could stimulate diet and more hydroxy groups comprised were better for this stimulation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords direct interspecies electron transfer electrically conductive aggregates glycol glycerol metatranscriptomics alcohol dehydrogenation 1 introduction recent discovery that electron donating syntrophs and electron accepting methanogens exchange electrons via direct interspecies electron transfer diet is a revolutionary event for anaerobic digestion rotaru et al 2014a 2014b one of the few large scale bio energy strategies appels et al 2011 holm nielsen et al 2009 diet challenges the long held over the past more than 50 years hypothesis that electron transfer from syntrophs to methanogens primarily depends on diffusion of electron carrying molecules hydrogen and formate bryant et al 1967 dong and stams 1995 stams and plugge 2009 trafficking in hydrogen or formate is a relatively slow and close range way felchner zwirello et al 2012 ishii et al 2005 no engineering strategy to speed up interspecies hydrogen or formate transfer is readily apparent in contrast diet mediated by electrically conductive pili e pili ueki et al 2018 or membrane bound multi heme c type cytochromes mhcs liu et al 2018 provides rapider and long range electron transport lovley 2017 zhao et al 2020d more excitingly engineering strategies for designing the novel digesters to encourage diet have been practiced zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2020d for instance the inclusion of carbon based conductive materials serving as electron conduits to promote diet can dramatically improve the performances and stability of anaerobic digestion zhao et al 2020d however the application of carbon based conductive materials is still limited by material types and sizes addition modes and economic evaluations zhao et al 2020d initially feeding digesters with ethanol seems likely to be another strategy for enhancing anaerobic digestion via promoting diet zhao et al 2016a 2016b digesters initially developed with ethanol enriched dieters formed highly conductive aggregates and metabolized subsequent propionate and butyrate faster than that without ethanol zhao et al 2016b despite that the mechanisms of ethanol stimulating diet within aggregates are still enigmatic engineering strategies of initially pretreating organic wastes to produce ethanol for sustaining diet have been documented in laboratory and large scale digesters for a diversity of organic wastes li et al 2020 zhao and zhang 2019 zhao et al 2017b 2018 2020a zhao et al 2020b zhu et al 2019 metagenomics was previously conducted to reveal the potential diet based syntrophic metabolism within ethanol fed aggregates zhao et al 2020b remarkably the abundance of pila gene known to encode the type iv pilin monomer protein pila assembling geobacter sulfurreducens e pili lovley et al 2020 dramatically increased zhao et al 2020b suggesting that ethanol stimulated dieters to produce more e pili the formation of extracellular electrical connection components usually consumes the cell energy of dieters liu et al 2012 which depends on the atp synthesis complex driving the transport of protons via transmembrane gradient of proton remarkably metatranscriptomic analysis in a co culture of g metallireducens with methanothrix harundinacea found that the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde ethanol dehydrogenation in g metallireducens proceeded the transformation of nadh nad by alcohol dehydrogenase and nadh quinone oxidoreductase rotaru et al 2014a the transformation of nadh nad is very linked to the transport of protons and electron bird et al 2011 therefore proceeding nadh nad transformation may stimulate atp synthesis complex that further supports the formation of extracellular electrical connection components this is most likely an important mechanism of stimulating diet within aggregates in the presence of ethanol warranting further investigations the function of nadh nad transformation by alcohol dehydrogenase and nadh quinone oxidoreductase in stimulating diet within ethanol fed aggregates is readily apparent rotaru et al 2014a therefore it is reasonably assumed that other alcohol compounds comprised of hydroxy groups are also capable of stimulating diet within aggregates similar to the function of ethanol one potential evidence to support this hypothesis was that study zhao et al 2017a in a semi continuous digester with butanol as a primary substrate found that methanothrix species were dominant and geobacter species accounted for approximately 10 of the bacterial communities another potential evidence was that study mei et al 2018 in an up flow packed bed digester treating fructose and polyethylene glycol found that the novel species of geobacter bin gac1 were dominant and metabolically active containing the genes for e pili and c type cytochromes however both studies ignored the possibility that alcohol compounds comprised of hydroxy groups could stimulate diet within aggregates the first objective of this study was to clarify the possibility that diet could be stimulated within aggregates fed with alcohol compounds comprised of hydroxy groups the second objective was to further explore the link between nadh nad transformation in alcohol dehydrogenation and the formation of extracellular electrical connection components to better understand the mechanisms of alcohol compounds stimulating diet to address both objectives three up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb digesters respectively with ethanol glycol and glycerol as a primary substrate were conducted to perform the side by side comparisons of aggregate characteristics aggregate conductance and gene expression via metatranscriptomics the results showed that glycerol fed aggregates exhibited the higher potential of diet than ethanol and glycol fed aggregates providing a promising route for achieving the better diet that should be highlighted in the engineering design of anaerobic digestion 2 materials and methods 2 1 aggregate culture aggregate culture was continuously conducted in three cylindrical glass uasb digesters each of which had a working volume of 1000 ml internal diameter of 70 mm and height of 300 mm each of the three uasb digesters received a 300 ml of seed sludge as inoculum the seed sludge was collected from a large scale anaerobic digester treating municipal sludge in dalian china the total solid ts and volatile solid vs of which was 13 700 180 mg l mean standard deviation n 3 and 9150 150 mg l respectively each of the three uasb digesters had a gas sampling bag and a sludge sampling port and was operated at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 23 h and a temperature of 37 0 c one of the three uasb digesters was fed with ethanol as a primary substrate to form the ethanol fed aggregates the composition per liter of the initial feedstocks was ethanol 3 04 ml corresponding to a chemical oxygen demand cod concentration of 5000 mg l nh4cl 0 48 g kh2po4 0 11 g nahco3 0 50 g trace element solution 10 ml vitamin solution 10 ml the detailed composition of trace element and vitamin solution had been previously described zhao et al 2015a another two of the three uasb digesters were respectively fed with glycol glycerol as a primary substrate to form the glycol glycerol fed aggregates except glycol 3 52 ml corresponding to 5000 mgcod l glycerol 3 28 ml corresponding to 5000 mgcod l the composition of the initial feedstocks of glycol glycerol fed uasb digester was same as that of ethanol fed uasb digester apparently with the same concentration of cod in these feedstocks glycerol contains the most mole number of hydroxy groups 0 027 mol gcod glycerol among all the substrates followed by glycol 0 026 mol gcod glycol and ethanol 0 010 mol gcod ethanol therefore if alcohol compounds comprised of hydroxy groups could stimulate diet within aggregates it was reasonably assumed that more hydroxy groups comprised glycol glycerol would be better for this stimulation which led to a higher efficiency of anaerobic digestion all the feedstocks were deoxygenated by flushing nitrogen gas for 20 min and stored under the anaerobic conditions at 4 c before use during the start up stage the organic loading rate olr of the three uasb digesters was 5 22 kgcod m3 d fig 1 after the 46 day culture the cod removal efficiencies of the three uasb digesters reached more than 90 fig 1b indicating that the start up of the three uasb digesters was finished afterwards the olr of the three uasb digesters was gradually increased by changing the concentration of cod in the feedstocks fig 1 2 2 analytical methods ts vs and cod were determined with standard methods for examination of water and wastewater metabolic intermediates of ethanol acetate propionate and butyrate were determined by a gas chromatograph gc with a flame ionization detector

aggregates was determined by a two chamber microbial fuel cell mfc malvankar et al 2012a each of the two chambers had a working volume of 120 ml the anode was comprised of two platinum electrodes 2 2 cm 1 5 cm 6 6 cm2 of the total geometric area separated by a 0 6 mm non conductive gap malvankar et al 2012a the two platinum electrodes were fixed on a glass substrate to support the connection of aggregates with the spilt anode and to bridge the non conductive gap the cathode was comprised of conductive carbon fibers diameter of 3 cm 5 pieces anodic electrolyte 70 ml was same as the feedstocks section 2 2 and cathodic electrolyte was 50 mm k3 fe cn 6 solution electricity generation was recorded by a data acquisition card zhouzheng daqm 4200 china to ensure aggregates to bridge the non conductive gap microscopic images of aggregates on the spilt anode were checked after electricity generation by a metallographic microscope axio observer axioscope 5 germany to measure the electrical conductivity of aggregates the connection between anode and cathode was removed and the split anode was connected with an electrochemical workstation chenhua chi 660 china with a voltage ramp of 0 1 0 1 v in steps of 0 025 v zhao et al 2016b to achieve a current voltage response resistance temperature response of aggregates was determined by a physical property measurement system ppms 9 quantum design usa morita et al 2011 the temperature was varied from 290 k corresponding to 17 c up to 310 k corresponding to 37 c in steps of 1 k morita et al 2011 four probe electrical conductance measurement was conducted to measure the resistance at each temperature morita et al 2011 the freeze dried aggregates were gently crushed to form a homogeneous layer and placed on the four electrodes which were placed into the vacuum chamber of ppms 9 a fixed current 200 ua was applied to the two outer electrodes and the potential drop between the two inner electrodes was measured 2 4 metatranscriptomic sequencing total rna of aggregates was extracted according to the standard procedures after quality test rrna were removed from the total rna to enrich mrna then mrna was fragmented into the short fragments with fragmentation buffer and used as the templates to synthesize the single strand cdna with the random hexamer primers zheng et al 2021 afterwards buffer dntps and dna polymerase i and rnase h were used to synthesize the double strand cdna ampure xp beads were used to purify the double strand cdna which then were resolved for the end repair adding poly a and performing sequencing adapter ligation zheng et al 2021 the products were purified by ampure xp beads before pcr amplification finally quantified libraries could be prepared for the paired end sequencing by a hiseq 2000 system illumina 2 5 metatranscriptomic analysis metatranscriptomic raw reads were quality checked with a trimmomactic software parameters leading 3 trailing 3 slidingwindow

borodovsky 1998 for each predicted protein coding sequence functional information was collected by a sequence similarity search against the ncbi nonredundant protein sequence nr database the sequences with reliable hits in nr database were also compared against kegg orthology ogata et al 1999 the differentially expressed genes were determined by the difference value of the transcript abundance log2fpkm 3 results and discussion 3 1 methanogenic performances of three uasb digesters to explore that aggregates fed with alcohol compounds comprised of more hydroxy groups could keep syntrophic metabolism more stable which might be linked to the better stimulation of diet methanogenic performances of the three uasb digesters in response to the high olr impacts were investigated fig 1 and fig s1 see supporting information there was no significant difference p 0 05 in methane production rate fig 1a and cod removal efficiency fig 1b among the three uasb digesters before the olr was increased to 15 65 kgcod m3 d however when the olr reached 15 65 kgcod m3 d the syntrophic metabolism in ethanol fed digester gradually broke down fig 1 and fig s1 with no methane was detected fig 1a meanwhile the cod removal efficiency in glycol fed digester dramatically declined from 88 5 0 2 to 62 5 0 3 fig 1b with a significant p 0 05 accumulation of metabolic intermediates such as acetate fig s1 the syntrophic metabolism in glycol fed digester finally broke down when the olr was increased to 20 87 kgcod m3 d fig 1 and fig s1 in contrast despite that the olr was further increased finally to 31 30 kgcod m3 d the syntrophic metabolism in glycerol fed digester was always kept steadily fig 1 with an average cod removal efficiency more than 95 fig 1b and an average concentration of metabolic intermediates lower than 2500 mgcod l fig s1 the degradation pathway of ethanol glycol and glycerol is generally same including the initial conversion of alcohols to aldehydes alcohol dehydrogenation and further conversion of aldehydes to carboxylates ferrero et al 2018 im et al 2019 rotaru et al 2014a apparently in addition to the mole number of hydroxy groups comprised the difference in the metabolic carboxylates in the degradation pathway of ethanol glycol and glycerol might be another important factor influencing the methanogenic performances specifically propionate was the primary carboxylate in syntrophic conversion of glycerol to methane while acetate was the primary carboxylate in syntrophic conversion of ethanol glycol to methane despite that propionate was a thermodynamically important intermediate these was no evident accumulation of propionate detected in glycerol fed digester fig s1 suggesting a high efficiency working mode of syntrophic metabolism within aggregates the high efficiency syntrophic metabolism usually depends on the effective interspecies electron transfer way therefore it was reasonably assumed that diet was a primary working mode of syntrophic metabolism within glycerol fed aggregates the stimulation of diet within glycerol fed aggregates was not simply attributed to the thermodynamic significance of substrate as previous studies feng et al 2021 liu et al 2020 yin and wu 2019 since the standard heat of combustion δh 25 c and 101 kpa of ethanol 14 22 kj gcod ethanol glycol 14 86 kj gcod glycol and glycerol 14 79 kj gcod glycerol was nearly same however an interesting phenomenon was that the methanogenic performances in response to the high olr impacts were consistent with mole number of hydroxy groups comprised as follows glycerol 0 027 mol gcod glycerol glycol 0 026 mol gcod glycol ethanol 0 010 mol gcod ethanol 3 2 general characteristics of aggregates all the three uasb digesters formed the aggregates with an average diameter of 200 300 um fig s2 see supporting information they were black and roughly elliptoid fig s2a1 b1 and c1 primarily comprised of the bamboo like species fig s2a2 b2 and c2 closely related to methanothrix species further investigations via tem were to observe the morphology of cells within these aggregates although it was hard to evaluate the in situ state of cells after drying and immobilization close examination of tem images still observed the potential interspecies connected networks assembled by the filaments between cells fig 2 see the arrows the similar phenomenons were previously observed within aggregates comprised of two geobacter species summers et al 2010 as well as geobacter metallireducens with methanosarcina barkeri wang et al 2018 that exchanged electrons via e pili despite that the types pili or archaella and electrical conductivity of these filaments were unclear cells within glycerol fed aggregates fig 2c producing more filaments to form a denser network than that within ethanol and glycol fed aggregates fig 2a and b was readily apparent 3 3 electrical conductance of aggregates the interspecies connected networks assembled by filaments fig 2 provided a potential of cell to cell electron exchange via e pili within aggregates a direct approach to clarify this potential is to determine the electrical conductivity of aggregates morita et al 2011 since there is a much stronger correlation between aggregate conductance and transcript abundance of genes for e pili holmes et al 2016 to ensure the aggregates to have a steady connection with the spilt anode and to bridge the non conductive gap electricity generation fig s3 see supporting information and microscopic images of aggregates bridging the non conductive gap fig s4 see supporting information were recorded to our surprise the maximum current density generated by glycerol fed aggregates reached 65 8 ma m2 which was approximately 2 8 and 15 7 folds higher than that by ethanol 23 8 ma m2 and glycol 4 2 ma m2 fed aggregates respectively fig s2 despite that the link between electricity generation and diet was still unclear g metallireducens and g hydrogenophilus generating the relatively higher current densities were found to be capable of growing with m barkeri via diet while g bremensis g humireducens and g uraniireducens known to generate the relatively lower current densities were not rotaru et al 2015 aggregates in the three uasb digesters exhibited an evidently linear r2 0 90 current voltage response fig 3 similar to the aggregates in an uasb digester treating brewery wastes in which diet was the primary working mode of syntrophic metabolism morita et al 2011 the electrical conductivity of ethanol fed aggregates was 10 4 0 5 us cm also comparable to that of aggregates in the uasb digester treating brewery wastes 6 1 7 2 us cm morita et al 2011 the electrical conductivity of glycol fed aggregates 12 7 0 2 us cm was slightly higher than that of ethanol fed aggregates which however reached 19 4 0 3 us cm within glycerol fed aggregates the high electrical conductivity fig 3 reflected that there was a conductive matrix within aggregates in which cells exchanged electrons via their extracellular electrical connection components e pili or mhcs morita et al 2011 shrestha et al 2014 aggregate conductance has been primarily described as two types metallic like conductance malvankar et al 2011 morita et al 2011 and redox conductance li et al 2017 liu et al 2021 electron transfer between cells via e pili exhibits a metallic like conductance malvankar et al 2011 morita et al 2011 while the redox conductance is most likely attributed to the reason that electron transfer from cell to cell is conducted by a succession of electron transfer reactions via the redox proteins snider et al 2012 one of the significant differences between the two types of aggregate conductance is most likely involved in a mechanism that electrons are delocalized or not li et al 2017 malvankar et al 2012b specifically in the metallic like conductance electrons are delocalized and move without any need for the thermal activation malvankar et al 2012b in contrast in the redox conductance electrons are not delocalized and move with the need for the thermal activation malvankar et al 2012b therefore the relatively higher temperature is more beneficial for electron transfer with the redox conductance liu et al 2021 malvankar et al 2012b to further evaluate this nature the resistance temperature response of aggregates was conducted fig 4 aggregates in the three uasb digesters generally exhibited an increase in the resistance when temperature was increased fig 4 consistent with the metallic like conductance that was derived from a hallmark of delocalized electrons scattered by high energy phonons malvankar et al 2012b the metallic like conductance suggested a possibility that cells within these aggregates exchanged electrons primarily via e pili however the linear relationship in the resistance temperature response of glycerol fed aggregates r2 0 48 was the least among these aggregates fig 4 suggesting that cells also exchanged electrons via mhcs with a redox conductance that influenced the resistance temperature response 3 4 metatranscriptomic identification of diet within aggregates expression for the total genes closely related to e pili and c type cytochromes as described in previous studies mei et al 2018 zheng et al 2021 is shown in fig 5 table s1 see supporting information and table s2 see supporting information genes encoding the type iv pilus assembly proteins pila pilb pilc pile pilm piln pilo pilp pilq and pily1 were highly expressed log2fpkm 9 39 10 96 within aggregates of the three uasb digesters fig 5 and table s1 the transcript abundance of these genes within glyrecol fed aggregates 10 96 was significantly higher than that within ethanol 9 39 and glycol 9 65 fed aggregates fig 5 pila was the most dominant expression of these genes 8 94 9 70 table s1 see the shaded text and number deleting pila can prevent e pilus expression in g sulfurreducens lovley et al 2005 therefore the relatively higher expression of pila gene within glycerol fed aggregates 9 70 further supported the hypothesis derived from the electrical conductivity data fig 3 and tem images fig 2 that cells within glycerol fed aggregates produced more e pili to form the interspecies electrically connected networks furthermore the transcript abundance of pilb pilc pile pilm piln pilo pilp pilq and pily1 gene within glycerol fed aggregates was higher than that within glycol fed aggregates followed by ethanol fed aggregates table s1 in addition to e pili genes for c type cytochromes were also highly expressed 8 90 9 64 within aggregates of the three uasb digesters fig 5 and table s2 see supporting information unlike the gene expression for e pili the transcript abundance for genes for c type cytochromes within glycol fed aggregates 9 64 was close to that within glycerol 9 42 fed aggregates but higher than that within ethanol fed aggregates 8 90 fig 5 suggesting that cells within glycol fed aggregates produced more mhcs as their extracellular electrical connection components microbial composition fig 6 and expression of the top 50 genes table 1 and table s3 see supporting information within aggregates were analyzed to gain insight into the microbial factors linked to the potential diet methanothrix species were dominant fig 6 and metabolically active within aggregates of the three uasb digesters table 1 and table s3 genes encoding the enzymes involved in carbon dioxide reduction such as methyl coenzyme m reductase tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase and 5 10 methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase were highly expressed in methanothrix species table 1 and table s3 see the shaded text and number consistently an evidently reduced peak with a potential ranging from 0 25 v to 0 34 v close to the reduced potential of co2 ch4 0 41 v was detected in these aggregates based on cyclic voltammetry cv scan fig s5 see supporting information these results and the fact that methanothrix species were not capable of metabolizing hydrogen and formate to methane suggested that they primarily participated in directly accepting electrons for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane methanothrix species may benefit from diet because the conversion of acetate to methane yields little energy and they grow slowly on acetate holmes et al 2017 an evidence to support this was that genes encoding the enzymes involved in energy metabolism v a type h na transporting atpase were also highly expressed in methanothrix species table 1 and table s3 see the shaded text and number methanobacterium species known as the hydrogen formate utilizing methanogens were secondly dominant in ethanol and glycol fed aggregates the abundance of which however declined in glycerol fed aggregates fig 6 their decline was accompanied by a significant increase in the abundance of methanoculleus species fig 6 capable of metabolizing a diversity of substrates to methane such as hydrogen formate 2 propanol 2 butanol and cyclopentanol dianou et al 2001 despite that genes encoding the enzymes involved in carbon dioxide reduction were also highly expressed in methanoculleus species table 1 and table s3 see the shaded text and number it was still unclear that methanoculleus species were capable of directly accepting electrons via diet however it should be pointed out that the gene encoding archaeal type iv pilus assembly protein pila was highly expressed in methanoculleus species within glycerol fed aggregates table s2 see the shaded text and number suggesting that methanoculleus species produced e archaella the e archaella of archaea and their role in extracellular electron transfer are still enigmatic for instance methanospirillum hungatei has been known as the only archaea species the archaella of which are electrically conductive walker et al 2019 whereas m hungatei could not grow via diet in a co culture with g metallireducens rotaru et al 2014a desulfovibrio species were the dominant electron donating syntrophs within ethanol and glycol fed aggregates and the abundance of desulfovibrio species within glycol fed aggregates was more than 15 higher than that within ethanol fed aggregates fig 6 the capacity of extracellular electron transfer to fe iii oxides or electrodes by desulfovibrio species had been previously evaluated lovley and holmes 2022 despite that there was no defined evidence indicating that desulfovibrio species were capable of participating in diet desulfovibrio species highly expressed the genes for c type cytochromes within glycol fed aggregates table s2 see the shaded text and number suggesting that desulfovibrio species participated in diet primarily via mhcs consistent with this metatranscriptomic analysis of methanogenic aggregates from the coastal zones also showed that desulfovibrio species highly expressed the genes for mhcs in the potential diet based syntrophic metabolism zheng et al 2021 the abundance of desulfovibrio species declined within glycerol fed aggregates fig 6 and their decline was accompanied by a significant increase in the abundance of anaerovibrio and selenomonas species fig 6 the anaerobic fermentation species capable of metabolizing glycerol to propionate de vries et al 1974 although the capacity of anaerovibrio and selenomonas species participating in diet had been never evaluated their capacity of extracellular electron transfer to fumarate via mhcs had been reported de vries et al 1974 3 5 potential mechanisms of stimulating diet within aggregates multiple line of evidence involved in electrical conductivity fig 3 and fig 4 microbial composition fig 6 and gene expression for e pili fig 5 and table s1 c type cytochromes fig 5 and table s2 and carbon dioxide reduction table 1 and table s3 indicated that cells within ethanol glycol and glycerol fed aggregates might exchange electrons via diet the primary reason might be attributed to the hydroxy groups of alcohol compounds and their intracellular metabolism alcohol dehydrogenation an evidence to support this hypothesis was that feeding the aggregates with glycerol 0 027 mol gcod glycerol exhibited the relatively higher electrical conductivity fig 3 and gene expression for e pili fig 5 and table s1 than glycol 0 026 mol gcod glycol followed by ethanol 0 010 mol gcod ethanol and feeding the aggregates with glycol glycerol exhibited the relatively higher gene expression for c type cytochromes than ethanol fig 5 and table s2 therefore it seemed likely that alcohol compounds comprised of more hydroxy groups could stimulate the electron donating syntrophs to produce more extracellular electrical connection components another evidence to support the function of alcohol dehydrogenation in stimulating diet within these aggregates was that the transcript abundance of genes encoding the enzymes involved in carbon dioxide reduction and acetate decarboxylation within glycol and glycerol fed aggregates was generally lower than that within ethanol fed aggregates while the transcript abundance of genes encoding the enzymes involved in alcohol dehydrogenation was opposite fig 7 table s4 table s5 and table s6 see supporting information these results suggested a possibility that alcohol compounds comprised of hydroxy groups could stimulate diet within aggregates as expected from the previous studies rotaru et al 2014a zhao et al 2020 genes encoding the enzymes involved in alcohol dehydrogenation alcohol dehydrogenase and nadh quinone oxidoreductase were highly expressed within aggregates of the three uasb digesters fig 7 and table s6 it was unclear that the transcript abundance of genes for alcohol dehydrogenase within glycerol fed aggregates 8 10 was significantly lower than that within ethanol fed aggregates 10 78 while glycerol fed aggregates 11 84 had the highest transcript abundance of genes for nadh quinone oxidoreductase that directly functioned the nadh nad transformation among these aggregates fig 7 apparently gene expression for alcohol dehydrogenation within glycol and glycerol fed aggregates was generally higher than that within ethanol fed aggregates fig 7 and table s6 suggesting that alcohol compounds comprised of more hydroxy groups could more effectively stimulate the nadh nad transformation these results and the phenomenons that feeding the aggregates with glycerol glycol exhibited the higher gene expression for e pili fig 5 and table s1 or c type cytochromes fig 5 and table s2 than ethanol further supported the hypothesis that there was a link between nadh nad transformation and the formation of extracellular electrical connection components the most likely explanation was that the electron donating syntrophs initially metabolizing the hydroxy groups alcohol dehydrogenation proceeded the transformation of nadh nad by alcohol dehydrogenase and nadh quinone oxidoreductase rotaru et al 2014a the rapid transformation of nadh nad stimulated the atp synthesis complex that drove the transport of protons via transmembrane gradient of proton to yield more energy bird et al 2011 for the formation extracellular electrical connection components to participated in diet although the aggregates of the three uasb digesters exhibited a relatively high electrical conductivity fig 3 the types pili or archaella and electrical conductivity of the filaments within these aggregates should be examined to further clarify this explanation 3 6 implications the aggregates fed with glycerol exhibited the relatively higher potential of diet than that fed with ethanol and glycol which kept the syntrophic metabolism in the uasb digester more stable in response to the high olr impacts fig 1 and fig s1 therefore it seems likely that initially pretreating the organic wastes to produce ethanol or ethnaol type fermentation pretreatment is just one of the best strategies for enhancing anaerobic digestion via stimulating diet li et al 2020 zhao and zhang 2019 zhao et al 2017b 2018 2020a zhao et al 2020b zhu et al 2019 developing the novel strategies to optimize the methanogenic substrates towards alcohol compounds comprised of more hydroxy groups for maximizing the potential of diet should be considered for instance yeast fermentation for glycerol production wang et al 2001 zhao et al 2015c seems likely to be a better strategy in terms of the high efficiency and stable conversion of organic wastes to methane than ethanol type fermentation pretreatment however the economic evaluations of continuous addition of yeast for glycerol production needs further investigations 4 conclusions the study presented here demonstrated that glycol glycerol could stimulate diet within aggregates similar to that with ethanol as a primary substrate providing a possibility that alcohol compounds comprised of hydroxy groups could stimulate diet within aggregates this was likely because that initially metabolizing the hydroxy groups of alcohol compounds alcohol dehydrogenation proceeded nadh nad transformation by alcohol dehydrogenase and nadh quinone oxidoreductase which further supported the formation of extracellular electrical connection components e pili and mhcs in addition alcohol compounds comprised of more hydroxy groups could stimulate the better diet within aggregates providing a promising strategy for enhancing anaerobic digestion via optimizing the methanogenic substrates towards alcohol compounds comprised of more hydroxy groups for maximizing the potential of diet credit authorship contribution statement experiments were conceived and designed by zhiqiang zhao and yaobin zhang digesters were operated by
