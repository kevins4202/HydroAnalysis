9605,agriculture has by far the largest water footprint of human activities improving the water productivity of crop production is key to enhancing both water and food security irrigation is a significant pressure on water resources in the arid region of northwest china here we examine optimizing the regional cropping distribution within the heihe river basin for achieving the dual goals of improving productivity and reducing irrigation water demand the soil and water assessment tool swat and a cellular automata model are employed to model the processes of cropping pattern changes the optimization takes the maximum of crop water productivity cwp the maximum economic water productivity ewp and the maximum nutrient water productivity nwp as the objective function the model optimizes the spatial distribution of six crops including corn spring wheat spring barley spring canola polish alfalfa and upland cotton results show that under the premise of considering food security the maximization of water productivity for cwp ewp and nwp leads to the reduction of corn planting area and the eastward shift of corn planting region a significant decrease in the proportion of wheat planting occurs in the objective of ewp maximization while the planting proportion of barley and canola increased significantly all three optimization objectives yield cropping distributions that reduce the irrigation water demand of cultivated land and improve the water productivity of the basin among which maximizing cwp scenario has the greatest water saving intensity furthermore from the perspective of ecosystem services the cropping distribution of maximizing ewp is more reasonable for the basin different cropping change scenarios provide effective references for decision makers to make a reasonable cropping distribution in the region keywords regional cropping distribution swat model cellular automata model water productivity irrigation water demand ecosystem services value 1 introduction water is a fundamental human need and thus a critical natural resource that has broad implications on peoples livelihoods and strategic economic importance water shortage has the potential to greatly limit economic development and ecological civilization construction ecological civilization is a governmental framework for developing china s environmental laws and policies and technological innovations advocating harmonious coexistence between humans and nature meng et al 2021 in recent years the population explosion combined with unsustainable consumption has increased the stress and degradation of water resources fao 2020 moreover the uneven spatio temporal distribution of climate change and high intensity human activities further aggravate water shortage lu et al 2019 chen et al 2020 the growing risk of water shortages is already affecting agricultural production in many parts of the world especially in arid climates hornbeck and keskin 2014 li et al 2018 which is manifested as a reduction in crop yields sadati et al 2014 china the largest developing country in the world supports 19 of the world s population with only 8 of its agricultural arable land yang et al 2015 agriculture remains the largest user of water under the current development model which represents more than 90 of total global freshwater consumption yin et al 2020 agricultural irrigation will further aggravate the problem of water shortage in arid areas and deepen the divide between agricultural and ecological water use the heihe river basin located in the arid area of northwest china is a typical inland river basin the combination of water shortage and ecological deterioration is the major problem challenging the development of the regional economy niu et al 2019 the oasis in the middle reaches of the basin is a major commercial base of grain production in western china with 18 2 of the land area consuming 60 9 of the water resources of which agricultural water accounts for 92 of the total water use kang 2019 it greatly reduces the amount of available ecological water leading to the deterioration of the ecological environment in the lower reaches of the heihe river rounsevell et al 2010 it is thus essential to determine how to reduce the demand for irrigation water while ensuring regional food security and economic development given the growing population reducing the irrigated i e cropped area is increasingly impractical therefore it is essential to increase the productivity of existing irrigated areas and dryland farming crop water productivity cwp is defined as the grain yield per unit of water involved with production increasing cwp can thus help to alleviate the water crisis while ensuring food security sun et al 2017 however cwp does not account for the economics of production which is an important consideration for farmers in contrast the economic water productivity ewp is the gross economic return per unit of water use and thus an index that captures the economics of farming because cwp and ewp contain different information both are important metrics for regional water resource managers to consider when formulating planning policies zhao et al 2017 yu et al 2020 owusu sekyere et al 2017 it is also important to consider that food security includes not only quantity which can be measured in terms of cwp but also quality i e more nutrition per drop govender et al 2017 however the studies of the two are usually divided into different research disciplines and carried out in isolation the cwp is often considered within agricultural engineering while the latter is emphasized in nutrition and food science chibarabada et al 2017 mabhaudhi et al 2016a this means that there is often a lack of consideration of nutritional status in solving the problems of agricultural water shortage and food security the nutritional water productivity nwp proposed by renault and wallender 2000 quantitatively links crop water use crop production and nutrient requirements the importance of nwp is often heightened when a crisis situation occurs such as when food flows are reduced locally due to the closure of the border therefore the simultaneous consideration of cwp ewp and nwp allows for a more comprehensive and robust exploration when planning process for developing of regional agricultural water saving measures such as modifying the regional cropping distribution optimizing the regional cropping distribution in simple terms is a method to maximize the predetermined benefits of a region by adjusting the planting type area and spatial layout of crops li et al 2016 this method plays an important role in developing efficient of water saving agriculture niu et al 2016 zhang and guo 2016 wang et al 2012 varade1 and pate 2018 hao et al 2017 he et al 2020 for example li and guo 2014 built a multi objective cropping distribution model based on two level fractional programming and solved it using an interactive fuzzy programming method for the middle reaches of heihe river sara et al 2017 developed a linear model to optimize the cropping distribution of 28 crops in egypt with net annual return maximization as the objective function however at present the optimization of regional cropping distributions is mainly focused on adjusting the planting proportion of crops without considering spatially explicit changes in crop production across sub regions making it difficult to guide the agricultural planting practice hao et al 2017 proposed optimizing the regional cropping distribution based on a cross entropy method he et al 2020 combined cellular automata with a spatially distributed crop water consumption model to optimize the regional cropping distribution cellular automata are a grid dynamics model with discrete time space and state wang 2020 cellular automata do not have a fixed mathematical equation but rather determine the state of the cell at the next moment by conversion rules owing to its gridded nature cellular automata are easy to combine with remote sensing and spatially explicit simulation data and not limited by spatial scale al sharif and pradhan 2014 aburas et al 2016 so it is an effective tool for optimizing spatial patterns here we combine cellular automata and the soil water assessment tool swat hydrological model to optimize the crop cropping distributions of different crops in the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin the swat model is a distributed hydrological model that can effectively simulate crop growth guo et al 2018 samimi et al 2020 sinnathamby et al 2017 the swat model is used to simulate the water productivity of the main crops in the heihe river basin and a cropping suitability assessment is used to ensure the rationality of the cropping distributions with the minimum area as a constraint to guarantee the food security of the basin by adjusting the planting area and spatial distribution of corn spring wheat spring barley spring canola alfalfa and cotton latin name zea mays l triticum aestivum l hordeum vulgare linn brassica campestris l medicago sativa linn gossypium hirsutum linn the objectives of maximizing cwp ewp and nwp in the whole basin are achieved cropland as an important part of the natural ecosystem not only provides essential food fiber fuel other substances and energy but also supplies important ecosystem services swinton et al 2007 power 2010 as ecological problems are attracting increasing attention researchers monetize the value of ecosystem services i e ecosystem services value esv so as to more intuitively reflect the importance of cultivated land ecosystem function costanza et al 1997 li et al 2019a 2019b chen 2020 this serves as a warning against reducing irreversible damage to ecosystems for short term economic development at present most studies have evaluated the impact of land use change on cropland ecosystem services polasky et al 2011 song and deng 2015 fu et al 2016 but pay less attention to cropland ecosystem services caused by crop type changes liu et al 2017 aiming at improving regional water productivity this study optimizes crop cropping distribution which inevitably leads to the change of cropland esv therefore ecosystem service evaluation is introduced in this study to estimate the esv at the county and basin scales investigate the ecological sustainability of different optimization scenarios and provide a targeted basis for the formulation of cultivated land protection policies in different counties 2 study area the heihe river basin fig 1 is located in the middle of hexi corridor the heihe river is the second largest inland river in northwest china and the basin is characterized by a temperate continental climate zhang et al 2018 taking yingluoxia and zhengyixia hydrological stations as the dividing point the heihe river basin can be divided into upper middle and lower reaches the upstream area is located in the southern qilian mountains and has an average annual precipitation of more than 300 mm the main source of runoff in the middle reaches of heihe river is snowmelt in the upper reaches and precipitation the middle reach is an oasis plain area located in the mid latitude zone the annual average temperature is 6 8 c and the land is fertile abundant water resources and favorable climate environment make this area well suited for agricultural development liu et al 2015 the middle reach of the heihe river basin which is dominated by irrigated agriculture is the main water consuming area and runoff utilizing area yin et al 2012 the lower reaches of the river are desert areas where the climate is very dry in terms of administrative divisions the study area includes gaotai linze ganzhou minle shandan sunan qilian and suzhou counties most of which are subordinate to zhangye city in gansu province fig 1 more than 90 of the regional population grain production and gdp is concentrated in the oasis area of the middle reaches of the basin the middle reaches of the heihe river are the main grain and oil production bases in gansu with corn and wheat as the main crops 3 method and data we propose a comprehensive technical framework to optimize the cropping distribution and evaluate ecosystem services the overall procedure in this study is summarized in fig 2 which is described in detail below 3 1 swat model swat is a process based semi distributed hydrological model coupled with the simplified environmental policy integrated climate epic crop model the coupled swat epic model can be used to simulate the growth characteristics of regional crops making it a widely used crop growth related tool for crop yield and crop water productivity research padhiary et al 2020 sinnathamby et al 2017 liu et al 2020 the model first divides the watershed into sub basins according to topographic data which are further sub divided into homogeneous hydrological response units hru that represent landscapes with unique combinations of land use soil and slope by simulating leaf growth light interception and the conversion of light energy to biomass the epic model simulates the potential biomass of a plant every day under ideal growth conditions i e adequate supply of water and nutrient and favorable climate under the constraint of temperature stress water stress and nutrient stress the model simulates the actual growth status of crops in this study the auto fertilization mode of the model is adopted so the crop growth only considers water and temperature stress without nutrient stress among them water stress is simulated by comparing the potential evapotranspiration of crops with the actual evapotranspiration while temperature stress is a function of the optimal temperature for crop growth and the daily average temperature the actual biomass increment is the product of a potential increment and growth factors the potential biomass increment is related to leaf area index lai and the total amount of solar radiation intercepted that day and the growth factors are quantified by stress the model calculates the actual crop yield by multiplying the actual above ground biomass on the harvest day by the harvest index while the harvest index is a function of accumulated heat meanwhile determination of irrigation water demand by agricultural crops is based on the soil water balance for this work we use the established and calibrated swat model described in niu et al 2018 in their study the upper middle heihe river basin was divided into 34 sub basins and 1613 hru in addition using the optimization algorithm of the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2004 the swat epic model was calibrated and validated for runoff evapotranspiration and crop yield of corn spring wheat spring barley and spring canola polish here to enable a more comprehensive assessment we further calibrate swat epic for alfalfa and cotton the yield data of cotton is obtained from zhangye statistic yearbook for the period of 2005 2014 the alfalfa yield for period 2011 2013 is obtained from zhu et al 2014 while that in 2014 from li et al 2019a 2019b referring to the sensitive parameters used in crop module calibration in nair et al 2011 and sinnathamby et al 2017 twelve crop parameters bio e hvsti blai frgrw1 laimx1 frgrw2 laimx2 dlai t base gsi ext coef chtmx with the highest sensitivity through manual sensitivity analysis are selected for the optimization among the twelve parameters the bio e hvsti ext coef and chtmx directly affect biomass crop yield and height the six parameters blai dlai frgrw1 laimx1 frgrw2 and laimx2 are the crucial parameters to quantify the change of leaf area index lai during crop growing season the t base and gsi respectively control the length of growing season and evapotranspiration processes the default values of the model for the rest crop parameters with the low sensitivity are adopted mean relative error mre relatively root mean square error rrmse and relative bias index pbias are used to determine the performance of the model which are given as 1 m r e i 1 n y s i y o i y o i n 2 r r m s e i 1 n y o i y s i 2 n y o 3 p b i a s i 1 n y s i y o i i 1 n y o i where y o i stands for the observed yield value y s i represents simulated value y o is the average value of observations and n is the number of time positions in order to effectively simulate the growth state of different crops in each cultivated land of the basin we construct six swat projects and we consider that there is only one type of crop planted on all cultivated land in each project the crops parameter values of corn wheat barley and canola are obtained from the study of niu et al 2018 and that of alfalfa and cotton is obtained from the calibration results of this study the relevant parameter values are displayed in the results section 3 2 crop suitability assessment crop suitability assessment is a qualitative and quantitative evaluation process for the suitability of planting a certain crop in a specific region crop suitability can quantify the effect of spatial variation factors on crop growth and is the main basis for crop selection in the process of optimizing the regional cropping distribution jayathilaka et al 2012 its main purpose is to predict the potential and limitations of land for crop production pan and pan 2012 girmay et al 2018 the suitability of crops at a certain location can be measured by a suitability index which is the product of membership value and index weight and the value is between 0 and 1 climate topography and soil characteristics are the main factors affecting crop suitability mcdowell et al 2017 in general based on the availability of data evaluation indicators will be selected from these three types of factors peng 2016 in swat the input climate factors include precipitation temperature wind speed humidity and solar radiation the crop yield output of the model is the best variable to explain the suitability of various types of crops to these meteorological factors egbebiyi et al 2019 ramírez villegas et al 2011 therefore meteorological factors are not considered in the crop suitability assessment in this study and only topography and soil characteristics are taken as the main parameters in the evaluation index system the two topographic factors are altitude and slope respectively soil characteristics include soil texture bulk density ph value and five factors considered in the process of soil nutrient classification total nitrogen alkali hydrolyzable nitrogen available phosphorus available potassium and organic matter the classification of soil texture is based on the international classification standard and the spatial distribution of soil clay silt and sand content in the heihe river basin partial least squares pls regression analysis can effectively calculate the contribution rate of each evaluation index to the change of cwp li 2019 shi et al 2013 importance of variable projection vip and the multiple correlation coefficient of pls regression model are two main parameters which are calculated by simca p and spss software respectively the specific calculation formula of contribution rate is as follows 4 w i v i p i i 1 n v i p i r 100 where w i is the contribution rate of the i th index to cwp vip i is the vip value of the i th factor r is the multiple correlation coefficient of pls regression model and n is the number of indicators in the pls model in this study a 30 m 30 m grid cell is taken as the evaluation unit with the contribution rate as index weigh meanwhile the membership value is determined by reference to the empirical data of crop planting in the study area and the historical data summarized in papers and books cri 2013 deng et al 2004 lin 2002 yang 2009 cao 2002 zhang et al 2004 finally the suitability index is divided into five grades from high to low by the natural breakpoint classification method the lower the grade the higher the suitability suitability evaluation can compare the suitability of the same crop planted in different geographical locations and the suitability of different crops planted in the same location providing the necessary data basis for the optimization of cropping distribution 3 3 water productivity cwp combines physical accounting of water with yield to indicate the value of a unit of water swat model takes hru as the unit to output crop yield and evapotranspiration cwp at hru scale can be calculated as 5 c w p y 10 a e t where cwp is crop water productivity in kg m3 y is the crop yield per unit area in kg ha aet is actual evapotranspiration in mm the factor 10 is meant to convert water depths in mm into water volumes per land surface in m3 ha the crops considered here have vastly different yields on a mass per unit area basis because which represents a source of bias in the cwp optimization therefore yield is replaced by equivalent yield in the calculation of cwp in this study liu et al 2019 singh et al 2020 corn the crop with the largest planting area in the study area is taken as the reference crop the conversion coefficients of wheat barley canola alfalfa and cotton are 1 27 1 64 3 85 0 71 4 17 as the primary goal of farmers is to achieve optimal income and profitability economic issues must be considered in addition to cwp ewp is the ratio of crop value per unit to evapotranspiration gang et al 2012 6 e w p y n p 10 a e t where ewp is economic water productivity in yuan m3 np is net profit per unit of crop yield in yuan kg the np value of corn wheat canola and cotton is calculated by dividing the difference of gross profit and cost by the total yield the relevant data of these four crops derives from price department of national development and reform commission pdndrc 2016 which are shown in table 1 an np value of 1 15 yuan kg is used for alfalfa is following zhu et al 2014 meanwhile the np of barley is obtained from the faostat http www fao org faostat zh data where faostat is lacking data for barley in 2015 we take annual values of economic values from 2012 to 2014 as nouri et al 2020 did in their study mabhaudhi et al 2016b stated to meaningfully address food and nutrition security there is a need for an index that combines aspects of water use crop production human nutrition and food access which summarizes the motivation of renault and wallender 2000 for proposing the nwp in nutrition guidelines and food surveys it is common to consider three indicators energy protein and fat renault and wallender 2000 the analysis of water requirements per unit of energy can provide a theoretical reference for the adjustment of human dietary structure sun et al 2016 therefore energy per kilogram of crops is taken as the nutritional value nv in this study energy is a computed value obtained by adding the product of each energy supplying nutrient protein fat carbohydrates and the corresponding energy conversion coefficient kilocalorie kcal is the unit of energy in nutrition 1 kcal 4 184 kj in this study the energy is expressed in kj the energy conversion coefficients of protein fat and carbohydrate are 4 kcal g 9 kcal g and 4 kcal g respectively yang et al 2018 the contents of energy supplying nutrients and energy values in crops are presented in table 2 nutrient element contents of corn wheat and barley are obtained from zheng 2004 while that of canola gets from the data collected by wang 2016 the calculation formula of nwp is as follows 7 n w p y n v 10 a e t where nwp is the nutrient water productivity in kj kg 3 4 cellular automation model based on cellular automata ca an optimization model of cropping distribution is established in the upper middle reaches of heihe river basin ca is a dynamic simulation model which represents the space as cellular matrix where each cell has its own state wijesekara et al 2012 for example the crop type defined numerically represents the state of the cell at the moment cellular automata consists of five parts cell cell space neighbor ruleset and time moreno et al 2009 the optimization model takes crop planting area irrigation water demand and planting suitability as the constraint conditions the maximization of cwp ewp and nwp are implemented in separate model runs for each model run the maximization of the respective metric is set as the objective function to drive the optimization to obtain the spatial distribution of six crops in the study alfalfa and cotton are forage crops and textile raw material respectively therefore when the maximum nwp is taken as the optimization goal we do not consider the spatial optimization of alfalfa and cotton keeping their spatial layout the same as cropping distribution of maximizing ewp as water productivity and irrigation water demand data is based on hru the raster calculator tool in arcgis software is used to extract the data from the hru into the grid in this study the grid cell of crop planting and the matrix of grid cells for the whole study area are taken as the cell and cell space respectively meanwhile the neighbors of each cell are taken as the moore type that is the eight cells immediately adjacent to the central one the conversion ruleset is the core of ca and the main basis for determining the next state of each cell considering the value of the neighborhood and the constraints set in the model the specific framework of ca model is expressed by the following formula 8 v m n t 1 v m n c s m n x w p m n x i m n x n m n x t x 1 2 6 where v m n t 1 and v m n t represents the state of the cell in row m and column n of the cellular matrix at time t 1 and t respectively c s m n x t represents the crop suitability of crop x in row m and column n at time t w p m n x t is water productivity of crop x in row m and column n at time t i m n x t is iwd of crop x in row m and column n at time t n m n x t represents the number of neighbors that meet the requirements the conversion rules of the model include two processes judgement and conversion the model first judges whether the grid can be converted to another crop this process is based on crop specific planting area constraints i e a minimum requirement suitability and neighborhood status in that part the lower bound of the fourth grade is chosen as threshold value for each crop suitability then the conversion priority of these crops in the same cell is determined by the objective function that is the crop planted in the grid is converted to the crop with the highest water productivity according to random order the conversion rules are iterated to each grid cell meanwhile only one crop per grid cell is taken as the basic constraint objective functions of three optimization scenarios and relevant constraints of the optimization model are described as follows the average of cwp ewp and nwp of the whole study area are separately used as the objective function for different optimization scenarios 9 scenario 1 max a c w p m 1 m n 1 n x 1 x c w p m n x k m n t n 10 scenario 2 max a e w p m 1 m n 1 n x 1 x e w p m n x k m n t n 11 scenario 3 max a n w p m 1 m n 1 n x 1 x n w p m n x k m n t n where acwp aewp and anwp respectively represent regional average of cwp ewp and nwp m and n respectively represent the total number of rows and columns of the grid generated by cropping distribution of the study area x represents the total number of crop types which is 6 in this study k m n is crop planting coefficient representing whether there is a crop planted in a cell if crops are planted in a cell the crop planting coefficient is 1 otherwise it is 0 tn is the total number of grids with crop planted in the original cropping distribution planting area constraint according to zhangye statistic yearbook in 2015 the resident population of zhangye city is 1 22 106 referring to the setting of food security in zhang et al 2016 the minimum annual per capita demand for wheat is 250 kg while corn is 100 kg meanwhile zhangye exports 60 of corn yield and imports 30 of wheat every year to support the local agricultural economy and food demand based on the crop yield data we calculate that the corn and wheat yield should not be reduced by more than 50 and 30 between year 2005 and 2015 the minimum planting area of barley and canola is 1 13 104 ha in 2010 and 1 26 104 ha in 2007 respectively which decreases about by 30 and 20 respectively compared with 2015 therefore changeable planting proportion of corn wheat barley and canola is set as 0 5 0 3 0 3 and 0 2 in addition the minimum planting area of cotton is 0 87 in 2015 so we only set changeable planting proportion of cotton as 0 05 due to the lack of multi year statistical data of alfalfa allowable change proportion of alfalfa is set as 0 1 based on its planting proportion furthermore the sum of the area assigned to crop cannot exceed the total cultivated area 12 x 1 x c n x t n 13 t n x 1 α x c n x t n x 1 α x where c n x is the total number of grids for crop x in the optimized cropping distribution t n x is the total grid number of crop x in the original cropping distribution α x is the allowable change proportion of crop planting area of crop x irrigation water constraint the iwd of the optimized cropping distribution cannot exceed that of the original cropping distribution 14 m 1 m n 1 n x 1 x i m n x k m n x t i where ti is iwd of the original cropping distribution neighbor constraint when the number of neighbors with crop planted is not less than 2 crop can be planted in the central grid this constraint can effectively improve the agricultural concentration 15 n m n k m n 2 where n m n is the number of neighbors with crop planted the whole optimization model is implemented using matlab r2016a the mathworks inc natick ma usa the model takes the cropping distribution of the heihe river basin in 2015 as the initial state the data loaded in the model includes cropping distribution distribution of crop suitability number of neighbors spatial distribution of cwp ewp nwp and iwd of different crops in the judgment part a crop suitability level greater than 4 indicates that the grid is unsuitable for crop growth when the conversion rules are iterated to the whole cellular space in a random order the iwd of the cropping distribution is calculated if the value is less than the iwd of original cropping distribution the optimization is completed otherwise the grid cells of the whole watershed are arranged in the order of iwd from largest to smallest and the crop in the grid is converted to one with less iwd in this order until the iwd of the whole basin is less than that of the original cropping distribution the whole optimization process ends the flow chart of cropping distribution optimization model is summarized in fig 3 3 5 ecosystem services evaluation ecosystem services can be interpreted as the benefits that humans derive directly or indirectly from ecosystem functions which refer to the habitats biological or system properties or processes of ecosystems costanza et al 1997 scientifically described the principles and methods of ecosystem services evaluation however this method underestimates the esv of croplands in china therefore according to china s ecosystem and socio economic development xie et al 2008 improved the costanza based evaluation method and proposed an equivalent weight table of esv suitable for china xie et al 2008 reclassified ecosystem services into nine items food production raw material production climate regulation gas regulation waste regulation hydrological regulation biodiversity maintenance soil conservation and landscaping they fell into four categories supply service regulation service support service and cultural service this study mainly focuses on the total esv referring to the study of liu et al 2017 we set the equivalent weight factor of each crop as the equivalent weight factor of farmland while the economic value of one equivalent weight factor of esv is equal to 1 7 of the market value of 1 ha of the corresponding crop the formula of total esv of each crop are as follows 16 u a e v i j e f i j u a m v i j 1 7 17 e v s i j 1 9 c p a s i u a e v i j where u a m v i j and u a e v i j respectively represents the market value and value of ecosystem service j by 1 ha of crop i e f i j is equivalent weight factor of the value of ecosystem service j of crop i c p a s i is planting area of crop i in scenario s e v s i represents the total ecosystem service value of crop i in scenario s 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation the swat model including the calibration and validation of crop parameters for corn wheat barley and canola was completed in the study of niu et al 2018 these parameters are used directly in this study and the yield of alfalfa and cotton is calibrated and validated table 3 lists the calibrated results of crop parameters for cotton and alfalfa in the calibration process different modified steps are used for different parameters the modified step of blai bio e and t base is 1 while that of gis and hvsti is 0 001 and 0 02 respectively and 0 05 for other seven parameters fig 4 shows the model performance statistics result and graphical comparisons between the simulated crop yield and observed yield the statistics show that the mre of alfalfa and cotton is less than 20 the rrmse and pbias values of alfalfa both are below 0 1 and these two indices for cotton are not more than 0 26 meanwhile fig 4 demonstrates the simulated results are in good agreement with the observed yield of crops in general the calibrated swat model can simulate crop production well in the upper middle reaches of heihe river basin 4 2 spatial distribution of crop suitability the crop suitability assessment in this study is composed of ten indices related to topographic factors and soil characteristics firstly according to the international classification standard of soil texture and the distribution data of clay silt and sand the soil texture of study area is divided into seven types as shown in fig 5 d loam and clay loam are mainly distributed in the upper reaches of heihe river basin in the western central and eastern region of the middle reach the dominant soil textures are sandy loam silty loam and silty clay loam respectively according to the empirical data obtained from previous studies the index grades are divided and the membership values are given to each grade table 4 shows the weights of each evaluation index determined by pls regression analysis it is observed from table 4 the weight of elevation of alfalfa corn and cotton is the largest the weight of soil texture of wheat is the largest while the weight of slope is smallest meanwhile there is no significant difference in the weight of each index for barley and canola according to the membership and index weight the suitability index of different crops is calculated on each grid unit fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of suitability for six crop species in the upper middle reaches of heihe river basin the suitability index for corn wheat barley canola alfalfa cotton is 0 34 0 84 0 37 0 90 0 33 0 99 0 35 0 98 0 47 0 95 0 43 0 93 it can be observed from fig 6 when taking topographic factors and soil properties as evaluation indexes the most suitable planting areas for corn wheat alfalfa and cotton is in the central and western regions of the middle reaches of heihe river basin canola and barley are more suitable to be planted in the eastern part of the middle reaches and the cultivated land of the upper reaches in the judgment part of cropping distribution optimization thresholds of suitability screening for corn wheat barley canola alfalfa and cotton are 0 51 0 56 0 51 0 52 0 59 and 0 58 respectively 4 3 optimization of cropping distribution corn wheat barley and canola are the main grain and oil crops in the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin and they collectively account for more than 60 of the total cropped area zmbs 2012 corn with the largest planting area is mainly distributed in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin ganzhou linze and gaotai counties are the most densely planted counties the distribution of wheat crops is relatively scattered and the planting area of shandan and minle counties is the largest meanwhile minle and shandan counties are the primary barley growing areas the cultivated land in the southwest of shandan and minle counties is mainly occupied by canola the farmland in the upper reach is a patchwork of fields with barley and canola alfalfa and cotton each accounted for only a small proportion 3 of the planting area as shown in figs 7 b and 8 b when the crop water productivity is taken as the optimization objective planting patterns change dramatically except for corn the acreage of the other five crops increases to varying degrees the planting proportion of corn decreases from about 66 to 55 the whole planting area of corn transfers to the southeast that is shandan and minle counties become the main corn planting areas after optimization the planting area of wheat transfers from the southeast to central ganzhou county and western gaotai and sunan with more acreage in the latter the main production area of barley is also transferred from the east to the west in the middle reaches in ganzhou linze gaotai sunan and suzhou counties barley is planted in a large area after optimization meanwhile most of the cultivated land in the upper reaches of heihe river is also occupied by barley except for a small part of the canola retained in the southeast of minle large quantities of canola are planted in gaotai and linze under this optimization scenario the planting area of wheat barley and canola all expand more than 30 over their original planting areas table 5 zheng and tan 2016 also indicated that appropriate expansion of wheat planting area in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin can improve the regional cwp the planting of alfalfa is still scattered but different from its original distribution the planting proportion in shandan and qilian counties increases significantly after optimization the planting layout of cotton is concentrated in ganzhou county which accounts for more than half of the total cotton planting area as shown in fig 8 b the spatial distribution of iwd after optimization with the goal of maximizing cwp is provided in fig 9 b compared with the original cropping distribution the iwd in the upper reaches shows little change and the value is still 250 mm in the middle reaches the change of iwd shows different trends in the east and west the iwd in the central and western regions decreases significantly after optimization the iwd of most areas decreases from 450 550 mm to 250 350 mm or 350 450 mm while in the eastern region the iwd is higher than the original cropping distribution and the value in most areas increases from 250 350 mm to 350 450 mm this is mainly due to corn becoming the main crop planted in the region after optimization however from the perspective of the whole basin the optimized cropping distribution reduces iwd by 0 07 km3 5 6 compared with the original cropping distribution the spatial distribution of cwp before and after optimization are shown in fig 10 a and b respectively east of the administrative boundary between ganzhou and linze there is no change in the cwp grade in most area cwp markedly increases only in two regions which are the west of ganzhou and the south of shandan and minle counties the cwp of the former increases from 1 0 1 2 kg m3 to above 1 2 kg m3 and the value even exceeds 1 6 kg m3 in some areas the cwp of the latter increases from below 0 8 kg m3 to above 1 0 kg m3 meanwhile the cwp in most western regions increases significantly to above 1 6 kg m3 cwp decreases only in a few areas of linze and gaotai which is attributed to the fact that these areas became canola planting areas with relatively smaller cwp value the cwp of all crop species increases compared with that before optimization the cwp of canola increases the most with more than 30 the distribution and statistical results of cropping distribution for maximizing ewp is presented in figs 7 c and 8 c in the optimized cropping distribution corn still accounts for the largest proportion but the planting proportion decreases to about 60 the main planting area of corn is still in ganzhou but the planting proportion is decreased the significant increase of corn area occurrs in minle and shandan counties as a whole the corn planting area transfers from west to east crops with reduced acreage also include wheat the planting proportion of which decreases from 9 0 to 6 8 this is because the economic benefit value of wheat is the smallest which is only 0 84 yuan kg meanwhile about 30 of wheat is transferred to gaotai county making it the main wheat growing area because barley and canola had higher economic benefits the planting area of both increases significantly in the whole agricultural area part of the planting areas of them also transfers from shandan county to ganzhou and the west of ganzhou alfalfa shows a more uniform distribution and there is little difference in planting proportion among counties ganzhou still has the largest cotton planting area with planting proportion increasing from 27 to 67 on the crop planting map with the maximum ewp we find that large areas of corn crops are replaced with barley wheat and canola in the west of the boundary between ganzhou and linze counties which leads to significant reduction of iwd in these areas different from the scenario of maximizing cwp corn is still planted in the south of suzhou and gaotai counties so the iwd has not changed there in both the east and west sides of ganzhou district a portion of corn is replaced by barley so the irrigation water decreases from 350 450 mm to 250 350 mm in the mixed planting region of barley and canola in the middle of minle county the iwd is maintained at 250 350 mm level or decreases to below 250 mm however there is increased iwd in other areas west of middle reaches on the whole basin the iwd of the optimized cropping distribution is 1 21 km3 which saves 0 04 km3 compared with the original cropping distribution but the water saving intensity is less than the scenario of maximizing cwp after optimizing the cropping distribution based on maximizing ewp except shandan county the ewp of other counties increases to varying degrees in the west side of the administrative boundary between ganzhou and linze counties the ewp increases most obviously with the value rising to 2 2 yuan m3 increasing the planting area of barley effectively improves the economic benefits of the western region after the optimization of cropping distribution the ewp of barley canola and cotton all increases by more than 10 the ewp of wheat increases to 1 12 yuan m3 while that of alfalfa and corn change slightly based on the predetermination of alfalfa and cotton layout the spatial distributions of corn wheat barley and canola are optimized the result of which is shown in fig 7 d the cultivated land in qilian county is occupied by barley canola and alfalfa after optimization meanwhile the planting proportion of canola increases to 5 8 which is nearly 20 higher than the original area and the canola is mainly scattered in shandan and minle counties the rest of the cultivated land in shandan and minle counties are mainly planted with corn and barley wheat planting areas are transferred to the middle reaches of the heihe river basin and gaotai county has the largest proportion of planting with the value about 33 the distribution of iwd also changes significantly after optimization with nwp maximization as the objective which are similar to that of cropping distribution of maximizing cwp the obvious difference between these two scenarios appears in the eastern part of the middle reaches when the cwp is maximized iwd at 250 350 mm appears more in the middle of ganzhou and the west of minle while when the nwp is maximized the iwd of this grade is mainly distributed in the southeast of minle and shandan county in this scenario the iwd of the whole study area decreases by 0 06 km3 4 8 therefore this scenario also effectively reduces the iwd of regional cultivated land the highest optimized values of nwp in the whole basin are concentrated in parts of gaotai suzhou counties where nwp increases from below 2 2 104 kj m3 to above 2 5 104 kj m3 the regions where the nwp increases by one grade are concentrated in the north and south sides of linze county in the western part of ganzhou county the nwp of most farmland rises from below 1 8 104 kj m3 to above 2 0 104 kj m3 while the nwp in central and eastern regions basically are unchanged in contrast to the increasing trend of nwp in the west the nwp in minle and shandan counties decreases slightly the nwp basically decreases two grades 1 5 104 1 8 104 kj m3 and 1 8 104 2 0 104 kj m3 this decrease does not reverse the overall basin wide increase after optimization the nwp of wheat increases the most about 31 and the nwp of barley corn and canola also increases in different degrees increasing by 9 4 and 15 respectively see table 6 4 4 changes in ecosystem services value different from the study of liu et al 2017 this study uses simulated crop yield and unit price of each crop to calculate the market price of the crop per unit area realizing the spatialization of esv fig 11 shows the changes of esv per unit area esvp of six crops in each county after the optimization of cropping distribution it can be found that the esvp of canola in ganzhou linze gaotai and suzhou counties and alfalfa crops in qilian county change by more than 1000 usd ha which is due to they grow out of nothing in the optimization process in addition the esvp of different crops in the basin changes in the range of 300 700 usd ha among which the esvp of wheat in suzhou minle and cotton in ganzhou increases most significantly the esvp of cotton in sunan and alfalfa in suzhou decreases significantly after optimization under the scenarios of maximizing ewp and nwp the esvp of cotton in shandan county decreases by nearly 300 usd ha fig 12 shows the changes of esv in the three optimization scenarios compared with the original scenario the increase and decrease of esv is interspersed in the whole basin the increase area of esv mainly occurrs in shandan and minle counties in the east while the transformation from canola to corn crops in the south of shandan results in negative growth of esv the farmland of four counties ganzhou linze gaotai and suzhou in the central and western regions is covered by esv reduction areas this overlapped with the area where the crop type changes from corn to barley obviously these two types of crop transformation are the main reason for the reduction of regional esv on the county scale three different optimization objectives all bright significant improvement in the esv of shandan and qilian counties ganzhou county has no obvious esv change when the regional cwp is the maximum while the esv increases by 4 107 usd and decreases by 6 107 usd respectively in scenario 2 maximizing regional ewp and scenario 3 maximizing regional nwp after the optimization of cropping distribution gaotai and linze both counties show a trend of esv reduction of which reduction quantity reaches a maximum more than 6 107 usd in optimization scenario 3 on the watershed scale the maximization of cwp decreases the esv of the whole basin by 6 18 107 usd 18 the maximization of ewp and nwp improve the esv of the whole basin with the value increasing by 4 46 107 usd 13 6 and 1 48 107 usd 5 1 respectively 5 discussion our main goal in this work is to optimize the regional cropping distribution to improve water productivity three separate optimizations each with a different objective function maximizing each of cwp ewp and nwp are implemented to optimize corn wheat barley canola alfalfa and cotton crop distributions relative to their 2015 extents using iwd and crop suitability as constraints according to pabuayon et al 2019 and araya et al 2019 enhancing cwp is an important measure for agricultural sector to deal with the dual challenges of food demand growth and water resource shortage therefore this study sets the regional cwp maximization as the objective function of scenario 1 to drive the cropping distribution optimization model the results shows that the cwp of six main crops in heihe river basin increased in varying degrees and the biggest increase is of cwp of canola as more than 30 correspondingly the planting area and spatial distribution of crops also changes the planting scale of corn in the west of the middle reaches decreases and more concentrates in minle and shandan counties the planting area of barley mainly moves to the west of ganzhou the main wheat planting areas are also transferred to gan lin gao ganzhou linze and gaotai region sunan county and suzhou district in the west it has been indicated that cwp exhibit high temporal and spatial variability under the influence of climatic and agricultural factors mdemu et al 2009 kukal and irmak 2017 our study verifies this theory and demonstrates that the adjustment of crop cropping distribution can effectively improve regional cwp meanwhile cwp can be further improved with regulated deficit irrigation adeboye et al 2015 hunsaker et al 2015 greaves and wang 2017 therefore future studies can consider the growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies based on the optimization results realizing all round improvement of regional cwp a sustainable farming scheme should not only consider the timing of plantation and spatial distribution of crops but also crops nutritional and economic productivity schyns and hoekstra 2014 davis et al 2017 therefore in scenario 2 and scenario 3 the objectives are to maximize ewp and nwp respectively when the regional ewp is maximized except for corn and alfalfa the proportion of the other four crops in the central and western regions of the middle reaches is significantly increased the adjustment of cropping distribution has a positive effect on the ewp of crops bringing marked increase in the ewp of barley cotton and canola the pre post optimization differences shows that there is development space for crops ewp in each production area this provides a reference for the selection and development of crop producing areas and provides a scientific basis for the further socio economic optimization of the whole basin however there is high uncertainty in crop markets and the economic benefits of crops often fluctuate zimmer 2016 alemanya et al 2021 in the future work the economic model covering the change of nwp value can be introduced into the optimization model to realize the dynamic optimization of regional ewp scenario 3 completes the optimization of cropping distributions with the goal of maximizing regional nwp the results show that the nwp of wheat increases to 1 3 times of the former and there is about 15 increase occurring in the nwp of canola nodoushan et al 2020 demonstrated that combining diet change and import policy could reduce internal blue water footprint of a country it is of guiding significance to alleviate water shortage in arid area shtull trauring and bernstein 2018 meanwhile any new diet change and suggestions are based on regional water productivity therefore through the optimization of regional nwp this study considers the nutrition outcomes into the food production which can effectively address the challenge of producing more nutritious food under water shortage all optimized cropping distributions effectively reduce the iwd of whole study area with cwp showing the largest reduction of iwd meanwhile the optimized cropping distribution transfers the corn crops with high water consumption to the eastern region of the middle reaches of heihe river that is the pressure of iwd is transferred from the counties with serious water shortage gaotai and linze to the counties with relatively lower water stress shandan and minle zhang et al 2015 it effectively alleviates the serious water shortage in the central and western areas of heihe river basin and the overexploitation of groundwater in gaotai county lian 2011 factors affecting irrigation water demand include climate factors and human activities kirby et al 2016 iglesias and garrote 2015 in recent years there has been increasing human intervention occurring in agricultural irrigation wang and qin 2017 li et al 2020 among them adjusting the planting mode and improving the irrigation water management are effective measures to reduce irrigation water demand mehta et al 2013 this is also the main approach to further reduce irrigation water demand in heihe river basin on the basis of optimized regional cropping distribution in our optimization we focus on maximizing regional water productivity weakening the reduction of iwd so the iwd after optimization is only reduced by about 5 in addition zou et al 2018 and li et al 2019a 2019b respectively pointed out soil characteristics and agricultural management practices are main driving factors affecting iwd and regional water productivity therefore reasonable improvement of soil environment and agricultural management is an effective way to enhance crop suitability and further increase regional water saving efforts and water productivity the crop suitability assessment is a key constraint to determine the suitable planting areas of different crops in the process of cropping distribution optimization in this study ten factors related to topography and soil characteristics altitude slope soil texture bulk density ph total nitrogen alkali hydrolyzable nitrogen available phosphorus available potassium and organic matter are chosen as evaluation indexes to calculate suitability index the suitability index for corn wheat barley canola alfalfa and cotton are 0 34 0 84 0 37 0 90 0 33 0 99 0 35 0 98 0 47 0 95 and 0 43 0 93 respectively from the perspective of spatial distribution the most suitable planting areas of corn wheat alfalfa and cotton are in the middle and western regions of middle reaches of the heihe river while canola and barley are more suitable for planting in the eastern of middle reaches and upper reaches of the heihe river basin hailu et al 2015 reported that soil organic matter som content and total nitrogen tn were found to be the limiting factors for wheat and barley crop production in this study som and total nitrogen of wheat has higher suitability index proportion which verifies this theory however the scattered and few planting characteristics of barley make this feature not prominent therefore applying regional management and conservation measures soil and water conservation soil fertility management can effectively improve the suitability of land units particularly for marginal and unsuitable lands tesfay et al 2017 alemu et al 2013 girmay et al 2018 the local government can actively take corresponding policies to expand the suitable area of various types of crops which has a positive effect on optimizing the cropping distribution of the whole region and enhancing regional water productivity in order to evaluate the rationality and sustainability of different optimization scenarios the market value method is applied to estimate and compare the esv of crop cropping distribution before and after optimization the esv of different counties show different changing tendency in the process of crop cropping distribution optimization the central and western counties in the middle reaches of the basin are the main negative growth areas of esv therefore when changing cropping distribution for improving regional water productivity more attention should be paid to the ecosystem function of the central and western regions in the middle reaches of the heihe river for avoiding ecological hidden dangers in these counties scientific planting technology and efficient management can be used to improve the esv of these areas after the optimization of cropping distribution cai et al 2020 the esv of the basin is effectively improved in the two scenarios of maximizing ewp and nwp and the former increases more therefore in the three optimization scenarios the maximizing ewp is more reasonable from the perspective of ecosystem services high standard farmland construction is a powerful measure to improve the service capacity of cultivated land ecosystem tang et al 2015 which can be used to alleviates the decline of esv in maximizing cwp scenario 6 conclusion in this study the swat and cellular automata model in conjunction with the crop suitability assessment are combined to construct a cropping distribution optimization model the maximization of cwp ewp and nwp are separately set as the objective function to drive the optimization model with the goal of optimizing the regional cropping distribution we present a case study of the proposed model in upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin in addition the regional esv is calculated to evaluate three optimization scenarios from an ecologically sustainable perspective optimizing the cropping distribution can increase water productivity in the heihe river basin and relieve the water pressure in the western part of the basin we consider cwp ewp and nwp to enable a more comprehensive assessment that accounts for additional socio economic factors of the three cwp shows the greatest water saving potential which is more suitable for dealing with dry years and can alleviate the regional irrigation water pressure to the greatest extent on the premise of ensuring crop yield optimizing the regional cropping distribution with the maximum of ewp is an effective measure to improve the agricultural economic benefit of the basin which can simultaneously promote the development of regional agricultural economy and the growth of regional esv the setting of the scenario of maximizing the nwp provides a guarantee for the government to effectively deal with regional food security when facing a certain social crisis in general the crop cropping distribution of maximizing ewp is more suitable for the heihe river basin in ordinary years the three optimization schemes provide theoretical basis and decision support for decision makers to promote regional

9605,agriculture has by far the largest water footprint of human activities improving the water productivity of crop production is key to enhancing both water and food security irrigation is a significant pressure on water resources in the arid region of northwest china here we examine optimizing the regional cropping distribution within the heihe river basin for achieving the dual goals of improving productivity and reducing irrigation water demand the soil and water assessment tool swat and a cellular automata model are employed to model the processes of cropping pattern changes the optimization takes the maximum of crop water productivity cwp the maximum economic water productivity ewp and the maximum nutrient water productivity nwp as the objective function the model optimizes the spatial distribution of six crops including corn spring wheat spring barley spring canola polish alfalfa and upland cotton results show that under the premise of considering food security the maximization of water productivity for cwp ewp and nwp leads to the reduction of corn planting area and the eastward shift of corn planting region a significant decrease in the proportion of wheat planting occurs in the objective of ewp maximization while the planting proportion of barley and canola increased significantly all three optimization objectives yield cropping distributions that reduce the irrigation water demand of cultivated land and improve the water productivity of the basin among which maximizing cwp scenario has the greatest water saving intensity furthermore from the perspective of ecosystem services the cropping distribution of maximizing ewp is more reasonable for the basin different cropping change scenarios provide effective references for decision makers to make a reasonable cropping distribution in the region keywords regional cropping distribution swat model cellular automata model water productivity irrigation water demand ecosystem services value 1 introduction water is a fundamental human need and thus a critical natural resource that has broad implications on peoples livelihoods and strategic economic importance water shortage has the potential to greatly limit economic development and ecological civilization construction ecological civilization is a governmental framework for developing china s environmental laws and policies and technological innovations advocating harmonious coexistence between humans and nature meng et al 2021 in recent years the population explosion combined with unsustainable consumption has increased the stress and degradation of water resources fao 2020 moreover the uneven spatio temporal distribution of climate change and high intensity human activities further aggravate water shortage lu et al 2019 chen et al 2020 the growing risk of water shortages is already affecting agricultural production in many parts of the world especially in arid climates hornbeck and keskin 2014 li et al 2018 which is manifested as a reduction in crop yields sadati et al 2014 china the largest developing country in the world supports 19 of the world s population with only 8 of its agricultural arable land yang et al 2015 agriculture remains the largest user of water under the current development model which represents more than 90 of total global freshwater consumption yin et al 2020 agricultural irrigation will further aggravate the problem of water shortage in arid areas and deepen the divide between agricultural and ecological water use the heihe river basin located in the arid area of northwest china is a typical inland river basin the combination of water shortage and ecological deterioration is the major problem challenging the development of the regional economy niu et al 2019 the oasis in the middle reaches of the basin is a major commercial base of grain production in western china with 18 2 of the land area consuming 60 9 of the water resources of which agricultural water accounts for 92 of the total water use kang 2019 it greatly reduces the amount of available ecological water leading to the deterioration of the ecological environment in the lower reaches of the heihe river rounsevell et al 2010 it is thus essential to determine how to reduce the demand for irrigation water while ensuring regional food security and economic development given the growing population reducing the irrigated i e cropped area is increasingly impractical therefore it is essential to increase the productivity of existing irrigated areas and dryland farming crop water productivity cwp is defined as the grain yield per unit of water involved with production increasing cwp can thus help to alleviate the water crisis while ensuring food security sun et al 2017 however cwp does not account for the economics of production which is an important consideration for farmers in contrast the economic water productivity ewp is the gross economic return per unit of water use and thus an index that captures the economics of farming because cwp and ewp contain different information both are important metrics for regional water resource managers to consider when formulating planning policies zhao et al 2017 yu et al 2020 owusu sekyere et al 2017 it is also important to consider that food security includes not only quantity which can be measured in terms of cwp but also quality i e more nutrition per drop govender et al 2017 however the studies of the two are usually divided into different research disciplines and carried out in isolation the cwp is often considered within agricultural engineering while the latter is emphasized in nutrition and food science chibarabada et al 2017 mabhaudhi et al 2016a this means that there is often a lack of consideration of nutritional status in solving the problems of agricultural water shortage and food security the nutritional water productivity nwp proposed by renault and wallender 2000 quantitatively links crop water use crop production and nutrient requirements the importance of nwp is often heightened when a crisis situation occurs such as when food flows are reduced locally due to the closure of the border therefore the simultaneous consideration of cwp ewp and nwp allows for a more comprehensive and robust exploration when planning process for developing of regional agricultural water saving measures such as modifying the regional cropping distribution optimizing the regional cropping distribution in simple terms is a method to maximize the predetermined benefits of a region by adjusting the planting type area and spatial layout of crops li et al 2016 this method plays an important role in developing efficient of water saving agriculture niu et al 2016 zhang and guo 2016 wang et al 2012 varade1 and pate 2018 hao et al 2017 he et al 2020 for example li and guo 2014 built a multi objective cropping distribution model based on two level fractional programming and solved it using an interactive fuzzy programming method for the middle reaches of heihe river sara et al 2017 developed a linear model to optimize the cropping distribution of 28 crops in egypt with net annual return maximization as the objective function however at present the optimization of regional cropping distributions is mainly focused on adjusting the planting proportion of crops without considering spatially explicit changes in crop production across sub regions making it difficult to guide the agricultural planting practice hao et al 2017 proposed optimizing the regional cropping distribution based on a cross entropy method he et al 2020 combined cellular automata with a spatially distributed crop water consumption model to optimize the regional cropping distribution cellular automata are a grid dynamics model with discrete time space and state wang 2020 cellular automata do not have a fixed mathematical equation but rather determine the state of the cell at the next moment by conversion rules owing to its gridded nature cellular automata are easy to combine with remote sensing and spatially explicit simulation data and not limited by spatial scale al sharif and pradhan 2014 aburas et al 2016 so it is an effective tool for optimizing spatial patterns here we combine cellular automata and the soil water assessment tool swat hydrological model to optimize the crop cropping distributions of different crops in the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin the swat model is a distributed hydrological model that can effectively simulate crop growth guo et al 2018 samimi et al 2020 sinnathamby et al 2017 the swat model is used to simulate the water productivity of the main crops in the heihe river basin and a cropping suitability assessment is used to ensure the rationality of the cropping distributions with the minimum area as a constraint to guarantee the food security of the basin by adjusting the planting area and spatial distribution of corn spring wheat spring barley spring canola alfalfa and cotton latin name zea mays l triticum aestivum l hordeum vulgare linn brassica campestris l medicago sativa linn gossypium hirsutum linn the objectives of maximizing cwp ewp and nwp in the whole basin are achieved cropland as an important part of the natural ecosystem not only provides essential food fiber fuel other substances and energy but also supplies important ecosystem services swinton et al 2007 power 2010 as ecological problems are attracting increasing attention researchers monetize the value of ecosystem services i e ecosystem services value esv so as to more intuitively reflect the importance of cultivated land ecosystem function costanza et al 1997 li et al 2019a 2019b chen 2020 this serves as a warning against reducing irreversible damage to ecosystems for short term economic development at present most studies have evaluated the impact of land use change on cropland ecosystem services polasky et al 2011 song and deng 2015 fu et al 2016 but pay less attention to cropland ecosystem services caused by crop type changes liu et al 2017 aiming at improving regional water productivity this study optimizes crop cropping distribution which inevitably leads to the change of cropland esv therefore ecosystem service evaluation is introduced in this study to estimate the esv at the county and basin scales investigate the ecological sustainability of different optimization scenarios and provide a targeted basis for the formulation of cultivated land protection policies in different counties 2 study area the heihe river basin fig 1 is located in the middle of hexi corridor the heihe river is the second largest inland river in northwest china and the basin is characterized by a temperate continental climate zhang et al 2018 taking yingluoxia and zhengyixia hydrological stations as the dividing point the heihe river basin can be divided into upper middle and lower reaches the upstream area is located in the southern qilian mountains and has an average annual precipitation of more than 300 mm the main source of runoff in the middle reaches of heihe river is snowmelt in the upper reaches and precipitation the middle reach is an oasis plain area located in the mid latitude zone the annual average temperature is 6 8 c and the land is fertile abundant water resources and favorable climate environment make this area well suited for agricultural development liu et al 2015 the middle reach of the heihe river basin which is dominated by irrigated agriculture is the main water consuming area and runoff utilizing area yin et al 2012 the lower reaches of the river are desert areas where the climate is very dry in terms of administrative divisions the study area includes gaotai linze ganzhou minle shandan sunan qilian and suzhou counties most of which are subordinate to zhangye city in gansu province fig 1 more than 90 of the regional population grain production and gdp is concentrated in the oasis area of the middle reaches of the basin the middle reaches of the heihe river are the main grain and oil production bases in gansu with corn and wheat as the main crops 3 method and data we propose a comprehensive technical framework to optimize the cropping distribution and evaluate ecosystem services the overall procedure in this study is summarized in fig 2 which is described in detail below 3 1 swat model swat is a process based semi distributed hydrological model coupled with the simplified environmental policy integrated climate epic crop model the coupled swat epic model can be used to simulate the growth characteristics of regional crops making it a widely used crop growth related tool for crop yield and crop water productivity research padhiary et al 2020 sinnathamby et al 2017 liu et al 2020 the model first divides the watershed into sub basins according to topographic data which are further sub divided into homogeneous hydrological response units hru that represent landscapes with unique combinations of land use soil and slope by simulating leaf growth light interception and the conversion of light energy to biomass the epic model simulates the potential biomass of a plant every day under ideal growth conditions i e adequate supply of water and nutrient and favorable climate under the constraint of temperature stress water stress and nutrient stress the model simulates the actual growth status of crops in this study the auto fertilization mode of the model is adopted so the crop growth only considers water and temperature stress without nutrient stress among them water stress is simulated by comparing the potential evapotranspiration of crops with the actual evapotranspiration while temperature stress is a function of the optimal temperature for crop growth and the daily average temperature the actual biomass increment is the product of a potential increment and growth factors the potential biomass increment is related to leaf area index lai and the total amount of solar radiation intercepted that day and the growth factors are quantified by stress the model calculates the actual crop yield by multiplying the actual above ground biomass on the harvest day by the harvest index while the harvest index is a function of accumulated heat meanwhile determination of irrigation water demand by agricultural crops is based on the soil water balance for this work we use the established and calibrated swat model described in niu et al 2018 in their study the upper middle heihe river basin was divided into 34 sub basins and 1613 hru in addition using the optimization algorithm of the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2004 the swat epic model was calibrated and validated for runoff evapotranspiration and crop yield of corn spring wheat spring barley and spring canola polish here to enable a more comprehensive assessment we further calibrate swat epic for alfalfa and cotton the yield data of cotton is obtained from zhangye statistic yearbook for the period of 2005 2014 the alfalfa yield for period 2011 2013 is obtained from zhu et al 2014 while that in 2014 from li et al 2019a 2019b referring to the sensitive parameters used in crop module calibration in nair et al 2011 and sinnathamby et al 2017 twelve crop parameters bio e hvsti blai frgrw1 laimx1 frgrw2 laimx2 dlai t base gsi ext coef chtmx with the highest sensitivity through manual sensitivity analysis are selected for the optimization among the twelve parameters the bio e hvsti ext coef and chtmx directly affect biomass crop yield and height the six parameters blai dlai frgrw1 laimx1 frgrw2 and laimx2 are the crucial parameters to quantify the change of leaf area index lai during crop growing season the t base and gsi respectively control the length of growing season and evapotranspiration processes the default values of the model for the rest crop parameters with the low sensitivity are adopted mean relative error mre relatively root mean square error rrmse and relative bias index pbias are used to determine the performance of the model which are given as 1 m r e i 1 n y s i y o i y o i n 2 r r m s e i 1 n y o i y s i 2 n y o 3 p b i a s i 1 n y s i y o i i 1 n y o i where y o i stands for the observed yield value y s i represents simulated value y o is the average value of observations and n is the number of time positions in order to effectively simulate the growth state of different crops in each cultivated land of the basin we construct six swat projects and we consider that there is only one type of crop planted on all cultivated land in each project the crops parameter values of corn wheat barley and canola are obtained from the study of niu et al 2018 and that of alfalfa and cotton is obtained from the calibration results of this study the relevant parameter values are displayed in the results section 3 2 crop suitability assessment crop suitability assessment is a qualitative and quantitative evaluation process for the suitability of planting a certain crop in a specific region crop suitability can quantify the effect of spatial variation factors on crop growth and is the main basis for crop selection in the process of optimizing the regional cropping distribution jayathilaka et al 2012 its main purpose is to predict the potential and limitations of land for crop production pan and pan 2012 girmay et al 2018 the suitability of crops at a certain location can be measured by a suitability index which is the product of membership value and index weight and the value is between 0 and 1 climate topography and soil characteristics are the main factors affecting crop suitability mcdowell et al 2017 in general based on the availability of data evaluation indicators will be selected from these three types of factors peng 2016 in swat the input climate factors include precipitation temperature wind speed humidity and solar radiation the crop yield output of the model is the best variable to explain the suitability of various types of crops to these meteorological factors egbebiyi et al 2019 ramírez villegas et al 2011 therefore meteorological factors are not considered in the crop suitability assessment in this study and only topography and soil characteristics are taken as the main parameters in the evaluation index system the two topographic factors are altitude and slope respectively soil characteristics include soil texture bulk density ph value and five factors considered in the process of soil nutrient classification total nitrogen alkali hydrolyzable nitrogen available phosphorus available potassium and organic matter the classification of soil texture is based on the international classification standard and the spatial distribution of soil clay silt and sand content in the heihe river basin partial least squares pls regression analysis can effectively calculate the contribution rate of each evaluation index to the change of cwp li 2019 shi et al 2013 importance of variable projection vip and the multiple correlation coefficient of pls regression model are two main parameters which are calculated by simca p and spss software respectively the specific calculation formula of contribution rate is as follows 4 w i v i p i i 1 n v i p i r 100 where w i is the contribution rate of the i th index to cwp vip i is the vip value of the i th factor r is the multiple correlation coefficient of pls regression model and n is the number of indicators in the pls model in this study a 30 m 30 m grid cell is taken as the evaluation unit with the contribution rate as index weigh meanwhile the membership value is determined by reference to the empirical data of crop planting in the study area and the historical data summarized in papers and books cri 2013 deng et al 2004 lin 2002 yang 2009 cao 2002 zhang et al 2004 finally the suitability index is divided into five grades from high to low by the natural breakpoint classification method the lower the grade the higher the suitability suitability evaluation can compare the suitability of the same crop planted in different geographical locations and the suitability of different crops planted in the same location providing the necessary data basis for the optimization of cropping distribution 3 3 water productivity cwp combines physical accounting of water with yield to indicate the value of a unit of water swat model takes hru as the unit to output crop yield and evapotranspiration cwp at hru scale can be calculated as 5 c w p y 10 a e t where cwp is crop water productivity in kg m3 y is the crop yield per unit area in kg ha aet is actual evapotranspiration in mm the factor 10 is meant to convert water depths in mm into water volumes per land surface in m3 ha the crops considered here have vastly different yields on a mass per unit area basis because which represents a source of bias in the cwp optimization therefore yield is replaced by equivalent yield in the calculation of cwp in this study liu et al 2019 singh et al 2020 corn the crop with the largest planting area in the study area is taken as the reference crop the conversion coefficients of wheat barley canola alfalfa and cotton are 1 27 1 64 3 85 0 71 4 17 as the primary goal of farmers is to achieve optimal income and profitability economic issues must be considered in addition to cwp ewp is the ratio of crop value per unit to evapotranspiration gang et al 2012 6 e w p y n p 10 a e t where ewp is economic water productivity in yuan m3 np is net profit per unit of crop yield in yuan kg the np value of corn wheat canola and cotton is calculated by dividing the difference of gross profit and cost by the total yield the relevant data of these four crops derives from price department of national development and reform commission pdndrc 2016 which are shown in table 1 an np value of 1 15 yuan kg is used for alfalfa is following zhu et al 2014 meanwhile the np of barley is obtained from the faostat http www fao org faostat zh data where faostat is lacking data for barley in 2015 we take annual values of economic values from 2012 to 2014 as nouri et al 2020 did in their study mabhaudhi et al 2016b stated to meaningfully address food and nutrition security there is a need for an index that combines aspects of water use crop production human nutrition and food access which summarizes the motivation of renault and wallender 2000 for proposing the nwp in nutrition guidelines and food surveys it is common to consider three indicators energy protein and fat renault and wallender 2000 the analysis of water requirements per unit of energy can provide a theoretical reference for the adjustment of human dietary structure sun et al 2016 therefore energy per kilogram of crops is taken as the nutritional value nv in this study energy is a computed value obtained by adding the product of each energy supplying nutrient protein fat carbohydrates and the corresponding energy conversion coefficient kilocalorie kcal is the unit of energy in nutrition 1 kcal 4 184 kj in this study the energy is expressed in kj the energy conversion coefficients of protein fat and carbohydrate are 4 kcal g 9 kcal g and 4 kcal g respectively yang et al 2018 the contents of energy supplying nutrients and energy values in crops are presented in table 2 nutrient element contents of corn wheat and barley are obtained from zheng 2004 while that of canola gets from the data collected by wang 2016 the calculation formula of nwp is as follows 7 n w p y n v 10 a e t where nwp is the nutrient water productivity in kj kg 3 4 cellular automation model based on cellular automata ca an optimization model of cropping distribution is established in the upper middle reaches of heihe river basin ca is a dynamic simulation model which represents the space as cellular matrix where each cell has its own state wijesekara et al 2012 for example the crop type defined numerically represents the state of the cell at the moment cellular automata consists of five parts cell cell space neighbor ruleset and time moreno et al 2009 the optimization model takes crop planting area irrigation water demand and planting suitability as the constraint conditions the maximization of cwp ewp and nwp are implemented in separate model runs for each model run the maximization of the respective metric is set as the objective function to drive the optimization to obtain the spatial distribution of six crops in the study alfalfa and cotton are forage crops and textile raw material respectively therefore when the maximum nwp is taken as the optimization goal we do not consider the spatial optimization of alfalfa and cotton keeping their spatial layout the same as cropping distribution of maximizing ewp as water productivity and irrigation water demand data is based on hru the raster calculator tool in arcgis software is used to extract the data from the hru into the grid in this study the grid cell of crop planting and the matrix of grid cells for the whole study area are taken as the cell and cell space respectively meanwhile the neighbors of each cell are taken as the moore type that is the eight cells immediately adjacent to the central one the conversion ruleset is the core of ca and the main basis for determining the next state of each cell considering the value of the neighborhood and the constraints set in the model the specific framework of ca model is expressed by the following formula 8 v m n t 1 v m n c s m n x w p m n x i m n x n m n x t x 1 2 6 where v m n t 1 and v m n t represents the state of the cell in row m and column n of the cellular matrix at time t 1 and t respectively c s m n x t represents the crop suitability of crop x in row m and column n at time t w p m n x t is water productivity of crop x in row m and column n at time t i m n x t is iwd of crop x in row m and column n at time t n m n x t represents the number of neighbors that meet the requirements the conversion rules of the model include two processes judgement and conversion the model first judges whether the grid can be converted to another crop this process is based on crop specific planting area constraints i e a minimum requirement suitability and neighborhood status in that part the lower bound of the fourth grade is chosen as threshold value for each crop suitability then the conversion priority of these crops in the same cell is determined by the objective function that is the crop planted in the grid is converted to the crop with the highest water productivity according to random order the conversion rules are iterated to each grid cell meanwhile only one crop per grid cell is taken as the basic constraint objective functions of three optimization scenarios and relevant constraints of the optimization model are described as follows the average of cwp ewp and nwp of the whole study area are separately used as the objective function for different optimization scenarios 9 scenario 1 max a c w p m 1 m n 1 n x 1 x c w p m n x k m n t n 10 scenario 2 max a e w p m 1 m n 1 n x 1 x e w p m n x k m n t n 11 scenario 3 max a n w p m 1 m n 1 n x 1 x n w p m n x k m n t n where acwp aewp and anwp respectively represent regional average of cwp ewp and nwp m and n respectively represent the total number of rows and columns of the grid generated by cropping distribution of the study area x represents the total number of crop types which is 6 in this study k m n is crop planting coefficient representing whether there is a crop planted in a cell if crops are planted in a cell the crop planting coefficient is 1 otherwise it is 0 tn is the total number of grids with crop planted in the original cropping distribution planting area constraint according to zhangye statistic yearbook in 2015 the resident population of zhangye city is 1 22 106 referring to the setting of food security in zhang et al 2016 the minimum annual per capita demand for wheat is 250 kg while corn is 100 kg meanwhile zhangye exports 60 of corn yield and imports 30 of wheat every year to support the local agricultural economy and food demand based on the crop yield data we calculate that the corn and wheat yield should not be reduced by more than 50 and 30 between year 2005 and 2015 the minimum planting area of barley and canola is 1 13 104 ha in 2010 and 1 26 104 ha in 2007 respectively which decreases about by 30 and 20 respectively compared with 2015 therefore changeable planting proportion of corn wheat barley and canola is set as 0 5 0 3 0 3 and 0 2 in addition the minimum planting area of cotton is 0 87 in 2015 so we only set changeable planting proportion of cotton as 0 05 due to the lack of multi year statistical data of alfalfa allowable change proportion of alfalfa is set as 0 1 based on its planting proportion furthermore the sum of the area assigned to crop cannot exceed the total cultivated area 12 x 1 x c n x t n 13 t n x 1 α x c n x t n x 1 α x where c n x is the total number of grids for crop x in the optimized cropping distribution t n x is the total grid number of crop x in the original cropping distribution α x is the allowable change proportion of crop planting area of crop x irrigation water constraint the iwd of the optimized cropping distribution cannot exceed that of the original cropping distribution 14 m 1 m n 1 n x 1 x i m n x k m n x t i where ti is iwd of the original cropping distribution neighbor constraint when the number of neighbors with crop planted is not less than 2 crop can be planted in the central grid this constraint can effectively improve the agricultural concentration 15 n m n k m n 2 where n m n is the number of neighbors with crop planted the whole optimization model is implemented using matlab r2016a the mathworks inc natick ma usa the model takes the cropping distribution of the heihe river basin in 2015 as the initial state the data loaded in the model includes cropping distribution distribution of crop suitability number of neighbors spatial distribution of cwp ewp nwp and iwd of different crops in the judgment part a crop suitability level greater than 4 indicates that the grid is unsuitable for crop growth when the conversion rules are iterated to the whole cellular space in a random order the iwd of the cropping distribution is calculated if the value is less than the iwd of original cropping distribution the optimization is completed otherwise the grid cells of the whole watershed are arranged in the order of iwd from largest to smallest and the crop in the grid is converted to one with less iwd in this order until the iwd of the whole basin is less than that of the original cropping distribution the whole optimization process ends the flow chart of cropping distribution optimization model is summarized in fig 3 3 5 ecosystem services evaluation ecosystem services can be interpreted as the benefits that humans derive directly or indirectly from ecosystem functions which refer to the habitats biological or system properties or processes of ecosystems costanza et al 1997 scientifically described the principles and methods of ecosystem services evaluation however this method underestimates the esv of croplands in china therefore according to china s ecosystem and socio economic development xie et al 2008 improved the costanza based evaluation method and proposed an equivalent weight table of esv suitable for china xie et al 2008 reclassified ecosystem services into nine items food production raw material production climate regulation gas regulation waste regulation hydrological regulation biodiversity maintenance soil conservation and landscaping they fell into four categories supply service regulation service support service and cultural service this study mainly focuses on the total esv referring to the study of liu et al 2017 we set the equivalent weight factor of each crop as the equivalent weight factor of farmland while the economic value of one equivalent weight factor of esv is equal to 1 7 of the market value of 1 ha of the corresponding crop the formula of total esv of each crop are as follows 16 u a e v i j e f i j u a m v i j 1 7 17 e v s i j 1 9 c p a s i u a e v i j where u a m v i j and u a e v i j respectively represents the market value and value of ecosystem service j by 1 ha of crop i e f i j is equivalent weight factor of the value of ecosystem service j of crop i c p a s i is planting area of crop i in scenario s e v s i represents the total ecosystem service value of crop i in scenario s 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation the swat model including the calibration and validation of crop parameters for corn wheat barley and canola was completed in the study of niu et al 2018 these parameters are used directly in this study and the yield of alfalfa and cotton is calibrated and validated table 3 lists the calibrated results of crop parameters for cotton and alfalfa in the calibration process different modified steps are used for different parameters the modified step of blai bio e and t base is 1 while that of gis and hvsti is 0 001 and 0 02 respectively and 0 05 for other seven parameters fig 4 shows the model performance statistics result and graphical comparisons between the simulated crop yield and observed yield the statistics show that the mre of alfalfa and cotton is less than 20 the rrmse and pbias values of alfalfa both are below 0 1 and these two indices for cotton are not more than 0 26 meanwhile fig 4 demonstrates the simulated results are in good agreement with the observed yield of crops in general the calibrated swat model can simulate crop production well in the upper middle reaches of heihe river basin 4 2 spatial distribution of crop suitability the crop suitability assessment in this study is composed of ten indices related to topographic factors and soil characteristics firstly according to the international classification standard of soil texture and the distribution data of clay silt and sand the soil texture of study area is divided into seven types as shown in fig 5 d loam and clay loam are mainly distributed in the upper reaches of heihe river basin in the western central and eastern region of the middle reach the dominant soil textures are sandy loam silty loam and silty clay loam respectively according to the empirical data obtained from previous studies the index grades are divided and the membership values are given to each grade table 4 shows the weights of each evaluation index determined by pls regression analysis it is observed from table 4 the weight of elevation of alfalfa corn and cotton is the largest the weight of soil texture of wheat is the largest while the weight of slope is smallest meanwhile there is no significant difference in the weight of each index for barley and canola according to the membership and index weight the suitability index of different crops is calculated on each grid unit fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of suitability for six crop species in the upper middle reaches of heihe river basin the suitability index for corn wheat barley canola alfalfa cotton is 0 34 0 84 0 37 0 90 0 33 0 99 0 35 0 98 0 47 0 95 0 43 0 93 it can be observed from fig 6 when taking topographic factors and soil properties as evaluation indexes the most suitable planting areas for corn wheat alfalfa and cotton is in the central and western regions of the middle reaches of heihe river basin canola and barley are more suitable to be planted in the eastern part of the middle reaches and the cultivated land of the upper reaches in the judgment part of cropping distribution optimization thresholds of suitability screening for corn wheat barley canola alfalfa and cotton are 0 51 0 56 0 51 0 52 0 59 and 0 58 respectively 4 3 optimization of cropping distribution corn wheat barley and canola are the main grain and oil crops in the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin and they collectively account for more than 60 of the total cropped area zmbs 2012 corn with the largest planting area is mainly distributed in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin ganzhou linze and gaotai counties are the most densely planted counties the distribution of wheat crops is relatively scattered and the planting area of shandan and minle counties is the largest meanwhile minle and shandan counties are the primary barley growing areas the cultivated land in the southwest of shandan and minle counties is mainly occupied by canola the farmland in the upper reach is a patchwork of fields with barley and canola alfalfa and cotton each accounted for only a small proportion 3 of the planting area as shown in figs 7 b and 8 b when the crop water productivity is taken as the optimization objective planting patterns change dramatically except for corn the acreage of the other five crops increases to varying degrees the planting proportion of corn decreases from about 66 to 55 the whole planting area of corn transfers to the southeast that is shandan and minle counties become the main corn planting areas after optimization the planting area of wheat transfers from the southeast to central ganzhou county and western gaotai and sunan with more acreage in the latter the main production area of barley is also transferred from the east to the west in the middle reaches in ganzhou linze gaotai sunan and suzhou counties barley is planted in a large area after optimization meanwhile most of the cultivated land in the upper reaches of heihe river is also occupied by barley except for a small part of the canola retained in the southeast of minle large quantities of canola are planted in gaotai and linze under this optimization scenario the planting area of wheat barley and canola all expand more than 30 over their original planting areas table 5 zheng and tan 2016 also indicated that appropriate expansion of wheat planting area in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin can improve the regional cwp the planting of alfalfa is still scattered but different from its original distribution the planting proportion in shandan and qilian counties increases significantly after optimization the planting layout of cotton is concentrated in ganzhou county which accounts for more than half of the total cotton planting area as shown in fig 8 b the spatial distribution of iwd after optimization with the goal of maximizing cwp is provided in fig 9 b compared with the original cropping distribution the iwd in the upper reaches shows little change and the value is still 250 mm in the middle reaches the change of iwd shows different trends in the east and west the iwd in the central and western regions decreases significantly after optimization the iwd of most areas decreases from 450 550 mm to 250 350 mm or 350 450 mm while in the eastern region the iwd is higher than the original cropping distribution and the value in most areas increases from 250 350 mm to 350 450 mm this is mainly due to corn becoming the main crop planted in the region after optimization however from the perspective of the whole basin the optimized cropping distribution reduces iwd by 0 07 km3 5 6 compared with the original cropping distribution the spatial distribution of cwp before and after optimization are shown in fig 10 a and b respectively east of the administrative boundary between ganzhou and linze there is no change in the cwp grade in most area cwp markedly increases only in two regions which are the west of ganzhou and the south of shandan and minle counties the cwp of the former increases from 1 0 1 2 kg m3 to above 1 2 kg m3 and the value even exceeds 1 6 kg m3 in some areas the cwp of the latter increases from below 0 8 kg m3 to above 1 0 kg m3 meanwhile the cwp in most western regions increases significantly to above 1 6 kg m3 cwp decreases only in a few areas of linze and gaotai which is attributed to the fact that these areas became canola planting areas with relatively smaller cwp value the cwp of all crop species increases compared with that before optimization the cwp of canola increases the most with more than 30 the distribution and statistical results of cropping distribution for maximizing ewp is presented in figs 7 c and 8 c in the optimized cropping distribution corn still accounts for the largest proportion but the planting proportion decreases to about 60 the main planting area of corn is still in ganzhou but the planting proportion is decreased the significant increase of corn area occurrs in minle and shandan counties as a whole the corn planting area transfers from west to east crops with reduced acreage also include wheat the planting proportion of which decreases from 9 0 to 6 8 this is because the economic benefit value of wheat is the smallest which is only 0 84 yuan kg meanwhile about 30 of wheat is transferred to gaotai county making it the main wheat growing area because barley and canola had higher economic benefits the planting area of both increases significantly in the whole agricultural area part of the planting areas of them also transfers from shandan county to ganzhou and the west of ganzhou alfalfa shows a more uniform distribution and there is little difference in planting proportion among counties ganzhou still has the largest cotton planting area with planting proportion increasing from 27 to 67 on the crop planting map with the maximum ewp we find that large areas of corn crops are replaced with barley wheat and canola in the west of the boundary between ganzhou and linze counties which leads to significant reduction of iwd in these areas different from the scenario of maximizing cwp corn is still planted in the south of suzhou and gaotai counties so the iwd has not changed there in both the east and west sides of ganzhou district a portion of corn is replaced by barley so the irrigation water decreases from 350 450 mm to 250 350 mm in the mixed planting region of barley and canola in the middle of minle county the iwd is maintained at 250 350 mm level or decreases to below 250 mm however there is increased iwd in other areas west of middle reaches on the whole basin the iwd of the optimized cropping distribution is 1 21 km3 which saves 0 04 km3 compared with the original cropping distribution but the water saving intensity is less than the scenario of maximizing cwp after optimizing the cropping distribution based on maximizing ewp except shandan county the ewp of other counties increases to varying degrees in the west side of the administrative boundary between ganzhou and linze counties the ewp increases most obviously with the value rising to 2 2 yuan m3 increasing the planting area of barley effectively improves the economic benefits of the western region after the optimization of cropping distribution the ewp of barley canola and cotton all increases by more than 10 the ewp of wheat increases to 1 12 yuan m3 while that of alfalfa and corn change slightly based on the predetermination of alfalfa and cotton layout the spatial distributions of corn wheat barley and canola are optimized the result of which is shown in fig 7 d the cultivated land in qilian county is occupied by barley canola and alfalfa after optimization meanwhile the planting proportion of canola increases to 5 8 which is nearly 20 higher than the original area and the canola is mainly scattered in shandan and minle counties the rest of the cultivated land in shandan and minle counties are mainly planted with corn and barley wheat planting areas are transferred to the middle reaches of the heihe river basin and gaotai county has the largest proportion of planting with the value about 33 the distribution of iwd also changes significantly after optimization with nwp maximization as the objective which are similar to that of cropping distribution of maximizing cwp the obvious difference between these two scenarios appears in the eastern part of the middle reaches when the cwp is maximized iwd at 250 350 mm appears more in the middle of ganzhou and the west of minle while when the nwp is maximized the iwd of this grade is mainly distributed in the southeast of minle and shandan county in this scenario the iwd of the whole study area decreases by 0 06 km3 4 8 therefore this scenario also effectively reduces the iwd of regional cultivated land the highest optimized values of nwp in the whole basin are concentrated in parts of gaotai suzhou counties where nwp increases from below 2 2 104 kj m3 to above 2 5 104 kj m3 the regions where the nwp increases by one grade are concentrated in the north and south sides of linze county in the western part of ganzhou county the nwp of most farmland rises from below 1 8 104 kj m3 to above 2 0 104 kj m3 while the nwp in central and eastern regions basically are unchanged in contrast to the increasing trend of nwp in the west the nwp in minle and shandan counties decreases slightly the nwp basically decreases two grades 1 5 104 1 8 104 kj m3 and 1 8 104 2 0 104 kj m3 this decrease does not reverse the overall basin wide increase after optimization the nwp of wheat increases the most about 31 and the nwp of barley corn and canola also increases in different degrees increasing by 9 4 and 15 respectively see table 6 4 4 changes in ecosystem services value different from the study of liu et al 2017 this study uses simulated crop yield and unit price of each crop to calculate the market price of the crop per unit area realizing the spatialization of esv fig 11 shows the changes of esv per unit area esvp of six crops in each county after the optimization of cropping distribution it can be found that the esvp of canola in ganzhou linze gaotai and suzhou counties and alfalfa crops in qilian county change by more than 1000 usd ha which is due to they grow out of nothing in the optimization process in addition the esvp of different crops in the basin changes in the range of 300 700 usd ha among which the esvp of wheat in suzhou minle and cotton in ganzhou increases most significantly the esvp of cotton in sunan and alfalfa in suzhou decreases significantly after optimization under the scenarios of maximizing ewp and nwp the esvp of cotton in shandan county decreases by nearly 300 usd ha fig 12 shows the changes of esv in the three optimization scenarios compared with the original scenario the increase and decrease of esv is interspersed in the whole basin the increase area of esv mainly occurrs in shandan and minle counties in the east while the transformation from canola to corn crops in the south of shandan results in negative growth of esv the farmland of four counties ganzhou linze gaotai and suzhou in the central and western regions is covered by esv reduction areas this overlapped with the area where the crop type changes from corn to barley obviously these two types of crop transformation are the main reason for the reduction of regional esv on the county scale three different optimization objectives all bright significant improvement in the esv of shandan and qilian counties ganzhou county has no obvious esv change when the regional cwp is the maximum while the esv increases by 4 107 usd and decreases by 6 107 usd respectively in scenario 2 maximizing regional ewp and scenario 3 maximizing regional nwp after the optimization of cropping distribution gaotai and linze both counties show a trend of esv reduction of which reduction quantity reaches a maximum more than 6 107 usd in optimization scenario 3 on the watershed scale the maximization of cwp decreases the esv of the whole basin by 6 18 107 usd 18 the maximization of ewp and nwp improve the esv of the whole basin with the value increasing by 4 46 107 usd 13 6 and 1 48 107 usd 5 1 respectively 5 discussion our main goal in this work is to optimize the regional cropping distribution to improve water productivity three separate optimizations each with a different objective function maximizing each of cwp ewp and nwp are implemented to optimize corn wheat barley canola alfalfa and cotton crop distributions relative to their 2015 extents using iwd and crop suitability as constraints according to pabuayon et al 2019 and araya et al 2019 enhancing cwp is an important measure for agricultural sector to deal with the dual challenges of food demand growth and water resource shortage therefore this study sets the regional cwp maximization as the objective function of scenario 1 to drive the cropping distribution optimization model the results shows that the cwp of six main crops in heihe river basin increased in varying degrees and the biggest increase is of cwp of canola as more than 30 correspondingly the planting area and spatial distribution of crops also changes the planting scale of corn in the west of the middle reaches decreases and more concentrates in minle and shandan counties the planting area of barley mainly moves to the west of ganzhou the main wheat planting areas are also transferred to gan lin gao ganzhou linze and gaotai region sunan county and suzhou district in the west it has been indicated that cwp exhibit high temporal and spatial variability under the influence of climatic and agricultural factors mdemu et al 2009 kukal and irmak 2017 our study verifies this theory and demonstrates that the adjustment of crop cropping distribution can effectively improve regional cwp meanwhile cwp can be further improved with regulated deficit irrigation adeboye et al 2015 hunsaker et al 2015 greaves and wang 2017 therefore future studies can consider the growth stage based deficit irrigation strategies based on the optimization results realizing all round improvement of regional cwp a sustainable farming scheme should not only consider the timing of plantation and spatial distribution of crops but also crops nutritional and economic productivity schyns and hoekstra 2014 davis et al 2017 therefore in scenario 2 and scenario 3 the objectives are to maximize ewp and nwp respectively when the regional ewp is maximized except for corn and alfalfa the proportion of the other four crops in the central and western regions of the middle reaches is significantly increased the adjustment of cropping distribution has a positive effect on the ewp of crops bringing marked increase in the ewp of barley cotton and canola the pre post optimization differences shows that there is development space for crops ewp in each production area this provides a reference for the selection and development of crop producing areas and provides a scientific basis for the further socio economic optimization of the whole basin however there is high uncertainty in crop markets and the economic benefits of crops often fluctuate zimmer 2016 alemanya et al 2021 in the future work the economic model covering the change of nwp value can be introduced into the optimization model to realize the dynamic optimization of regional ewp scenario 3 completes the optimization of cropping distributions with the goal of maximizing regional nwp the results show that the nwp of wheat increases to 1 3 times of the former and there is about 15 increase occurring in the nwp of canola nodoushan et al 2020 demonstrated that combining diet change and import policy could reduce internal blue water footprint of a country it is of guiding significance to alleviate water shortage in arid area shtull trauring and bernstein 2018 meanwhile any new diet change and suggestions are based on regional water productivity therefore through the optimization of regional nwp this study considers the nutrition outcomes into the food production which can effectively address the challenge of producing more nutritious food under water shortage all optimized cropping distributions effectively reduce the iwd of whole study area with cwp showing the largest reduction of iwd meanwhile the optimized cropping distribution transfers the corn crops with high water consumption to the eastern region of the middle reaches of heihe river that is the pressure of iwd is transferred from the counties with serious water shortage gaotai and linze to the counties with relatively lower water stress shandan and minle zhang et al 2015 it effectively alleviates the serious water shortage in the central and western areas of heihe river basin and the overexploitation of groundwater in gaotai county lian 2011 factors affecting irrigation water demand include climate factors and human activities kirby et al 2016 iglesias and garrote 2015 in recent years there has been increasing human intervention occurring in agricultural irrigation wang and qin 2017 li et al 2020 among them adjusting the planting mode and improving the irrigation water management are effective measures to reduce irrigation water demand mehta et al 2013 this is also the main approach to further reduce irrigation water demand in heihe river basin on the basis of optimized regional cropping distribution in our optimization we focus on maximizing regional water productivity weakening the reduction of iwd so the iwd after optimization is only reduced by about 5 in addition zou et al 2018 and li et al 2019a 2019b respectively pointed out soil characteristics and agricultural management practices are main driving factors affecting iwd and regional water productivity therefore reasonable improvement of soil environment and agricultural management is an effective way to enhance crop suitability and further increase regional water saving efforts and water productivity the crop suitability assessment is a key constraint to determine the suitable planting areas of different crops in the process of cropping distribution optimization in this study ten factors related to topography and soil characteristics altitude slope soil texture bulk density ph total nitrogen alkali hydrolyzable nitrogen available phosphorus available potassium and organic matter are chosen as evaluation indexes to calculate suitability index the suitability index for corn wheat barley canola alfalfa and cotton are 0 34 0 84 0 37 0 90 0 33 0 99 0 35 0 98 0 47 0 95 and 0 43 0 93 respectively from the perspective of spatial distribution the most suitable planting areas of corn wheat alfalfa and cotton are in the middle and western regions of middle reaches of the heihe river while canola and barley are more suitable for planting in the eastern of middle reaches and upper reaches of the heihe river basin hailu et al 2015 reported that soil organic matter som content and total nitrogen tn were found to be the limiting factors for wheat and barley crop production in this study som and total nitrogen of wheat has higher suitability index proportion which verifies this theory however the scattered and few planting characteristics of barley make this feature not prominent therefore applying regional management and conservation measures soil and water conservation soil fertility management can effectively improve the suitability of land units particularly for marginal and unsuitable lands tesfay et al 2017 alemu et al 2013 girmay et al 2018 the local government can actively take corresponding policies to expand the suitable area of various types of crops which has a positive effect on optimizing the cropping distribution of the whole region and enhancing regional water productivity in order to evaluate the rationality and sustainability of different optimization scenarios the market value method is applied to estimate and compare the esv of crop cropping distribution before and after optimization the esv of different counties show different changing tendency in the process of crop cropping distribution optimization the central and western counties in the middle reaches of the basin are the main negative growth areas of esv therefore when changing cropping distribution for improving regional water productivity more attention should be paid to the ecosystem function of the central and western regions in the middle reaches of the heihe river for avoiding ecological hidden dangers in these counties scientific planting technology and efficient management can be used to improve the esv of these areas after the optimization of cropping distribution cai et al 2020 the esv of the basin is effectively improved in the two scenarios of maximizing ewp and nwp and the former increases more therefore in the three optimization scenarios the maximizing ewp is more reasonable from the perspective of ecosystem services high standard farmland construction is a powerful measure to improve the service capacity of cultivated land ecosystem tang et al 2015 which can be used to alleviates the decline of esv in maximizing cwp scenario 6 conclusion in this study the swat and cellular automata model in conjunction with the crop suitability assessment are combined to construct a cropping distribution optimization model the maximization of cwp ewp and nwp are separately set as the objective function to drive the optimization model with the goal of optimizing the regional cropping distribution we present a case study of the proposed model in upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin in addition the regional esv is calculated to evaluate three optimization scenarios from an ecologically sustainable perspective optimizing the cropping distribution can increase water productivity in the heihe river basin and relieve the water pressure in the western part of the basin we consider cwp ewp and nwp to enable a more comprehensive assessment that accounts for additional socio economic factors of the three cwp shows the greatest water saving potential which is more suitable for dealing with dry years and can alleviate the regional irrigation water pressure to the greatest extent on the premise of ensuring crop yield optimizing the regional cropping distribution with the maximum of ewp is an effective measure to improve the agricultural economic benefit of the basin which can simultaneously promote the development of regional agricultural economy and the growth of regional esv the setting of the scenario of maximizing the nwp provides a guarantee for the government to effectively deal with regional food security when facing a certain social crisis in general the crop cropping distribution of maximizing ewp is more suitable for the heihe river basin in ordinary years the three optimization schemes provide theoretical basis and decision support for decision makers to promote regional

9606,accurately converting instantaneous evapotranspiration λet i at satellite over passing time into daily evapotranspiration λet d is a key issue of applying remotely sensed data to estimate regional evapotranspiration λet from remote sensing satellites which plays an important role for effective water resource management the scaling methods that take advantage of the relationship between λet and other environmental factors and can be used to convert λet i into λet d in this study five scaling methods of converting λet i into λet d including the evaporative fraction method eva f method revised evaporative fraction method r eva f method crop coefficient method k c et 0 method revised crop coefficient method r k c et 0 method and direct canopy resistance method direct r c method were evaluated based on the detailed meteorological data measured from 2016 to 2018 in a tea field and 2018 to 2020 in a wheat field in southeast china the estimated λet d was compared with the measured λet d by the bowen ratio energy balance breb method the results indicated that the eva f and r eva f methods with the mean root mean square error rmse and coefficient of efficiency ε equaled 9 02 w m 2 and 0 92 12 06 w m 2 and 0 89 respectively were superior to the k c et 0 r k c et 0 and direct r c method the k c et 0 method with the mean rmse and ε equaled 20 62 w m 2 and 0 79 was also a good option for simulating the λet d of tea and wheat while the r k c et 0 method simulated the λet d well for the wheat with mean rmse and ε equaled 36 29 w m 2 and 0 71 but significantly overestimated the tea λet d with the mean rmse and ε values of 39 61 w m 2 and 0 59 for tea the direct r c method overestimated λet d of tea and wheat for the most of intervals with the mean rmse and ε of 39 58 w m

resources allocation and irrigation management chen et al 2019 evapotranspiration equivalent form of the latent heat flux λet plays a key role in agricultural water management as it consumes a majority of the total water huang et al 2020 yan et al 2018 thus accurate determination of λet is strongly needed for agricultural production and agricultural water management numerous instruments have become commercially available for measuring the λet such as bowen ratio tower eddy covariance and scintillometry pozníková et al 2018 however conventional observation techniques give only point measurements and are restricted by poor spatial representation and numerous expensive installations liu et al 2012b a good alternative approach is to relate λet to remotely sensed surface temperature based on the energy balance equation zhang and lemeur 1995 remote sensing with satellites offers a means of estimating λet over a large spatial scale due to the great spatial representation xue et al 2020 and the relatively low cost of data collection filgueiras et al 2020 however instantaneous data derived from remotely sensing only provide instantaneous evapotranspiration λet i in practice λet is required on a daily as well as longer time scales for establishing a reasonable irrigation scheduling consequently reliable methods to convert λet i into daily evapotranspiration λet d are worthwhile to develop some scaling methods of estimating λet d from instantaneous values have been proposed cammalleri et al 2014 chávez et al 2008 the key to developing various scaling methods is to associate λet d to a factor that is generally a constant during the daytime or the whole diurnal cycle farah et al 2004 liu et al 2012a this factor can be expressed as a ratio between λet i at a specific time of the day and a reference variable that can be computed daily tang et al 2013 van niel et al 2012 the most common technique for estimating λet d from instantaneous values is based on the evaporative fraction e f defined as the ratio of the λet to available energy shuttleworth et al 1989 the evaporative fraction method eva f method is well known for the assumption that e f is selfpreserving which means it is constant or nearly constant over the daytime its effectiveness in accurate estimation of λet d has been demonstrated for natural grassland in northeastern kansas crago 1996 five distinct vegetative covers in southwest france nichols and cuenca 1993 for winter wheat and summer corn in northern china tang et al 2013 and for maize field in semiarid northwest china zhang et al 2017 however it has been shown in previous studies that the assumption of self preserving can be influenced by variable environmental factors such as cloud cover soil moisture conditions and different vegetation cover farah et al 2004 gentine et al 2007 lhomme and elguero 1999 wandera et al 2017 xu et al 2015 the diurnal variation of e f was almost constant under dry conditions but it depicted a pronounced concave up shape under wet conditions hoedjes et al 2008 for the same soil moisture the stability of e f was lower when the leaf area index was higher gentine et al 2007 tang et al 2013 and van niel et al 2012 implied that the e f was more variable during cloudy conditions when compared to clear sky conditions those variable environmental factors may cause inaccuracy of λet d estimations when utilizing the eva f method chemin and alexandridis 2001 proposed that assuming soil heat flux g equal to 0 might yield a significant improvement in the accuracy of the eva f method for calculating λet d since the g accounted for a low percentage in the surface energy balance and always varied with the soil thermal properties and soil moisture thus a revised eva f method referred as r eva f method was proposed to estimate λet d based on a revised e f re f which is defined as the ratio of λet to net radiation r n suleiman and crago 2004 used the r eva f method to extrapolate λet d from hourly values and the results demonstrated that the r eva f method had a good performance for grassland however chávez et al 2008 implied that the r eva f method had an overestimation for corn and soybean fields together this result indicated that daily average g should be included in the computation of scaling methods considering the influence of other meteorological conditions on the λet allen et al 2007 found that the crop coefficient k c which is defined as the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to a reference evapotranspiration et 0 is nearly constant at a low frequency during the day so that it can be used to extrapolate λet d from λet i hence a crop coefficient k c et 0 method for estimating λet d was proposed based on k c and et 0 the assumption in the k c et 0 method is that the value of instantaneous k c is similar to the daily average value the k c et 0 method takes into account the effects of atmospheric properties and has been successfully applied to several experiments in estimating λet d from instantaneous values delogu et al 2012 xu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 previous studies demonstrated that the k c et 0 method had good performances over agricultural irrigated areas allen et al 2007 trezza 2002 alfalfa and irrigated cotton fields colaizzi et al 2005 less optimal application over natural semi arid and forested sites bare soil where λet decreased rapidly in a dry soil colaizzi et al 2005 chávez et al 2008 pointed out that the k c et 0 method maybe work poorly in the situations with considerable deviation from reference grass or alfalfa field due to the limitation of its definition tasumi et al 2005 reported that the fixed canopy resistance r c used in the k c et 0 method may be only suitable for reference crops the daytime r c may vary for the actual crops lecina et al 2003 todorovic 1999 and can be considered vitally as an important factor that influence λet the effect of r c can be further investigate especially when the r c significantly deviates from the commonly used fixed value as a physiological and aerodynamic parameter the r c over the course of a day is essentially time dependent and can be influenced by variations in solar radiation vapor pressure deficit and wind speed even for the water unstressed reference grass alfalfa surface tang and li 2017 tang et al 2017 investigated using varied r c in λet d estimation could improve the accuracy of the k c et 0 method in the afternoon but worse results may occur in the morning accordingly an improved k c et 0 method r k c et 0 method was proposed that varied r c instead of the fixed r c recommended by fao 56 was used when calculating the et 0 of the k c et 0 method based on the arguments on the application of r c in the k c et 0 method malek et al 1992 presented a direct method direct r c method of scaling up λet using the r c calculated by inverting the original penman monteith equation and showed that r c can be used as a nearly constant to scale up λet the performance of the direct r c method has been confirmed in many studies tang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 tang and li 2017 demonstrated relatively large the diurnal variation of r c tang et al 2017 reported that using varied r c in direct r c method did not produce a much closer scaled λet d than using a fixed r c and pointed out that the assumption of the r c nearly constant during the daytime was doubtful and further research was needed the available research findings shown the performances of the above scaling methods eva f r eva f k c et 0 r k c et 0 and direct r c method may be different for instantaneous time at different satellite over passing time climatic conditions and vegetation growing conditions zhang et al 2017 showed the optimal values with the eva f and k c et 0 methods appeared at 11 00 15 00 whereas the r k c et 0 method gave the best performance when using values at 12 00 tang et al 2017 demonstrated that the r k c et 0 method performed better at the humid site than at the arid site colaizzi et al 2005 reported that the eva f method performed better for bare soil than for transpiring crops the conclusions of previous studies were not always consistent even in similar vegetation cover conditions the vegetation cover and climatic conditions could be considerable influence factors on the accuracy of the upscaling methods most of the studies were conducted in the arid or semiarid regions gentine et al 2007 ibáñez and castellví 2000 zhang et al 2017 few in the humid regions thus the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the performances of the five scaling methods eva f r eva f k c et 0 r k c et 0 and direct r c method in estimation of the λet d from λet i using ground based measurements for two vegetation cover types tea and wheat grown in a humid region 2 to analyze the causes of the discrepancies between the measured and estimated λet d using different methods and 3 to recommend proper approaches for estimating λet d at the tea and wheat fields in southeast china 2 materials and methods 2 1 field observation the data in this study was collected from two long term automatic weather stations at a tea and wheat

maximum heights of the wheat plants were 0 75 m and 0 72 m reached at maturity in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively the wheat was rain fed because plentiful rainfall adequately met the wheat hydration needs of the whole growth period the soil texture of the wheat field is mainly loam the field capacity and wilting point were measured with the same method as in the tea field with corresponding values of 25 and 9 6 respectively two sets of identical weather stations were installed separately in the center of the tea field and the wheat field adequate fetch 100 200 m can be

data in the tea field gaped from 11 july 2017 27 october 2017 the meteorological data were used to drive the λet scaling methods and to calculate the λet d and λet i by the breb method these data were carefully checked to ensure the quality and completeness of the daily cycle in two steps first the λet results were ignored when β is close to 0 75 ohmura 1982 and days with data gaps caused by instrument malfunctions or maintenance and the data spikes and abnormalities in the atmospheric variables were excluded after these data quality and completeness checks 342 days 2016 2017 and 254 days

up shape and ranged from 0 6 to 0 8 for tea and 0 5 to 0 7 for wheat while re f fluctuated obviously before 9 00 and after 15 00 with a gentle variation for most time fig 3a possible reason for the typical concave up variation is due to weather conditions and vegetation factors chávez et al 2008 gentine et al 2007 liu et al 2020 the parameter k c showed a mildly concave down shape through the day and relatively dramatic changes in early morning and late afternoon and reached a maximum near noon fig 3b a and c similar trend of k c in the daytime performed in the liu et al 2012a was found but the magnitude of k c was commonly higher than that of e f as an aggregate result of the soil water stress and vegetation coverage zhang et al 2017 on the other hand fig 3b b and d displayed the diurnal variations of rk c where a mild concave down shape in wheat but a rapid and continued decline in tea was be found the rk c was fairly constant from 11 00 14 00 in wheat which was an indication that instantaneous values could be representative of daytime values the unsteadiness of rk c for tea plants during the daytime may result in considerable error for converting λet i into λet d the trend of r c showed a sharply decreasing trend in the early morning and the late afternoon fig 3c while it remained constant for most time with the mean value of 179 m s 1 for tea and 202 m s 1 for wheat liu et al 2020 pointed out that the diurnal pattern of the e f is mainly influenced by the stomatal regulation this explained the similar diurnal patter of e f re f and r c since r c is basically determined by leaf stomatal regulation 3 3 performance of the five upscaling methods the performance of five scaling methods eva f r eva f k c et 0 r k c et 0 and direct r c method in estimated λet d based on the λet i at 09 00 15 00 for tea and wheat was validated based on the measured λet d using the bber method and is presented in table 1 the λet i from 09 00 15 00 was selected due to this time period coincides with the time when most of the satellites appear over the study area and the upscaling factors are fairly constant the linear fitting is performed with the intercept set to zero for the eva f and r eva f method the slopes a of the linear relationships between estimated and measured λet d showed a slightly upward trend during the day and approximated one at around 12 00 13 00 the two methods slightly underestimated the values of λet d in the morning and overestimated in the afternoon both in the cases of tea and wheat the coefficient of determination r 2 varied from 0 82 to 0 99 indicating strong correlation between measured and estimated λet d previous studies demonstrated the difference between the measured λet d and the estimated value of the eva f method based on λet i at noon was small crago 1996 hoedjes et al 2008 while the a between measured and estimated λet d calculated by k c et 0 r k c et 0 and direct r c method in the cases of tea and wheat changed greatly with an arched trend during the day and was close to one at around 13 00 14 00 in most cases those three methods markedly overestimated the λet d when the λet i between 9 00 and 13 00 was used especially the direct r c method the bias of the estimated λet d calculated by five methods eva f r eva f k c et 0 r k c et 0 and direct r c method for the seven one hour temporal points were plotted in fig 4 the diurnal bias patterns for the eva f and r eva f method only changed slightly through the day while the bias of the estimated λet d calculated by the k c et 0 r k c et 0 and direct r c method changed severely through the day with an overestimation when the λet i was used in the morning and afternoon the bias of the estimated λet d calculated by the k c et 0 and direct r c method were high when the λet i was used in the morning but decreased obviously during 14 00 15 00 the bias of the estimated λet d calculated by the r k c et 0 method had a different performance between the tea and wheat with a sharply decrease for wheat and an arch shape for tea the minimum bias appeared when the λet i was used at 12 00 for wheat and at 13 00 for tea respectively overall the eva f method had the smallest bias and followed by the r eva f method which absolute bias values were less than 10 at all times while the k c et 0 method r k c et 0 method and direct r c method displayed overestimation in most cases moreover diurnal variation of the efficiency coefficient ε of the estimated λet d calculated by five methods displayed in fig 5 the hourly variations of ε for the estimated λet d calculated by the eva f and r eva f method in the daytime showed a slight concave down pattern and more stable than the other methods the excellent ε values 0 98 for the eva f method 0 97 for the r eva f method were obtained when the λet i at noon was used for the scaling methods and showed good performances which agreed with results reported for the mediterranean region ibáñez and castellví 2000 for the k c et 0 method the variation of ε demonstrated obvious concave up image which increased progressively then a good ε value 0 89 was obtained by the k c et 0 method when the λet i was used at 14 00 for the r k c et 0 method the trend of ε curve showed little similar for tea and wheat which sharply concaved down and attached the peak when the λet i was used at 12 00 for tea increased steadily and attached the peak when the λet i was used at 14 00 for wheat the mean ε value of the estimated λet d calculated by the r k c et 0 method was only 0 75 for wheat and 0 59 for tea poorly the direct r c method performed worse with the mean ε value equaled 0 60 the rmse of the estimated λet d calculated by five methods varied greatly as shown in fig 6 for the eva f and r eva f method the trend of rmse showed a smooth concave up shape which further confirmed the good performance for most time as explained in figs 4 and 5 for the k c et 0 method the rmse changed from 30 86 w m 2 to 13 7 w m 2 when the λet i was used during 9 00 14 00 but later increased further to 23 50 w m 2 for the r k c et 0 method the rmse showed different performance for tea and wheat which the minimum value appeared when the λet i was used at 12 00 for tea 26 3 w m 2 and at 14 00 for wheat 20 1 w m 2 for the direct r c method the rmse remained on a sharply downswing until 14 00 which meant the best performance time in general the eva f and r eva f method had relatively uniform rmse throughout the daytime with the average values for both methods lower than 12 1 w m 2 the k c et 0 method had acceptable accuracy with an average rmse of 20 6 w m 2 when the λet i was used from 9 00 15 00 however the r k c et 0 and direct r c method performed not well with the average rmse of 38 0 and 39 5 w m 2 respectively overall for both tea and wheat five methods had a similar performance in different growing seasons the eva f and r eva f method were more reliable and robust than other methods k c et 0 method r k c et 0 method and direct r c method for λet d estimation with a little underestimation in daytime the k c et 0 method was obviously superior to the remaining r k c et 0 and direct r c method and had a good performance when the λet i in the afternoon was used but a great overestimation was found when λet i before 14 00 was used the r k c et 0 and direct r c method had underperformed and only had an acceptable estimation result when the λet i at noon was used 3 4 the cause analysis of discrepancy of estimated and measued λet d synthetically the eva f and r eva f method achieved good results in simulating the λet d from the λet i at most time but the r eva f method was slightly inferior to the eva f method the cause of error may be due to the soil heat flux g was neglected it was recommended that g should be included in the calculation of λet d using the eva f method chávez et al 2008 since accurate estimations of daytime g are difficult due to the effects of variations in soil thermal properties and soil moisture this result highlighted a further limiting factor in the applicability of the eva f method particularly over sparsely vegetated areas where the contribution of g is particularly relevant however cammalleri et al 2014 pointed out that the impact of g may be less important if the daily flux was 24 h rather than daytime only in this study the k c et 0 method provided robust results with the high accuracy rmse 20 62 w m 2 ε 0 79 while great overestimation and unstable k c diurnal variation suggested that et 0 is not an improvement as a scaling flux in comparison with the net radiation r n or available energy r n g previous studies demonstrated that the diurnal pattern of k c was strongly dependent on leaf area index lai e g yang et al 2013 indicated that the performance of the k c et 0 method might be poor at higher lai while zhang et al 2017 reported that the k c et 0 method gave a good performance even at high lai it is recommended that lai may not exclusively reflect the plant evolution and other factors can be considered to describe the vegetation conditions previous studies demonstrated that the k c et 0 method had good performances over agricultural irrigated areas allen et al 2007 trezza 2002 alfalfa and irrigated cotton fields colaizzi et al 2005 less optimal application over natural semi arid and forested sites bare soil where λet decreased rapidly in a dry soil colaizzi et al 2005 as implemented here possible limitations of the k c et 0 method may be as follows one is that related to the differences in aerodynamic properties between the reference surface and the actual landscape site particularly for semi arid areas or forested sites the accuracy of et 0 estimates computed from the local weather data will not be a true et 0 potentially compromising the reliability of et 0 as upscaling quantity another is that the limitations of the methodology in the presence of rapidly changing soil water stress and strong stomatal regulation yang et al 2013 unexpectedly using varied surface resistances r c did not produce a much closer upscaled λet d than using a fixed r c the r k c et 0 method had a relatively lower accuracy in estimating the λet d than the k c et 0 method tang et al 2017 reported the r k c et 0 method performed better at the humid site than at the arid site however it had a weak performance of the λet d estimates at the two humid areas in this study besides the r k c et 0 method had a different result which simulated the λet d well for the wheat but significantly overestimated the tea λet d the reason for the different performance of the r k c et 0 method in tea and wheat fields might due to the diverse diurnal variations of r c estimated by td model r c td the r c calculated by inverting the pm equation r c pm was characterized as the reference values the averaged diurnal evolutions of estimated r c td and r c pm during the whole growing period of tea and wheat were analyzed fig 7 the daytime r c td exhibited a concave shape with the minimum value occurring at noon and the maximum in the early morning or late afternoon the averaged daytime r c td for the wheat growing period was higher than that for the tea while the r c td was always significantly lower than the r c pm for tea and showed dissimilar diurnal variations for tea and wheat yan et al 2021 pointed out that the td method performed less effectively for the tea field where λet d was overestimated while it performed well for the wheat field this may be the main reason for the r k c et 0 method performed better for wheat than for the tea the direct r c method overestimated λet d for the most of intervals although the pm model is generally acknowledged as a standard method with high accuracy for the direct calculation of λet d and λet i this indicated the hypothesis that r c remained a stability constant in daytime did not seem to be valid in this study and the direct r c method might be not suitable for extrapolation purposes 4 conclusions in this study five upscaling methods eva f r eva f k c et 0 r k c et 0 and direct r c method were applied and compared for evaluating their performance in estimating λet d from λet i the accuracy of the methods was validated using the measured λet d by the breb method in a tea and wheat field the following conclusions were obtained both the eva f and r eva f methods were good options for predicting λet d of tea and wheat from λet i however the r eva f method was slightly inferior to the eva f method owing to its neglecting of the soil heat flux g specifically the eva f and r eva f method gave the best scaling when using values from 11 00 14 00 the k c et 0 method was a good method for predicting λet d of tea and wheat although it yielded a systematic overestimation of λet d and appeared to be less accurate than the eva f and r eva f method the r k c et 0 method showed a relatively lower accuracy in the λet d estimation than the k c et 0 method due to its application of the canopy resistance r c besides the r k c et 0 method showed different accuracies for tea and wheat due to the dissimilar diurnal variations of r c td the discrepancy between the k c et 0 and r k c et 0 method was not significant for wheat but a wide difference for tea the direct r c method overestimated λet d for the most of intervals with the mean rmse and ε of 39 58 w m 2 and 0 62 and was not suitable for extrapolation purposes the results of the present study will provide a scientific basis and an

9606,accurately converting instantaneous evapotranspiration λet i at satellite over passing time into daily evapotranspiration λet d is a key issue of applying remotely sensed data to estimate regional evapotranspiration λet from remote sensing satellites which plays an important role for effective water resource management the scaling methods that take advantage of the relationship between λet and other environmental factors and can be used to convert λet i into λet d in this study five scaling methods of converting λet i into λet d including the evaporative fraction method eva f method revised evaporative fraction method r eva f method crop coefficient method k c et 0 method revised crop coefficient method r k c et 0 method and direct canopy resistance method direct r c method were evaluated based on the detailed meteorological data measured from 2016 to 2018 in a tea field and 2018 to 2020 in a wheat field in southeast china the estimated λet d was compared with the measured λet d by the bowen ratio energy balance breb method the results indicated that the eva f and r eva f methods with the mean root mean square error rmse and coefficient of efficiency ε equaled 9 02 w m 2 and 0 92 12 06 w m 2 and 0 89 respectively were superior to the k c et 0 r k c et 0 and direct r c method the k c et 0 method with the mean rmse and ε equaled 20 62 w m 2 and 0 79 was also a good option for simulating the λet d of tea and wheat while the r k c et 0 method simulated the λet d well for the wheat with mean rmse and ε equaled 36 29 w m 2 and 0 71 but significantly overestimated the tea λet d with the mean rmse and ε values of 39 61 w m 2 and 0 59 for tea the direct r c method overestimated λet d of tea and wheat for the most of intervals with the mean rmse and ε of 39 58 w m

resources allocation and irrigation management chen et al 2019 evapotranspiration equivalent form of the latent heat flux λet plays a key role in agricultural water management as it consumes a majority of the total water huang et al 2020 yan et al 2018 thus accurate determination of λet is strongly needed for agricultural production and agricultural water management numerous instruments have become commercially available for measuring the λet such as bowen ratio tower eddy covariance and scintillometry pozníková et al 2018 however conventional observation techniques give only point measurements and are restricted by poor spatial representation and numerous expensive installations liu et al 2012b a good alternative approach is to relate λet to remotely sensed surface temperature based on the energy balance equation zhang and lemeur 1995 remote sensing with satellites offers a means of estimating λet over a large spatial scale due to the great spatial representation xue et al 2020 and the relatively low cost of data collection filgueiras et al 2020 however instantaneous data derived from remotely sensing only provide instantaneous evapotranspiration λet i in practice λet is required on a daily as well as longer time scales for establishing a reasonable irrigation scheduling consequently reliable methods to convert λet i into daily evapotranspiration λet d are worthwhile to develop some scaling methods of estimating λet d from instantaneous values have been proposed cammalleri et al 2014 chávez et al 2008 the key to developing various scaling methods is to associate λet d to a factor that is generally a constant during the daytime or the whole diurnal cycle farah et al 2004 liu et al 2012a this factor can be expressed as a ratio between λet i at a specific time of the day and a reference variable that can be computed daily tang et al 2013 van niel et al 2012 the most common technique for estimating λet d from instantaneous values is based on the evaporative fraction e f defined as the ratio of the λet to available energy shuttleworth et al 1989 the evaporative fraction method eva f method is well known for the assumption that e f is selfpreserving which means it is constant or nearly constant over the daytime its effectiveness in accurate estimation of λet d has been demonstrated for natural grassland in northeastern kansas crago 1996 five distinct vegetative covers in southwest france nichols and cuenca 1993 for winter wheat and summer corn in northern china tang et al 2013 and for maize field in semiarid northwest china zhang et al 2017 however it has been shown in previous studies that the assumption of self preserving can be influenced by variable environmental factors such as cloud cover soil moisture conditions and different vegetation cover farah et al 2004 gentine et al 2007 lhomme and elguero 1999 wandera et al 2017 xu et al 2015 the diurnal variation of e f was almost constant under dry conditions but it depicted a pronounced concave up shape under wet conditions hoedjes et al 2008 for the same soil moisture the stability of e f was lower when the leaf area index was higher gentine et al 2007 tang et al 2013 and van niel et al 2012 implied that the e f was more variable during cloudy conditions when compared to clear sky conditions those variable environmental factors may cause inaccuracy of λet d estimations when utilizing the eva f method chemin and alexandridis 2001 proposed that assuming soil heat flux g equal to 0 might yield a significant improvement in the accuracy of the eva f method for calculating λet d since the g accounted for a low percentage in the surface energy balance and always varied with the soil thermal properties and soil moisture thus a revised eva f method referred as r eva f method was proposed to estimate λet d based on a revised e f re f which is defined as the ratio of λet to net radiation r n suleiman and crago 2004 used the r eva f method to extrapolate λet d from hourly values and the results demonstrated that the r eva f method had a good performance for grassland however chávez et al 2008 implied that the r eva f method had an overestimation for corn and soybean fields together this result indicated that daily average g should be included in the computation of scaling methods considering the influence of other meteorological conditions on the λet allen et al 2007 found that the crop coefficient k c which is defined as the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to a reference evapotranspiration et 0 is nearly constant at a low frequency during the day so that it can be used to extrapolate λet d from λet i hence a crop coefficient k c et 0 method for estimating λet d was proposed based on k c and et 0 the assumption in the k c et 0 method is that the value of instantaneous k c is similar to the daily average value the k c et 0 method takes into account the effects of atmospheric properties and has been successfully applied to several experiments in estimating λet d from instantaneous values delogu et al 2012 xu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 previous studies demonstrated that the k c et 0 method had good performances over agricultural irrigated areas allen et al 2007 trezza 2002 alfalfa and irrigated cotton fields colaizzi et al 2005 less optimal application over natural semi arid and forested sites bare soil where λet decreased rapidly in a dry soil colaizzi et al 2005 chávez et al 2008 pointed out that the k c et 0 method maybe work poorly in the situations with considerable deviation from reference grass or alfalfa field due to the limitation of its definition tasumi et al 2005 reported that the fixed canopy resistance r c used in the k c et 0 method may be only suitable for reference crops the daytime r c may vary for the actual crops lecina et al 2003 todorovic 1999 and can be considered vitally as an important factor that influence λet the effect of r c can be further investigate especially when the r c significantly deviates from the commonly used fixed value as a physiological and aerodynamic parameter the r c over the course of a day is essentially time dependent and can be influenced by variations in solar radiation vapor pressure deficit and wind speed even for the water unstressed reference grass alfalfa surface tang and li 2017 tang et al 2017 investigated using varied r c in λet d estimation could improve the accuracy of the k c et 0 method in the afternoon but worse results may occur in the morning accordingly an improved k c et 0 method r k c et 0 method was proposed that varied r c instead of the fixed r c recommended by fao 56 was used when calculating the et 0 of the k c et 0 method based on the arguments on the application of r c in the k c et 0 method malek et al 1992 presented a direct method direct r c method of scaling up λet using the r c calculated by inverting the original penman monteith equation and showed that r c can be used as a nearly constant to scale up λet the performance of the direct r c method has been confirmed in many studies tang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 tang and li 2017 demonstrated relatively large the diurnal variation of r c tang et al 2017 reported that using varied r c in direct r c method did not produce a much closer scaled λet d than using a fixed r c and pointed out that the assumption of the r c nearly constant during the daytime was doubtful and further research was needed the available research findings shown the performances of the above scaling methods eva f r eva f k c et 0 r k c et 0 and direct r c method may be different for instantaneous time at different satellite over passing time climatic conditions and vegetation growing conditions zhang et al 2017 showed the optimal values with the eva f and k c et 0 methods appeared at 11 00 15 00 whereas the r k c et 0 method gave the best performance when using values at 12 00 tang et al 2017 demonstrated that the r k c et 0 method performed better at the humid site than at the arid site colaizzi et al 2005 reported that the eva f method performed better for bare soil than for transpiring crops the conclusions of previous studies were not always consistent even in similar vegetation cover conditions the vegetation cover and climatic conditions could be considerable influence factors on the accuracy of the upscaling methods most of the studies were conducted in the arid or semiarid regions gentine et al 2007 ibáñez and castellví 2000 zhang et al 2017 few in the humid regions thus the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the performances of the five scaling methods eva f r eva f k c et 0 r k c et 0 and direct r c method in estimation of the λet d from λet i using ground based measurements for two vegetation cover types tea and wheat grown in a humid region 2 to analyze the causes of the discrepancies between the measured and estimated λet d using different methods and 3 to recommend proper approaches for estimating λet d at the tea and wheat fields in southeast china 2 materials and methods 2 1 field observation the data in this study was collected from two long term automatic weather stations at a tea and wheat field in zhenjiang 31 56 n 119 10 e 23 m a s l and changzhou city 31 41 n 119 40 e 15 m a s l respectively in jiangsu province of southeast china the research areas belong to humid subtropical monsoon climatic zone the measurements in the tea field 55 m 58 m was conducted in the middle growing period of the tea plants from march 2016 to february 2018 the tea plants anji white tea a famous tea in china were transplanted in march 5th 2014 at distances of 1 20 m 0 52 m with more than 7000 m2 zone around planted other tea plants conventional farming practices made tea plants to be pruned to maintain a height of 0 5 m the total precipitation came up to 1080 1 mm while the total evapotranspiration was 780 1 mm during march 2016 to march 2017 the tea field was sprinkler irrigated with 880 mm amount of irrigation during 2016 2018 the soil texture of the tea field is mainly loam the field capacity and the soil water content at wilting point were measured by taking 5 soil samplings at different soil layers 10 20 40 cm the corresponding average values are 30 and 10 respectively the measurements in the wheat field were conducted in two growing seasons one from 26 november 2018 1 june 2019 and the other growing season from 19 november 2019 23 may 2020 the area of the wheat field was 0 56 ha 103 m 54 m with a row spacing of 0 25 m and the seeding rate was 300 kg ha 1 the measured maximum heights of the wheat plants were 0 75 m and 0 72 m reached at maturity in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively the wheat was rain fed because plentiful rainfall adequately met the wheat hydration needs of the whole growth period the soil texture of the wheat field is mainly loam the field capacity and wilting point were measured with the same method as in the tea field with corresponding values of 25 and 9 6 respectively two sets of identical weather stations were installed separately in the center of the tea field and the wheat field adequate fetch 100 200 m can be provided because of the great area of similar crops surrounding in the tea and wheat fields and the probes for measuring the air temperature and humidity instating in two low heights 50 100 cm above the canopy the net radiation r n and wind speed u were measured respectively by a net radiometer cnr 4 sensor kipp and zoen in the netherlands with sensitivity of 10 0 μv w m 2 and a three cup anemometer a100l2 metone in the united states the accuracy of 0 12 m s 1 at 2 5 m above the ground air temperature t a and relative humidity rh were measured by two sensors hmp155a vaisala finland the accuracy of 0 1 t a and 2 rh at different heights 1 5 m and 2 5 m in order to be used in the bowen ratio energy balance breb method soil heat flux g was measured by a soil heat plate hfp01 l10 campbell scientific usa at 2 cm depth with sensitivity of 62 20 μv w m 2 and accuracy of 15 to 5 volumetric soil water content vwc was measured by five hydra probe sensors stevens usa the accuracy of

campbell scientific usa and data was set to collect every 10 s averaged every 10 min validations were done before the installation to ensure the accuracy of all the sensors due to instrument failure data in the tea field gaped from 11 july 2017 27 october 2017 the meteorological data were used to drive the λet scaling methods and to calculate the λet d and λet i by the breb method these data were carefully checked to ensure the quality and completeness of the daily cycle in two steps first the λet results were ignored when β is close to 0 75 ohmura 1982 and days with data gaps caused by instrument malfunctions or maintenance and the data spikes and abnormalities in the atmospheric variables were excluded after these data quality and completeness checks 342 days 2016 2017 and 254 days 2017 2018 at the tea field and 188 days 2018 2019 and 187 days 2017 2018 at the wheat field were available for further analysis 2 2 scaling up methods in this study five upscaling methods were selected for evaluating their performance of estimating daily evapotranspiration λet d from 8 00 18 00 from instantaneous evapotranspiration λet i at a certain hourly time estimates derived from bowen ratio energy balance observations system 2 2 1 eva f method the eva f method to estimate λet d from λet i can be expressed as sugita and brutsaert 1991 1 e f λ et i r n g i 2 λ et d e f r n g d where

2017 and 2017 2018 respectively the wind speed u varied from 0 42 to 6 19 m s 1 and 0 43 to 6 30 m s 1 with mean values of 2 06 and 1 95 m s 1 in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 respectively for wheat field t a and vpd ranged from 1 9 to 27 4 and 0 01 to 1 83 kpa with average values equaled 10 6 and 0 34 kpa in 2018 2019 from 26 nov 2018 28 jun 2019 and ranged from 0 6 to 26 5 and 0 002 to 1 50 kpa in 2019

according to the variation of t a during the whole growing period three typical periods were selected fig 2 to analyze the hourly variation of energy fluxes in tea and wheat fields among these periods the peak values of hourly average r n for each period ranged from 276 3 to 448 2 w m 2 in the tea field and 179 4 to 424 5 w m 2 in the wheat field 3 2 validity of the constancy of the upscaling factors to finely apply these five scaling methods eva f r eva f k c et 0 r k c et 0 and direct r c method it is necessary to understand the diurnal variations and assess the constancy of the parameters of the evaporative fraction e f revised evaporative fraction re f crop coefficient k c revised crop coefficient rk c and canopy resistance r c fig 3a c illustrated hourly variations of the parameters by averaging the parameters in time intervals per day during the growing season of the tea in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 and the wheat in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively all parameters displayed the amplitude of nearly stable in the noon with different degrees of decrease or increase in the early morning and the late afternoon specifically the diurnal variations of the e f re f k c and r c behaved similarly on tea plants and wheat plants while the diurnal variations of rk c behaved differently on tea plants and wheat plants the e f remained fairly constant with a slight concave up shape and ranged from 0 6 to 0 8 for tea and 0 5 to 0 7 for wheat while re f fluctuated obviously before 9 00 and after 15 00 with a gentle variation for most time fig 3a possible reason for the typical concave up variation is due to weather conditions and vegetation factors chávez et al 2008 gentine et al 2007 liu et al 2020 the parameter k c showed a mildly concave down shape through the day and relatively dramatic changes in early morning and late afternoon and reached a maximum near noon fig 3b a and c similar trend of k c in the daytime performed in the liu et al 2012a was found but the magnitude of k c was commonly higher than that of e f as an aggregate result of the soil water stress and vegetation coverage zhang et al 2017 on the other hand fig 3b b and d displayed the diurnal variations of rk c where a mild concave down shape in wheat but a rapid and continued decline in tea was be found the rk c was fairly constant from 11 00 14 00 in wheat which was an indication that instantaneous values could be representative of daytime values the unsteadiness of rk c for tea plants during the daytime may result in considerable error for converting λet i into λet d the trend of r c showed a sharply decreasing trend in the early morning and the late afternoon fig 3c while it remained constant for most time with the mean value of 179 m s 1 for tea and 202 m s 1 for wheat liu et al 2020 pointed out that the diurnal pattern of the e f is mainly influenced by the stomatal regulation this explained the similar diurnal patter of e f re f and r c since r c is basically determined by leaf stomatal regulation 3 3 performance of the five upscaling methods the performance of five scaling methods eva f r eva f k c et 0 r k c et 0 and direct r c method in estimated λet d based on the λet i at 09 00 15 00 for tea and wheat was validated based on the measured λet d using the bber method and is presented in table 1 the λet i from 09 00 15 00 was selected due to this time period coincides with the time when most of the satellites appear over the study area and the upscaling factors are fairly constant the linear fitting is performed with the intercept set to zero for the eva f and r eva f method the slopes a of the linear relationships between estimated and measured λet d showed a slightly upward trend during the day and approximated one at around 12 00 13 00 the two methods slightly underestimated the values of λet d in the morning and overestimated in the afternoon both in the cases of tea and wheat the coefficient of determination r 2 varied from 0 82 to 0 99 indicating strong correlation between measured and estimated λet d previous studies demonstrated the difference between the measured λet d and the estimated value of the eva f method based on λet i at noon was small crago 1996 hoedjes et al 2008 while the a between measured and estimated λet d calculated by k c et 0 r k c et 0 and direct r c method in the cases of tea and wheat changed greatly with an arched trend during the day and was close to one at around 13 00 14 00 in most cases those three methods markedly overestimated the λet d when the λet i between 9 00 and 13 00 was used especially the direct r c method the bias of the estimated λet d calculated by five methods eva f r eva f k c et 0 r k c et 0 and direct r c method for the seven one hour temporal points were plotted in fig 4 the diurnal bias patterns for the eva f and r eva f method only changed slightly through the day while the bias of the estimated λet d calculated by the k c et 0 r k c et 0 and direct r c method changed severely through the day with an overestimation when the λet i was used in the morning and afternoon the bias of the estimated λet d calculated by the k c et 0 and direct r c method were high when the λet i was used in the morning but decreased obviously during 14 00 15 00 the bias of the estimated λet d calculated by the r k c et 0 method had a different performance between the tea and wheat with a sharply decrease for wheat and an arch shape for tea the minimum bias appeared when the λet i was used at 12 00 for wheat and at 13 00 for tea respectively overall the eva f method had the smallest bias and followed by the r eva f method which absolute bias values were less than 10 at all times while the k c et 0 method r k c et 0 method and direct r c method displayed overestimation in most cases moreover diurnal variation of the efficiency coefficient ε of the estimated λet d calculated by five methods displayed in fig 5 the hourly variations of ε for the estimated λet d calculated by the eva f and r eva f method in the daytime showed a slight concave down pattern and more stable than the other methods the excellent ε values 0 98 for the eva f method 0 97 for the r eva f method were obtained when the λet i at noon was used for the scaling methods and showed good performances which agreed with results reported for the mediterranean region ibáñez and castellví 2000 for the k c et 0 method the variation of ε demonstrated obvious concave up image which increased progressively then a good ε value 0 89 was obtained by the k c et 0 method when the λet i was used at 14 00 for the r k c et 0 method the trend of ε curve showed little similar for tea and wheat which sharply concaved down and attached the peak when the λet i was used at 12 00 for tea increased steadily and attached the peak when the λet i was used at 14 00 for wheat the mean ε value of the estimated λet d calculated by the r k c et 0 method was only 0 75 for wheat and 0 59 for tea poorly the direct r c method performed worse with the mean ε value equaled 0 60 the rmse of the estimated λet d calculated by five methods varied greatly as shown in fig 6 for the eva f and r eva f method the trend of rmse showed a smooth concave up shape which further confirmed the good performance for most time as explained in figs 4 and 5 for the k c et 0 method the rmse changed from 30 86 w m 2 to 13 7 w m 2 when the λet i was used during 9 00 14 00 but later increased further to 23 50 w m 2 for the r k c et 0 method the rmse showed different performance for tea and wheat which the minimum value appeared when the λet i was used at 12 00 for tea 26 3 w m 2 and at 14 00 for wheat 20 1 w m 2 for the direct r c method the rmse remained on a sharply downswing until 14 00 which meant the best performance time in general the eva f and r eva f method had relatively uniform rmse throughout the daytime with the average values for both methods lower than 12 1 w m 2 the k c et 0 method had acceptable accuracy with an average rmse of 20 6 w m 2 when the λet i was used from 9 00 15 00 however the r k c et 0 and direct r c method performed not well with the average rmse of 38 0 and 39 5 w m 2 respectively overall for both tea and wheat five methods had a similar performance in different growing seasons the eva f and r eva f method were more reliable and robust than other methods k c et 0 method r k c et 0 method and direct r c method for λet d estimation with a little underestimation in daytime the k c et 0 method was obviously superior to the remaining r k c et 0 and direct r c method and had a good performance when the λet i in the afternoon was used but a great overestimation was found when λet i before 14 00 was used the r k c et 0 and direct r c method had underperformed and only had an acceptable estimation result when the λet i at noon was used 3 4 the cause analysis of discrepancy of estimated and measued λet d synthetically the eva f and r eva f method achieved good results in simulating the λet d from the λet i at most time but the r eva f method was slightly inferior to the eva f method the cause of error may be due to the soil heat flux g was neglected it was recommended that g should be included in the calculation of λet d using the eva f method chávez et al 2008 since accurate estimations of daytime g are difficult due to the effects of variations in soil thermal properties and soil moisture this result highlighted a further limiting factor in the applicability of the eva f method particularly over sparsely vegetated areas where the contribution of g is particularly relevant however cammalleri et al 2014 pointed out that the impact of g may be less important if the daily flux was 24 h rather than daytime only in this study the k c et 0 method provided robust results with the high accuracy rmse 20 62 w m 2 ε 0 79 while great overestimation and unstable k c diurnal variation suggested that et 0 is not an improvement as a scaling flux in comparison with the net radiation r n or available energy r n g previous studies demonstrated that the diurnal pattern of k c was strongly dependent on leaf area index lai e g yang et al 2013 indicated that the performance of the k c et 0 method might be poor at higher lai while zhang et al 2017 reported that the k c et 0 method gave a good performance even at high lai it is recommended that lai may not exclusively reflect the plant evolution and other factors can be considered to describe the vegetation conditions previous studies demonstrated that the k c et 0 method had good performances over agricultural irrigated areas allen et al 2007 trezza 2002 alfalfa and irrigated cotton fields colaizzi et al 2005 less optimal application over natural semi arid and forested sites bare soil where λet decreased rapidly in a dry soil colaizzi et al 2005 as implemented here possible limitations of the k c et 0 method may be as follows one is that related to the differences in aerodynamic properties between the reference surface and the actual landscape site particularly for semi arid areas or forested sites the accuracy of et 0 estimates computed from the local weather data will not be a true et 0 potentially compromising the reliability of et 0 as upscaling quantity another is that the limitations of the methodology in the presence of rapidly changing soil water stress and strong stomatal regulation yang et al 2013 unexpectedly using varied surface resistances r c did not produce a much closer upscaled λet d than using a fixed r c the r k c et 0 method had a relatively lower accuracy in estimating the λet d than the k c et 0 method tang et al 2017 reported the r k c et 0 method performed better at the humid site than at the arid site however it had a weak performance of the λet d estimates at the two humid areas in this study besides the r k c et 0 method had a different result which simulated the λet d well for the wheat but significantly overestimated the tea λet d the reason for the different performance of the r k c et 0 method in tea and wheat fields might due to the diverse diurnal variations of r c estimated by td model r c td the r c calculated by inverting the pm equation r c pm was characterized as the reference values the averaged diurnal evolutions of estimated r c td and r c pm during the whole growing period of tea and wheat were analyzed fig 7 the daytime r c td exhibited a concave shape with the minimum value occurring at noon and the maximum in the early morning or late afternoon the averaged daytime r c td for the wheat growing period was higher than that for the tea while the r c td was always significantly lower than the r c pm for tea and showed dissimilar diurnal variations for tea and wheat yan et al 2021 pointed out that the td method performed less effectively for the tea field where λet d was overestimated while it performed well for the wheat field this may be the main reason for the r k c et 0 method performed better for wheat than for the tea the direct r c method overestimated λet d for the most of intervals although the pm model is generally acknowledged as a standard method with high accuracy for the direct calculation of λet d and λet i this indicated the hypothesis that r c remained a stability constant in daytime did not seem to be valid in this study and the direct r c method might be not suitable for extrapolation purposes 4 conclusions in this study five upscaling methods eva f r eva f k c et 0 r k c et 0 and direct r c method were applied and compared for evaluating their performance in estimating λet d from λet i the accuracy of the methods was validated using the measured λet d by the breb method in a tea and wheat field the following conclusions were obtained both the eva f and r eva f methods were good options for predicting λet d of tea and wheat from λet i however the r eva f method was slightly inferior to the eva f method owing to its neglecting of the soil heat flux g specifically the eva f and r eva f method gave the best scaling when using values from 11 00 14 00 the k c et 0 method was a good method for predicting λet d of tea and wheat although it yielded a systematic overestimation of λet d and appeared to be less accurate than the eva f and r eva f method the r k c et 0 method showed a relatively lower accuracy in the λet d estimation than the k c et 0 method due to its application of the canopy resistance r c besides the r k c et 0 method showed different accuracies for tea and wheat due to the dissimilar diurnal variations of r c td the discrepancy between the k c et 0 and r k c et 0 method was not significant for wheat but a wide difference for tea the direct r c method overestimated λet d for the most of intervals with the mean rmse and ε of 39 58 w m 2 and 0 62 and was not suitable for extrapolation purposes the results of the present study will provide a scientific basis and an effective tool for the estimation of λet d at regional scale based on the instantaneous data of the remotely sensing declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

keywords raised and sunken beds low land crop diversification cropping system water productivity production efficiency 1 introduction the north eastern region ner of india being under subtropical climate receives very high rainfall average annual rainfall 200 cm being bestowed with plentiful of water resources many low laying agricultural lands of the region remain saturated to over saturated through wet season very often crop plants suffer from poor drainage leading to crop failure datta and jong 2002 the hill and mountain topography of the region further aggravates the situation even in winter season the water table in valley areas remains high mainly because of continuous runoff and seepage from surrounding uplands chris et al 2010 causing damage to agriculture calder 2000 bruijnzeel 2004 consequently monocropping of rice prevails as the traditional practice in valley land of ner of india as farmers can hardly grow any other arable crops than rice owing to excess soil moisture besides rice crop alone is not remunerative as the average productivity of rice in ner is very low 1 8 t ha 1 it is difficult to ensure definite income as the production is very much influenced by the nature baishya et al 2009 in case of the low laying lands of ner land submergence occurs up to 50 cm in peak monsoon period and the soil remains in saturated conditions up to november month since the crop and water productivity wp of monocropped rice is low it necessitates development of alternative technology for the low lying paddy lands for income generation and sustaining food security diversification and intensification of rice based cropping system to increase productivity per unit resource is very pertinent to enhance productivity and income ghosh et al 2009 crop diversification ensures balanced food supply conserves natural resources reduces fertilizer and pesticide loads and creates employment opportunity gill and ahlawat 2006 the land configuration through raised and sunken bed system in this context is a useful technique for proper land and water management to increase cropping intensity and productivity sharma 2003 the raised and sunken bed rsb is a land configuration specially designed by cutting and filling method for low laying areas such beds are prepared by removing the surface soil layer from an area and depositing the same on the adjacent area to a height as per requirement crop diversification through this system has been recognized as an effective strategy for judicious use of land and water resources as well as for poverty alleviation through achieving food and nutrition security in a sustainable manner das et al 2014 modification of field topography through construction of alternate raised and sunken beds

discussion 4 1 productivity and land use efficiency under rsb system the land configuration through rsb showed substantial improvement in the crop productivity due to crop diversification and intensification water conservation in sunken beds helped for raising crops in raised beds das et al 2014 consequently enhancement in rey due to rsb was 230 1511 over the fp increase in yield due to rsb technique was reported earlier by many researchers jat et al 2012 das et al 2013b low yield of crop in fp might be due to poor nutrient and crop management practices followed by farmers in case of fp the land gets submerged as the land situation was low laying paddy land however with the advantage of rsb system the raised beds were not getting submerged thus higher rey in rsb technology over the fp was primarily due to two reasons first improvement in the soil microclimate including the physical environment due to land configuration through rsb singh et al 2004 which might have modified the soil moisture and temperature favouring the soil plant system for better crop growth second inclusion of vegetables with pulses legumes crops in the system das et al 2014 leading to higher production from the system higher market price of the vegetables and pulses compared to rice might have enhanced the rey in rsb table 3 introduction of leguminous crops in the system improved the biological n fixation in soil saha and ghosh 2010 enhancement in rey due to inclusion of vegetables and pulse crops in the sequences has been widely reported kumar et al 2008 das et al 2013a increase in wee was due to enhancement in cropping intensity and higher yield of crops under rsb system as compared to fp sharma et al 2007 jat et al 2012 in our study water accumulated in the sunken beds was initially used manually for irrigating crops in the raised beds no irrigations were applied after establishment of the crops in the raised beds as there was sufficient moisture below the surface layer due to lateral and upward movement of water from the adjacent sunken beds research reports from orissa and meghalaya of india reported 400 600 enhancement in wue under rsb system singh et al 2005 das et al 2014 higher wee in case of various vegetable based cropping systems under rsb system over monocropping of rice was reported earlier by singh et al 2005 the production efficiency pe varies depending on the yield and duration of the crops tomar and tiwari 1990 significantly higher rey of the vegetable based cropping sequences resulted higher pe under rsb compared to fp kharub et al 2003 saha and ghosh 2010 increase in pe due to crop intensification under rsb land configuration was also reported earlier from high rainfall areas of india sharma et al 2004 das et al 2014 the higher lue was observed in case of the cropping sequences under rsb because of the field was under cover with crops for longer time compared to monocropping of rice fp sharma et al 2004 reported increase in lue with inclusion of vegetables and pulses in the cropping system higher lue due to efficient utilization of land for longer duration by cropping sequences over rice monocropping system was reported saha and ghosh 2010 4 2 economic analysis of the rsb system crop intensification and diversification enhanced the economic profitability under rsb system besides creating employment opportunity gill and ahlawat 2006 in the present study the employment generation was increased by 111 260 in various cropping sequences under rsb over the monocropping of rice practised by the farmers over 445 increase in employment opportunity under rsb over fp was also reported by das et al 2014 higher economic returns from the vegetable based sequence under rsb system over monocropping of rice has been reported by das et al 2014 the lowest gross return usd 436 9 ha 1 and net return usd 26 3 ha 1 was recorded in the monocropping of rice fp which was much lower than all other cropping sequences under rsb the lowest gross and net returns under rice monocropping fp were also reported earlier by previous researchers mishra et al 2007 ghosh et al 2009 in this study 25 240 folds increase in net return were recorded through rsb land configuration over fp except the rice rice system under rsd the b c of all the other cropping sequences were over 2 0 higher b c ratio under rsb land configuration was due to inclusion of high value vegetable and pulse crops in the system das et al 2014 previous researchers also reported increment in b c ratio under rsb system over monocropping of rice ghosh et al 2009 das et al 2013b 5 conclusion the rsb land configuration technique in the low lying paddy land of ner of india is very promising the rsb land configuration not only helps in crop diversification and intensification through out the year but also increase the productivity and profitability over rice monocropping system under long term various cropping sequences such as broccoli blackgram cabbage blackgram cauliflower blackgram tomato cowpea fodder chilli greengram potato blackgram pea greengram etc in raised beds and rice rice sequence in sunken beds are possible to diversify the rice monocropping system in the low lying paddy lands the various cropping sequences under rsb enhanced the wp and pe by 2 0 31 0 and 1 5 13 8 times over the rice monocropping system fp there were over 10 times 942 increase in employment generation and 4 times 336 in crop production under rsb over the fp the net return and b c ratio were also increased significantly due to rsb land configuration

9607,the raised and sunken bed rsb land configuration was tested and evaluated during 2017 2020 for promoting crop diversification and intensification enhancing water and crop productivity and testing the economic variability of the farmers of north east india being situated in sub tropics the study area received an average annual rainfall of 1905 mm water accumulated in the sunken beds was used for irrigating crops in the raised beds the results indicated considerable improvement in cropping intensity productivity employment and income under rsb system in comparison to farmers practice fp of rice monocropping system various cropping sequences such as broccoli blackgram cabbage blackgram cauliflower blackgram tomato cowpea fodder chilli greengram potato blackgram pea greengram etc in raised beds and rice rice sequence in sunken beds were possible under rsb land configuration to diversify the rice monocropping system the rice equivalent yield rey of the cropping sequences under rsb ranged between 8 9 and 43 5 t ha 1 over only 2 7 t ha 1 under fp the employment generation and crop production were enhanced by over 10 times 942 and 4 times 336 respectively under rsb over the fp similarly water productivity and production efficiency were enhanced by 2 0 31 0 and 1 5 13 8 times respectively through various cropping sequences compared to rice monocropping fp the various cropping sequences under rsb land configuration enhanced the b c ratio by 75 5 513 2 over the fp producing a net income ranging from usd 657 7 to usd 5890 1 ha 1 against only usd 26 1 ha 1 under fp keywords raised and sunken beds low land crop diversification cropping system water productivity production efficiency 1 introduction the north eastern region ner of india being under subtropical climate receives very high rainfall average annual rainfall 200 cm being bestowed with plentiful of water resources many low laying agricultural lands of the region remain saturated to over saturated through wet season very often crop plants suffer from poor drainage leading to crop failure datta and jong 2002 the hill and mountain topography of the region further aggravates the situation even in winter season the water table in valley areas remains high mainly because of continuous runoff and seepage from surrounding uplands chris et al 2010 causing damage to agriculture calder 2000 bruijnzeel 2004 consequently monocropping of rice prevails as the traditional practice in valley land of ner of india as farmers can hardly grow any other arable crops than rice owing to excess soil moisture besides rice crop alone is not remunerative as the average productivity of rice in ner is very low 1 8 t ha 1 it is difficult to ensure definite income as the production is very much influenced by the nature baishya et al 2009 in case of the low laying lands of ner land submergence occurs up to 50 cm in peak monsoon period and the soil remains in saturated conditions up to november month since the crop and water productivity wp of monocropped rice is low it necessitates development of alternative technology for the low lying paddy lands for income generation and sustaining food security diversification and intensification of rice based cropping system to increase productivity per unit resource is very pertinent to enhance productivity and income ghosh et al 2009 crop diversification ensures balanced food supply conserves natural resources reduces fertilizer and pesticide loads and creates employment opportunity gill and ahlawat 2006 the land configuration through raised and sunken bed system in this context is a useful technique for proper land and water management to increase cropping intensity and productivity sharma 2003 the raised and sunken bed rsb is a land configuration specially designed by cutting and filling method for low laying areas such beds are prepared by removing the surface soil layer from an area and depositing the same on the adjacent area to a height as per requirement crop diversification through this system has been recognized as an effective strategy for judicious use of land and water resources as well as for poverty alleviation through achieving food and nutrition security in a sustainable manner das et al 2014 modification of field topography through construction of alternate raised and sunken beds improves the physical environment particularly aeration status of the soil and creates proper condition for growth of crops other than rice tomar et al 1996 singh et al 2004 it has been well recognized that inclusion of pulse and vegetable in cropping sequence are more beneficial than cereals after cereals baishya et al 2016 the rsb land configuration provides an opportunity for crop diversification and intensification and thus can be a potential option for development of socio economic status and livelihood of farmers in java and indonesia similar types of land management technique popularly called sorjan and tidal wetlands system respectively have been followed where high value crops are grown on raised beds and rice in sunken beds in meghalaya state of north east ne india temporary bun raised bed system of cultivation has been practised by the farmers keeping the sunken area area between the two raised beds unutilized singh et al 2011 depending upon the type of soil depth of standing water resources available with the farmers and crops to be grown various types of land configurations have been developed tomar et al 1996 which may be permanent or temporary although raised and sunken bed system was earlier tested and evaluated in some parts of india for better crop production mishra and saha 2007 saha and ghosh 2010 das et al 2014 research reports are not sufficient from the ner further very few available studies have either included water or crop productivity with crop diversification and intensification for assessing the efficiency of the rsb system the aims of this study is to crop diversification and intensification under raised and sunken bed rsb systems for year round income generation in the prevailing climatic condition of north east india our study focuses primarily on the relative equivalent yield water expenses efficiency land utilization efficiency and production efficiency of rsb technology in a low lying paddy land compared to the rice monocropping system mostly practised by the farmers of ner we also studied the economic return of the rsb technology over the farmers practice 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the

biological n fixation in soil saha and ghosh 2010 enhancement in rey due to inclusion of vegetables and pulse crops in the sequences has been widely reported kumar et al 2008 das et al 2013a increase in wee was due to enhancement in cropping intensity and higher yield of crops under rsb system as compared to fp sharma et al 2007 jat et al 2012 in our study water accumulated in the sunken beds was initially used manually for irrigating crops in the raised beds no irrigations were applied after establishment of the crops in the raised beds as there was sufficient moisture below the surface layer due to lateral and upward movement of water from the adjacent sunken beds research reports from orissa and meghalaya of india reported 400 600 enhancement in wue under rsb system singh et al 2005 das

9608,to further explore the performance of the newly proposed crop water stress indicator the mean value of gaussian distribution of excess green index mgdexg for maize canopy in rgb imagery studies were conducted in two maize fields with different irrigation levels during the 2015 and 2019 growing seasons specifically the effects of spatial resolution of rgb images collected by both ground and uav platforms and segmentation scale of uav rgb orthophoto on the performance of mgdexg were investigated and mgdexg maps were derived based on uav rgb orthophoto to monitor maize water status and its inter field variability the results show that when the spatial resolution of ground rgb images 2 4 mm was resized by bilinear interpolation algorithm to 4 8 9 6 19 2 38 4 and 76 8 mm similar water estimation performances of mgdexg were observed when compared to the crop water stress index cwsi with r2 values ranging 0 80 0 83 however the processing time per rgb image with 2 4 mm spatial resolution was greatly reduced from 232 26 s to 0 32 s when the resolution was reduced by 32 times providing a better opportunity to obtain mgdexg in real time when uav rgb images with two spatial resolutions of 2 7 mm and 14 7 mm were adopted a poor water stress estimation performance was observed for the lower resolution with r2 of 0 62 and rmse of 0 12 mol m 2 s 1 for the maize stomatal conductance the possible reason could be the errors introduced during the mosaicking process when segmentation scales of 2 m x 2 m 4 m x 4 m 6 m x 6 m 8 m x 8 m 10 m x 10 m and 12 m x 12 m were adopted to crop uav rgb orthophoto similar results were also observed finally mgdexg maps were derived from uav rgb orthophoto overall this study demonstrated that the water stress estimation performance of mgdexg index was not affected by image spatial resolution and statistical scale and mgdexg maps could be successfully acquired by a uav rgb remote sensing platform with the advantages of low cost and easy to be adopted by users keywords uav rgb images canopy temperature crop water stress index deficit irrigation inter field variability 1 introduction water availability is becoming the most limiting factor for crop production evans and lawson 2020 accurately estimating crop water status is one of the key steps to achieve the best balance between irrigation water use and crop yield geerts and raes 2009 although the traditional methods for crop water status detection based on soil water content and crop physiological characteristics e g stem leaf water potential and stomatal conductance could present accurate information of crop water status the disadvantages of time consuming destructive and labor intensive have restricted their application ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 virnodkar et al 2020 due to the close relationship to transpiration rate gautam and pagay 2020 crop canopy temperature tc has been acknowledged as a reliable and non destructive alternative to the above traditional methods for crop water status detection berni et al 2009 osroosh et al 2016 tanner 1963 the crop water stress index cwsi idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 has been the most widely used tc based method for crop water status detection and has been successfully used to estimate water status for multiple crops anda et al 2020 egea et al 2017 khorsand et al 2019 venturin et al 2020 however the additional parameters required by the calculation of cwsi and its difficulty in practical application e g the site and climate specific characteristic of the empirical cwsi method and the difficulty to estimate canopy resistance accurately for the theoretical cwsi method restrict the application by farmers testi et al 2008 in our recent study of zhang et al 2021 a new crop water stress indicator the mean value of gaussian distribution of excess green index for maize canopy mgdexg using rgb images was proposed the crop water status estimation performance of mgdexg has been confirmed by significant positive correlations with water stress related physiological parameters leaf water potential and sap flow and robust significant negative correlation with cwsi compared to cwsi the main advantages of the mgdexg index is that it is much cheaper to implement and easier to calculate which potentially will make it easier to be adopted and implemented by users e g farmers to further explore the crop water status estimation performance of the mgdexg index the effect of the rgb image spatial resolution should be taken into consideration because the method is a statistical description based on the gaussian distribution of excess green index of crop canopy within the rgb image to calculate the mgdexg index one should make sure the rgb image has fine spatial resolution so that the gaussian distribution of crop canopy could be accurately estimated by the expectation maximization algorithm in addition the emerging unmanned aerial vehicle uav remote sensing platform provides a low cost option to monitor crop water status and its inter field variability bian et al 2019 park et al 2017 poblete et al 2018 acquiring sufficient information for accurate irrigation management shi et al 2019 efforts should be made to derive mgdexg maps based on uav rgb images therefore it is necessary to verify the feasibility of calculating the mgdexg index based on uav rgb images and to investigate the effect of segmentation scales of uav rgb orthophoto on the crop water status estimation performance of the mgdexg index the main objective of this study was to further explore the performance of mgdexg in estimation of crop water status the specific objectives were 1 to explore the effect of rgb image spatial resolution on the performance of mgdexg 2 to investigate the effect of segmentation scales of uav rgb orthophoto on the performance of mgdexg and 3 to derive mgdexg maps based on uav rgb images 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sites

index crop water stress index cwsi is defined by the non water stressed baseline nwsb and non transpiration baseline ntb and calculated as 1 c w s i t c t a n w s b n t b n w s b where tc ta is the difference between canopy and air temperature nwsb and ntb are the lower and upper limits of tc ta when tc ta value is close to nwsb cwsi value is close to 0 indicating non water stress condition when tc ta value is close to ntb cwsi value is close to 1 indicating severe water stress condition occasionally due to tc ta value could be slightly lower than nwsb or greater than ntb the actual cwsi value could be slightly lower than 0 or greater than 1 gardner et al 1992 to establish the cwsi empirical model nwsb and ntb could be defined as 2 n w s b a b v p d 3 n t b a b v p g where vpd is the vapor pressure deficit of the atmosphere intercept a and slope b are the linear regression parameters of nwsb on vpd vpg is the difference between the saturation vapor pressure evaluated at air temperature and at a higher air temperature equal to air temperature plus intercept a in eq 2 to simplify the calculation of the cwsi empirical model in previous studies researchers started to establish nwsb and ntb by using wet and dry references garcia tejero et al 2018 jose blaya ros et al 2020 poirier pocovi et al 2020 at the same time there were also some researches try to simplify the calculation of the cwsi empirical model by taking 5 c as the constant ntb cohen et al 2015 dejonge et al 2015 taghvaeian et al 2014 the feasibility and reliability of above simplified methods have been demonstrated for various crops and in different sites therefore in this study to simplify the calculation of the cwsi empirical model a constant ntb value of 5 c was adopted in both sites in the previous studies within the same research field in site 1 nwsb has been established for 2015 han et al 2018 as shown in eq 4 as site 2 nwsb was established for 2019 in this study as shown in eq 5 4 n w s b 3 43 1 97 v p d 5 n w s b 0 73 3 64 v p d 2 4 resample method of ground rgb images to explore the effect of rgb image spatial resolution on the water stress estimation performance of the mgdexg index firstly bilinear interpolation algorithm was used to reduce the image spatial resolution from 2 4 to 4 8 9 6 19 2 38 4 and 76 8 mm respectively then mgdexg was extracted and compared with cwsi the bilinear interpolation algorithm was implemented using the resample function in r language 2 5 segmentation method of uav orthophoto to derive mgdexg map of the field firstly uav rgb orthophoto should be segmented to small regions then mgdexg is calculated for each small region according to the procedure proposed in zhang et al 2021 to explore the effect of segmentation scales on the water stress estimation performance of mgdexg six segmentation scales 2 m x 2 m 4 m x 4 m 6 m x 6 m 8 m x 8 m 10 m x 10 m and 12 m x 12 m were chosen as shown in fig 2 taking segmentation of 12 m x 12 m for example the research field in site 2 could be divided evenly into 100 small regions because the entire field is a square with the side length of about 120 m to achieve the segmentation the geographical coordinate information of each small field was calculated uav rgb orthophoto was segmented according the geographical coordinate information using crop function of raster package in r language to evaluate the water stress performance of the mgdexg index cwsi map derived from uav thermal images was also segmented by the corresponding scale and the average cwsi value was used as maize water status reference for each small region 2 6 statistical analysis all data analyses were performed in r language r core team 2020 the correlation analyses were conducted using the lm function the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean square error rmse were calculated for the evaluation 3 results and discussion 3 1 extraction accuracy of maize canopy temperature derived from uav thermal images fig 3a shows the relationship between temperatures derived from uav thermal images collected in site 2 and ground truth temperatures measured using the handheld infrared thermometer significant correlation was observed with r2 of 0 99 and rmse of 1 61 c compared to ground truth temperatures higher values were derived from uav thermal images to obtain accurate temperature observations it is necessary to calibrate uav thermal images as shown in fig 3b maize tc data were accurately derived from the calibrated uav thermal images with significant correlation with ground truth tc data measured by the handheld infrared thermometer the r2 and rmse values were 0 82 and 1 54 c respectively however a significant deviation from the 1 1 line were observed for the fitted line with slope and intercept of 0 63 and 10 76 c respectively similar result was found in our recent study of zhang et al 2019a which was conducted during the late vegetative stage in 2018 maize growing season the slope and intercept of the fitted line were 0 71 and 9 53 c respectively the significant deviation from the 1 1 line shows that underestimation of tc was firstly observed for none or slight water stress condition relatively lower ground truth tc observations then overestimation was started to be observed with the increase of water stress the change in the distribution of ground feature with water stress is the possible reason for the above phenomenon as shown in fig 4 when maize plants were not suffering from water stress more shaded soil pixels with lower temperature and less sunlit soil pixels with higher temperature will be found as the increase of water stress because of the leaf curling caused by water stress the proportion of pixels with lower temperature shaded soil will decrease and the proportion of pixels with higher temperature sunlit soil will increase in addition due to the relatively lower spatial resolution of uav thermal images 9 7 cm some soil pixels will inevitably be misclassified as maize pixels during the tc extraction process therefore when the misclassification is assumed to a certain percentage more pixels with higher temperatures and less pixels with lower temperatures will be misclassified as maize pixels as the increase of water stress resulting in underestimation of tc at first and then overestimation in the future studies are still needed to in depth investigate reasons accounted for the change of tc extraction error 3 2 maize crop water stress index in previous studies in site 1 the water stress estimation ability of cwsi had been confirmed by significant correlations with soil water deficit and sap flow han et al 2016 2018 in this study maize gs data were taken as water stress references to verify the water stress estimation performance of cwsi established in site 2 gs has long been taken as a direct crop water stress indicator griffiths and parry 2002 and successfully used as water status reference for many crops han et al 2016 zarco tejada et al 2013 as shown in fig 5 the significant correlation between cwsi and gs with r2 of 0 59 and rmse of 0 12 mol m 2 s 1 also indicated that the cwsi established in site 2 could be used successfully to estimate maize water status then cwsi maps with the ground sample distance of 9 7 cm were derived from uav thermal images in site 2 fig 6 clear spatial variations were observed within each irrigation treatment 3 3 effect of image spatial resolution on water stress estimation performance of mgdexg as shown in fig 7 the mean value and standard deviation of mgdexg derived from ground rgb images in 2015 in site 1 for the original spatial resolution 2 4 mm were 0 22 and 0 06 respectively when the resolution was reduced by bilinear interpolation algorithm there were not obvious changes with mean value and standard deviation of 0 22 and 0 06 for resolution of 4 8 mm with 0 22 and 0 06 for 9 6 mm with 0 22 and 0 06 for 19 2 mm with 0 22 and 0 06 for 38 4 mm and with 0 22 and 0 07 for 76 8 mm respectively in addition similar water stress estimation performances of mgdexg were observed under different resolutions with the biggest r2 difference of 0 03 the above results illustrated that the water stress estimation performance of mgdexg will not be affected when the resolution of rgb images is reduced by bilinear interpolation algorithm however the efficiency of mgdexg derived from rgb images was greatly enhanced under the original resolution the average time to process one rgb image was 232 26 s using computer with cpu of i5 8300 h graphics of nvidia gtx 1060 and memory size of 32 gb under the resolution of 76 8 mm this time was reduced to only 0 32 s the stable water stress estimation performance of mgdexg and the greatly enhanced processing efficiency provide an opportunity to obtain mgdexg in real time to further explore the effect of image spatial resolution on water stress estimation performance of mgdexg uav rgb images collected in site 2 with two resolutions of 2 7 mm and 14 7 mm were adopted to extract mgdexg the maize gs data were taken as water status references as shown in fig 8 significant correlations between mgdexg and gs were observed with r2 of 0 78 and rmse of 0 09 mol m 2 s 1 for resolution of 2 7 mm and with r2 of 0 62 and rmse of 0 12 mol m 2 s 1 for resolution of 14 7 mm a slightly poor performance of water stress estimation was observed for uav rgb orthophoto with a lower resolution of 14 7 mm than 2 7 mm the possible reason for the above phenomenon may be that errors were introduced during the mosaicking process in the future experiments including a larger number of image spatial resolution levels for authentic un modified spatial scales uav rgb images are needed to further investigate the effect of image spatial resolution on water stress estimation performance of mgdexg 3 4 effect of segmentation scale on water stress estimation performance of mgdexg as shown in fig 9 significant negative correlations were observed between mgdexg and cwsi for segmentation scales of 2 m x 2 m 4 m x 4 m 6 m x 6 m 8 m x 8 m 10 m x 10 m and 12 m x 12 m with the biggest r2 of 0 76 among the six segmentation scales the biggest r2 and rmse differences were 0 05 and 0 02 respectively what s more a very stable relationship expression between mgdexg and cwsi was found the biggest slope and intercept differences were 0 05 and 0 01 respectively the above results illustrated that the water stress estimation performance of mgdexg will not be affected by different segmentation scales 3 5 mgdexg maps derived from uav rgb orthophoto finally mgdexg maps were derived from uav rgb orthophoto in site 2 fig 10 taking the segmentation scale of 2 m x 2 m for example clear spatial variations were also observed within each irrigation treatment the final goal of estimating crop water status and its inter field variability is providing site specific irrigation prescription maps for variable rate irrigation systems in general there are two commonly used inexpensive ways to obtain crop water stress maps based on uav remote sensing technology one is to capture variations of crop canopy temperature by uav thermal imagery messina and modica 2020 and the other is capture spectral changes of crop canopy by uav multispectral images ballester et al 2018 in this study obtaining mgdexg maps based on uav rgb images has been demonstrated as another effective tool with the significant correlation between mgdexg and cwsi in addition compared to the higher price of uav thermal and multispectral platforms e g only one flir vue pro r camera costs 4849 and only one micasense rededge mx camera costs 4900 the price of the uav rgb platform e g phantom 4 pro v2 0 1599 is much cheaper the advantages of mgdexg of being much cheaper to implement and easier to calculate potentially will make it easier to be adopted and implemented by users e g farmers in the future field experiment is needed to explore actual water saving performance by scheduling irrigation management based on mgdexg 4 conclusions the results show that maize water status and its inter field variability could be monitored successfully by the combination of mgdexg and uav rgb remote sensing platform compared to the more commonly used uav thermal remote sensing platforms the above scheme is much cheaper and easier to be adopted and implemented by users e g farmers specifically when the resolution of rgb images was reduced by bilinear interpolation algorithm the water stress estimation performance of mgdexg will not be affected and the processing efficiency will be greatly enhanced providing the opportunity to obtain mgdexg in real time however when authentic uav rgb images with two resolutions of 2 7 mm and 14 7 mm were adopted a weaker water stress estimation performance was observed for the lower resolution with r2 of 0 62 and rmse of 0 12 mol m 2 s 1 with gs the possible reason for the above phenomenon could be the errors introduced during the mosaicking process in the future experiments including a larger number of image spatial resolution levels for authentic uav rgb images are needed to further explore the effect of image spatial resolution on water stress estimation performance of mgdexg in addition the water stress estimation performance of mgdexg will not be affected by different segmentation scales of uav rgb orthophoto and mgdexg maps could be derived successfully by the corresponding segmentation scale further field experiment is needed to explore

the most limiting factor for crop production evans and lawson 2020 accurately estimating crop water status is one of the key steps to achieve the best balance between irrigation water use and crop yield geerts and raes 2009 although the traditional methods for crop water status detection based on soil water content and crop physiological characteristics e g stem leaf water potential and stomatal conductance could present accurate information of crop water status the disadvantages of time consuming destructive and labor intensive have restricted their application ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 virnodkar et al 2020 due to the close relationship to transpiration rate gautam and pagay 2020 crop canopy temperature tc has been acknowledged as a reliable and non destructive alternative to the above traditional methods for crop water status detection berni et al 2009 osroosh et al 2016 tanner 1963 the crop water stress index cwsi idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 has been the most widely used tc based method for crop water status detection and has been successfully used to estimate water status for multiple crops anda et al 2020 egea et al 2017 khorsand et al 2019 venturin et al 2020 however the additional parameters required by the calculation of cwsi and its difficulty in practical application e g the site and climate specific characteristic of the empirical cwsi method and the difficulty to estimate canopy resistance accurately for the theoretical cwsi method restrict the application by farmers testi et al 2008 in our recent study of zhang et al 2021 a new crop water stress indicator the mean value of gaussian distribution of excess green index for maize canopy mgdexg using rgb images was proposed the crop water status estimation performance of mgdexg has been confirmed by significant positive correlations with water stress related physiological parameters leaf water potential and sap flow and robust significant negative correlation with cwsi compared to cwsi the main advantages of the mgdexg index is that it is much cheaper to implement and easier to calculate which potentially will make it easier to be adopted and implemented by users e g farmers to further explore the crop water status estimation performance of the mgdexg index the effect of the rgb image spatial resolution should be taken into consideration because the method is a statistical description based on the gaussian distribution of excess green index of crop canopy within the rgb image to calculate the mgdexg index one should make sure the rgb image has fine spatial resolution so that the gaussian distribution of crop canopy could be accurately estimated by the expectation maximization algorithm in addition the emerging unmanned aerial vehicle uav remote sensing platform provides a low cost option to monitor crop water status and its inter field variability bian et al 2019 park et al 2017 poblete et al 2018 acquiring sufficient information for accurate irrigation management shi et al 2019 efforts should be made to derive mgdexg maps based on uav rgb images therefore it is necessary to verify the feasibility of calculating the mgdexg index based on uav rgb images and to investigate the effect of segmentation scales of uav rgb orthophoto on the crop water status estimation performance of the mgdexg index the main objective of this study was to further explore the performance of mgdexg in estimation of crop water status the specific objectives were 1 to explore the effect of rgb image spatial resolution on the performance of mgdexg 2 to investigate the effect of segmentation scales of uav rgb orthophoto on the performance of mgdexg and 3 to derive mgdexg maps based on uav rgb images 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sites

index crop water stress index cwsi is defined by the non water stressed baseline nwsb and non transpiration baseline ntb and calculated as 1 c w s i t c t a n w s b n t b n w s b where tc ta is the difference between canopy and air temperature nwsb and ntb are the lower and upper limits of tc ta when tc ta value is close to nwsb cwsi value is close to 0 indicating non water stress condition when tc ta value is close to ntb cwsi value is close to 1 indicating severe water stress condition occasionally due to tc ta value could be slightly lower than nwsb or greater than ntb the actual cwsi value could be slightly lower than 0 or greater than 1 gardner et al 1992 to establish the cwsi empirical model nwsb and ntb could be defined as 2 n w s b a b v p d 3 n t b a b v p g where vpd is the vapor pressure deficit of the atmosphere intercept a and slope b are the linear regression parameters of nwsb on vpd vpg is the difference between the saturation vapor pressure evaluated at air temperature and at a higher air temperature equal to air temperature plus intercept a in eq 2 to simplify the calculation of the cwsi empirical model in previous studies researchers started to establish nwsb and ntb by using wet and dry references garcia tejero et al 2018 jose blaya ros et al 2020 poirier pocovi et al 2020 at the same time there were also some researches try to simplify the calculation of the cwsi empirical model by taking 5 c as the constant ntb cohen et al 2015 dejonge et al 2015 taghvaeian et al 2014 the feasibility and reliability of above simplified methods have been demonstrated for various crops and in different sites therefore in this study to simplify the calculation of the cwsi empirical model a constant ntb value of 5 c was adopted in both sites in the previous studies within the same research field in site 1 nwsb has been established for 2015 han et al 2018 as shown in eq 4 as site 2 nwsb was established for 2019 in this study as shown in eq 5 4 n w s b 3 43 1 97 v p d 5 n w s b 0 73 3 64 v p d 2 4 resample method of ground rgb images to explore the effect of rgb image spatial resolution on the water stress estimation performance of the mgdexg index firstly bilinear interpolation algorithm was used to reduce the image spatial resolution from 2 4 to 4 8 9 6 19 2 38 4 and 76 8 mm respectively then mgdexg was extracted and compared with cwsi the bilinear interpolation algorithm was implemented using the resample function in r language 2 5 segmentation method of uav orthophoto to derive mgdexg map of the field firstly uav rgb orthophoto should be segmented to small regions then mgdexg is calculated for each small region according to the procedure proposed in zhang et al 2021 to explore the effect of segmentation scales on the water stress estimation performance of mgdexg six segmentation scales 2 m x 2 m 4 m x 4 m 6 m x 6 m 8 m x 8 m 10 m x 10 m and 12 m x 12 m were chosen as shown in fig 2 taking segmentation of 12 m x 12 m for example the research field in site 2 could be divided evenly into 100 small regions because the entire field is a square with the side length of about 120 m to achieve the segmentation the geographical coordinate information of each small field was calculated uav rgb orthophoto was segmented according the geographical coordinate information using crop function of raster package in r language to evaluate the water stress performance of the mgdexg index cwsi map derived from uav thermal images was also segmented by the corresponding scale and the average cwsi value was used as maize water status reference for each small region 2 6 statistical analysis all data analyses were performed in r language r core team 2020 the correlation analyses were conducted using the lm function the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean square error rmse were calculated for the evaluation 3 results and discussion 3 1 extraction accuracy of maize canopy temperature derived from uav thermal images fig 3a shows the relationship between temperatures derived from uav thermal images collected in site 2 and ground truth temperatures measured using the handheld infrared thermometer significant correlation was observed with r2 of 0 99 and rmse of 1 61 c compared to ground truth temperatures higher values were derived from uav thermal images to obtain accurate temperature observations it is necessary to calibrate uav thermal images as shown in fig 3b maize tc data were accurately derived from the calibrated uav thermal images with significant correlation with ground truth tc data measured by the handheld infrared thermometer the r2 and rmse values were 0 82 and 1 54 c respectively however a significant deviation from the 1 1 line were observed for the fitted line with slope and intercept of 0 63 and 10 76 c respectively similar result was found in our recent study of zhang et al 2019a which was conducted during the late vegetative stage in 2018 maize growing season the slope and intercept of the fitted line were 0 71 and 9 53 c respectively the significant deviation from the 1 1 line shows that underestimation of tc was firstly observed for none or slight water stress condition relatively lower ground truth tc observations then overestimation was started to be observed with the increase of water stress the change in the distribution of ground feature with water stress is the possible reason for the above phenomenon as shown in fig 4 when maize plants were not suffering from water stress more shaded soil pixels with lower temperature and less sunlit soil pixels with higher temperature will be found as the increase of water stress because of the leaf curling caused by water stress the proportion of pixels with lower temperature shaded soil will decrease and the proportion of pixels with higher temperature sunlit soil will increase in addition due to the relatively lower spatial resolution of uav thermal images 9 7 cm some soil pixels will inevitably be misclassified as maize pixels during the tc extraction process therefore when the misclassification is assumed to a certain percentage more pixels with higher temperatures and less pixels with lower temperatures will be misclassified as maize pixels as the increase of water stress resulting in underestimation of tc at first and then overestimation in the future studies are still needed to in depth investigate reasons accounted for the change of tc extraction error 3 2 maize crop water stress index in previous studies in site 1 the water stress estimation ability of cwsi had been confirmed by significant correlations with soil water deficit and sap flow han et al 2016 2018 in this study maize gs data were taken as water stress references to verify the water stress estimation performance of cwsi established in site 2 gs has long been taken as a direct crop water stress indicator griffiths and parry 2002 and successfully used as water status reference for many crops han et al 2016 zarco tejada et al 2013 as shown in fig 5 the significant correlation between cwsi and gs with r2 of 0 59 and rmse of 0 12 mol m 2 s 1 also indicated that the cwsi established in site 2 could be used successfully to estimate maize water status then cwsi maps with the ground sample distance of 9 7 cm were derived from uav thermal images in site 2 fig 6 clear spatial variations were observed within each irrigation treatment 3 3 effect of image spatial resolution on water stress estimation performance of mgdexg as shown in fig 7 the mean value and standard deviation of mgdexg derived from ground rgb images in 2015 in site 1 for the original spatial resolution 2 4 mm were 0 22 and 0 06 respectively when the resolution was reduced by bilinear interpolation algorithm there were not obvious changes with mean value and standard deviation of 0 22 and 0 06 for resolution of 4 8 mm with 0 22 and 0 06 for 9 6 mm with 0 22 and 0 06 for 19 2 mm with 0 22 and 0 06 for 38 4 mm and with 0 22 and 0 07 for 76 8 mm respectively in addition similar water stress estimation performances of mgdexg were observed under different resolutions with the biggest r2 difference of 0 03 the above results illustrated that the water stress estimation performance of mgdexg will not be affected when the resolution of rgb images is reduced by bilinear interpolation algorithm however the efficiency of mgdexg derived from rgb images was greatly enhanced under the original resolution the average time to process one rgb image was 232 26 s using computer with cpu of i5 8300 h graphics of nvidia gtx 1060 and memory size of 32 gb under the resolution of 76 8 mm this time was reduced to only 0 32 s the stable water stress estimation performance of mgdexg and the greatly enhanced processing efficiency provide an opportunity to obtain mgdexg in real time to further explore the effect of image spatial resolution on water stress estimation performance of mgdexg uav rgb images collected in site 2 with two resolutions of 2 7 mm and 14 7 mm were adopted to extract mgdexg the maize gs data were taken as water status references as shown in fig 8 significant correlations between mgdexg and gs were observed with r2 of 0 78 and rmse of 0 09 mol m 2 s 1 for resolution of 2 7 mm and with r2 of 0 62 and rmse of 0 12 mol m 2 s 1 for resolution of 14 7 mm a slightly poor performance of water stress estimation was observed for uav rgb orthophoto with a lower resolution of 14 7 mm than 2 7 mm the possible reason for the above phenomenon may be that errors were introduced during the mosaicking process in the future experiments including a larger number of image spatial resolution levels for authentic un modified spatial scales uav rgb images are needed to further investigate the effect of image spatial resolution on water stress estimation performance of mgdexg 3 4 effect of segmentation scale on water stress estimation performance of mgdexg as shown in fig 9 significant negative correlations were observed between mgdexg and cwsi for segmentation scales of 2 m x 2 m 4 m x 4 m 6 m x 6 m 8 m x 8 m 10 m x 10 m and 12 m x 12 m with the biggest r2 of 0 76 among the six segmentation scales the biggest r2 and rmse differences were 0 05 and 0 02 respectively what s more a very stable relationship expression between mgdexg and cwsi was found the biggest slope and intercept differences were 0 05 and 0 01 respectively the above results illustrated that the water stress estimation performance of mgdexg will not be affected by different segmentation scales 3 5 mgdexg maps derived from uav rgb orthophoto finally mgdexg maps were derived from uav rgb orthophoto in site 2 fig 10 taking the segmentation scale of 2 m x 2 m for example clear spatial variations were also observed within each irrigation treatment the final goal of estimating crop water status and its inter field variability is providing site specific irrigation prescription maps for variable rate irrigation systems in general there are two commonly used inexpensive ways to obtain crop water stress maps based on uav remote sensing technology one is to capture variations of crop canopy temperature by uav thermal imagery messina and modica 2020 and the other is capture spectral changes of crop canopy by uav multispectral images ballester et al 2018 in this study obtaining mgdexg maps based on uav rgb images has been demonstrated as another effective tool with the significant correlation between mgdexg and cwsi in addition compared to the higher price of uav thermal and multispectral platforms e g only one flir vue pro r camera costs 4849 and only one micasense rededge mx camera costs 4900 the price of the uav rgb platform e g phantom 4 pro v2 0 1599 is much cheaper the advantages of mgdexg of being much cheaper to implement and easier to calculate potentially will make it easier to be adopted and implemented by users e g farmers in the future field experiment is needed to explore actual water saving performance by scheduling irrigation management based on mgdexg 4 conclusions the results show that maize water status and its inter field variability could be monitored successfully by the combination of mgdexg and uav rgb remote sensing platform compared to the more commonly used uav thermal remote sensing platforms the above scheme is much cheaper and easier to be adopted and implemented by users e g farmers specifically when the resolution of rgb images was reduced by bilinear interpolation algorithm the water stress estimation performance of mgdexg will not be affected and the processing efficiency will be greatly enhanced providing the opportunity to obtain mgdexg in real time however when authentic uav rgb images with two resolutions of 2 7 mm and 14 7 mm were adopted a weaker water stress estimation performance was observed for the lower resolution with r2 of 0 62 and rmse of 0 12 mol m 2 s 1 with gs the possible reason for the above phenomenon could be the errors introduced during the mosaicking process in the future experiments including a larger number of image spatial resolution levels for authentic uav rgb images are needed to further explore the effect of image spatial resolution on water stress estimation performance of mgdexg in addition the water stress estimation performance of mgdexg will not be affected by different segmentation scales of uav rgb orthophoto and mgdexg maps could be derived successfully by the corresponding segmentation scale further field experiment is needed to explore actual water saving performance by scheduling irrigation management based on mgdexg funding this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51979233 the 111 project no

9609,the urmia lake basin ulb is a critical region in terms of water and environment in iran the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between agricultural land use changes and the decrease of the lake urmia water level calculating the actual evapotranspiration and interception etia in agricultural and non agricultural lands investigating the trend of temperature changes and its relationship with etia determining the water balance and estimating net and gross biomass water productivity in the ulb so land cover classification lcc maps etia and water productivity were prepared from fao s wapor product fwp from 2009 to 2020 daily precipitation and temperature were collected from 24 meteorological stations in the ulb to validate fwp land cover classification 354 control points were collected and the error matrix and kappa coefficient were used then based on the etia and lcc estimated by fwp the volume of water consumed in irrigated rainfed fallow and non agricultural lands as well as the water balance of the basin was calculated the overall accuracy oa and kappa coefficient for lcc were 86 and 0 81 respectively the results showed that until 2013 the area of irrigated and rainfed agricultural lands had been increased by 48 which could be regarded as an influential factor in reducing the water level of lake urmia the average annual precipitation and etia of the basin were 15 24 109 and 15 91 109 m3 respectively also the average annual etia of agricultural lands grasslands and evaporation from the surface of lake urmia were 4 88 109 8 18 109 and 2 85 109 m3 respectively therefore a negative balance of 0 67 109 m3 was observed the results also showed that the average annual temperature had been increased by 1 1 c from 2009 to 2020 finally the rise of the temperature and area of irrigated croplands the decrease of precipitation and the negative water balance should be considered as warning signals calling for the proper management of water resources graphical abstract ga1 keywords land cover classification precipitation remote sensing wapor database water balance 1 introduction lake urmia the largest inland lake in iran and the second largest hypersaline lake in the world with a volume of 32 109 m3 is located in one of the potential agricultural areas davarpanah et al 2021 its water level had been decreased by more than 7 m from 1995 to 2014 and 88 of its area had been dried nikraftar et al 2021 for various reasons such as climate changes human activities and mismanagement aghakouchak et al 2015 eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 golabian 2010 hassanzadeh et al 2012 tourian et al 2015 in the recent years land use changes from rainfed and grassland to irrigated croplands and around cities from agriculture to urban use are evident also most water resources used in agriculture have low water efficiency davarpanah et al 2021 recent droughts have weakened agriculture so many rural inhabitants have migrated to cities ulrp 2020 in addition precipitation deficits climate changes delju 2012 azizzadeh and javan 2018 and extensive construction of dams rahimi and breuste 2021 alborzi et al 2018 have all decreased the water level of lake urmia nazeri tahroudi et al 2018 the ecological water level of lake urmia is 1274 1 m which has been determined as the optimal level for the stability of the region ecosystem yang et al 2020 while its current level is at 1271 3 m davarpanah et al 2021 continuation of this situation not only wastes water resources but also causes further drying of the lake bed davarpanah et al 2021 as a result the diffusion of salt by the wind poses a serious threat to the health of the local inhabitants fathian et al 2015 understanding climate changes at different scales and over long periods is essential for sustainable water resources management velasco et al 2018 therefore numerous studies have been conducted on lake urmia davarpanah et al 2021 for instance evaluated the dry and wet periods of the ulb this was done using the second generation canadian land system canesm2 model and rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios their results showed that the possibility of drought in the urmia lake basin would increase in the future nikraftar et al 2021 also examined the factors influential on improving the condition of lake urmia stating that the amount of precipitation had a significant impact further fathian et al 2015 stated that the flow of rivers in the urmia lake basin was more sensitive to temperature changes dehghanipour et al 2020 also quantified the lake s impact on the local climate according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao about 70 of the world s water consumption is used in agriculture 19 in industry and 11 in cities most of the water consumption in agriculture occurs through evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration is an important variable in irrigation management allen et al 2007 drought monitoring calcagno et al 2007 golian et al 2019 estimation of the amount of water storage in a region zhang et al 2018 water efficiency zwart et al 2010 and groundwater management wilcox 2019 so it is one of the influential factors on the condition of lake urmia also with the temperature rise around the world throughout the twentieth century temperature related climatic variables such as evapotranspiration are affected significantly allan et al 2013 li et al 2012 equations based on meteorological data and lysimetric measurements are commonly used to calculate evapotranspiration however it is costly and impossible to construct lysimeters and meteorological stations everywhere geshnigani et al 2021 okechukwu 2020 therefore evapotranspiration is measured or calculated on a point basis and in specific regions in the recent decades with the development of some hardware and software for satellite image processing the use of remote sensing methods to estimate actual evapotranspiration has been increased allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 2012 the most important methods for estimating evapotranspiration are sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 sebs su 2002 and metric allen et al 2007 algorithms however using these algorithms requires multiple satellite imagery expertize and software skills therefore they are not easy to use recently fao has developed a portal to monitor water productivity through the open access of the remotely sensed derived data wapor across africa and the middle east one of the data provided in this portal is actual evapotranspiration and interception etia in wapor etia is calculated based on the etlook algorithm bastiaanssen et al 2012 etia has been available in 10 day monthly and annual periods at three levels since 2009 the continental level 250 m covers africa and the middle east level 1 the national level 100 m covers 21 countries and 4 river basins level 2 the third level 30 m includes eight irrigation areas level 3 fao 2020 blatchford et al 2020 despite many studies that have been done in the field of evapotranspiration water balance and land use change in lake urmia basin but these studies have included only a part of this basin or have investigated only one issue and in a short time for example tasumi 2019 investigated the actual evapotranspiration using the metric algorithm in the west of urmia lake javadian et al 2019 compared the actual evapotranspiration accuracy obtained from the wapor portal and metric algorithm mohammadzadeh et al 2021 studied land use in the southern of lake urmia basin taheri et al 2019 investigated the amount of water consumption in a number of sub basins of lake urmia basin therefore the purpose of this study was to specify the area of irrigated and rainfed croplands and their temporal changes using remote sensing in response to the question of whether the growth of irrigated croplands has affected the reduction of the lake urmia water level or not the other goal of the study was to investigate the temporal trend of the annual temperature and the spatial temporal distribution of annual precipitation and to determine etia in agricultural and non agricultural lands to study the water balance of the urmia lake basin finally this study attempted to determine net and gross biomass water productivity in irrigated and rainfed croplands 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the urmia lake

at levels 1 and 2 the global cgls 100 m land cover map for 2015 was used whereas the cropland class was further divided into irrigated rainfed and fallow on an annual basis also identification of irrigated areas in this portal was done by applying a water deficit index wdi by taking into account the seasonal cumulative values of precipitation p s and actual evapotranspiration etias eq 1 fao 2020 1 wdi ps etias when wdi is 1 or larger it shows that the crop water demand is supplied by precipitation wdi less than 1 indicates that the crop water demand during the growing season is more than

precipitation with station daily precipitation data is used http chg geog ucsb edu data chirps it is an existing external data source that combines satellite observations with global models and measurements at local stations the daily precipitation pixel size is approximately 5 km prakash 2019 and nikraftar et al 2021 stated that this dataset could be reliable for long term analysis also blatchford et al 2020 concluded that the fwp actual evapotranspiration and interception dataset had enough quality to understand and monitor the regional and continental water management and water processes rahimpour et al 2018 evaluated fwp evapotranspiration obtaining the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and correlation r to be equal to 2 14 mm 10 d 1 2 55 mm 10 d 1 and 0

fallow croplands was separated from each other for each year using arcmap software v 10 3 then etia in these zones was extracted at 10 day intervals from 2009 to the end of 2020 table 1 summarizes the

water balance we used the precipitation data collected from 24 meteorological stations within the basin instead of using the chirps data in order to increase the accuracy also to investigate the temporal trend of temperature changes and its relationship with etia the average daily temperature of synoptic stations in the lake urmia basin was collected from 2009 to 2020 to investigate the spatial distribution of precipitation cokriging geostatistical method was used also digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 30 30 m was used as an auxiliary variable taheri et al 2019 rata et al 2020 temporal trend of precipitation and temperature data were analyzed using trendline option in excel software mohammadzadeh et al 2021 2 5 water productivity to investigate water productivity in the ulb the annual gross and net biomass water productivity from 2009 to 2020 was obtained from the fao s wapor product the mean of gross biomass water productivity gbwp eq 11 is the quantity of biomass production per total volume of the water consumed sum of canopy transpiration soil evaporation and interception in a specific period the mean of net biomass water productivity nbwp eq 12 is

total biomass production in kg dry matter ha 1 e t and i are evaporation transpiration and interception respectively all in mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of fwp land cover classification table 2 shows the error matrix for fwp land cover classification the lowest ua and pa were observed in rainfed and grassland classes which was equal to 79 01 and 72 47 respectively in the study area the rainfed croplands were scattered on the domains and moderately steep areas of the mountains leading to the creation of croplands with small areas considering that fwp land cover classification pixel size is 250 m 6 25 ha this could be regarded as the main source of error and inseparability of rainfed and grassland from each other also becker et al 2021 stated that this could be due to the similarity between the spectral profiles of both classes the highest pa was observed in the water classification zones with 100 oa showed that the mapping was successful up to 86 in all classes kappa for the error matrix was 0 81 finally it could be concluded that the accuracy of fwp land cover classification was reliable 3 2 land use changes according to fig 2a which shows the trend of changes in the agricultural lands in relation to the reduction of water level of lake urmia from 1987 to 2013 the area of agricultural lands has increased by 48 from 864 103 to 1282 103 ha and the water level of lake urmia has decreased by 7 4 m from 1278 2 to 1270 8 m therefore it is clear that increasing the area of agricultural lands increases the demand for water consumption and puts much pressure on the water resources of the basin so it could be considered as one of the important factors in reducing the water level of lake urmia mahmoudi and rezaei 2013 also stated that 22 109 m3 water was extracted from groundwater sources from 1996 to 2010 which caused a decrease in the water level of lake urmia but with the start of the urmia lake restoration committee 10 year plan in 2013 to prevent the drying process of the lake some measures including closing illegal wells reducing irrigation water allocation and cultivation areas and limiting additional groundwater and surface water withdrawal have been adopted aghakouchak et al 2015 taheri et al 2019 it was observed that the process of the increase in irrigated croplands has been stopped beginning to decline this decrease had been continued until 2020 fig 2b according to fig 2b from 2013 to 2020 81 103 ha of the irrigated croplands 14 had been converted to rainfed which could be attributed to the reduction of water resources groundwater depletion and programs of the lake urmia restoration committee also since the only water source for the rainfed croplands in the ulb was precipitation it was observed that with the decrease in the precipitation the area under cultivation of these croplands had been decreased sharply they have remained as fallow from 2013 to 2017 the area of irrigated rainfed and fallow croplands was equal to 585 103 377 103 and 320 103 ha in 2013 and it was equal to 504 103 565 103 and 213 103 in 2020 fig 3 shows the land use maps in the urmia lake basin in 2013 and 2020 according to this figure most changes are observed in the south and east of lake urmia 3 3 actual evapotranspiration and interception etia precipitation is one of the supplier sources for evapotranspiration in agriculture however the inappropriate spatial temporal distribution of precipitation in the urmia lake basin does not supply the plant s water requirement in the growing season most of the precipitation occurs in the non agricultural season and only 30 of it is in the agricultural season fig 4 also only 22 of precipitation occurs in agricultural lands and 78 is in the highlands the inappropriate spatial distribution of precipitation is a limiting factor for actual evapotranspiration especially in rainfed croplands also according to fig 4 it can be observed that the peak of actual evapotranspiration in these lands has occurred a few days after the precipitation while in irrigated croplands the actual evapotranspiration has reached its highest level in the driest months of the year so it has caused dams and groundwater sources to supply the plant s water requirement in irrigated croplands the highest amount of precipitation has occurred in the southern and eastern highlands of the lake urmia basin with an average of 2 9 mm d 1 and the lowest amount of precipitation has occurred on the lake surface with an average of 0 68 mm d 1 fig 5 therefore evaporated water from the lake surface is not supplied directly through precipitation to supply the lake s water evaporate demand the precipitation that has occurred in the highlands must pour into the lake through the rivers but due to the existence of several dams on the rivers this does not happen and the water gathered behind these dams has increased the water demand in the agricultural sector and has increased agricultural lands 3 4 water consumption fig 6 shows the volume of inlet precipitation in the basin and the average water consumption in different sectors through etia regardless of the groundwater exchange the only incoming water source to the basin was precipitation with an average of 15 24 109 m3 from 2009 to 2020 and the volume of the average annual etia from agricultural lands grasslands and evaporation from the surface of lake urmia was 4 88 109 8 18 109 and 2 85 109 m3 respectively which was in total 15 91 109 m3 therefore a negative balance of 0 67 109 m3 was observed table 3 the lowest precipitation has occurred in 2017 which was 10 43 109 m3 67 of this precipitation has been exited from the basin through etia in grasslands or altitudes thus showing that most of the precipitation has occurred in grasslands also considering that the etia of irrigated croplands has not been decreased it can be concluded that the water required for agriculture was supplied from groundwater sources and dams this issue can also be observed in 2018 2019 and 2020 the average annual evapotranspiration in fallow croplands was 0 36 109 m3 equal to 30 of rainfed croplands etia etia in irrigated croplands and evaporation from the surface of lake urmia was 23 and 20 of the total precipitation respectively table 3 most of the exited water from the basin equal to 54 of the precipitation has occurred through evapotranspiration in grasslands which has covered a large area this water has supplied entirely through precipitation therefore this exiting volume of water in grasslands is uncontrollable also the area of irrigated croplands has been decreased by 14 from 2013 to 2020 but the volume of evapotranspiration of these lands shows an increasing trend this can be due to the increase in the average annual temperature and the cultivation of high consumption crops according to the fifth report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc which forecasts the climate extremes based on temperature and precipitation indices an increase in the intensity and number of hot and dry periods is visible hao et al 2013 this is also true about the ulb fig 7 shows the increasing trend of the average annual temperature by 1 1 c from 2009 to 2020 further davarpanah et al 2021 showed that the possibility of drought in the ulb would increase in the future mohammadzadeh et al 2021 also stated that the average temperature had been increased by 3 5 c in the last 30 years etia showed a positive correlation of 0 78 with increasing the temperature fig 7 therefore despite the decrease in irrigated croplands the increase of etia table 3 in the ulb was due to the rise of the annual temperature so it can be concluded that the only solution for compensating the negative water balance in this basin is further reducing the area under irrigated cultivation and evaporation from the surface of urmia lake numerous studies have been carried out on the evaporation from the surface of lake urmia including biazar et al 2020 siadatmousavi and seyedalipour 2019 and hasany and yaghmaei 2015 also considering that agriculture is the main source of income for the inhabitants of this basin it is important to focus on cultivating high yield crops beside reducing the area under irrigated cultivation 3 5 water productivity the average annual gbwp in irrigated and rainfed croplands was 1 79 and 1 78 kg m 3 respectively the average annual nbwp was estimated to be equal to 2 16 kg m 3 and 2 61 kg m 3 for irrigated and rainfed croplands respectively fig 8 also table 4 shows that the average annual evaporation transpiration and interception in the irrigated croplands were 1 3 3 and 2 times more than those of rainfed croplands respectively so by using eqs 9 and 10 the total biomass production tbp in irrigated croplands was obtained 2 47 times more than that of the rainfed croplands considering that the transpiration and tbp of the irrigated croplands were 3 and 2 47 times more than those of the rainfed croplands it can be concluded that water productivity in irrigated croplands was low so to decrease water consumption in the irrigated croplands transpiration should be reduced by using methods such as deficit irrigation and partial root irrigation beside the cultivation of high yield crops also evaporation and interception in these lands could be reduced by using methods such as soil surface mulching drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation instead of sprinkler irrigation 4 conclusion the results showed that the area of agricultural lands had been increased by 48 from 1987 to 2013 from 864 103 to 1282 103 ha during the same period the water level of lake urmia had been decreased by 7 4 m from 1278 2 to 1270 8 m and more than 80 of its area had been dried the results also showed that in the urmia lake basin precipitation had been decreased while the average annual temperature had been increased by 1 1 c from 2009 to 2020 in addition 14 of the irrigated croplands area had been reduced and the net and gross biomass water productivity had not been increased also the water balance in this basin was negative 0 67 109 m3 and the transpiration and tbp of the irrigated cropland were 3 and 2 47 times more than those of the rainfed cropland respectively finally the increase in agricultural lands the rise of temperature consequently increasing etia the decreasing trend and the inappropriate spatial temporal distribution of precipitation all emphasize the importance of reducing evapotranspiration through methods such as subsurface irrigation deficit irrigation and reduction of irrigated croplands by cultivating high yield crops declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9609,the urmia lake basin ulb is a critical region in terms of water and environment in iran the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between agricultural land use changes and the decrease of the lake urmia water level calculating the actual evapotranspiration and interception etia in agricultural and non agricultural lands investigating the trend of temperature changes and its relationship with etia determining the water balance and estimating net and gross biomass water productivity in the ulb so land cover classification lcc maps etia and water productivity were prepared from fao s wapor product fwp from 2009 to 2020 daily precipitation and temperature were collected from 24 meteorological stations in the ulb to validate fwp land cover classification 354 control points were collected and the error matrix and kappa coefficient were used then based on the etia and lcc estimated by fwp the volume of water consumed in irrigated rainfed fallow and non agricultural lands as well as the water balance of the basin was calculated the overall accuracy oa and kappa coefficient for lcc were 86 and 0 81 respectively the results showed that until 2013 the area of irrigated and rainfed agricultural lands had been increased by 48 which could be regarded as an influential factor in reducing the water level of lake urmia the average annual precipitation and etia of the basin were 15 24 109 and 15 91 109 m3 respectively also the average annual etia of agricultural lands grasslands and evaporation from the surface of lake urmia were 4 88 109 8 18 109 and 2 85 109 m3 respectively therefore a negative balance of 0 67 109 m3 was observed the results also showed that the average annual temperature had been increased by 1 1 c from 2009 to 2020 finally the rise of the temperature and area of irrigated croplands the decrease of precipitation and the negative water balance should be considered as warning signals calling for the proper management of water resources graphical abstract ga1 keywords land cover classification precipitation remote sensing wapor database water balance 1 introduction lake urmia the largest inland lake in iran and the second largest hypersaline lake in the world with a volume of 32 109 m3 is located in one of the potential agricultural areas davarpanah et al 2021 its water level had been decreased by more than 7 m from 1995 to 2014 and 88 of its area had been dried nikraftar et al 2021 for various reasons such as climate changes human activities and mismanagement aghakouchak et al 2015 eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 golabian 2010 hassanzadeh et al 2012 tourian et al 2015 in the recent years land use changes from rainfed and grassland to irrigated croplands and around cities from agriculture to urban use are evident also most water resources used in agriculture have low water efficiency davarpanah et al 2021 recent droughts have weakened agriculture so many rural inhabitants have migrated to cities ulrp 2020 in addition precipitation deficits climate changes delju 2012 azizzadeh and javan 2018 and extensive construction of dams rahimi and breuste 2021 alborzi et al 2018 have all decreased the water level of lake urmia nazeri tahroudi et al 2018 the ecological water level of lake urmia is 1274 1 m which has been determined as the optimal level for the stability of the region ecosystem yang et al 2020 while its current level is at 1271 3 m davarpanah et al 2021 continuation of this situation not only wastes water resources but also causes further drying of the lake bed davarpanah et al 2021 as a result the diffusion of salt by the wind poses a serious threat to the health of the local inhabitants fathian et al 2015 understanding climate changes at different scales and over long periods is essential for sustainable water resources management velasco et al 2018 therefore numerous studies have been conducted on lake urmia davarpanah et al 2021 for instance evaluated the dry and wet periods of the ulb this was done using the second generation canadian land system canesm2 model and rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios their results showed that the possibility of drought in the urmia lake basin would increase in the future nikraftar et al 2021 also examined the factors influential on improving the condition of lake urmia stating that the amount of precipitation had a significant impact further fathian et al 2015 stated that the flow of rivers in the urmia lake basin was more sensitive to temperature changes dehghanipour et al 2020 also quantified the lake s impact on the local climate according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao about 70 of the world s water consumption is used in agriculture 19 in industry and 11 in cities most of the water consumption in agriculture occurs through evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration is an important variable in irrigation management allen et al 2007 drought monitoring calcagno et al 2007 golian et al 2019 estimation of the amount of water storage in a region zhang et al 2018 water efficiency zwart et al 2010 and groundwater management wilcox 2019 so it is one of the influential factors on the condition of lake urmia also with the temperature rise around the world throughout the twentieth century temperature related climatic variables such as evapotranspiration are affected significantly allan et al 2013 li et al 2012 equations based on meteorological data and lysimetric measurements are commonly used to calculate evapotranspiration however it is costly and impossible to construct lysimeters and meteorological stations everywhere geshnigani et al 2021 okechukwu 2020 therefore evapotranspiration is measured or calculated on a point basis and in specific regions in the recent decades with the development of some hardware and software for satellite image processing the use of remote sensing methods to estimate actual evapotranspiration has been increased allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 2012 the most important methods for estimating evapotranspiration are sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 sebs su 2002 and metric allen et al 2007 algorithms however using these algorithms requires multiple satellite imagery expertize and software skills therefore they are not easy to use recently fao has developed a portal to monitor water productivity through the open access of the remotely sensed derived data wapor across africa and the middle east one of the data provided in this portal is actual evapotranspiration and interception etia in wapor etia is calculated based on the etlook algorithm bastiaanssen et al 2012 etia has been available in 10 day monthly and annual periods at three levels since 2009 the continental level 250 m covers africa and the middle east level 1 the national level 100 m covers 21 countries and 4 river basins level 2 the third level 30 m includes eight irrigation areas level 3 fao 2020 blatchford et al 2020 despite many studies that have been done in the field of evapotranspiration water balance and land use change in lake urmia basin but these studies have included only a part of this basin or have investigated only one issue and in a short time for example tasumi 2019 investigated the actual evapotranspiration using the metric algorithm in the west of urmia lake javadian et al 2019 compared the actual evapotranspiration accuracy obtained from the wapor portal and metric algorithm mohammadzadeh et al 2021 studied land use in the southern of lake urmia basin taheri et al 2019 investigated the amount of water consumption in a number of sub basins of lake urmia basin therefore the purpose of this study was to specify the area of irrigated and rainfed croplands and their temporal changes using remote sensing in response to the question of whether the growth of irrigated croplands has affected the reduction of the lake urmia water level or not the other goal of the study was to investigate the temporal trend of the annual temperature and the spatial temporal distribution of annual precipitation and to determine etia in agricultural and non agricultural lands to study the water balance of the urmia lake basin finally this study attempted to determine net and gross biomass water productivity in irrigated and rainfed croplands 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the urmia lake basin ulb is located between 44 13 and 47 53 east longitudes and from 35 40 to 38 29 north latitudes in northwestern iran its area is about 51 800 km2 the ulb is located in parts of west azerbaijan 46

annual temperature of 13 c the maximum monthly temperature 32 2 c is in july and the minimum 12 7 c is in january the average annual precipitation in this region varies from 180 to 440 mm almost no precipitation occurs between july and september 2 2 land cover classification in the wapor portal land cover classification lcc is obtained using seasonal phenology information from the crop calendar

precipitation with station daily precipitation data is used http chg geog ucsb edu data chirps it is an existing external data source that combines satellite observations with global models and measurements at local stations the daily precipitation pixel size is approximately 5 km prakash 2019 and nikraftar et al 2021 stated that this dataset could be reliable for long term analysis also blatchford et al 2020 concluded that the fwp actual evapotranspiration and interception dataset had enough quality to understand and monitor the regional and continental water management and water processes rahimpour et al 2018 evaluated fwp evapotranspiration obtaining the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and correlation r to be equal to 2 14 mm 10 d 1 2 55 mm 10 d 1 and 0 97 respectively they concluded that fwp actual evapotranspiration and interception had acceptable accuracy to investigate the time trend of etia in agricultural lands the area of irrigated rainfed and fallow croplands was separated from each other for each year using arcmap software v 10 3 then etia in these zones was extracted at 10 day intervals from 2009 to the end of 2020 table 1 summarizes the

water balance we used the precipitation data collected from 24 meteorological stations within the basin instead of using the chirps data in order to increase the accuracy also to investigate the temporal trend of temperature changes and its relationship with etia the average daily temperature of synoptic stations in the lake urmia basin was collected from 2009 to 2020 to investigate the spatial distribution of precipitation cokriging geostatistical method was used also digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 30 30 m was used as an auxiliary variable taheri et al 2019 rata et al 2020 temporal trend of precipitation and temperature data were analyzed using trendline option in excel software mohammadzadeh et al 2021 2 5 water productivity to investigate water productivity in the ulb the annual gross and net biomass water productivity from 2009 to 2020 was obtained from the fao s wapor product the mean of gross biomass water productivity gbwp eq 11 is the quantity of biomass production per total volume of the water consumed sum of canopy transpiration soil evaporation and interception in a specific period the mean of net biomass water productivity nbwp eq 12 is the quantity of total biomass production per volume of the water usefully consumed canopy transpiration in the year for more information refer to fao 2020 11 gbwp tbp e t i 12 nbwp tbp t where tbp is total biomass production in kg dry matter ha 1 e t and i are evaporation transpiration and interception respectively all in mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of fwp land cover classification table 2 shows the error matrix for fwp land cover classification the lowest ua and pa were observed in rainfed and grassland classes which was equal to 79 01 and 72 47 respectively in the study area the rainfed croplands were scattered on the domains and moderately steep areas of the mountains leading to the creation of croplands with small areas considering that fwp land cover classification pixel size is 250 m 6 25 ha this could be regarded as the main source of error and inseparability of rainfed and grassland from each other also becker et al 2021 stated that this could be due to the similarity between the spectral profiles of both classes the highest pa was observed in the water classification zones with 100 oa showed that the mapping was successful up to 86 in all classes kappa for the error matrix was 0 81 finally it could be concluded that the accuracy of fwp land cover classification was reliable 3 2 land use changes according to fig 2a which shows the trend of changes in the agricultural lands in relation to the reduction of water level of lake urmia from 1987 to 2013 the area of agricultural lands has increased by 48 from 864 103 to 1282 103 ha and the water level of lake urmia has decreased by 7 4 m from 1278 2 to 1270 8 m therefore it is clear that increasing the area of agricultural lands increases the demand for water consumption and puts much pressure on the water resources of the basin so it could be considered as one of the important factors in reducing the water level of lake urmia mahmoudi and rezaei 2013 also stated that 22 109 m3 water was extracted from groundwater sources from 1996 to 2010 which caused a decrease in the water level of lake urmia but with the start of the urmia lake restoration committee 10 year plan in 2013 to prevent the drying process of the lake some measures including closing illegal wells reducing irrigation water allocation and cultivation areas and limiting additional groundwater and surface water withdrawal have been adopted aghakouchak et al 2015 taheri et al 2019 it was observed that the process of the increase in irrigated croplands has been stopped beginning to decline this decrease had been continued until 2020 fig 2b according to fig 2b from 2013 to 2020 81 103 ha of the irrigated croplands 14 had been converted to rainfed which could be attributed to the reduction of water resources groundwater depletion and programs of the lake urmia restoration committee also since the only water source for the rainfed croplands in the ulb was precipitation it was observed that with the decrease in the precipitation the area under cultivation of these croplands had been decreased sharply they have remained as fallow from 2013 to 2017 the area of irrigated rainfed and fallow croplands was equal to 585 103 377 103 and 320 103 ha in 2013 and it was equal to 504 103 565 103 and 213 103 in 2020 fig 3 shows the land use maps in the urmia lake basin in 2013 and 2020 according to this figure most changes are observed in the south and east of lake urmia 3 3 actual evapotranspiration and interception etia precipitation is one of the supplier sources for evapotranspiration in agriculture however the inappropriate spatial temporal distribution of precipitation in the urmia lake basin does not supply the plant s water requirement in the growing season most of the precipitation occurs in the non agricultural season and only 30 of it is in the agricultural season fig 4 also only 22 of precipitation occurs in agricultural lands and 78 is in the highlands the inappropriate spatial distribution of precipitation is a limiting factor for actual evapotranspiration especially in rainfed croplands also according to fig 4 it can be observed that the peak of actual evapotranspiration in these lands has occurred a few days after the precipitation while in irrigated croplands the actual evapotranspiration has reached its highest level in the driest months of the year so it has caused dams and groundwater sources to supply the plant s water requirement in irrigated croplands the highest amount of precipitation has occurred in the southern and eastern highlands of the lake urmia basin with an average of 2 9 mm d 1 and the lowest amount of precipitation has occurred on the lake surface with an average of 0 68 mm d 1 fig 5 therefore evaporated water from the lake surface is not supplied directly through precipitation to supply the lake s water evaporate demand the precipitation that has occurred in the highlands must pour into the lake through the rivers but due to the existence of several dams on the rivers this does not happen and the water gathered behind these dams has increased the water demand in the agricultural sector and has increased agricultural lands 3 4 water consumption fig 6 shows the volume of inlet precipitation in the basin and the average water consumption in different sectors through etia regardless of the groundwater exchange the only incoming water source to the basin was precipitation with an average of 15 24 109 m3 from 2009 to 2020 and the volume of the average annual etia from agricultural lands grasslands and evaporation from the surface of lake urmia was 4 88 109 8 18 109 and 2 85 109 m3 respectively which was in total 15 91 109 m3 therefore a negative balance of 0 67 109 m3 was observed table 3 the lowest precipitation has occurred in 2017 which was 10 43 109 m3 67 of this precipitation has been exited from the basin through etia in grasslands or altitudes thus showing that most of the precipitation has occurred in grasslands also considering that the etia of irrigated croplands has not been decreased it can be concluded that the water required for agriculture was supplied from groundwater sources and dams this issue can also be observed in 2018 2019 and 2020 the average annual evapotranspiration in fallow croplands was 0 36 109 m3 equal to 30 of rainfed croplands etia etia in irrigated croplands and evaporation from the surface of lake urmia was 23 and 20 of the total precipitation respectively table 3 most of the exited water from the basin equal to 54 of the precipitation has occurred through evapotranspiration in grasslands which has covered a large area this water has supplied entirely through precipitation therefore this exiting volume of water in grasslands is uncontrollable also the area of irrigated croplands has been decreased by 14 from 2013 to 2020 but the volume of evapotranspiration of these lands shows an increasing trend this can be due to the increase in the average annual temperature and the cultivation of high consumption crops according to the fifth report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc which forecasts the climate extremes based on temperature and precipitation indices an increase in the intensity and number of hot and dry periods is visible hao et al 2013 this is also true about the ulb fig 7 shows the increasing trend of the average annual temperature by 1 1 c from 2009 to 2020 further davarpanah et al 2021 showed that the possibility of drought in the ulb would increase in the future mohammadzadeh et al 2021 also stated that the average temperature had been increased by 3 5 c in the last 30 years etia showed a positive correlation of 0 78 with increasing the temperature fig 7 therefore despite the decrease in irrigated croplands the increase of etia table 3 in the ulb was due to the rise of the annual temperature so it can be concluded that the only solution for compensating the negative water balance in this basin is further reducing the area under irrigated cultivation and evaporation from the surface of urmia lake numerous studies have been carried out on the evaporation from the surface of lake urmia including biazar et al 2020 siadatmousavi and seyedalipour 2019 and hasany and yaghmaei 2015 also considering that agriculture is the main source of income for the inhabitants of this basin it is important to focus on cultivating high yield crops beside reducing the area under irrigated cultivation 3 5 water productivity the average annual gbwp in irrigated and rainfed croplands was 1 79 and 1 78 kg m 3 respectively the average annual nbwp was estimated to be equal to 2 16 kg m 3 and 2 61 kg m 3 for irrigated and rainfed croplands respectively fig 8 also table 4 shows that the average annual evaporation transpiration and interception in the irrigated croplands were 1 3 3 and 2 times more than those of rainfed croplands respectively so by using eqs 9 and 10 the total biomass production tbp in irrigated croplands was obtained 2 47 times more than that of the rainfed croplands considering that the transpiration and tbp of the irrigated croplands were 3 and 2 47 times more than those of the rainfed croplands it can be concluded that water productivity in irrigated croplands was low so to decrease water consumption in the irrigated croplands transpiration should be reduced by using methods such as deficit irrigation and partial root irrigation beside the cultivation of high yield crops also evaporation and interception in these lands could be reduced by using methods such as soil surface mulching drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation instead of sprinkler irrigation 4 conclusion the results showed that the area of agricultural lands had been increased by 48 from 1987 to 2013 from 864 103 to 1282 103 ha during the same period the water level of lake urmia had been decreased by 7 4 m from 1278 2 to 1270 8 m and more than 80 of its area had been dried the results also showed that in the urmia lake basin precipitation had been decreased while the average annual temperature had been increased by 1 1 c from 2009 to 2020 in addition 14 of the irrigated croplands area had been reduced and the net and gross biomass water productivity had not been increased also the water balance in this basin was negative 0 67 109 m3 and the transpiration and tbp of the irrigated cropland were 3 and 2 47 times more than those of the rainfed cropland respectively finally the increase in agricultural lands the rise of temperature consequently increasing etia the decreasing trend and the inappropriate spatial temporal distribution of precipitation all emphasize the importance of reducing evapotranspiration through methods such as subsurface irrigation deficit irrigation and reduction of irrigated croplands by cultivating high yield crops declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
