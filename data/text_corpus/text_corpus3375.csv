solution treatment wetland 1 introduction treatment wetlands are nature based solutions for water treatment that can be used to treat different types of wastewater in areas where decentralized treatment technologies are the most cost effective option kadlec and wallace 2009 this is the case for example in developing countries where infrastructure is lacking or high costs are incurred such as for operation and maintenance of public infrastructure van afferden et al 2015 conventional subsurface horizontal flow hf wetlands have been used for decades to treat domestic wastewater due to stricter regulations regarding discharge standards and the knowledge that oxygen is a limiting factor for removal of certain pollutants various treatment wetland designs have been developed that utilize pumping of air or water to increase the oxygen transfer efficiency and thus pollutant removal wallace et al 2008 treatment wetland technology varies from completely passive systems to highly engineered systems that employ aeration recirculation or reciprocation in general intensified treatment wetlands have operating costs but also have a smaller area footprint and higher pollutant removal capacity per person equivalent per square meter pe m2 compared to passive non aerated wetlands nivala et al 2019 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are major sources of micropollutants entering aquatic ecosystems verlicchi and zambello 2014 and the removal of micropollutants in wastewater treatment has become an increasing focus of research in recent decades micropollutants are anthropogenic chemicals from the substance classes of e g personal care products hormones and pharmaceuticals micropollutants occur in low ng l to very low pg l concentrations in the environment and pose risks to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems ilyas et al 2020 recent studies on micropollutant treatment wetlands have examined a range of wetland designs operational conditions and influent compositions to efficiently remove micropollutants hijosa valsero et al 2016 kahl et al 2017 matamoros et al 2007 biodegradation is one of the most important micropollutant degradation processes in treatment wetlands jekel et al 2015 it has become accepted practice to analyze representative chemicals of a substance class with so called indicator substances in order to draw conclusions about other micropollutants with the similar property dickenson et al 2011 in previous studies several micropollutants were identified as suitable indicator compounds for identifying water quality along small rivers müller et al 2018 drinking water treatment jin and peldszus 2012 and surveilling hospital effluents helwig et al 2013 jekel et al 2015 also identified process and source indicator substances and recommended micropollutants with varying degrees of biodegradability recalcitrant moderately biodegradable and readily biodegradable in order to be able to make a conclusive statement on treatment efficacy of engineered treatment systems seven of such indicator substances have already be successfully applied to monitor treatment efficacy of intensified treatment wetlands kahl et al 2017 the measurement of indicator substances reflects the concentrations of the micropollutants analyzed but does not give a holistic view of all the chemicals present in a given water sample however even if the parent compounds are degraded the resulting transformation products and metabolites can lead to environmental risks the use of cell based in vitro bioassays also known as effect based methods can assess the sum effect of all biologically active pollutants both quantitatively and qualitatively in a water sample escher et al 2020 bioassays provide complementary information to chemical analysis in that they can be used to detect unknown compounds transformation products and metabolites with similar modes of action active pollutants even if present below their chemical analytical detection limits can produce mixture effects neale et al 2020a välitalo et al 2017 cell based in vitro bioassays are designed to cover relevant steps of cellular toxicity pathways such as xenobiotic metabolism hormonal activity and adaptive stress response to address different groups of chemicals neale et al 2020a bioassays have been used in several individual studies to examine the removal efficacy of biological effects from wwtps as well as constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment lundqvist et al 2019 neale et al 2020b nivala et al 2018 lundqvist et al 2019 assessed the removal of biological effects in five wwtps with a bioassay test battery estrogenicity androgenicity aryl hydrocarbon receptor activity oxidative stress response and the ability to activate nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated b cells and found a removal efficacy between 16 99 depending on the bioassay ávila et al 2014 reported a reduction in biological effects of 70 100 dioxin like activity estrogenicity and apical effects in whole organisms by a hybrid constructed wetland in the proof of concept study by nivala et al 2018 at the same research site as the current study seven different treatment wetlands and a municipal wwtp were evaluated once in summer and once in winter for their removal efficacy of selected micropollutants and biological effects the municipal wwtp consistently showed lower 52 98 removal of biological effects than the intensified treatment wetlands 77 99 the present study advances on previous research by comparing seven different treatment wetland designs with an adjacent municipal wastewater treatment plant for their removal efficacy of conventional pollutants indicator micropollutants and biological effects over the course of one year the overarching aims of this study were i to identify whether removal of mixture effects is influenced by certain treatment wetland design aspects aerated vs non aerated planted vs non planted single stage vs two stage and ii to determine the relationship between removal of indicator micropollutants and biological effects 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted at a treatment wetland research platform in langenreichenbach germany the platform is located adjacent to a municipal wwtp activated sludge technology followed by biological and chemical phosphorous precipitation that serves approximately 16 000 inhabitants at the research platform a two chamber septic tank serves as primary treatment of raw wastewater with a nominal hydraulic residence time nhrt of two days before it is sent to the pilot scale wetland systems the horizontal flow hf wetland 50 cm saturated depth h50p served as a baseline technology non aerated single stage the intensified systems included saturated horizontal flow wetlands with aeration ha aerated and unplanted hap aerated and planted saturated vertical flow wetlands with aeration va aerated and unplanted vap aerated and planted a two stage wetland system consisting of vap followed by an unsaturated sand filter vap vsp as well as a two cell reciprocating r system table 1 all systems started operation in june 2010 further details on the

transported to the laboratory at 4 c the 250 ml samples were acidified with 6 m hydrochloric acid to ph 2 and filtrated with a glass fiber microfilter gf f 0 7 µm followed by solid phase extraction enrichment factor ef 200 as described by sossalla et al 2020 within 24 h of collection extracts were stored at 18 c until bioanalysis a detailed description of the quantification of the mixture effects are described in könig et al 2017 and neale et al 2017 in short the appropriate amount of extract was transferred to a dosing vial the solvent methanol was blown down under a gentle nitrogen stream and the residue was resuspended in test medium to a maximum relative enrichment factor ref of 50 in the bioassay a serial dilution 1000 fold 211 of each water extract and for quality control blank extracts prepared from lc grade water methanol ethyl acetate were also run in duplicate each plate included a positive control reference compound of the bioassay for reproducibility control cytotoxicity was assessed prior to quantification of the reporter protein by microscopic imaging escher et al 2019 the reference compounds and their effect concentrations ec are listed in table 2 lods of each bioassay are derived in the supplementary information section a3 table a1 a battery of five bioassays was applied to quantify the mixture effects present in the water samples the bioassays cover three different stages of the cellular toxicity pathway xenobiotic metabolism analysed by the bioassays ahr calux activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr and pparɣ geneblazer binding to the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma pparɣ hormonal activity analyzed by the bioassays erα geneblazer indicative of activation of the estrogen receptor alpha erα and gr geneblazer activation of the glucocorticoid receptor gr oxidative stress response was evaluated with arec32 mediated by the transcription factor nrf2 2 3 data analysis limits of detection lod and limits of quantification loq are given in the supplementary information sektion a3 table a1 for bioassays cell viability was also determined effect concentrations ec causing more than 10 cytotoxicity were excluded from the concentration effect modeling further information on the data evaluation method for each bioassay is published in escher et al 2018b for bioassays indicative of xenobiotic metabolism and receptor mediated effects effect concentrations triggering 10 ec10 of the investigated maximum effect were used to calculate ec10 for oxidative stress response effect concentrations causing an induction ratio of 1 5 ecir1 5 were used with the concept of bioanalytical equivalent concentrations herein referred to as beq an observed effect can be translated into the equivalent concentration of the reference compound for a given bioassay for this the ec of the reference compound ecreference is divided by the ec of the sample ecsample equation 1 1 beq ng l ec 10 reference ec 10 sample or ec ir 1 5 reference ec ir 1 5 sample outliers were identified first by manual inspection and removal of data corresponding to dates of sitewide maintenance followed by identification of recommended upper and lower bounds for outliers according to von sperling et al 2020 further information is given in the supplementary information section a1 the use of chemical concentrations and beqs to determine the pollutant removal efficacy of small scale treatment wetlands is not particularly accurate because the water loss due to evapotranspiration can amount to a significant fraction of the daily inflow during the summer months kadlec and wallace 2009 therefore the mass load ml for chemical concentrations and the bioanalytical equivalent load bel for bioanalysis were calculated on a monthly basis by

microsoft excel office 2013 and knime analytical platform version 4 1 3 analysis was conducted in graphpad prism version 9 the kruskal wallis test was used to identify whether there was a significant difference between the mass removal and bel removal of the treatment wetlands followed by the post hoc dunn s multiple comparisons test to compare the mass removal efficacy of a particular wetland with another 2 5 multivariate data analysis the aim of the multivariate data analysis was to evaluate whether or not bioassays are representative of concentration changes observed among pools of micropollutants using principal component analysis pca therefore pca was only performed on the micropollutant and bioassay data other variables were used as quantitative data providing orientation analysis was conducted in the r software r core team 2020 considering the number of missing data pre processing steps were necessary variables with more than 30 of missing values among observations were removed the remaining missing data were inferred using a regularized iterative multiple correspondence analysis implemented in the package missmda josse and husson 2016 the pca method implemented in the factominer package husson et al 2011 was chosen two separate pcas were carried out one for all observations and one for intensified wetland effluent concentrations and beqs only results were graphically displayed and analyzed using the factoextra package kassambara and mundt 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 conventional wastewater parameters temperature and rainfall during the study are provided in figure a1 air temperatures ranged between 40 c and 10 c and monthly rainfall ranged between 0 9 mm month april 2019 and 60 5 mm month february 2019 monthly mass pollutant removals are provided in fig 1 annual mean concentrations and mass removals for selected conventional wastewater parameters are given in table 3 the high annual mean mass removal of cbod5 98 and toc 85 the positive redox potential as well as the higher effluent dissolved oxygen do concentration 5 mg l is due to intensifications that lead to increased oxygen transfer in the wetlands intensified wetlands performed similarly to the wwtp in terms of cbod5 and toc mass removal fig 1a and fig 1b respectively ammonium nitrogen nh4 n mass removal was high 93 in the intensified wetlands ha hap vap vap vsp and r fig 1d nh4 n mass removal was lower in va 81 which could be a result of experiments conducted on va from 2013 2017 that could have caused poor functioning of the aeration system boog et al 2018 2014 h50p removed very little nh4 n due to lack of aerobic conditions 34 mass removal of total nitrogen tn varied depending on the systems fig 1c the lowest tn mass removal was observed in h50p 37 which can be explained by inefficient nitrification due to the lack of dissolved oxygen tn mass removals ranged from 48 hap to 66 va vap vsp in the intensified wetlands and was 91 for the wwtp e coli

wetlands hap 3 8 log10 units ha 3 9 log10 units had higher log reductions than the vf aerated wetlands vap 2 2 log10 units va 1 6 log10 units and the municipal wwtp 2 9 log10 units image deleted

concentrations were achieved in all wetlands and the wwtp for the readily biodegradable compounds caf 4 μg l ibu 4 μg l and npx 0 5 μg l table 4 aerobic conditions in the intensified treatment wetlands ha hap va vap vap vsp and r resulted in 89 mass removal of caf ibu and npx fig 2 a c which is consistent with previous studies hijosa valsero et al 2016 verlicchi and zambello 2014 the non aerated wetland h50p showed low mass removal of micropollutants due to the prevailing anaerobic conditions 86 for caf 51 for ibu and 61 for npx for the moderately biodegradable compounds btz dcl ace greater variability was observed in effluent concentrations and mass removals depending on the treatment wetland fig 2c e btz was well removed in ha hap vap vap vsp and the wwtp 5 µg l 82 mass removal while moderate mass removal was achieved for btz in va 57 and r 68 h50p had a btz annual mass percent removal of 44 which is significantly less than the btz removal observed in the wwtp p 0 05 or in vap vsp p 0 0001 p values are provided in table a3 previous studies showed moderate degradation of btz under anaerobic conditions and increased degradation under aerobic conditions liu et al 2011 matamoros et al 2010 vap hap and the two stage system vap vsp were most effective in removing dcl 81 93 and 95 mass removal respectively which was even higher than in a previous study conducted on this research side kahl et al 2017 these wetlands are characterized by high redox potentials favoring the biological degradation of dcl hijosa valsero et al 2010 the remaining wetlands achieved dcl mass removal between 39 h50p and 53 r and the wwtp achieved 40 on an annual basis mean effluent ace concentrations for all systems ranged between 2 0 μg l vap vsp ha and 29 μg l h50p ace removal in the treatment wetlands was highly seasonal which is reflected in the higher standard deviations in effluent ace concentrations compared to the other monitored micropollutants table 4 although previously thought to be resistant to biodegradation ace has recently been reported to be moderately biodegradable castronovo et al 2017 kahl et al 2018 monthly mean mass removal efficacies ranged between 85 99 for the intensified wetlands 37 60 for h50p and 96 99 for the municipal wwtp from may 2018 november 2018 when effluent water temperatures were 16 7 3 9 c from december 2019 april 2018 when effluent water temperatures were lower 7 9 1 8 c ace mean monthly mass removal dropped as low as 38 for the intensified wetlands 7 for h50p and 61 for the municipal wwtp monthly mean mass percent removals for each system are shown in the supplementary information table a2 other studies confirm poorer ace biodegradation at low temperatures which may be due to reduced metabolic activity of the ace degrading microorganisms burke et al 2014 kahl et al 2018 cbz was not effectively removed in any of the treatment systems fig 2g which is consistent with other studies on constructed wetlands and municipal wwtps ilyas et al 2020 kahl et al 2017 several studies suggest that cbz enters the wetlands as a conjugate and is metabolized back into the parent compound during biological treatment jekel et al 2015 neale et al 2020b thus the negative removal efficacies might be explained by the presence of conjugated cbz glucuronide conjugate könig et al 2016 reported from column and batch experiments that under reducing conditions and by adapted bacteria a degradation of cbz into the main degradation product 10 11 dihydro cbz could be observed 20 degradation in column experiment anoxic bank filtrate used as column influent and spiked with cbz since reducing conditions prevail in h50p reductive transformation of cbz cannot be excluded a differentiation between the original and newly formed parent compound and the resulting removal efficacy can therefore not be made the observed mass load removal efficacies of micropollutants are consistently with a previous study on the research site langenreichenbach kahl et al 2017 the second stage of the two stage system vap vsp provided incremental polishing resulting in higher micropollutant mass removal than single stage systems except for cbz mass removal in h50p 3 3 bioanalysis annual bel removal efficacies for four of the five investigated bioassays are provided in fig 3 either no effect was observed for the activation of gr or cytotoxicity masked the effect therefore this data is not presented hashmi et al 2020 reported masking effects of gr mediated activity by other cytotoxic compounds in raw water extracts and recommended fractionation as a sample preparation step to avoid masking effects normalization of beqs to bels for treatment plants was recommended by neale et al 2020b beq percent removal is analogous to concentration percent removal and bel removal is analogous to mass load removal comparing bel removal as opposed to beq removal gives a more accurate picture that takes into account flow dynamics such as those due to evapotranspiration the ec values in units of ref for each treatment wetland influent effluent monthly bel removals and p values are provided in the supplementary information in table a4 table a5 and table a6 respectively b a p el indicative for activation of ahr fig 3a was well removed in the intensified systems 78 91 with the two stage system vap vsp being the most effective system h50p and the wwtp showed lower removal efficacy of b a p el 66 and 60 respectively high variability of beq removal of activation of ahr was reported in the literature lundqvist et al 2019 neale et al 2020b between 79 and 94 of the oxidative stress response was removed by the intensified wetlands and the wwtp while h50p removed significantly less 56 p 0 05 fig 3b in previous studies beq removal efficacies varied from 60 to 85 neale et al 2020b nivala et al 2018 estrogenic activity fig 3c was efficiently removed in all intensified wetlands 99 which was significantly higher than removal observed in va 88 p 0 05 and h50p 77 p 0 05 these high removal efficacies are consistent with previous studies bain et al 2014 lundqvist et al 2019 neale et al 2020b because of masking effects cytotoxicity no eeqs could be derived for vap vsp high removal efficacy for rosiglitazone el indicative for activation of pparγ was observed for the intensified treatment wetlands and the wwtp 91 and to a lesser extent for h50p 76 fig 3d similar removals were also reported in previous studies where beq removal efficacies for rosiglitazone eq ranged from 67 to 99 bain et al 2014 neale et al 2020b with the exception of va the monthly bel removal efficacies for the intensified wetlands did not fluctuate much over the course of the year fig 4 previous experiments on va may have altered the microbial community or reduced the effectiveness of the aeration system resulting in a poorer and more variable system performance boog et al 2018 bel removal for the wwtp was comparable to that of the intensified wetlands except for activation of ahr h50p showed lower and more variable bel removal efficacies for all bioassays especially in the colder months not every observed biological effect in a bioassay results in an environmental or human health risk to distinguish between poor and good water quality recent studies have derived effect based trigger ebt values from the environmental quality standards eqs of the european union water framework directive ebts for surface water have been proposed escher et al 2018a and updated in a more recent study neale et al 2020a but no ebt values currently exist for the treated wastewater except for estrogenicity jarošová et al 2014 the samples for wetland influent wwtpin and h50p mostly showed high beqs that were above the propsed ebts for surface water even though the current ebts apply only to surface waters comparison with the beqs of treated effluents in this study shows the beqs achieved by the treatment systems intensified wetlands and the municipal wwtp were close to or even below the surface water ebts fig 5 indicating that no or very little dilution would be required for the treated effluent to be released to the environment without causing negative environmental effects for activation of ahr oxidative stress response and activation of ppary the effluents from ha hap va vap vap vsp r and the wwtp could be discharged directly to the environment without adversely affecting the receiving water the two stage wetland system vap vsp had the highest removal of biological effects with effluent beqs well below the proposed surface water ebts the exception for all investigated treatment systems wetlands and wwtp was eeq activation of er estrogenic activity where effluent beqs did not fall below the proposed surface water eeq ebt of 0 34 nge2 l a pca was conducted on all data with the intention of exploring the relationship between removal efficacies of conventional pollutants micropollutants and biological effects operational conditions were also used to discriminate the results categorical complementary data the multidimensional dataset of micropollutants and bioassays can be reduced to two dimensions that explain more than 82 of the total variance the first dimension corresponds to micropollutants that were more easily biodegradable under aerobic conditions btz ace ibu dcl npx while the second axis was mainly associated with cbz intensified wetlands significantly reduced a pool of micropollutants that are regarded as biodegradable under aerobic conditions these are grouped together on the left part of the score plot fig 6 a the data points for the intensified wetlands were similarly distributed along the vertical axis regardless of the individual system the ellipse centers of the effluent concentrations of all intensified wetlands and the wwtp were similarly close to each other and the major axes of the ellipses had similar orientations and magnitudes the poor removal of micropollutants and biological effects in h50p were grouped with the influent wastewater sep and wwtpin on the highest values of dimension 1 a second pca was conducted to reduce the dimensionality of the variation in data in order to identify which beqs were associated with the dominant dimensions the first three dimensions explained 73 of the total variance micropollutants that are more easily biodegradable were associated with dimension 1 and fell into two clusters btz dcl ibu and npx were associated with the bioassay for dichlorvos eq caf and ace associated with the bioassay for rosiglitazone eq fig 7 b these associations do not imply a causal relationship it is possible that variables in a cluster were associated simply because they all are sensitive to another common variable for example the difference between these two clusters might be explained by changes in temperature since this parameter was associated with the second dimension the contribution of rosiglitazone eq to dimension 1 was larger 13 5 than the one of dichlorvos eq 11 3 both cbz and b a p eq significantly contributed to dimension 2 28 5 and 43 6 respectively fig 7b fig 7a shows that b a p eq has a large contribution to dimension 3 34 7 as well as cbz 23 3 this does not mean that cbz is activating the ahr but rather that chemicals that activate the ahr are similarly recalcitrant as cbz conclusions seven treatment wetlands and a municipal wwtp were monitored for removal efficacy with respect to conventional wastewater parameters seven indicator micropollutants and five bioassays aerobic conditions as evidenced by high do elevated redox potential and full nitrification in the intensified wetlands promoted biodegradation of most micropollutants and removal of biological effects carbamazepine was not well removed in the intensified wetlands or the wwtp but was somewhat removed in the non aerated wetland h50p which exhibited predominantly anaerobic conditions low do low redox potential very little nitrification the two stage wetland vap vsp had the best overall removal of biological effects often with higher bel removal than the conventional wwtp all intensified treatment wetlands had higher bel removal than h50p thus further demonstrating the advantages of intensified wetland systems no significant differences were observed between the aerated hf and vf systems or between the planted and unplanted pairs indicating that vegetation plays only a small role in the removal capacity of intensified treatment wetlands for indicator micropollutants and selected mixture effects the two stage treatment wetland system vap vsp exhibited the highest and most stable mass removal for conventional wastewater parameters cbod5 toc tn nh4 n e coli annual average 4 7 log10 unit removal micropollutants 94 99 except cbz and biological equivalent loads 91 99 if cost and required footprint play an important role in a wastewater treatment project the aerated wetlands hap and vap are recommended as they also provide high quality effluent bel removal for the intensified treatment wetlands were similar to or higher than those of the municipal wwtp further demonstrating the high treatment capacity of nature based solutions no direct correlation between micropollutants removal and bel removal was found which underlines the importance of the complementary approach where indicator chemicals are a measure of the capacity for biodegradation but the bioassays give an impression on the overall water quality bioassays provide a sum parameter of risk scaled concentrations and are relevant for the overall water quality effect based trigger ebt values have recently been proposed for differentiate good from poor water quality by indicating acceptable risk for complex mixtures in surface waters escher et al 2018a while ebts have so far only been developed for surface water the intensified wetland systems in this study were able to achieve effluent bioequivalent concentrations beqs near to or below three proposed surface water ebts b a p eq dichlorvos eq and rosiglitazone eq indicating an immense potential for the use of enhanced nature based solutions for water treatment and reuse discharge of treated effluent to a receiving surface water would result in a dilution of effects effectively reducing further the beqs future studies should include internal sampling in saturated treatment wetland systems to better understand the spatial dynamics of pollutant and mixture effect removal since aerobic conditions are an important factor in removal of biological effects future studies could try to gain a better understanding of the role of redox potential and removal of biological effects the effect of intermittent or spatially zoned aeration on removal of micropollutants and biological effects could also be investigated availability of data data is available in supplementary material declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

stricter regulations regarding discharge standards and the knowledge that oxygen is a limiting factor for removal of certain pollutants various treatment wetland designs have been developed that utilize pumping of air or water to increase the oxygen transfer efficiency and thus pollutant removal wallace et al 2008 treatment wetland technology varies from completely passive systems to highly engineered systems that employ aeration recirculation or reciprocation in general intensified treatment wetlands have operating costs but also have a smaller area footprint and higher pollutant removal capacity per person equivalent per square meter pe m2 compared to passive non aerated wetlands nivala et al 2019 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are major sources of micropollutants entering aquatic ecosystems verlicchi and zambello 2014 and the removal of micropollutants in wastewater treatment has become an increasing focus of research in recent decades micropollutants are anthropogenic chemicals from the substance classes of e g personal care products hormones and pharmaceuticals micropollutants occur in low ng l to very low pg l concentrations in the environment and pose risks to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems ilyas et al 2020 recent studies on micropollutant treatment wetlands have examined a range of wetland designs operational conditions and influent compositions to efficiently remove micropollutants hijosa valsero et al 2016 kahl et al 2017 matamoros et al 2007 biodegradation is one of the most important micropollutant degradation processes in treatment wetlands jekel et al 2015 it has become accepted practice to analyze representative chemicals of a substance class with so called indicator substances in order to draw conclusions about other micropollutants with the similar property dickenson et al 2011 in previous studies several micropollutants were identified as suitable indicator compounds for identifying water quality along small rivers müller et al 2018 drinking water treatment jin and peldszus 2012 and surveilling hospital effluents helwig et al 2013 jekel et al 2015 also identified process and source indicator substances and recommended micropollutants with varying degrees of biodegradability recalcitrant moderately biodegradable and readily biodegradable in order to be able to make a conclusive statement on treatment efficacy of engineered treatment systems seven of such indicator substances have already be successfully applied to monitor treatment efficacy of intensified treatment wetlands kahl et al 2017 the measurement of indicator substances reflects the concentrations of the micropollutants analyzed but does not give a holistic view of all the chemicals present in a given water sample however even if the parent compounds are degraded the resulting transformation products and metabolites can lead to environmental risks the use of cell based in vitro bioassays also known as effect based methods can assess the sum effect of all biologically active pollutants both quantitatively and qualitatively in a water sample escher et al 2020 bioassays provide complementary information to chemical analysis in that they can be used to detect unknown compounds transformation products and metabolites with similar modes of action active pollutants even if present below their chemical analytical detection limits can produce mixture effects neale et al 2020a välitalo et al 2017 cell based in vitro bioassays are designed to cover relevant steps of cellular toxicity pathways such as xenobiotic metabolism hormonal activity and adaptive stress response to address different groups of chemicals neale et al 2020a bioassays have been used in several individual studies to examine the removal efficacy of biological effects from wwtps as well as constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment lundqvist et al 2019 neale et al 2020b nivala et al 2018 lundqvist et al 2019 assessed the removal of biological effects in five wwtps with a bioassay test battery estrogenicity androgenicity aryl hydrocarbon receptor activity oxidative stress response and the ability to activate nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated b cells and found a removal efficacy between 16 99 depending on the bioassay ávila et al 2014 reported a reduction in biological effects of 70 100 dioxin like activity estrogenicity and apical effects in whole organisms by a hybrid constructed wetland in the proof of concept study by nivala et al 2018 at the same research site as the current study seven different treatment wetlands and a municipal wwtp were evaluated once in summer and once in winter for their removal efficacy of selected micropollutants and biological effects the municipal wwtp consistently showed lower 52 98 removal of biological effects than the intensified treatment wetlands 77 99 the present study advances on previous research by comparing seven different treatment wetland designs with an adjacent municipal wastewater treatment plant for their removal efficacy of conventional pollutants indicator micropollutants and biological effects over the course of one year the overarching aims of this study were i to identify whether removal of mixture effects is influenced by certain treatment wetland design aspects aerated vs non aerated planted vs non planted single stage vs two stage and ii to determine the relationship between removal of indicator micropollutants and biological effects 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted at a treatment wetland research platform in langenreichenbach germany the platform is located adjacent to a municipal wwtp activated sludge technology followed by biological and chemical phosphorous precipitation that serves approximately 16 000 inhabitants at the research platform a two chamber septic tank serves as primary treatment of raw wastewater with a nominal hydraulic residence time nhrt of two days before it is sent to the pilot scale wetland systems the horizontal flow hf wetland 50 cm saturated depth h50p served as a baseline technology non aerated single stage the intensified systems included saturated horizontal flow wetlands with aeration ha aerated and unplanted hap aerated and planted saturated vertical flow wetlands with aeration va aerated and unplanted vap aerated and planted a two stage

enrichment factor ef 200 as described by sossalla et al 2020 within 24 h of collection extracts were stored at 18 c until bioanalysis a detailed description of the quantification of the mixture effects are described in könig et al 2017 and neale et al 2017 in short the appropriate amount of extract was transferred to a dosing vial the solvent methanol was blown down under a gentle nitrogen stream and the residue was resuspended in test medium to a maximum relative enrichment factor ref of 50 in the bioassay a serial dilution 1000 fold 211 of each water extract and for quality control blank extracts prepared from lc grade water methanol ethyl acetate were also run in duplicate each plate included a positive control reference compound of the bioassay for reproducibility control cytotoxicity was assessed prior to quantification of the reporter protein by microscopic imaging escher et al 2019 the reference compounds and their effect concentrations ec are listed in table 2 lods of each bioassay are derived in the supplementary information section a3 table a1 a battery of five bioassays was applied to quantify the mixture effects present in the water samples the bioassays cover three different stages of the cellular toxicity pathway xenobiotic metabolism analysed by the bioassays ahr calux activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr and pparɣ geneblazer binding to the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma pparɣ hormonal activity analyzed by the bioassays erα geneblazer indicative of activation of the estrogen receptor alpha erα and gr geneblazer

excluded from the concentration effect modeling further information on the data evaluation method for each bioassay is published in escher et al 2018b for bioassays indicative of xenobiotic metabolism and receptor mediated effects effect concentrations triggering 10 ec10 of the investigated maximum effect were used to calculate ec10 for oxidative stress response effect concentrations causing an induction ratio of 1 5 ecir1 5 were used with the concept of bioanalytical equivalent concentrations herein referred to as beq an observed effect can be translated into the equivalent concentration of the reference compound for a given bioassay for this the ec of the reference compound ecreference is divided by the ec of the sample ecsample equation 1 1 beq ng l ec 10 reference ec 10 sample or ec

and lower bounds for outliers according to von sperling et al 2020 further information is given in the supplementary information section a1 the use of chemical concentrations and beqs to determine the pollutant removal efficacy of small scale treatment wetlands is not particularly accurate because the water loss due to evapotranspiration can amount to a significant fraction of the daily inflow

microsoft excel office 2013 and knime analytical platform version 4 1 3 analysis was conducted in graphpad prism version 9 the kruskal wallis test was used to identify whether there was a significant difference between the mass removal and bel removal of the treatment wetlands followed by the post hoc dunn s multiple comparisons test to compare the mass removal efficacy of a particular wetland with another 2 5 multivariate data analysis the aim of the multivariate data analysis was to evaluate whether or not bioassays are representative of concentration changes observed among pools of micropollutants using principal component analysis pca therefore pca was only performed on the micropollutant and bioassay data other variables were used as quantitative data providing orientation analysis was conducted in the r software r core team 2020 considering the number of missing data pre processing steps were necessary variables with more than 30 of missing values among observations were removed the remaining missing data were inferred using a regularized iterative multiple correspondence analysis implemented in the package missmda josse and husson 2016 the pca method implemented in the factominer package husson et al 2011 was chosen two separate pcas were carried out one for all observations and one for intensified wetland effluent concentrations and beqs only results were graphically displayed and analyzed using the factoextra package kassambara and mundt 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 conventional wastewater parameters temperature and rainfall during the study are

provided in fig 1 annual mean concentrations and mass removals for selected conventional wastewater parameters are given in table 3 the high annual mean mass removal of cbod5 98 and toc 85 the positive redox potential as well as the higher effluent dissolved oxygen do concentration 5 mg l is due to intensifications that lead to increased oxygen transfer in the wetlands intensified wetlands performed similarly to the wwtp in terms of cbod5 and toc mass removal fig 1a and fig 1b respectively ammonium nitrogen nh4 n mass removal was high 93 in the intensified wetlands ha hap vap vap vsp and r fig 1d nh4 n mass removal was lower in va 81 which could be a result of experiments conducted on va from 2013 2017 that could have caused poor functioning of the aeration system boog et al 2018 2014 h50p removed very little nh4 n due to lack of aerobic conditions 34 mass removal of total nitrogen tn varied depending on the systems fig 1c the lowest tn mass removal was observed in h50p 37 which can be explained by inefficient nitrification due to the lack of dissolved oxygen tn mass removals ranged from 48 hap to 66 va vap vsp in the intensified wetlands and was 91 for the wwtp e coli

wetlands ha hap va vap vap vsp and r resulted in 89 mass removal of caf ibu and npx fig 2 a c which is consistent with previous studies hijosa valsero et al 2016 verlicchi and zambello 2014 the non aerated wetland h50p showed low mass removal of micropollutants due to the prevailing anaerobic conditions 86 for caf 51 for ibu and 61 for npx for the moderately biodegradable compounds btz dcl ace greater variability was observed in effluent concentrations and mass removals depending on the treatment wetland fig 2c e btz was well removed in ha hap vap vap vsp and the wwtp 5 µg l 82 mass removal while moderate mass removal was achieved for btz in va 57 and r 68 h50p had a btz annual mass percent removal of 44 which is significantly less than the btz removal observed in the wwtp p 0 05 or in vap vsp p 0 0001 p values are provided in table a3 previous studies showed moderate degradation of btz under anaerobic conditions and increased degradation under aerobic conditions liu et al 2011 matamoros et al 2010 vap hap and the two stage system vap vsp were most effective in removing dcl 81 93 and 95 mass removal respectively which was even higher than in a previous study conducted on this research side kahl et al 2017 these wetlands are characterized by high redox potentials favoring the biological degradation of dcl hijosa valsero et al 2010 the remaining wetlands achieved dcl mass removal between 39 h50p and 53 r and the wwtp achieved 40 on an annual basis mean effluent ace concentrations for all systems ranged between 2 0 μg l vap vsp ha and 29 μg l h50p ace removal in the treatment wetlands was highly seasonal which is reflected in the higher standard deviations in effluent ace concentrations compared to the other monitored micropollutants table 4 although previously thought to be resistant to biodegradation ace has recently been reported to be moderately biodegradable castronovo et al 2017 kahl et al 2018 monthly mean mass removal efficacies ranged between 85 99 for the intensified wetlands 37 60 for h50p and 96 99 for the municipal wwtp from may 2018 november 2018 when effluent water temperatures were 16 7 3 9 c from december 2019 april 2018 when effluent water temperatures were lower 7 9 1 8 c ace mean monthly mass removal dropped as low as 38 for the intensified wetlands 7 for h50p and 61 for the municipal wwtp monthly mean mass percent removals for each system are shown in the supplementary information table a2 other studies confirm poorer ace biodegradation at low temperatures which may be due to reduced metabolic activity of the ace degrading microorganisms burke et al 2014 kahl et al 2018 cbz was not effectively removed in any of the treatment systems fig 2g which is consistent with other studies on constructed wetlands and municipal wwtps ilyas et al 2020 kahl et al 2017 several studies suggest that cbz enters the wetlands as a conjugate and is metabolized back into the parent compound during biological treatment jekel et al 2015 neale et al 2020b thus the negative removal efficacies might be explained by the presence of conjugated cbz glucuronide conjugate könig et al 2016 reported from column and batch experiments that under reducing conditions and by adapted bacteria a degradation of cbz into the main degradation product 10 11 dihydro cbz could be observed 20 degradation in column experiment anoxic bank filtrate used as column influent and spiked with cbz since reducing conditions prevail in h50p reductive transformation of cbz cannot be excluded a differentiation between the original and newly formed parent compound and the resulting removal efficacy can therefore not be made the observed mass load removal efficacies of micropollutants are consistently with a previous study on the research site langenreichenbach kahl et al 2017 the second stage of the two stage system vap vsp provided incremental polishing resulting in higher micropollutant mass removal than single stage systems except for cbz mass removal in h50p 3 3 bioanalysis annual bel removal efficacies for four of the five investigated bioassays are provided in fig 3 either no effect was observed for the activation of gr or cytotoxicity masked the effect therefore this data is not presented hashmi et al 2020 reported masking effects of gr mediated activity by other cytotoxic compounds in raw water extracts and recommended fractionation as a sample preparation step to avoid masking effects normalization of beqs to bels for treatment plants was recommended by neale et al 2020b beq percent removal is analogous to concentration percent removal and bel removal is analogous to mass load removal comparing bel removal as opposed to beq removal gives a more accurate picture that takes into account flow dynamics such as those due to evapotranspiration the ec values in units of ref for each treatment wetland influent effluent monthly bel removals and p values are provided in the supplementary information in table a4 table a5 and table a6 respectively b a p el indicative for activation of ahr fig 3a was well removed in the intensified systems 78 91 with the two stage system vap vsp being the most effective system h50p and the wwtp showed lower removal efficacy of b a p el 66 and 60 respectively high variability of beq removal of activation of ahr was reported in the literature lundqvist et al 2019 neale et al 2020b between 79 and 94 of the oxidative stress response was removed by the intensified wetlands and the wwtp while h50p removed significantly less 56 p 0 05 fig 3b in previous studies beq removal efficacies varied from 60 to 85 neale et al 2020b nivala et al 2018 estrogenic activity fig 3c was efficiently removed in all intensified wetlands 99 which was significantly higher than removal observed in va 88 p 0 05 and h50p 77 p 0 05 these high removal efficacies are consistent with previous studies bain et al 2014 lundqvist et al 2019 neale et al 2020b because of masking effects cytotoxicity no eeqs could be derived for vap vsp high removal efficacy for rosiglitazone el indicative for activation of pparγ was observed for the intensified treatment wetlands and the wwtp 91 and to a lesser extent for h50p 76 fig 3d similar removals were also reported in previous studies where beq removal efficacies for rosiglitazone eq ranged from 67 to 99 bain et al 2014 neale et al 2020b with the exception of va the monthly bel removal efficacies for the intensified wetlands did not fluctuate much over the course of the year fig 4 previous experiments on va may have altered the microbial community or reduced the effectiveness of the aeration system resulting in a poorer and more variable system performance boog et al 2018 bel removal for the wwtp was comparable to that of the intensified wetlands except for activation of ahr h50p showed lower and more variable bel removal efficacies for all bioassays especially in the colder months not every observed biological effect in a bioassay results in an environmental or human health risk to distinguish between poor and good water quality recent studies have derived effect based trigger ebt values from the environmental quality standards eqs of the european union water framework directive ebts for surface water have been proposed escher et al 2018a and updated in a more recent study neale et al 2020a but no ebt values currently exist for the treated wastewater except for estrogenicity jarošová et al 2014 the samples for wetland influent wwtpin and h50p mostly showed high beqs that were above the propsed ebts for surface water even though the current ebts apply only to surface waters comparison with the beqs of treated effluents in this study shows the beqs achieved by the treatment systems intensified wetlands and the municipal wwtp were close to or even below the surface water ebts fig 5 indicating that no or very little dilution would be required for the treated effluent to be released to the environment without causing negative environmental effects for activation of ahr oxidative stress response and activation of ppary the effluents from ha hap va vap vap vsp r and the wwtp could be discharged directly to the environment without adversely affecting the receiving water the two stage wetland system vap vsp had the highest removal of biological effects with effluent beqs well below the proposed surface water ebts the exception for all investigated treatment systems wetlands and wwtp was eeq activation of er estrogenic activity where effluent beqs did not fall below the proposed surface water eeq ebt of 0 34 nge2 l a pca was conducted on all data with the intention of exploring the relationship between removal efficacies of conventional pollutants micropollutants and biological effects operational conditions were also used to discriminate the results categorical complementary data the multidimensional dataset of micropollutants and bioassays can be reduced to two dimensions that explain more than 82 of the total variance the first dimension corresponds to micropollutants that were more easily biodegradable under aerobic conditions btz ace ibu dcl npx while the second axis was mainly associated with cbz intensified wetlands significantly reduced a pool of micropollutants that are regarded as biodegradable under aerobic conditions these are grouped together on the left part of the score plot fig 6 a the data points for the intensified wetlands were similarly distributed along the vertical axis regardless of the individual system the ellipse centers of the effluent concentrations of all intensified wetlands and the wwtp were similarly close to each other and the major axes of the ellipses had similar orientations and magnitudes the poor removal of micropollutants and biological effects in h50p were grouped with the influent wastewater sep and wwtpin on the highest values of dimension 1 a second pca was conducted to reduce the dimensionality of the variation in data in order to identify which beqs were associated with the dominant dimensions the first three dimensions explained 73 of the total variance micropollutants that are more easily biodegradable were associated with dimension 1 and fell into two clusters btz dcl ibu and npx were associated with the bioassay for dichlorvos eq caf and ace associated with the bioassay for rosiglitazone eq fig 7 b these associations do not imply a causal relationship it is possible that variables in a cluster were associated simply because they all are sensitive to another common variable for example the difference between these two clusters might be explained by changes in temperature since this parameter was associated with the second dimension the contribution of rosiglitazone eq to dimension 1 was larger 13 5 than the one of dichlorvos eq 11 3 both cbz and b a p eq significantly contributed to dimension 2 28 5 and 43 6 respectively fig 7b fig 7a shows that b a p eq has a large contribution to dimension 3 34 7 as well as cbz 23 3 this does not mean that cbz is activating the ahr but rather that chemicals that activate the ahr are similarly recalcitrant as cbz conclusions seven treatment wetlands and a municipal wwtp were monitored for removal efficacy with respect to conventional wastewater parameters seven indicator micropollutants and five bioassays aerobic conditions as evidenced by high do elevated redox potential and full nitrification in the intensified wetlands promoted biodegradation of most micropollutants and removal of biological effects carbamazepine was not well removed in the intensified wetlands or the wwtp but was somewhat removed in the non aerated wetland h50p which exhibited predominantly anaerobic conditions low do low redox potential very little nitrification the two stage wetland vap vsp had the best overall removal of biological effects often with higher bel removal than the conventional wwtp all intensified treatment wetlands had higher bel removal than h50p thus further demonstrating the advantages of intensified wetland systems no significant differences were observed between the aerated hf and vf systems or between the planted and unplanted pairs indicating that vegetation plays only a small role in the removal capacity of intensified treatment wetlands for indicator micropollutants and selected mixture effects the two stage treatment wetland system vap vsp exhibited the highest and most stable mass removal for conventional wastewater parameters cbod5 toc tn nh4 n e coli annual average 4 7 log10 unit removal micropollutants 94 99 except cbz and biological equivalent loads 91 99 if cost and required footprint play an important role in a wastewater treatment project the aerated wetlands hap and vap are recommended as they also provide high quality effluent bel removal for the intensified treatment wetlands were similar to or higher than those of the municipal wwtp further demonstrating the high treatment capacity of nature based solutions no direct correlation between micropollutants removal and bel removal was found which underlines the importance of the complementary approach where indicator chemicals are a measure of the capacity for biodegradation but the bioassays give an impression on the overall water quality bioassays provide a sum parameter of risk scaled concentrations and are relevant for the overall water quality effect based trigger ebt values have recently been proposed for differentiate good from poor water quality by indicating acceptable risk for complex mixtures in surface waters escher et al 2018a while ebts have so far only been developed for surface water the intensified wetland systems in this study were able to achieve effluent bioequivalent concentrations beqs near to or below three proposed surface water ebts b a p eq dichlorvos eq and rosiglitazone eq indicating an immense potential for the use of enhanced nature based solutions for water treatment and reuse discharge of treated effluent to a receiving surface water would result in a dilution of effects effectively reducing further the beqs future studies should include internal sampling in saturated treatment wetland systems to better understand the spatial dynamics of pollutant and mixture effect removal since aerobic conditions are an important factor in removal of biological effects future studies could try to gain a better understanding of the role of redox potential and removal of biological effects the effect of intermittent or spatially zoned aeration on removal of micropollutants and biological effects could also be investigated availability of data data is available in supplementary material declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

monolithically integrated nanoarray catalysts are more cost saving and efficient than their pellet or powder counterparts because of the high surface area and structural stability tang et al 2017 however the defluorination efficiency is not satisfactory for electrocatalysts reported so far furthermore the effect of the dehalogenation pretreatment on microbial community in the subsequent biochemical treatment unit especially arg expression is poorly understood this work aims at 1 developing an efficient cathode catalyst based on cop for flo dehalogenation through facilely controlling morphology and electronic structure 2 elucidating the mechanism of electrochemical reduction dehalogenation of flo and 3 investigating the effect of dehalogenation products on microbial communities and arg expression for evaluating the practical application potential of the developed catalyst the discovery of the effects of dehalogenation products on microbial inhibition and arg expression would fill a gap in the electrochemical reduction dehalogenation process and provide a better understanding of relationship between the antibacterial activity of dehalogenation products and the emergence of

phosphorization dense nanowires array was vertically grown on the surface of nif fig 1 a the diameter of the wires is about 100 nm fig 1b the selective area electron diffraction saed pattern indicates a poor crystallinity inset in fig 1b the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopic eds elemental mapping demonstrates a homogeneous distribution of co fe and p in the nanowires fig 1c interestingly the nanowires after ultrasonication in water were transformed into nanotubes keeping almost unchanged size fig 1d and 1e and had better crystallinity inset in fig 1e the brighter contrast of elemental distribution at the edge region further confirms the structure of nanotubes fig 1f obviously this study establishes a facile method for large scale production of fe doped cop nanotubes the transformation from nanowires to nanotubes made the specific surface area increase significantly fig 2 a exposing more reaction sites the xrd patterns show more sharp diffraction peaks for phosphide compounds in fe cop nts nif compared to those in fe cop nws nif fig 2b indicative of better crystallinity which is consistent with the saed results fig 1b and 1e in addition the characteristic peak of co hpo3 h2o 030 disappears after ultrasonic treatment therefore the formation of nanotubes from nanowires is probably due to the loss of phosphate compounds and some amorphous compounds companying the crystallinity optimization of phosphide compounds during the ultrasonic process the xps characterization was conducted to further explore the composition of the materials the peaks at 778 5 ev and 793 4 ev for co 2p fig 2c as well as 129 1 ev and 130 1 ev for p 2p3 2 fig 2d are related to the characteristic binding energies for co p in cop zhang et al 2017 the higher intensity of p co bond for fe cop nws than that for cop nws indicated that the fe doping was beneficial to guide the formation of cop after ultrasonication treatment of fe cop nws the obtained fe cop nts showed an enhanced intensity of p co bond due to the exposure of more cop with the loss of phosphate compounds and some amorphous compounds cop was the just species to produce h with reductive dehalogenation activity liu et al 2019 liu and rodriguez 2005 in addition there are no xps peaks of fe p from fep in both fe and p spectra but showing the presence of fe3 at 713 5 and 725 1 ev fig s1 indicative of the formation of fe doped cop lu and zhao 2015 3 2 performance of different electrode for dehalogenation of flo in order to optimize the material with the best performance the effect of fe doping on the flo dehalogenation was investigated fig s2 the optimized ratio of fe co for dehalogenation of flo is fe0 02 co0 98p in both nanowires fe cop nws nif and nanotubes fe cop nts nif the cv test was adapted to further investigate the flo dehalogenation activities of nws with different fe doping content fig s3 the largest reductive current of fe0 02 co0 98p indicated the occurrence of more reduction reactions at the electrode surface unless otherwise noted the fe cop in the text specially refers to fe0 02 co0 98p for systematical investigation on flo dehalogenation the flo dehalogenation performance on various kinds of cathodes were compared fe cop nts nif electrode proceeded much faster flo dehalogenation than the other three electrodes fig 3 a the flo removal efficiencies were 29 6 77 9 and 91 5 for nif pd c nif and fe cop nws nif within 30 min respectively while nearly 100 flo was removed by fe cop nts nif in 20 min the reaction kinetics followed a pseudo first order rate model r2 0 98 the apparent rate constant k for fe cop nts nif is 3 3 5 5 and 20 5 times larger than that for fe cop nws nif pd c nif and nif respectively fig 3b the dehalogenation products of flo at 50 min were identified by hplc tqms analysis fig s4 exhibits the ms spectra with the m z values of the degradation products at the above cathodes five main products were detected for fe cop nws nif and fe cop nts nif namely flo f flo cl flo clf flo 2cl and complete dehalogenation product flo 2clf the extracted chromatograms of flo 2clf and flo 2cl show that the chromatographic peaks for fe cop nts nif are stronger than those for fe cop nws nif fig s5 which means that fe cop nts nif has a stronger catalytic activity to deep dehalogenation four main dehalogenation products were detected for pd c nif namely flo cl flo clf flo 2cl and flo 2clf only low amount of mon dehalogenation related products flo cl or flo f were detected for nif substrate implying its weak dehalogenation activities the released cl and f from flo by fe cop nws nif and fe cop nts nifw were quantitatively analyzed after 50 min dehalogenation fig 3c 3 08 mg l 1 cl and 0 207 mg l 1 f were detected on fe cop nws nif in 50 min in contrast fe cop nts nif has significant cl production 3 81 mg l 1 that close to the theoretical cl content 3 96 mg l 1 for 20 mg l 1 flo and the release ratio of f within 50 min reached 36 8 0 39 mg l 1 the theoretical f content is 1 06 mg l 1 the above results reveal that fe cop nts nif has a superior activity for defluorination or deep dehalogenation the electrochemical properties of fe cop nws nif and fe cop nts nif were studied to illuminate the better electrocatalytic dehalogenation performance of fe cop nts nif the cv test shows that the reduction peak of flo on fe cop nts nif occurred around 0 41 v and 1 16 v with the larger current than that on fe cop nws nif fig 3d the cv curve of fe cop nts nif in background electrolyte was conducted fig s6 the larger current after injecting flo into the background electrolyte further proves the reduction of flo the kinetics of the electrochemical reactions was analyzed by eis fig 3e the cathode electrolyte interface charge transfer resistance can be obtained from the arc of high frequencies table s2 fe cop nts nif shows the lower charge transfer resistance rct 1 877 ω cm 2 and much lower solid electrolyte interface resistance rsei of 0 02 ω cm 2 than those for fe cop nws nif the enhanced electron transfer ability of fe cop nts nif should be ascribed to the larger specific surface area and better crystallinity electrochemical double layer capacitance cdl reflect directly the electrochemical active surface area ecsa of the electrode lukowski et al 2013 the capacitive currents obtained from cv fig s7 were plotted to scan rate as a function fig 3f fe cop nts nif had 1 6 times larger cdl than fe cop nws nif the transformation from nanowires into nanotubes only by a simple sonication process can significantly increase catalytically active sites for dehalogenation 3 3 proposed electrocatalytic dehalogenation pathway and mechanism in the light of the analysis of dehalogenation products the possible dehalogenation pathway of flo by the fe cop nts nif electrode is schemed in fig s8 for electrocatalytic process h can be produced on the cathode surface by direct electrolysis of water which is closely related to the chemical composition morphology and crystal structure of electrocatalysts kong et al 2015 liu et al 2019 compared to the binding energies of metallic co 778 1 778 2 ev and elemental p 130 2 ev the binding energies of 778 5 ev for co 2p3 2 and 129 1 ev for p 2p3 2 indicate that the co and p in the samples are positively and negatively charged respectively probably due to the electron shift from co to p fig 2c and d castle 1984 pu et al 2014 therefore h atoms can be bonded onto the p terminated cop surface at a certain potential zhang et al 2017 the direct reductive mechanism by cathode electron or indirect reduction mechanism by h towards flo dehalogenation at the different cathode was studied the electron spin resonance esr test revealed the existence of only h signals and fe cop nts had a strong ability of generating h fig s9 t buoh as a specific quenching agent of h was used to assess the contribution of atomic h for flo dehalogenation mezyk et al 2004 obviously the flo dehalogenation could be inhibited for all the cathodes in presence of t buoh fig 4 a 4c when increasing t buoh concentration from 0 to 10 0 mm fig 4d and fig s10 the rate of flo removal was decreased by 59 53 and 40 for fe cop nts nif pd c nif and fe cop nws nif respectively directly reflecting the degree of h contribution the higher contribution of h for fe cop nts nif in contrast to fe cop nws nif can be ascribed to the larger specific surface area improved crystal structure and increased amount of phosphide which would expose more active sites and enhance the electric conductivity to promote h generation although the contribution of h for pd c nif is greater than that for fe cop nws nif the flo removal capability is worse this result means that the vertically grown nanowires array are more conducive to active site exposure and mass transport thereby improving the efficiency of the direct reduction process besides the indirect reduction process 3 4 effect of experimental conditions and durability the experimental conditions were optimized for achieving good dehalogenation performance on fe cop nts nif fig 5 the effect of cathode potential on electrocatalytic dehalogenation of flo was investigated in the range from 0 6 to 1 4 v vs ag agcl fig 5a the removal efficiency of flo was increased from 0 6 to 1 2 v and nearly 100 flo was removed within 20 min at 1 2 v obviously higher cathode potentials can offer more electrons and favor h generation enhancing the dehalogenation performance by both direct and indirect reduction pathway mao et al 2016 however when applying cathode potentials to 1 4 v flo removal efficiency decreased because h2 evolution may be dominant at more negative potential which is against atom h generation for dehalogenation mao et al 2019 the ph has little influence in flo dehalogenation at fe cop nts nif in a wide ph range from 2 82 to 11 06 fig 5b in addition the flo could be removed within 30 min when the initial flo concentration changed from 1 to 50 mg l 1 fig 5c indicative of sufficient active sites for reactions furthermore the fe cop nts nif electrode retained a very stable flo removal efficiency after experiencing five cycles fig 5d the overall loss of fe co and ni is in the ppb range fig s11 which is far below their emission standard gb25467 2010 the xps spectra indicated that the fe cop nts after five cycles still remained catalytically active cop species fig s12 these results demonstrate that the fe cop nts nif electrode has a great potential of practical application for electrocatalytic reduction dehalogenation 3 5 effect of dehalogenation pretreatment on antibacterial activity and biodegradation efficiency the antibacterial activity assay was performed using e coli dh5α fig 6 a e coli was almost completely suppressed within 12 h at the presence of 20 mg l 1 flo while the growth of e coli in 50 min dehalogenation product solution suffered no hurt as the same as in blank without flo this result proves that the fe cop nts nif cathode dehalogenation for 50 min can effectively eliminate the antibacterial activity of flo to determine the minimum inhibition concentrations the disk agar diffusion susceptibility was tested to further verify the effect of the pretreatment of flo on e coli the agar plate photographs demonstrate that the inhibition zone was significantly reduced even after only 10 min dehalogenation pretreatment fig s13 to explore the effect of dehalogenation pretreatment on the subsequent biodegradation process the inhibition tests of anaerobic and aerobic process were performed by assessing the cod removal the flo untreated significantly inhibited the biodegradation ability in anaerobic process fig 6b when flo solution was pretreated for 50 min its inhibition was effectively eliminated and the cod consumption was equivalent to that in the blank control group in contrast the inhibitory effect of flo on the aerobic process is not obvious but it is still reduced to a certain extent after pretreatment fig 6c 3 6 effects of dehalogenation pretreatment on microbial community the effect of dehalogenation pretreatment on the microbial community in anaerobic digestion and aerobic process was explored by high throughput sequencing from the phylum assignment results in the anaerobic microbial communities fig 7 a proteobacteria was dominant of blank group b with the average relative abundance of 44 73 other abundant phyla with content 2 in the blank group communities included bacteroidetes 22 76 chloroflexi 6 17 firmicutes 6 28 patescibacteria 15 52 and desulfobacterota 2 02 the species richness of the pretreated group pre was similar to b and much higher than that of the untreated group un the presence of flo in wastewater remarkably inhibited the abundance and diversity of microorganisms in the anaerobic microbial community the quantity of phyla with content 2 was reduced from 6 to 2 this result suggests that flo could reshape the microbial community structure in anaerobic process except for firmicutes and proteobacteria most bacterial phyla were decreased sharply and eventually disappeared due to flo residue in addition the proteobacteria and firmicutes contents increased significantly from 44 73 to 84 91 and from 6 28 to 11 22 respectively for the aerobic processes although the inhibitory effect was not obvious fig 6b the microbial community changed significantly fig 7b most bacterial phyla were also declined rapidly and eventually vanished at the presence of flo in aerobic process however the content of dominant proteobacteria remarkably increased from 41 31 to 76 53 firmicutes content also increased from 0 78 to 5 29 these results mean that proteobacteria and firmicutes might be more resistant to flo pressure obviously the dehalogenation pretreatment can effectively eliminate the influence of flo on the diversity of microbial community to gain an insight into the influence of dehalogenation pretreatment on the microbial community structure in sludge samples the sequences of the bacterial communities in anaerobic and aerobic process were analyzed at genus level for the anaerobic digestion process fig 7c the abundance of brucella pseudomonas and thermomanas increased significantly under flo pressure while aeromonas brachymonas and o candidatus nomurabacteria were dominant genera for the pretreatment and blank group for the aerobic process fig 7d thauera is a dominant genus in both the pretreatment group and the blank group and the abundance does not change significantly under flo pressure thauera is an important genus for the biological treatment of organic wastewater due to its metabolic versatility guo et al 2019a guo et al 2019b after being stimulated by untreated flo the relative abundance of pseudoxanthomonas is greatly increased the inhibitory effect of flo on the degradation efficiency of aerobic process is not obvious probably due to the insignificant toxic effect of flo on thaurea in the aerobic system 3 7 effects of pretreatment on flor in biodegradation systems to clarify the fate of flo arg flor during the anaerobic and aerobic process the expression of flor was quantified for the anaerobic digestion process fig 7e flor expression is obvious under the untreated flo pressure with a relative abundance of 0 45 which is much higher than that of the blank and pretreated group for the aerobic process fig 7f the abundance of flor expression under untreated flo pressure is 0 058 which is relatively lower than that in anaerobic condition but the relative abundance of flor is also significantly reduced compared with pretreated and blank group the correlation of the top 10 bacterial phyla or genera with flor and flo content was analyzed to identify the potential hosts carrying flor fig s14 shows the relevance with the phylum proteobacteria was positively correlated with the relative abundance of flor in both anaerobic r 0 4833 and aerobic r 0 7 p 0 01 sludge communities indicating that proteobacteria was the main potential host of flor gene brucella was the primary genera belonging to proteobacteria and dominant in anaerobic untreated group showing a highly significant correlation with flor content r 0 80335 p 0 01 fig s15a moreno et al 2002 furthermore there is an extremely significant correlation between thermomonas and flor in the anaerobic untreated group r 0 916667 p 0 001 for the aerobic process fig s15b the only genus that had significant relevance with flor content was thauera r 0 7 p 0 05 belonging to proteobacteria indicating that thauera had a resistance to the selective pressure from flo as a result flo showed a tiny inhibition effect on aerobic processes in addition flo had a similar correlation with flor to microbial communities implying that flo would cause selective pressure on hosts carrying flor and the dehalogenation pretreatment process could effectively control the screening of hosts carrying flor in any case the dehalogenation pretreatment by fe cop nts nif can reduce the toxicity of flo to sludge microorganisms and prevent the emergence of the closely related args therefore the combination of electrocatalytic reductive dehalogenation with biochemical process is an effective way to inhibit the expression of args and guarantee the high efficiency for the treatment of halogenated antibiotic containing wastewater 4 conclusion a highly effective dehalogenation electrocatalyst of fe cop nts nif cathode has been developed the regulation of morphology and crystallinity of catalyst can be facilely achieved the unique nanotube array architecture and improved crystallinity endow the catalyst with a superior electrocatalytic capacity for deep dehalogenation of halogenated antibiotics reaching the best electrocatalytic dehalogenation performance reported so far in situ growth of fe cop on nif substrate enables the working electrode to have an outstanding durability this study implies that the reduction dehalogenation pretreatment can effectively eliminate the antibacterial activity and guarantee microbial richness and diversity resulting in enhanced treatment performance and stability in subsequent biological treatment unit moreover the reduction dehalogenation pretreatment can extremely decrease the probability of args proliferation in the treatment process of antibiotic wastewater this work provides a large scale production and highly practical application of electrocatalyst for dehalogenation of halogenated antibiotics and proves that electrocatalytic reductive dehalogenation is an efficient and reliable way to reduce args expression and guarantee

antibiotics exacerbate the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance genes args van boeckel et al 2015 the primary method currently applied for wastewater treatment is biological approach li et al 2021 ma et al 2020 antibiotics in wastewater will severely inhibit the growth of bacterial and cause the deterioration of microbial community functions in addition antibiotic selective pressure makes biological treatment processes based on the control of microbial proliferation and metabolism inevitably aggravate the contamination of args leading to serious health risk to human beings rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 su et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 how to improve the efficiency of antibiotic detoxification degradation and effectively block the spread of args is a major scientific and technological issue in the environmental field florfenicol flo as a refractory broad spectrum chloramphenicol antibiotic has become one of the five most used antibiotics in china and is widely used in animal husbandry cabello et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 due to its inhibition of peptidyl transferase activity in bacterial protein synthesis flo is effective against gram positive and gram negative bacteria christensen et al 2006 traditional biochemical treatment process is difficult to remove flo leading to potential threat of resistance gene emergence mitchell et al 2013 oberoi et al 2019 pham et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 therefore eliminating its antibacterial activity is necessary before biochemical treatment various treatment techniques including zero valent iron reduction electro fenton oxidation and uv advanced oxidation have been investigated for the removal of flo from water cao et al 2017 ding et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 the electrochemical treatment process is attracted due to low maintenance requirement high efficiency and minimization of secondary pollution especially electrochemical reductive approach can achieve dehalogenation effectively ma et al 2019 liu et al 2019 yang et al 2021 direct cathode electron reduction and indirect atomic hydrogen h reduction are normally recognized as the dehalogenation mechanism li and farrell 2000 mao et al 2019 cathode materials play a pivotal role in h production lee et al 2013 considering it from a practical point of view non noble metals can serve as cathode materials candidate to generate h by activating protons or water molecules liu and rodriguez 2005 zhang et al 2017 besides the intrinsic catalytic capacity materials macro microstructure is important for heterogeneous catalysis chng et al 2013 wang et al 2013 monolithically integrated nanoarray catalysts are more cost saving and efficient than their pellet or powder counterparts because of the high surface area and structural stability tang et al 2017 however the defluorination efficiency is not satisfactory for electrocatalysts reported so far furthermore the effect of the dehalogenation pretreatment on microbial community in the subsequent biochemical treatment unit especially arg expression is poorly understood this work aims at 1 developing an efficient cathode catalyst based on cop for flo dehalogenation through facilely controlling

phosphorization dense nanowires array was vertically grown on the surface of nif fig 1 a the diameter of the wires is about 100 nm fig 1b the selective area electron diffraction saed pattern indicates a poor crystallinity inset in fig 1b the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopic eds elemental mapping demonstrates a homogeneous distribution of co fe and p in the nanowires fig 1c interestingly the nanowires after ultrasonication in water were transformed into nanotubes keeping almost unchanged size fig 1d and 1e and had better crystallinity inset in fig 1e the brighter contrast of elemental distribution at the edge region further confirms the structure of nanotubes fig 1f obviously this study establishes a facile method for large scale production of fe doped cop nanotubes the transformation from nanowires to nanotubes made the specific surface area increase significantly fig 2 a exposing more reaction sites the xrd patterns show more sharp diffraction peaks for phosphide compounds in fe cop nts nif compared to those in fe cop nws nif fig 2b indicative of better crystallinity which is consistent with the saed results fig 1b and 1e in addition the characteristic peak of co hpo3 h2o 030 disappears after ultrasonic treatment therefore the formation of nanotubes from nanowires is probably due to the loss of phosphate compounds and some amorphous compounds companying the crystallinity optimization of phosphide compounds during the ultrasonic process the xps characterization was conducted to further explore the composition of the materials the peaks at 778 5 ev and 793 4 ev for co 2p fig 2c as well as 129 1 ev and 130 1 ev for p 2p3 2 fig 2d are related to the characteristic binding energies for co p in cop zhang et al 2017 the higher intensity of p co bond for fe cop nws than that for cop nws indicated that the fe doping was beneficial to guide the formation of cop after ultrasonication treatment of fe cop nws the obtained fe cop nts showed an enhanced intensity of p co bond due to the exposure of more cop with the loss of phosphate compounds and some amorphous compounds cop was the just species to produce h with reductive dehalogenation activity liu et al 2019 liu and rodriguez 2005 in addition there are no xps peaks of fe p from fep in both fe and p spectra but showing the presence of fe3 at 713 5 and 725 1 ev fig s1 indicative of the formation of fe doped cop lu and zhao 2015 3 2 performance of different electrode for dehalogenation of flo in order to optimize the material with the best performance the effect of fe doping on the flo dehalogenation was investigated fig s2 the optimized ratio of fe co for dehalogenation of flo is fe0 02 co0 98p in both nanowires fe cop nws nif and nanotubes fe cop nts nif the cv test was adapted to further investigate the flo dehalogenation activities of nws with different fe doping content fig s3 the largest reductive current of fe0 02 co0 98p indicated the occurrence of more reduction reactions at the electrode surface unless otherwise noted the fe cop in the text specially refers to fe0 02 co0 98p for systematical investigation on flo dehalogenation the flo dehalogenation performance on various kinds of cathodes were compared fe cop nts nif electrode proceeded much faster flo dehalogenation than the other three electrodes fig 3 a the flo removal efficiencies were 29 6 77 9 and 91 5 for nif pd c nif and fe cop nws nif within 30 min respectively while nearly 100 flo was removed by fe cop nts nif in 20 min the reaction kinetics followed a pseudo first order rate model r2 0 98 the apparent rate constant k for fe cop nts nif is 3 3 5 5 and 20 5 times larger than that for fe cop nws nif pd c nif and nif respectively fig 3b the dehalogenation products of flo at 50 min were identified by hplc tqms analysis fig s4 exhibits the ms spectra with the m z values of the degradation products at the above cathodes five main products were detected for fe cop nws nif and fe cop nts nif namely flo f flo cl flo clf flo 2cl and complete dehalogenation product flo 2clf the extracted chromatograms of flo 2clf and flo 2cl show that the chromatographic peaks for fe cop nts nif are stronger than those for fe cop nws nif fig s5 which means that fe cop nts nif has a stronger catalytic activity to deep dehalogenation four main dehalogenation products were detected for pd c nif namely flo cl flo clf flo 2cl and flo 2clf only low amount of mon dehalogenation related products flo cl or flo f were detected for nif substrate implying its weak dehalogenation activities the released cl and f from flo by fe cop nws nif and fe cop nts nifw were quantitatively analyzed after 50 min dehalogenation fig 3c 3 08 mg l 1 cl and 0 207 mg l 1 f were detected on fe cop nws nif in 50 min in contrast fe cop nts nif has significant cl production 3 81 mg l 1 that close to the theoretical cl content 3 96 mg l 1 for 20 mg l 1 flo and the release ratio of f within 50 min reached 36 8 0 39 mg l 1 the theoretical f content is 1 06 mg l 1 the above results reveal that fe cop nts nif has a superior activity for defluorination or deep dehalogenation the electrochemical properties of fe cop nws nif and fe cop nts nif were studied to illuminate the better electrocatalytic dehalogenation performance of fe cop nts nif the cv test shows that the reduction peak of flo on fe cop nts nif occurred around 0 41 v and 1 16 v with the larger current than that on fe cop nws nif fig 3d the cv curve of fe cop nts nif in background electrolyte was conducted fig s6 the larger current after injecting flo into the background electrolyte further proves the reduction of flo the kinetics of the electrochemical reactions was analyzed by eis fig 3e the cathode electrolyte interface charge transfer resistance can be obtained from the arc of high frequencies table s2 fe cop nts nif shows the lower charge transfer resistance rct 1 877 ω cm 2 and much lower solid electrolyte interface resistance rsei of 0 02 ω cm 2 than those for fe cop nws nif the enhanced electron transfer ability of fe cop nts nif should be ascribed to the larger specific surface area and better crystallinity electrochemical double layer capacitance cdl reflect directly the electrochemical active surface area ecsa of the electrode lukowski et al 2013 the capacitive currents obtained from cv fig s7 were plotted to scan rate as a function fig 3f fe cop nts nif had 1 6 times larger cdl than fe cop nws nif the transformation from nanowires into nanotubes only by a simple sonication process can significantly increase catalytically active sites for dehalogenation 3 3 proposed electrocatalytic dehalogenation pathway and mechanism in the light of the analysis of dehalogenation products the possible dehalogenation pathway of flo by the fe cop nts nif electrode is schemed in fig s8 for electrocatalytic process h can be produced on the cathode surface by direct electrolysis of water which is closely related to the chemical composition morphology and crystal structure of electrocatalysts kong et al 2015 liu et al 2019 compared to the binding energies of metallic co 778 1 778 2 ev and elemental p 130 2 ev the binding energies of 778 5 ev for co 2p3 2 and 129 1 ev for p 2p3 2 indicate that the co and p in the samples are positively and negatively charged respectively probably due to the electron shift from co to p fig 2c and d castle 1984 pu et al 2014 therefore h atoms can be bonded onto the p terminated cop surface at a certain potential zhang et al 2017 the direct reductive mechanism by cathode electron or indirect reduction mechanism by h towards flo dehalogenation at the different cathode was studied the electron spin resonance esr test revealed the existence of only h signals and fe cop nts had a strong ability of generating h fig s9 t buoh as a specific quenching agent of h was used to assess the contribution of atomic h for flo dehalogenation mezyk et al 2004 obviously the flo dehalogenation could be inhibited for all the cathodes in presence of t buoh fig 4 a 4c when increasing t buoh concentration from 0 to 10 0 mm fig 4d and fig s10 the rate of flo removal was decreased by 59 53 and 40 for fe cop nts nif pd c nif and fe cop nws nif respectively directly reflecting the degree of h contribution the higher contribution of h for fe cop nts nif in contrast to fe cop nws nif can be ascribed to the larger specific surface area improved crystal structure and increased amount of phosphide which would expose more active sites and enhance the electric conductivity to promote h generation although the contribution of h for pd c nif is greater than that for fe cop nws nif the flo removal capability is worse this result means that the vertically grown nanowires array are more conducive to active site exposure and mass transport thereby improving the efficiency of the direct reduction process besides the indirect reduction process 3 4 effect of experimental conditions and durability the experimental conditions were optimized for achieving good dehalogenation performance on fe cop nts nif fig 5 the effect of cathode potential on electrocatalytic dehalogenation of flo was investigated in the range from 0 6 to 1 4 v vs ag agcl fig 5a the removal efficiency of flo was increased from 0 6 to 1 2 v and nearly 100 flo was removed within 20 min at 1 2 v obviously higher cathode potentials can offer more electrons and favor h generation enhancing the dehalogenation performance by both direct and indirect reduction pathway mao et al 2016 however when applying cathode potentials to 1 4 v flo removal efficiency decreased because h2 evolution may be dominant at more negative potential which is against atom h generation for dehalogenation mao et al 2019 the ph has little influence in flo dehalogenation at fe cop nts nif in a wide ph range from 2 82 to 11 06 fig 5b in addition the flo could be removed within 30 min when the initial flo concentration changed from 1 to 50 mg l 1 fig 5c indicative of sufficient active sites for reactions furthermore the fe cop nts nif electrode retained a very stable flo removal efficiency after experiencing five cycles fig 5d the overall loss of fe co and ni is in the ppb range fig s11 which is far below their emission standard gb25467 2010 the xps spectra indicated that the fe cop nts after five cycles still remained catalytically active cop species fig s12 these results demonstrate that the fe cop nts nif electrode has a great potential of practical application for electrocatalytic reduction dehalogenation 3 5 effect of dehalogenation pretreatment on antibacterial activity and biodegradation efficiency the antibacterial activity assay was performed using e coli dh5α fig 6 a e coli was almost completely suppressed within 12 h at the presence of 20 mg l 1 flo while the growth of e coli in 50 min dehalogenation product solution suffered no hurt as the same as in blank without flo this result proves that the fe cop nts nif cathode dehalogenation for 50 min can effectively eliminate the antibacterial activity of flo to determine the minimum inhibition concentrations the disk agar diffusion susceptibility was tested to further verify the effect of the pretreatment of flo on e coli the agar plate photographs demonstrate that the inhibition zone was significantly reduced even after only 10 min dehalogenation pretreatment fig s13 to explore the effect of dehalogenation pretreatment on the subsequent biodegradation process the inhibition tests of anaerobic and aerobic process were performed by assessing the cod removal the flo untreated significantly inhibited the biodegradation ability in anaerobic process fig 6b when flo solution was pretreated for 50 min its inhibition was effectively eliminated and the cod consumption was equivalent to that in the blank control group in contrast the inhibitory effect of flo on the aerobic process is not obvious but it is still reduced to a certain extent after pretreatment fig 6c 3 6 effects of dehalogenation pretreatment on microbial community the effect of dehalogenation pretreatment on the microbial community in anaerobic digestion and aerobic process was explored by high throughput sequencing from the phylum assignment results in the anaerobic microbial communities fig 7 a proteobacteria was dominant of blank group b with the average relative abundance of 44 73 other abundant phyla with content 2 in the blank group communities included bacteroidetes 22 76 chloroflexi 6 17 firmicutes 6 28 patescibacteria 15 52 and desulfobacterota 2 02 the species richness of the pretreated group pre was similar to b and much higher than that of the untreated group un the presence of flo in wastewater remarkably inhibited the abundance and diversity of microorganisms in the anaerobic microbial community the quantity of phyla with content 2 was reduced from 6 to 2 this result suggests that flo could reshape the microbial community structure in anaerobic process except for firmicutes and proteobacteria most bacterial phyla were decreased sharply and eventually disappeared due to flo residue in addition the proteobacteria and firmicutes contents increased significantly from 44 73 to 84 91 and from 6 28 to 11 22 respectively for the aerobic processes although the inhibitory effect was not obvious fig 6b the microbial community changed significantly fig 7b most bacterial phyla were also declined rapidly and eventually vanished at the presence of flo in aerobic process however the content of dominant proteobacteria remarkably increased from 41 31 to 76 53 firmicutes content also increased from 0 78 to 5 29 these results mean that proteobacteria and firmicutes might be more resistant to flo pressure obviously the dehalogenation pretreatment can effectively eliminate the influence of flo on the diversity of microbial community to gain an insight into the influence of dehalogenation pretreatment on the microbial community structure in sludge samples the sequences of the bacterial communities in anaerobic and aerobic process were analyzed at genus level for the anaerobic digestion process fig 7c the abundance of brucella pseudomonas and thermomanas increased significantly under flo pressure while aeromonas brachymonas and o candidatus nomurabacteria were dominant genera for the pretreatment and blank group for the aerobic process fig 7d thauera is a dominant genus in both the pretreatment group and the blank group and the abundance does not change significantly under flo pressure thauera is an important genus for the biological treatment of organic wastewater due to its metabolic versatility guo et al 2019a guo et al 2019b after being stimulated by untreated flo the relative abundance of pseudoxanthomonas is greatly increased the inhibitory effect of flo on the degradation efficiency of aerobic process is not obvious probably due to the insignificant toxic effect of flo on thaurea in the aerobic system 3 7 effects of pretreatment on flor in biodegradation systems to clarify the fate of flo arg flor during the anaerobic and aerobic process the expression of flor was quantified for the anaerobic digestion process fig 7e flor expression is obvious under the untreated flo pressure with a relative abundance of 0 45 which is much higher than that of the blank and pretreated group for the aerobic process fig 7f the abundance of flor expression under untreated flo pressure is 0 058 which is relatively lower than that in anaerobic condition but the relative abundance of flor is also significantly reduced compared with pretreated and blank group the correlation of the top 10 bacterial phyla or genera with flor and flo content was analyzed to identify the potential hosts carrying flor fig s14 shows the relevance with the phylum proteobacteria was positively correlated with the relative abundance of flor in both anaerobic r 0 4833 and aerobic r 0 7 p 0 01 sludge communities indicating that proteobacteria was the main potential host of flor gene brucella was the primary genera belonging to proteobacteria and dominant in anaerobic untreated group showing a highly significant correlation with flor content r 0 80335 p 0 01 fig s15a moreno et al 2002 furthermore there is an extremely significant correlation between thermomonas and flor in the anaerobic untreated group r 0 916667 p 0 001 for the aerobic process fig s15b the only genus that had significant relevance with flor content was thauera r 0 7 p 0 05 belonging to proteobacteria indicating that thauera had a resistance to the selective pressure from flo as a result flo showed a tiny inhibition effect on aerobic processes in addition flo had a similar correlation with flor to microbial communities implying that flo would cause selective pressure on hosts carrying flor and the dehalogenation pretreatment process could effectively control the screening of hosts carrying flor in any case the dehalogenation pretreatment by fe cop nts nif can reduce the toxicity of flo to sludge microorganisms and prevent the emergence of the closely related args therefore the combination of electrocatalytic reductive dehalogenation with biochemical process is an effective way to inhibit the expression of args and guarantee the high efficiency for the treatment of halogenated antibiotic containing wastewater 4 conclusion a highly effective dehalogenation electrocatalyst of fe cop nts nif cathode has been developed the regulation of morphology and crystallinity of catalyst can be facilely achieved the unique nanotube array architecture and improved crystallinity endow the catalyst with a superior electrocatalytic capacity for deep dehalogenation of halogenated antibiotics reaching the best electrocatalytic dehalogenation performance reported so far in situ growth of fe cop on nif substrate enables the working electrode to have an outstanding durability this study implies that the reduction dehalogenation pretreatment can effectively eliminate the antibacterial activity and guarantee microbial richness and diversity resulting in enhanced treatment performance and stability in subsequent biological treatment unit moreover the reduction dehalogenation pretreatment can extremely decrease the probability of args proliferation in the treatment process of antibiotic wastewater this work provides a large scale production and highly practical application of electrocatalyst for dehalogenation of halogenated antibiotics and proves that electrocatalytic reductive dehalogenation is an efficient and reliable way to reduce args expression and guarantee

16877,sulfidated nanoscale zerovalent iron s nzvi is a promising reductant for trichloroethylene in groundwater yet a comprehensive understanding of its degradation efficiency for other chlorinated hydrocarbons chcs is lacking in this study we assessed the benefits of using s nzvi for the degradation of two chlorinated methanes three chlorinated ethanes and four chlorinated ethenes compared to unamended nzvi by analyzing the degradation rate constants the maximum degradation quantity and the degradation pathways and products under both stoichiometrically electron excess and limited conditions the improvement in rate constants induced by sulfidation was compound specific and was more significant for chlorinated ethenes 57 707 folds than for the other chcs 1 0 17 folds this is likely because of the different reduction mechanisms of each chc and sulfidation may favor specific mechanisms associated with the reduction of chlorinated ethenes more than the others sulfidation of nzvi enabled either higher 3 1 24 4 folds or comparable 0 78 0 91 maximum degradation quantity assessed under electron limited conditions for all the chcs investigated indicating the promise of s nzvi for remediation of groundwater contaminated by chc mixtures furthermore we proposed the degradation pathways of various chcs based on the observed degradation intermediates and products and found that sulfidation suppressed the generation of partially dechlorinated products particularly for chlorinated methanes and ethanes and favor degradation pathways leading to the non chlorinated benign products this is the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of sulfidation in improving the degradation of a suite of chcs and the results provide valuable insight to the assessment of applicability and benefits of s nzvi for chc remediation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfidation nanoscale zerovalent iron chlorinated hydrocarbons groundwater remediation reduction pathways 1 introduction c1 and c2 chlorinated hydrocarbons chcs are common groundwater contaminants included in the u s epa priority pollutant list u s epa 1979 micro and nanoscale zerovalent iron n zvi have been proposed as promising and cost effective reducing agents for in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater kueper et al 2014 degradation of various chcs by zvi was comprehensively investigated in early papers gillham and ohannesin 1994 scherer et al 1998 nzvi was first synthesized in 1998 zhang et al 1998 and was subsequently used to treat various contaminants as reviewed elsewhere he et al 2015 mukherjee et al 2016 zou et al 2016 however poor selectivity of n zvi towards target contaminants e g trichloroethylene tce has halted more widespread acceptance of n zvi as a full scale in situ remediation technology fan et al 2016 it is well recognized that n zvi functionalized with sulfur s n zvi irrespective of the synthesis methods e g one or two step aqueous synthesis ball milling and sulfur source na2s2o4 na2s2o3 na2s and elemental s possesses superior reactivity to tce compared to unamended n zvi as reviewed elsewhere fan et al 2017 li et al 2017 recent studies have focused on facile synthesis of highly reactive s n zvi and how fe and s precursors affect their reactivity mostly using tce as the target contaminant brumovský et al 2020 cai et al 2021 xu et al 2020a the focus on tce is likely due to its frequent presence in contaminated groundwater however various c1 and c2 chcs are often encountered together at contaminated sites because of co disposal or biodegradation of one chc to another mccarty 2010 but investigations on the degradation of chcs other than tce by s n zvi are limited there are only a few studies with carbon tetrachloride ct han and yan 2016 gu et al 2017 jin et al 2018 nezamabadi 2016 chloroform cf nezamabadi 2016 1 1 1 trichloroethane 1 1 1 tca nezamabadi 2016 1 2 dichloroethane 1 2 dca nunez garcia et al 2016 perchloroethylene pce islam et al 2020 and cis 1 2 dichloroethylene cis dce islam et al 2020 mangayayam et al 2019 both enhanced and suppressed degradation caused by sulfidation was reported for ct han and yan 2016 gu et al 2017 jin et al 2018 nezamabadi 2016 and cis dce islam et al 2020 mangayayam et al 2019 and the extent of improvement in the degradation of the other chcs appears to be lower than that for tce the results of those studies indicate that the superior reactivity of s n zvi for tce obtained from various synthesis methods may not hold for other chcs thus more comprehensive studies on the degradation of a broader range of commonly detected chcs in groundwater by s n zvi are required towards an improved understanding of the effect of sulfidation and its efficacy for site remediation the mechanisms by which sulfidation leads to improved contaminant degradation are mostly derived from studies on tce sulfidation has been proposed to enhance the electron conductivity gu et al 2017 kim et al 2011 he et al 2018 xu et al 2019a 2020b and the surface hydrophobicity xu et al 2019b 2020b of n zvi and to poison the recombination of reactive atomic hydrogen species h to generate h2 han and yan 2016 although these mechanisms individually explain the sulfidation induced phenomena associated with the degradation of tce their applicability to other chcs is unclear for example han and yan 2016 indicated that the enhanced electron conductivity cannot explain the absence of improvement in the reactivity of ct a compound known to be degraded by direct electron transfer li and farrell 2000 it is likely that the change in reactivity with sulfidation depends on specific reduction mechanisms associated with each chc specific chc surface interactions or a combination of such factors a thorough understanding of the mechanisms responsible for changes in reactivity with sulfidation also requires comprehensive comparisons on the degradation of various chcs previous studies were mostly conducted under stoichiometrically electron excess conditions which is representative of conditions for remediation of dissolved chcs in contaminant plumes very few studies have investigated degradation under electron limited conditions which is representative of remediation in source zone regions with chc non aqueous phase liquids napls gu et al 2017 he et al 2018 xu et al 2019a bhattacharjee and ghoshal 2016 2018 napls account for the major mass fraction of chcs present at contaminated sites and serve as a long term source of chcs in groundwater kueper et al 2014 more importantly the assessment on the degradation performance has been largely focused on the decay of parent compounds i e the reactivity yet from a remediation point of view the degradation efficiency of s n zvi consists of several other aspects including electron utilization efficiency he et al 2020 maximum contaminant degradation extent and product formation the electron utilization and degradation extent are particularly pertinent under conditions with limited supply of electrons which requires systematic investigations to evaluate the performance of s n zvi with napl chcs besides it is known that the reduction of ct cf and 1 1 1 tca by fe based particles generates partially dechlorinated products e g dichloromethane dcm 1 1 dichloroethane 1 1 dca nezamabadi 2016 elsner and hofstetter 2011 which are often more persistent and or toxic than the parent compounds jordan et al 2021 strategies have been proposed and developed to suppress the generation of these problematic products during reduction elsner and hofstetter 2011 yin et al 2017 which require insight into degradation pathways and reactive intermediates it is unclear how sulfidation would affect the reduction pathways of chcs other than tce and the generation of partially dechlorinated products in this study we compared the degradation efficiency of nine chcs including two chlorinated methanes three chlorinated ethanes and four chlorinated ethenes by nzvi and s nzvi only nanosized particles were used under both stoichiometrically electron excess and limited conditions the degradation efficiency was characterized through several parameters including degradation rate constants electron utilization maximum degradation quantity and product formation to provide a holistic assessment on the benefits of using s nzvi compared to nzvi the results show that sulfidation particularly increased the rate constants of chlorinated ethenes more than the other chcs and resulted in comparable or highly improved degradation extent for all the chcs investigated by analyzing the reaction pathways and products we found that the benefits of sulfidation also include promoting the generation of non chlorinated benign products to our knowledge this is the first comprehensive study that systematically investigates the degradation performance of s nzvi to a variety of chcs 2 materials and methods 2

fe molar ratio of 0 05 was synthesized by the one step method using na2s according to the procedures reported previously bhattacharjee and ghoshal 2018 and the final ratio in the nanoparticle was also

shown in table s3 and fig s1 respectively the anaerobic degradation of the nine chcs by nzvi s nzvi and pd nzvi were tested individually under both electron excess 1 36 mmol g nanoparticle and limited conditions 33 9 mmol g with details provided in sm 3 the h2 parent chcs and degradation products were monitored and the analytical methods are provided in sm 3 it should be noted that we determined the stoichiometric conditions based on the initial electrons in the nanoparticles e 0 mmol g which were 47 2 mmol g for nzvi 36 3 mmol g for s nzvi and 41 7 mmol g for pd nzvi instead of fe0 and the reasons are explained in sm 2 2 2 data analysis the amount of chcs m t mmol g and degradation products pi t mmol g i is the specific product at reaction time t were reported relative to the initial mass of nanoparticles they were quantified by analyzing the headspace and calibrating against the respective pure standard prepared in a setup identical to the degradation system without nanoparticles some products were quantified by diluted gas standards using henry s law coefficients table s4 under electron limited conditions the quantity of chcs in the headspace cannot indicate the total amount in the degradation system because the concentration of chcs used were close to or beyond their water solubility where henry s law does not apply thus the m t was calculated from the initial added parent chcs m 0 mmol g and the amount of degradation products formed according to eq 1 1 m t m 0 d t 2 d t i d i t i n i p i t where d t mmol g is the total quantity of chc that has been degraded at reaction time t h di t mmol g is the quantity of chc degraded to product i and ni is the moles of parent chc it consumes to form one mole of product i the maximum quantity of chc degraded at the end of the reaction is referred to as d max mmol g the electron utilization by chc ε chc and h2o ε h 2 o and the percentage of unreacted electrons ε r in the degradation residue were calculated according to eq s1 s3 in sm 4 the kinetics of the degradation was described by both the observed first order rate constant k obs h 1 using the data from the entire reaction course according to eq 3 which assumes that the rate to reach equilibrium m e mmol g or depletion of the target compound is proportional to the distance from the equilibrium 3 m t m e m 0 m e exp k obs t and the pseudo first order rate constant k1 h 1 using the ln m t m 0 from the initial linear range according to eq 4 4 ln m t m 0 k 1 t based on the deficit in the mass balance of carbon fig s2 and electrons fig s4 we inferred there exist some unknown and undetected products for the degradation of ct cf 1 1 1 tca and 1 1 dca sm 5 their presence was also verified by a lower dechlorination extent accounted for by the detectable products than that indicated by the released chloride table s6 for the sake of more accurate assessment on the degradation efficiency we proposed the possible identity of the undetected products and estimated their quantity and the procedures are provided in sm 6 in this study all the degradation efficiency parameters including k 1 k obs ε chc d max and e chc have accounted for these hypothesized undetected products the spss23 ibm was used for statistical analysis at a significance level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 overview on the degradation of chcs by nzvi and s nzvi the reactivity of nzvi and s nzvi for different chcs varied significantly and sulfidation improved their degradation to very different extents under electron excess conditions nzvi rapidly depleted ct in 2 h but reacted with 1 1 1 tca and cf more slowly with a degradation extent of 86 6 in 120 h and 45 8 in 191 h respectively fig s6 nzvi was almost inert to 1 1 2 tca and we barely observed degradation of 1 1 dca and the four chlorinated ethenes pce tce cis dce and trans dce with nzvi in comparison s nzvi depleted ct cf 1 1 1 tca tce and trans dce in 0 83 250 h whereas the degradation extent of the others 1 1 2 tca 1 1 dca pce cis dce was 5 7 51 2 in 300 h fig 1 under electron limited conditions m 0 33 9 mmol g chcs cannot be fully depleted by either nzvi or s nzvi as expected but some reached equilibrium sooner than the others with significantly varying degradation extents fig s7 and s8 for example the degradation extent of ct by nzvi reached 64 8 in 5 h whereas it was only 0 08 2 8 for the four chlorinated ethenes in 600 h sulfidation increased the degradation extent of chlorinated ethenes to 2 0 22 3 but did not improve that of ct and cf besides reactivity we note that even when the parent chcs were eliminated they were not fully dechlorinated particularly the chlorinated methanes and ethanes but generated partially chlorinated products such as dcm and 1 1 dca and sulfidation appeared to reduce their formation vide infra the other important aspect is the passivation of nanoparticles over the reaction course and eventually how many electrons in the nanoparticles are used to eliminate cl in chcs which refers to not only the selectivity of electrons for chcs over h2o but also the usage of electrons towards more efficient dechlorination pathways to form non chlorinated benign products thus to comprehensively assess the degradation efficiency of s nzvi for various chcs and to address the benefits of sulfidation we will discuss in the following sections how sulfidation affects i the reactivity of chcs indicated by degradation rate constants k obs and k 1 ii the electron utilization ε chc and the corresponding maximum degradation quantity of chcs d max and iii the degradation pathways and the final product profile in selected cases the results of s nzvi were compared to those of the highly reactive pd nzvi to clarify mechanisms or illustrate the advantages of sulfidation the degradation data of chcs by pd nzvi are presented in fig s9 and s10 3 2 sulfidation increases the reactivity of chlorinated ethenes more than the other chcs in most previous studies k obs or mass surface area normalized k obs was used to indicate the reactivity of fe based particles for chcs fan et al 2017 li et al 2017 which describes how fast the reaction can reach equilibrium eq 3 and the presence or absence of a residual parent compound will affect its magnitude in comparison k1 describes the kinetics in the initial degradation period eq 4 which better represents the reactivity eq s12 details discussed in sm 8 a typical example for this is the degradation of cf under electron excess conditions s nzvi depleted cf in 60 h fig 1 b which is much faster than that of nzvi where the degradation extent stalled at 45 8 in 191 h fig s6 b the fitted k obs was only increased by 2 fold with sulfidation whereas it was 11 fold for k1 table s7 and s8 thus k1 better represents and differentiates the reactivity of s nzvi versus nzvi and was used for comparison among chcs in fig 2 overall sulfidation significantly improved the reactivity of nzvi for 1 1 2 tca 1 1 dca and all the chlorinated ethenes but only slightly with ct cf and 1 1 1 tca under electron excess conditions nzvi rapidly degraded ct with a k1 of 2 6 h 1 followed by 1 1 1 tca 9 1 10 2 h 1 cf 8 0 10 3 h 1 and 1 1 2 tca 3 3 10 4 h 1 and sulfidation increased their k1 by 2 7 4 3 11 and 27 folds respectively the other chcs did not react with nzvi thus no k1 values reported as evident by the absence of corresponding degradation products but s nzvi was reactive and yielded k1 of 0 8 76 7 10 3 h 1 fig 2 a limited degradation of 1 1 dca pce tce cis dce and trans dce by nzvi was reported in earlier studies but the inertness of the nzvi herein for these compounds is consistent with their low degradation rate constants in the literature scherer et al 1998 song et al 2005 the distinct reactivity of nzvi likely arises from different approaches and fe precursors used during synthesis xu et al 2020a and the batch to batch variations in different labs under electron limited conditions we observed very limited degradation of 1 1 2 tca 1 1 dca and the four chlorinated ethenes by nzvi k1 0 12 17 7 10 5 h 1 and sulfidation improved their k1 by 1 2 orders of magnitude from 9 7 fold for 1 1 2 tca to 707 fold for tce whereas the k1 of ct cf and 1 1 1 tca were comparable for nzvi 86 7 0 98 2 8 10 2 h 1 and s nzvi 99 2 0 97 4 4 10 2 h 1 fig 2 b this is the first report of the degradation of 1 1 2 tca 1 1 dca and trans dce by s nzvi to allow comparison of k obs with previous studies we have compared it between nzvi and s nzvi in fig s11 the sulfidation induced improvement in the degradation of tce by n zvi is well documented and varies significantly with particle size sulfidation methods fe and s precursors and s fe doses fan et al 2017 li et al 2017 xu et al 2020a the large increase in k obs of tce after sulfidation 78 fold herein is consistent with our previous work bhattacharjee and ghoshal 2018 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 and that of others albeit to different extents fan et al 2017 li et al 2017 our data showed significant increase in the k obs of cis dce after sulfidation 9 6 fold but both favorable and unfavorable effects of sulfidation on the k obs of cis dce have been reported islam et al 2020 mangayayam et al 2019 the contradictory results for cis dce may arise from differences in size and surface properties of s n zvi s precursors and sulfidation methods the little or moderate effect of sulfidation on the k obs of ct cf 1 1 1 tca and pce is consistent with previous reports gu et al 2017 han and yan 2016 islam et al 2020 jin et al 2018 nezamabadi 2016 we also tested dcm and 1 2 dca but no degradation was found by any of the nanoparticles irrespective of whether k1 or k obs is compared the sulfidation induced changes in the reactivity of nzvi for various chcs span two orders of magnitude with chlorinated ethenes being much higher than those of chlorinated methanes and ethanes the reactivity of fe based particles for chcs is mainly controlled by i the rate of electron transfer from the fe0 phase to the target compound i e electron conductivity ii the mass transfer and binding of chcs to the particle surface and iii the rate of chemical reduction that is determined by the property of each chc any improvements in these factors upon sulfidation may result in the improved degradation of chcs previous studies have suggested that the reduction of chcs by fe based particles can proceed through both direct electron transfer and h the consensus is that ct is primarily reduced through direct electron transfer li and farrell 2000 song and carraway 2006 whereas 1 1 1 tca can be reduced through both direct electron transfer and h cwiertny et al 2006 although the relative importance of each mechanism has not been demonstrated for all the chcs investigated the dominant ones may be reflected by the correlations of rate constants with thermodynamic parameters for example the driving force of direct electron transfer can be indicated by the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital e lumo ev for chcs scherer et al 1998 with lower e lumo corresponding to a higher chemical reduction reactivity table s9 we found that the k1 of chlorinated methanes and ethanes by nzvi and s nzvi was negatively correlated with e lumo p 0 05 and can be well predicted by e lumo fig 2 c 2 d fig s12 which is consistent with previous reports scherer et al 1998 song and carraway 2005 and indicates the dominance of direct electron transfer mechanism in their reduction by nzvi and s nzvi however no such correlation was found for chlorinated ethenes the reduction of chlorinated ethenes by fe based particles was reported to be caused by direct electron transfer e g pce wang and farrell 2003 as well as h e g tce cis dce li and farrell 2000 wang and farrell 2003 xie and cwiertny 2013 other studies have also attributed the reduction mechanism of tce by s nzvi to direct electron transfer fan et al 2017 kim et al 2011 mangayayam et al 2019 however h is overall more pertinent to the reduction of chlorinated ethenes than chlorinated methanes ethanes as shown by the 1 3 orders of magnitude higher degradation rate constants of the former than the latter by hydrogenation with supported pd which is a h mediated process mackenzie et al 2006 chaplin et al 2012 thus the much higher sulfidation induced improvement in the k1 of chlorinated ethenes than the other chcs may indicate that sulfidation of nzvi is likely to specifically improve the reduction of chlorinated ethenes via h which is consistent with the mechanism proposed by han and yan 2016 where sulfidation poisons the recombination of h generated from fe0 corrosion and thus prolongs its residence time the presence of h in s nzvi but not in nzvi was recently demonstrated by zhou et al 2020 using cyclic voltammetry analysis we also found similar trends in the enhancement in k1 induced by sulfidation f k 1 s nzvi nzvi i e chlorinated ethenes chlorinated methanes ethanes to that of pd doping f k 1 pd nzvi nzvi table s9 fig 2 e the superior reactivity of pd nzvi for chlorinated ethenes compared to chlorinated ethanes was primarily attributed to the generation of h cwiertny et al 2006 xie and cwiertny 2013 2007 thus by parallel comparison the results suggest a different reduction mechanism of chlorinated ethenes from those of chlorinated methanes ethanes and that sulfidation probably favors the reduction of chlorinated ethenes via h although the exact mechanism is unclear however a recent study from cao et al 2021 demonstrated that the dechlorination of florfenicol by s nzvi is mainly through electron transfer at fes sites instead of h at fe0 sites based on the results of h scavenging experiments material characterization and theoretical calculations the contradictions in degradation mechanisms may arise because of the target compounds used but also indicate more direct evidence is required to validate the relative importance of h mediated reduction for different chcs and the role of h in s nzvi and nzvi for contaminant degradation most previous studies have attributed the effect of sulfidation to the superior ability of fesx to conduct electrons based on the results of tce gu et al 2017 he et al 2018 kim et al 2011 xu et al 2019a 20b indeed fesx is a better electron conductor than feox xu and schoonen 2000 and the increased electron conductivity of s nzvi compared to nzvi is demonstrated by the enhanced corrosion and the reduced electron transfer resistance xu et al 2019a 20b turcio ortega et al 2012 however the improved conductivity does not explain why ct which has the lowest e lumo and is readily reduced by direct electron transfer would only show slight improvement in its reactivity after sulfidation as reported herein and by others han and yan 2016 jin et al 2018 nezamabadi 2016 in fact the sulfidation induced factor of increase in k1 under electron limited conditions log f k 1 s nzvi nzvi is positively correlated with e lumo p 0 05 fig 2 f indicating that sulfidation was less effective in improving the degradation of chcs whose reduction is dominated by direct electron transfer thus the improved electron conductivity after sulfidation may contribute to the enhanced degradation of an individual chc but it may not adequately explain the varied extent of improvement among different chcs however we cannot exclude the possibility of differences in conductivity of s nzvi in this study with those reported by others which may result in somewhat different reactivity trends for various chcs the mass transfer of chcs to the particle surface can be influenced by the compound hydrophobicity the surface wettability or any specific binding interactions between them recent studies have demonstrated reduced interactions of nzvi with h2o after sulfidation by both contact angle analysis and density functional theory calculations and proposed the reduced wettability to be responsible for the improved degradation of tce xu et al 19b 20b cao et al 2020 gu et al 2019 kolos et al 2020 however if the surface wettability driven affinity for target compounds plays an essential role in chc degradation the chcs with a higher octanol water partition coefficient log k ow measure of hydrophobicity of a chemical should be more affected by the decreased wettability of s nzvi no significant correlation of log f k 1 s nzvi nzvi with log k ow was found for the investigated chcs fig s13 which indicates that the improved surface affinity for chcs driven by reduced wettability with sulfidation may also contribute to the enhanced degradation of an individual chc but cannot adequately explain the varied changes in reactivity of different chcs however whether the mass transfer and binding of chcs to the s nzvi surface plays a significant role in other types of s nzvi with different surface composition and wettability requires further investigation it is also possible that specific interactions of chlorinated ethenes with the s nzvi surface as those with pd based hydrogenation catalysts chaplin et al 2012 would improve their degradation 3 3 electron utilization and maximum degradation quantity we found significant increases in ε chc and d max for most chcs by s nzvi compared to nzvi under electron excess conditions fig s14 which is consistent with a previous studies with tce he et al 2020 however how many electrons in the nanoparticles can be ultimately utilized to degrade chcs have not been generally reported and can only be obtained in the presence of excess chcs thus in this study we mainly compare and discuss the ε chc and d max under electron limited conditions fig 3 shows that sulfidation significantly improved the ε chc and d max for 1 1 2 tca 1 1 dca and the four chlorinated ethenes by 4 9 29 5 and 3 1 24 4 folds respectively but not those of ct cf and 1 1 1 tca which is consistent with the changes in k 1 the corresponding decrease in ε h 2 o for all chcs after sulfidation is also consistent with the increase in k 1 theoretically d max is an equation of the electrons utilized to degrade chcs divided by the stoichiometric number of electrons consumed per chc e chc e mol chc 5 d max e 0 ε chc e chc e chc depends on the degradation pathways and the final product profile discussed in the next section and the numerical data of e chc are shown in table s10 given that the ε chc and e chc of ct cf and 1 1 1 tca were both comparable for nzvi and s nzvi fig 3 b c their slightly reduced d max after sulfidation is because s nzvi 36 3 mmol g possessed less e 0 than nzvi 47 2 mmol g table s3 according to eq 5 the d max of chcs by s nzvi varied significantly with that of chlorinated methanes and ethanes 10 4 to 17 0 mmol g being larger than chlorinated ethenes 0 69 7 6 mmol g fig 3 a but the difference is much smaller than the variation in k1 which spans 3 orders of magnitude fig 2 b this has practical implications because although the reactivity of s nzvi k 1 for some chcs e g cf 1 1 2 tca 1 1 dca is much lower than that of ct and 1 1 1 tca they can achieve comparable degradation capacity with longer reaction time the results indicate that the d max under electron limited conditions is a more useful parameter than k1 to assess the extent of remediation achievable by s nzvi at napl containing sites one reason for the much smaller d max of chlorinated ethenes by s nzvi than the other chcs is because of their lower ε chc which is 16 0 62 7 compared to 61 5 99 1 for the others fig 3 c there was some electron loss to h2o for the degradation of 1 1 2 tca 1 1 dca pce and cis dce by s nzvi because of their relatively low k1 and thus longer reaction time 360 h fig s8 but for the remaining chcs there was almost no electron loss to side reactions with h2o thus the less than 100 ε chc is because of the passivation on the reactivity of s nzvi probably resulting from the outgrowth of feox over the reaction course this passivation effect may be alleviated with higher s dose in the nanoparticles bhattacharjee and ghoshal 2018 but we noted that it is more severe for chlorinated ethenes particularly cis dce and trans dce resulting in their relatively low ε chc the severe passivation effect for chlorinated ethenes than the other chcs is partially because of their longer reaction time fig s8 the other reason is likely because of their distinct reduction mechanisms as discussed in the previous section leading to different fe oxides and or different fe oxide spatial distributions and morphologies another contributing factor to the different d max of chcs is the difference in e chc eq 5 a lower e chc corresponds to a more efficient transformation of parent chcs per electron and the degradation of chlorinated methanes and ethanes by s nzvi generally has a lower e chc 2 1 2 2 than chlorinated ethenes 2 1 7 8 table s10 for instance the e chc of tce by s nzvi under electron limited conditions was 4 1 whereas it was only 2 2 for cf and 1 1 dca thus the d max of tce is only half the value for cf and 1 1 dca despite their similar ε chc the smaller e chc by s nzvi compared to pd nzvi also contributes to their comparable d max for most chcs under electron limited conditions despite the ε chc by s nzvi being overall smaller than that by pd nzvi fig s15 as discussed in sm 10 taken as a whole the results show the promise of s nzvi for remediation of mixed chc napls in groundwater 3 4 sulfidation promotes the generation of non chlorinated products the product profile for the degradation of chcs by s nzvi is shown and compared with that of nzvi in fig 4 we found that sulfidation modified the product distribution but not the composition and most notably it reduced the generation of partially dechlorinated products for example as reported previously jin et al 2018 nezamabadi 2016 song and carraway 2006 cf is the major reduction product of ct by both nzvi and s nzvi and we found that sulfidation reduced its percentage in the final product profile from 71 7 to 60 3 and from 83 9 to 47 7 under electron excess and limited conditions respectively the generation of dcm from cf 1 1 dca from 1 1 1 tca and vinyl chloride vc and chloroethane ca from 1 1 dca were also reduced after sulfidation these partially dechlorinated products are no less of a concern than their corresponding parent chcs with regards to carcinogenicity and other adverse health effect jordan et al 2021 iarc 2020 table s1 and are also more recalcitrant to reductive dechlorination as evident from their low k1 values in fig 2 the reduction of chcs is known to follow multiple pathways and the results indicate that sulfidation may affect the branching ratios and favors the complete dechlorination ones the degradation pathways of the investigated chcs were proposed based on the time trends of the intermediates and products observed herein fig 1 fig s6 s8 and those reported previously and are depicted in fig 5 the reductive dechlorination of chcs was simplified to begin with a concerted two electron transfer regardless of direct electron transfer or h mediated reactions resulting in a simultaneous cleavage of one c cl bond and the formation of a carbanion elsner and hofstetter 2011 then the carbanions either undergo protonation to generate the hydrogenolysis products or cl elimination reactions to afford carbenes α elimination or unsaturated halo alkenes β elimination the hydrogenolysis of carbanions gives products with cl substituted by h such as from ct to cf fig 5 a 1 cf to dcm a 4 1 1 1 tca to 1 1 dca b 1 and 1 1 dca to ca b 4 whether the carbanions undergo α or β elimination depends on if they carry a cl at β c which is the more favorable leaving group for example 1 1 2 tca mainly undergoes β elimination reaction to generate vc b 9 and vc dominates the products of 1 1 2 tca for both nzvi and s nzvi fig 4 however vc can be slowly dechlorinated to ethene by s nzvi but not by nzvi b 10 fig s17 and thus sulfidation helps to reduce the formation of partially dechlorinated product from 1 1 2 tca sulfidation may also reduce the percentage of partially dechlorinated products by favoring the α elimination pathway for ct cf 1 1 1 tca and 1 1 dca these chcs only possess cl at the α c which helps to stabilize the carbanions from the first reductive dechlorination and facilitate their α elimination to generate carbenes a 2 a 5 b 2 and b 5 elsner and hofstetter 2011 the subsequent reaction mechanisms of carbenes are not fully understood but cl c6 hydrocarbons are known to be generated from α elimination instead of hydrogenolysis elsner and hofstetter 2011 fennelly and roberts 1998 luo et al 2021 this is because they are formed concurrently with the hydrogenolysis products e g cf dcm 1 1 dca and ca fig 1 fig s6 s8 and these compounds react too slowly to represent intermediates to generate cl c6 hydrocarbons fig 2 the other reaction pathway of carbenes leads to the formation of the hypothesized undetected products a 3 a 6 b 3 and b 6 their presence is inferred from the low mass balance on carbon and electron and is further verified by data on dechlorination extents which is comprehensively discussed in sm 5 the possible identity of these undetected products and the estimation of the amounts formed are provided in sm 6 although we are unclear of the mechanisms the less percentage of hydrogenolysis products from ct cf 1 1 1 tca and 1 1 dca of s nzvi indicates that sulfidation may suppress hydrogenolysis but favor α elimination either to form cl c6 hydrocarbons or the undetected products likely fully dechlorinated as discussed in sm 6 yin et al 2017 have reported that amino acids can suppress the cf formation from the reduction of ct by green rust which is hypothesized to be caused by the stabilization of carbene intermediates via the carbonyl group more efforts are required to investigate how sulfidation may affect the fate of the short lived carbenes and shift the reaction pathways and to develop possible strategies to circumvent the formation of problematic hydrogenolysis products besides hydrogenolysis and α elimination vc and 1 1 dce was also generated through dehydrochlorination hcl elimination b 8 b 11 from the degradation of 1 1 dca and 1 1 2 tca respectively by nzvi but both are eliminated after sulfidation fig 4 sulfidation can also modify the product distribution by affecting the reaction of the degradation intermediates the reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes by nzvi is reported to be via β elimination with the generation of chloroacetylenes fig 5 c 1 or acetylene c 4 and the chloroacetylene would be rapidly transformed to acetylene through hydrogenolysis c 2 arnold and roberts 2000 the hydrogenation and polymerization of acetylene lead to the formation of ethene ethane and c3 c6 hydrocarbons c 3 arnold and roberts 2000 sulfidation does not modify these pathways but it slows down the transformation of acetylene fig s18 resulting in more presence of acetylene in the final product profile under electron excess conditions fig 4 trace amounts of partially dechlorinated products e g cis dce and vc were found in the nzvi systems but with sulfidation their generation was highly reduced especially under electron limited conditions fig 4 the relative abundance of chcs versus s nvzi also affects the product distribution shifting the degradation conditions from electron excess to limited favors the α elimination pathway of ct and cf with the percentage of cf and dcm reducing from 60 3 to 47 7 and 36 1 to 14 5 respectively fig 4b 4d but not for 1 1 1 tca and 1 1 dca the shortage of electrons under limited conditions also results in more accumulation of degradation intermediates for example the percentage of vc increased from 73 9 to 92 9 from electron excess to limited conditions for the degradation of 1 1 2 tca and that of acetylene for chlorinated ethenes increased from 1 2 to 13 2 to 18 9 95 7 this is because the further transformation of vc and acetylene was disfavored in the competition with parent chcs for electrons fig s17 and s18 the results reinforce the significance of investigations on the performance of s nzvi under conditions representative of napl contaminated sites 4 conclusions despite the widely reported effect of sulfidation of nzvi on the considerably enhanced degradation of tce we showed that this effect is compound specific for chcs with the enhancements for chlorinated ethenes being more significant than for chlorinated methanes and ethanes our results show that the mechanisms of improved electron conductivity and reduced hydrophobicity described in the literature explain the sulfidation induced phenomena associated with tce degradation may not be adequate to describe the varied improvement for a series of chcs investigated in this study the specific enhancement for chlorinated ethenes is likely because their reduction mechanism is different from the other chcs which may involve more of h than direct electron transfer and sulfidation probably favors the h mediated reduction however further studies are required to provide more direct evidence on the role of h in s nzvi for contaminant degradation and the dominant mechanism for specific compounds the results indicate that the degradation mechanisms associated with each contaminant may be a determining factor leading to the improved reactivity with sulfidation and the identification of such mechanisms is essential to understand the performance of s nzvi or other remediation agents at contaminated sites we showed that sulfidation resulted in highly improved or comparable d max of all the investigated chcs compared to nzvi but not all the electrons in the s nzvi can be utilized by chcs even under electron limited conditions chlorinated methanes and ethanes can achieve comparable d max by s nzvi under electron limited conditions despite their rate constant values spanning 3 orders of magnitude the results imply that d max which incorporates the effects of reactivity electron utilization degradation pathways and product distribution may serve as a more appropriate indicator than degradation rate constants for assessment of the overall performance of s nzvi for various chcs the presence of partially dechlorinated products which are toxic and more recalcitrant to reductive dechlorination indicates that the substantial decay of parent chcs does not always translate into the complete success and risk reduction of remediation efforts assessments on the degradation efficiency should include the degradation products our results show that sulfidation helps the generation of non chlorinated benign products by suppressing the hydrogenolysis and dehydrochlorination pathways for chlorinated methanes and ethanes however whether and how different s fe ratios synthesis methods iron and sulfur precursors and the nano versus micron size would affect the reduction pathways to generate different intermediates and products requires further investigations future

16877,sulfidated nanoscale zerovalent iron s nzvi is a promising reductant for trichloroethylene in groundwater yet a comprehensive understanding of its degradation efficiency for other chlorinated hydrocarbons chcs is lacking in this study we assessed the benefits of using s nzvi for the degradation of two chlorinated methanes three chlorinated ethanes and four chlorinated ethenes compared to unamended nzvi by analyzing the degradation rate constants the maximum degradation quantity and the degradation pathways and products under both stoichiometrically electron excess and limited conditions the improvement in rate constants induced by sulfidation was compound specific and was more significant for chlorinated ethenes 57 707 folds than for the other chcs 1 0 17 folds this is likely because of the different reduction mechanisms of each chc and sulfidation may favor specific mechanisms associated with the reduction of chlorinated ethenes more than the others sulfidation of nzvi enabled either higher 3 1 24 4 folds or comparable 0 78 0 91 maximum degradation quantity assessed under electron limited conditions for all the chcs investigated indicating the promise of s nzvi for remediation of groundwater contaminated by chc mixtures furthermore we proposed the degradation pathways of various chcs based on the observed degradation intermediates and products and found that sulfidation suppressed the generation of partially dechlorinated products particularly for chlorinated methanes and ethanes and favor degradation pathways leading to the non chlorinated benign products this is the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of sulfidation in improving the degradation of a suite of chcs and the results provide valuable insight to the assessment of applicability and benefits of s nzvi for chc remediation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfidation nanoscale zerovalent iron chlorinated hydrocarbons groundwater remediation

comprehensively investigated in early papers gillham and ohannesin 1994 scherer et al 1998 nzvi was first synthesized in 1998 zhang et al 1998 and was subsequently used to treat various contaminants as reviewed elsewhere he et al 2015 mukherjee et al 2016 zou et al 2016 however poor selectivity of n zvi towards target contaminants e g trichloroethylene tce has halted more widespread acceptance of n zvi as a full scale in situ remediation technology fan et al 2016 it is well recognized that n zvi functionalized with sulfur s n zvi irrespective of the synthesis methods e g one or two step aqueous synthesis ball milling and sulfur source na2s2o4 na2s2o3 na2s and elemental s possesses superior reactivity to tce compared to unamended n zvi as reviewed elsewhere fan et al 2017 li et al

et al 2021 xu et al 2020a the focus on tce is likely due to its frequent presence in contaminated groundwater however various c1 and c2 chcs are often encountered together at contaminated sites because of co disposal or biodegradation of one chc to another mccarty 2010 but investigations on the degradation of chcs other than tce by s n zvi are limited there are only a few studies with carbon tetrachloride ct han and yan 2016 gu et al 2017 jin et al 2018 nezamabadi 2016 chloroform cf nezamabadi 2016 1 1 1 trichloroethane 1 1 1 tca nezamabadi 2016 1 2 dichloroethane 1 2 dca nunez garcia et

for ct han and yan 2016 gu et al 2017 jin et al 2018 nezamabadi 2016 and cis dce islam et al 2020 mangayayam et al 2019 and the extent of improvement in the degradation of the other chcs appears to be lower than that for tce the results of those studies indicate that the superior reactivity of s n zvi for tce obtained from various synthesis methods may not hold for other chcs thus more comprehensive studies on the degradation of a broader range of commonly detected chcs in groundwater by s n zvi are required towards an improved understanding of the effect of sulfidation and its efficacy for site remediation the mechanisms by which sulfidation leads to improved contaminant degradation are mostly derived from studies on tce sulfidation has been proposed to enhance the electron conductivity gu et al 2017 kim et al 2011 he et al 2018 xu et al 2019a 2020b and the surface hydrophobicity xu et al 2019b 2020b of n zvi and to poison the recombination of reactive atomic hydrogen species h to generate h2 han and yan 2016 although these mechanisms individually explain the sulfidation induced phenomena associated with the degradation of tce their applicability to other chcs is unclear for example han and yan 2016 indicated that the enhanced electron conductivity cannot explain the absence of improvement in the reactivity of ct a compound known to be degraded by direct electron transfer li and farrell 2000 it is likely that the change in reactivity with sulfidation depends on specific reduction mechanisms associated with each chc specific chc surface interactions or a combination of such factors a thorough understanding of the mechanisms responsible for changes in reactivity with sulfidation also requires comprehensive comparisons on the degradation of various chcs previous studies were mostly conducted under stoichiometrically electron excess conditions which is representative of conditions for remediation of dissolved chcs in contaminant plumes very few studies have investigated degradation under electron limited conditions which is representative of remediation in source zone regions with chc non aqueous phase liquids napls gu et al 2017 he et al 2018 xu et al 2019a bhattacharjee and ghoshal 2016 2018 napls account for the major mass fraction of chcs present at contaminated sites and serve as a long term source of chcs in groundwater kueper et al 2014 more importantly the assessment on the degradation performance has been largely focused on the decay of parent compounds i e the reactivity yet from a remediation point of view the degradation efficiency of s n zvi consists of several other aspects including electron utilization efficiency he et al 2020 maximum contaminant degradation extent and product formation the electron utilization and degradation extent are particularly pertinent under conditions with limited supply of electrons which requires systematic investigations to evaluate the performance of s n zvi with napl chcs besides it is known that the reduction of ct cf and 1 1 1 tca by fe based particles generates partially dechlorinated products e g dichloromethane dcm 1 1 dichloroethane 1 1 dca nezamabadi 2016 elsner and hofstetter 2011 which are often more persistent and or toxic than the parent compounds jordan et al 2021 strategies have been proposed and developed to suppress the generation of these problematic products during reduction elsner and hofstetter 2011 yin et al 2017 which require insight into degradation pathways and reactive intermediates it is unclear how sulfidation would affect the reduction pathways of chcs other than tce and the generation of partially dechlorinated products in this study we compared the degradation efficiency of nine chcs including two chlorinated methanes three chlorinated ethanes and four chlorinated ethenes by nzvi and s nzvi only nanosized particles were used under both stoichiometrically electron excess and limited conditions the degradation efficiency was characterized through several parameters including degradation rate constants electron utilization maximum degradation quantity and product formation to provide a holistic assessment on the benefits of using s nzvi compared to nzvi the results show that sulfidation particularly increased the rate constants of chlorinated ethenes more than the other chcs and resulted in comparable or highly improved degradation extent for all the chcs investigated by analyzing the reaction pathways and products we found that the benefits of sulfidation also include promoting the generation of non chlorinated benign products to our knowledge this is the first comprehensive study that systematically investigates the degradation performance of s nzvi to a variety of chcs 2 materials and methods 2

fe molar ratio of 0 05 was synthesized by the one step method using na2s according to the procedures reported previously bhattacharjee and ghoshal 2018 and the final ratio in the nanoparticle was also 0 05 the detailed synthesis and characterization methods for s nzvi nzvi and palladium doped nzvi pd nzvi are provided in sm 2 the physiochemical properties and tem images of the nanoparticles are shown in table s3 and fig s1 respectively the anaerobic degradation of the nine chcs by nzvi s nzvi and pd nzvi were tested individually under both electron excess 1 36 mmol g nanoparticle and limited conditions 33 9 mmol g with details provided in sm 3 the h2 parent chcs and degradation products were monitored and the analytical methods are provided in sm 3 it should be noted that we determined the stoichiometric conditions based on the initial electrons in the nanoparticles e 0 mmol g which were 47 2 mmol g for nzvi 36 3 mmol g for s nzvi and 41 7 mmol g for pd nzvi instead of fe0 and the reasons are explained in sm 2 2 2 data analysis the amount of chcs m t mmol g and degradation products pi t mmol g i is the specific product at reaction time t were reported relative to the initial mass of nanoparticles they were quantified by analyzing the headspace and calibrating against the respective pure standard prepared in a setup identical to the degradation system without nanoparticles some products were quantified by diluted gas standards using henry s law coefficients table s4 under electron limited conditions the quantity of chcs in the headspace cannot indicate the total amount in the degradation system because the concentration of chcs used were close to or beyond their water solubility where henry s law does not apply thus the m t was calculated from the initial added parent chcs m 0 mmol g and the amount of degradation products formed according to eq 1 1 m t m 0 d t 2 d t i d i t i n i p i t where d t mmol g is the total quantity of chc that has been degraded at reaction time t h di t mmol g is the quantity of chc degraded to product i and ni is the moles of parent chc it consumes to form one mole of product i the maximum quantity of chc degraded at the end of the reaction is referred to as d max mmol g the electron utilization by chc ε chc and h2o ε h 2 o and the percentage of unreacted electrons ε r in the degradation residue were calculated according to eq s1 s3 in sm 4 the kinetics of the degradation was described by both the observed first order rate constant k obs h 1 using the data from the entire reaction course according to eq 3 which assumes that the rate to reach equilibrium m e mmol g or depletion of the target compound is proportional to the distance from the equilibrium 3 m t m e m 0 m e exp k obs t and the pseudo first order rate constant k1 h 1 using the ln m t m 0 from the initial linear range according to eq 4 4 ln m t m 0 k 1 t based on the deficit in the mass balance of carbon fig s2 and electrons fig s4 we inferred there exist some unknown and undetected products for the degradation of ct cf 1 1 1 tca and 1 1 dca sm 5 their presence was also verified by a lower dechlorination extent accounted for by the detectable products than that indicated by the released chloride table s6 for the sake of more accurate assessment on the degradation efficiency we proposed the possible identity of the undetected products and estimated their quantity and the procedures are provided in sm 6 in this study all the degradation efficiency parameters including k 1 k obs ε chc d max and e chc have accounted for these hypothesized undetected products the spss23 ibm was used for statistical analysis at a significance level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 overview on the degradation of chcs by nzvi and s nzvi the reactivity of nzvi and s nzvi for different chcs varied significantly and sulfidation improved their degradation to very different extents under electron excess conditions nzvi rapidly depleted ct in 2 h but reacted with 1 1 1 tca and cf more slowly with a degradation extent of 86 6 in 120 h and 45 8 in 191 h respectively fig s6 nzvi was almost inert to 1 1 2 tca and we barely observed degradation of 1 1 dca and the four chlorinated ethenes pce tce cis dce and trans dce with nzvi in comparison s nzvi depleted ct cf 1 1 1 tca tce and trans dce in 0 83 250 h whereas the degradation extent of the others 1 1 2 tca 1 1 dca pce cis dce was 5 7 51 2 in 300 h fig 1 under electron limited conditions m 0 33 9 mmol g chcs cannot be fully depleted by either nzvi or s nzvi as expected but some reached equilibrium sooner than the others with significantly varying degradation extents fig s7 and s8 for example the degradation extent of ct by nzvi reached 64 8 in 5 h whereas it was only 0 08 2 8 for the four chlorinated ethenes in 600 h sulfidation increased the degradation extent of chlorinated ethenes to 2 0 22 3 but did not improve that of ct and cf besides reactivity we note that even when the parent chcs were eliminated they were not fully dechlorinated particularly the chlorinated methanes and ethanes but generated partially chlorinated products such as dcm and 1 1 dca and sulfidation appeared to reduce their formation vide infra the other important aspect is the passivation of nanoparticles over the reaction course and eventually how many electrons in the nanoparticles are used to eliminate cl in chcs which refers to not only the selectivity of electrons for chcs over h2o but also the usage of electrons towards more efficient dechlorination pathways to form non chlorinated benign products thus to comprehensively assess the degradation efficiency of s nzvi for various chcs and to address the benefits of sulfidation we will discuss in the following sections how sulfidation affects i the reactivity of chcs indicated by degradation rate constants k obs and k 1 ii the electron utilization ε chc and the corresponding maximum degradation quantity of chcs d max and iii the degradation pathways and the final product profile in selected cases the results of s nzvi were compared to those of the highly reactive pd nzvi to clarify mechanisms or illustrate the advantages of sulfidation the degradation data of chcs by pd nzvi are presented in fig s9 and s10 3 2 sulfidation increases the reactivity of chlorinated ethenes more than the other chcs in most previous studies k obs or mass surface area normalized k obs was used to indicate the reactivity of fe based particles for chcs fan et al 2017 li et al 2017 which describes how fast the reaction can reach equilibrium eq 3 and the presence or absence of a residual parent compound will affect its magnitude in comparison k1 describes the kinetics in the initial degradation period eq 4 which better represents the reactivity eq s12 details discussed in sm 8 a typical example for this is the degradation of cf under electron excess conditions s nzvi depleted cf in 60 h fig 1 b which is much faster than that of nzvi where the degradation extent stalled at 45 8 in 191 h fig s6 b the fitted k obs was only increased by 2 fold with sulfidation whereas it was 11 fold for k1 table s7 and s8 thus k1 better represents and differentiates the reactivity of s nzvi versus nzvi and was used for comparison among chcs in fig 2 overall sulfidation significantly improved the reactivity of nzvi for 1 1 2 tca 1 1 dca and all the chlorinated ethenes but only slightly with ct cf and 1 1 1 tca under electron excess conditions nzvi rapidly degraded ct with a k1 of 2 6 h 1 followed by 1 1 1 tca 9 1 10 2 h 1 cf 8 0 10 3 h 1 and 1 1 2 tca 3 3 10 4 h 1 and sulfidation increased their k1 by 2 7 4 3 11 and 27 folds respectively the other chcs did not react with nzvi thus no k1 values reported as evident by the absence of corresponding degradation products but s nzvi was reactive and yielded k1 of 0 8 76 7 10 3 h 1 fig 2 a limited degradation of 1 1 dca pce tce cis dce and trans dce by nzvi was reported in earlier studies but the inertness of the nzvi herein for these compounds is consistent with their low degradation rate constants in the literature scherer et al 1998 song et al 2005 the distinct reactivity of nzvi likely arises from different approaches and fe precursors used during synthesis xu et al 2020a and the batch to batch variations in different labs under electron limited conditions we observed very limited degradation of 1 1 2 tca 1 1 dca and the four chlorinated ethenes by nzvi k1 0 12 17 7 10 5 h 1 and sulfidation improved their k1 by 1 2 orders of magnitude from 9 7 fold for 1 1 2 tca to 707 fold for tce whereas the k1 of ct cf and 1 1 1 tca were comparable for nzvi 86 7 0 98 2 8 10 2 h 1 and s nzvi 99 2 0 97 4 4 10 2 h 1 fig 2 b this is the first report of the degradation of 1 1 2 tca 1 1 dca and trans dce by s nzvi to allow comparison of k obs with previous studies we have compared it between nzvi and s nzvi in fig s11 the sulfidation induced improvement in the degradation of tce by n zvi is well documented and varies significantly with particle size sulfidation methods fe and s precursors and s fe doses fan et al 2017 li et al 2017 xu et al 2020a the large increase in k obs of tce after sulfidation 78 fold herein is consistent with our previous work bhattacharjee and ghoshal 2018 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 and that of others albeit to different extents fan et al 2017 li et al 2017 our data showed significant increase in the k obs of cis dce after sulfidation 9 6 fold but both favorable and unfavorable effects of sulfidation on the k obs of cis dce have been reported islam et al 2020 mangayayam et al 2019 the contradictory results for cis dce may arise from differences in size and surface properties of s n zvi s precursors and sulfidation methods the little or moderate effect of sulfidation on the k obs of ct cf 1 1 1 tca and pce is consistent with previous reports gu et al 2017 han and yan 2016 islam et al 2020 jin et al 2018 nezamabadi 2016 we also tested dcm and 1 2 dca but no degradation was found by any of the nanoparticles irrespective of whether k1 or k obs is compared the sulfidation induced changes in the reactivity of nzvi for various chcs span two orders of magnitude with chlorinated ethenes being much higher than those of chlorinated methanes and ethanes the reactivity of fe based particles for chcs is mainly controlled by i the rate of electron transfer from the fe0 phase to the target compound i e electron conductivity ii the mass transfer and binding of chcs to the particle surface and iii the rate of chemical reduction that is determined by the property of each chc any improvements in these factors upon sulfidation may result in the improved degradation of chcs previous studies have suggested that the reduction of chcs by fe based particles can proceed through both direct electron transfer and h the consensus is that ct is primarily reduced through direct electron transfer li and farrell 2000 song and carraway 2006 whereas 1 1 1 tca can be reduced through both direct electron transfer and h cwiertny et al 2006 although the relative importance of each mechanism has not been demonstrated for all the chcs investigated the dominant ones may be reflected by the correlations of rate constants with thermodynamic parameters for example the driving force of direct electron transfer can be indicated by the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital e lumo ev for chcs scherer et al 1998 with lower e lumo corresponding to a higher chemical reduction reactivity table s9 we found that the k1 of chlorinated methanes and ethanes by nzvi and s nzvi was negatively correlated with e lumo p 0 05 and can be well predicted by e lumo fig 2 c 2 d fig s12 which is consistent with previous reports scherer et al 1998 song and carraway 2005 and indicates the dominance of direct electron transfer mechanism in their reduction by nzvi and s nzvi however no such correlation was found for chlorinated ethenes the reduction of chlorinated ethenes by fe based particles was reported to be caused by direct electron transfer e g pce wang and farrell 2003 as well as h e g tce cis dce li and farrell 2000 wang and farrell 2003 xie and cwiertny 2013 other studies have also attributed the reduction mechanism of tce by s nzvi to direct electron transfer fan et al 2017 kim et al 2011 mangayayam et al 2019 however h is overall more pertinent to the reduction of chlorinated ethenes than chlorinated methanes ethanes as shown by the 1 3 orders of magnitude higher degradation rate constants of the former than the latter by hydrogenation with supported pd which is a h mediated process mackenzie et al 2006 chaplin et al 2012 thus the much higher sulfidation induced improvement in the k1 of chlorinated ethenes than the other chcs may indicate that sulfidation of nzvi is likely to specifically improve the reduction of chlorinated ethenes via h which is consistent with the mechanism proposed by han and yan 2016 where sulfidation poisons the recombination of h generated from fe0 corrosion and thus prolongs its residence time the presence of h in s nzvi but not in nzvi was recently demonstrated by zhou et al 2020 using cyclic voltammetry analysis we also found similar trends in the enhancement in k1 induced by sulfidation f k 1 s nzvi nzvi i e chlorinated ethenes chlorinated methanes ethanes to that of pd doping f k 1 pd nzvi nzvi table s9 fig 2 e the superior reactivity of pd nzvi for chlorinated ethenes compared to chlorinated ethanes was primarily attributed to the generation of h cwiertny et al 2006 xie and cwiertny 2013 2007 thus by parallel comparison the results suggest a different reduction mechanism of chlorinated ethenes from those of chlorinated methanes ethanes and that sulfidation probably favors the reduction of chlorinated ethenes via h although the exact mechanism is unclear however a recent study from cao et al 2021 demonstrated that the dechlorination of florfenicol by s nzvi is mainly through electron transfer at fes sites instead of h at fe0 sites based on the results of h scavenging experiments material characterization and theoretical calculations the contradictions in degradation mechanisms may arise because of the target compounds used but also indicate more direct evidence is required to validate the relative importance of h mediated reduction for different chcs and the role of h in s nzvi and nzvi for contaminant degradation most previous studies have attributed the effect of sulfidation to the superior ability of fesx to conduct electrons based on the results of tce gu et al 2017 he et al 2018 kim et al 2011 xu et al 2019a 20b indeed fesx is a better electron conductor than feox xu and schoonen 2000 and the increased electron conductivity of s nzvi compared to nzvi is demonstrated by the enhanced corrosion and the reduced electron transfer resistance xu et al 2019a 20b turcio ortega et al 2012 however the improved conductivity does not explain why ct which has the lowest e lumo and is readily reduced by direct electron transfer would only show slight improvement in its reactivity after sulfidation as reported herein and by others han and yan 2016 jin et al 2018 nezamabadi 2016 in fact the sulfidation induced factor of increase in k1 under electron limited conditions log f k 1 s nzvi nzvi is positively correlated with e lumo p 0 05 fig 2 f indicating that sulfidation was less effective in improving the degradation of chcs whose reduction is dominated by direct electron transfer thus the improved electron conductivity after sulfidation may contribute to the enhanced degradation of an individual chc but it may not adequately explain the varied extent of improvement among different chcs however we cannot exclude the possibility of differences in conductivity of s nzvi in this study with those reported by others which may result in somewhat different reactivity trends for various chcs the mass transfer of chcs to the particle surface can be influenced by the compound hydrophobicity the surface wettability or any specific binding interactions between them recent studies have demonstrated reduced interactions of nzvi with h2o after sulfidation by both contact angle analysis and density functional theory calculations and proposed the reduced wettability to be responsible for the improved degradation of tce xu et al 19b 20b cao et al 2020 gu et al 2019 kolos et al 2020 however if the surface wettability driven affinity for target compounds plays an essential role in chc degradation the chcs with a higher octanol water partition coefficient log k ow measure of hydrophobicity of a chemical should be more affected by the decreased wettability of s nzvi no significant correlation of log f k 1 s nzvi nzvi with log k ow was found for the investigated chcs fig s13 which indicates that the improved surface affinity for chcs driven by reduced wettability with sulfidation may also contribute to the enhanced degradation of an individual chc but cannot adequately explain the varied changes in reactivity of different chcs however whether the mass transfer and binding of chcs to the s nzvi surface plays a significant role in other types of s nzvi with different surface composition and wettability requires further investigation it is also possible that specific interactions of chlorinated ethenes with the s nzvi surface as those with pd based hydrogenation catalysts chaplin et al 2012 would improve their degradation 3 3 electron utilization and maximum degradation quantity we found significant increases in ε chc and d max for most chcs by s nzvi compared to nzvi under electron excess conditions fig s14 which is consistent with a previous studies with tce he et al 2020 however how many electrons in the nanoparticles can be ultimately utilized to degrade chcs have not been generally reported and can only be obtained in the presence of excess chcs thus in this study we mainly compare and discuss the ε chc and d max under electron limited conditions fig 3 shows that sulfidation significantly improved the ε chc and d max for 1 1 2 tca 1 1 dca and the four chlorinated ethenes by 4 9 29 5 and 3 1 24 4 folds respectively but not those of ct cf and 1 1 1 tca which is consistent with the changes in k 1 the corresponding decrease in ε h 2 o for all chcs after sulfidation is also consistent with the increase in k 1 theoretically d max is an equation of the electrons utilized to degrade chcs divided by the stoichiometric number of electrons consumed per chc e chc e mol chc 5 d max e 0 ε chc e chc e chc depends on the degradation pathways and the final product profile discussed in the next section and the numerical data of e chc are shown in table s10 given that the ε chc and e chc of ct cf and 1 1 1 tca were both comparable for nzvi and s nzvi fig 3 b c their slightly reduced d max after sulfidation is because s nzvi 36 3 mmol g possessed less e 0 than nzvi 47 2 mmol g table s3 according to eq 5 the d max of chcs by s nzvi varied significantly with that of chlorinated methanes and ethanes 10 4 to 17 0 mmol g being larger than chlorinated ethenes 0 69 7 6 mmol g fig 3 a but the difference is much smaller than the variation in k1 which spans 3 orders of magnitude fig 2 b this has practical implications because although the reactivity of s nzvi k 1 for some chcs e g cf 1 1 2 tca 1 1 dca is much lower than that of ct and 1 1 1 tca they can achieve comparable degradation capacity with longer reaction time the results indicate that the d max under electron limited conditions is a more useful parameter than k1 to assess the extent of remediation achievable by s nzvi at napl containing sites one reason for the much smaller d max of chlorinated ethenes by s nzvi than the other chcs is because of their lower ε chc which is 16 0 62 7 compared to 61 5 99 1 for the others fig 3 c there was some electron loss to h2o for the degradation of 1 1 2 tca 1 1 dca pce and cis dce by s nzvi because of their relatively low k1 and thus longer reaction time 360 h fig s8 but for the remaining chcs there was almost no electron loss to side reactions with h2o thus the less than 100 ε chc is because of the passivation on the reactivity of s nzvi probably resulting from the outgrowth of feox over the reaction course this passivation effect may be alleviated with higher s dose in the nanoparticles bhattacharjee and ghoshal 2018 but we noted that it is more severe for chlorinated ethenes particularly cis dce and trans dce resulting in their relatively low ε chc the severe passivation effect for chlorinated ethenes than the other chcs is partially because of their longer reaction time fig s8 the other reason is likely because of their distinct reduction mechanisms as discussed in the previous section leading to different fe oxides and or different fe oxide spatial distributions and morphologies another contributing factor to the different d max of chcs is the difference in e chc eq 5 a lower e chc corresponds to a more efficient transformation of parent chcs per electron and the degradation of chlorinated methanes and ethanes by s nzvi generally has a lower e chc 2 1 2 2 than chlorinated ethenes 2 1 7 8 table s10 for instance the e chc of tce by s nzvi under electron limited conditions was 4 1 whereas it was only 2 2 for cf and 1 1 dca thus the d max of tce is only half the value for cf and 1 1 dca despite their similar ε chc the smaller e chc by s nzvi compared to pd nzvi also contributes to their comparable d max for most chcs under electron limited conditions despite the ε chc by s nzvi being overall smaller than that by pd nzvi fig s15 as discussed in sm 10 taken as a whole the results show the promise of s nzvi for remediation of mixed chc napls in groundwater 3 4 sulfidation promotes the generation of non chlorinated products the product profile for the degradation of chcs by s nzvi is shown and compared with that of nzvi in fig 4 we found that sulfidation modified the product distribution but not the composition and most notably it reduced the generation of partially dechlorinated products for example as reported previously jin et al 2018 nezamabadi 2016 song and carraway 2006 cf is the major reduction product of ct by both nzvi and s nzvi and we found that sulfidation reduced its percentage in the final product profile from 71 7 to 60 3 and from 83 9 to 47 7 under electron excess and limited conditions respectively the generation of dcm from cf 1 1 dca from 1 1 1 tca and vinyl chloride vc and chloroethane ca from 1 1 dca were also reduced after sulfidation these partially dechlorinated products are no less of a concern than their corresponding parent chcs with regards to carcinogenicity and other adverse health effect jordan et al 2021 iarc 2020 table s1 and are also more recalcitrant to reductive dechlorination as evident from their low k1 values in fig 2 the reduction of chcs is known to follow multiple pathways and the results indicate that sulfidation may affect the branching ratios and favors the complete dechlorination ones the degradation pathways of the investigated chcs were proposed based on the time trends of the intermediates and products observed herein fig 1 fig s6 s8 and those reported previously and are depicted in fig 5 the reductive dechlorination of chcs was simplified to begin with a concerted two electron transfer regardless of direct electron transfer or h mediated reactions resulting in a simultaneous cleavage of one c cl bond and the formation of a carbanion elsner and hofstetter 2011 then the carbanions either undergo protonation to generate the hydrogenolysis products or cl elimination reactions to afford carbenes α elimination or unsaturated halo alkenes β elimination the hydrogenolysis of carbanions gives products with cl substituted by h such as from ct to cf fig 5 a 1 cf to dcm a 4 1 1 1 tca to 1 1 dca b 1 and 1 1 dca to ca b 4 whether the carbanions undergo α or β elimination depends on if they carry a cl at β c which is the more favorable leaving group for example 1 1 2 tca mainly undergoes β elimination reaction to generate vc b 9 and vc dominates the products of 1 1 2 tca for both nzvi and s nzvi fig 4 however vc can be slowly dechlorinated to ethene by s nzvi but not by nzvi b 10 fig s17 and thus sulfidation helps to reduce the formation of partially dechlorinated product from 1 1 2 tca sulfidation may also reduce the percentage of partially dechlorinated products by favoring the α elimination pathway for ct cf 1 1 1 tca and 1 1 dca these chcs only possess cl at the α c which helps to stabilize the carbanions from the first reductive dechlorination and facilitate their α elimination to generate carbenes a 2 a 5 b 2 and b 5 elsner and hofstetter 2011 the subsequent reaction mechanisms of carbenes are not fully understood but cl c6 hydrocarbons are known to be generated from α elimination instead of hydrogenolysis elsner and hofstetter 2011 fennelly and roberts 1998 luo et al 2021 this is because they are formed concurrently with the hydrogenolysis products e g cf dcm 1 1 dca and ca fig 1 fig s6 s8 and these compounds react too slowly to represent intermediates to generate cl c6 hydrocarbons fig 2 the other reaction pathway of carbenes leads to the formation of the hypothesized undetected products a 3 a 6 b 3 and b 6 their presence is inferred from the low mass balance on carbon and electron and is further verified by data on dechlorination extents which is comprehensively discussed in sm 5 the possible identity of these undetected products and the estimation of the amounts formed are provided in sm 6 although we are unclear of the mechanisms the less percentage of hydrogenolysis products from ct cf 1 1 1 tca and 1 1 dca of s nzvi indicates that sulfidation may suppress hydrogenolysis but favor α elimination either to form cl c6 hydrocarbons or the undetected products likely fully dechlorinated as discussed in sm 6 yin et al 2017 have reported that amino acids can suppress the cf formation from the reduction of ct by green rust which is hypothesized to be caused by the stabilization of carbene intermediates via the carbonyl group more efforts are required to investigate how sulfidation may affect the fate of the short lived carbenes and shift the reaction pathways and to develop possible strategies to circumvent the formation of problematic hydrogenolysis products besides hydrogenolysis and α elimination vc and 1 1 dce was also generated through dehydrochlorination hcl elimination b 8 b 11 from the degradation of 1 1 dca and 1 1 2 tca respectively by nzvi but both are eliminated after sulfidation fig 4 sulfidation can also modify the product distribution by affecting the reaction of the degradation intermediates the reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes by nzvi is reported to be via β elimination with the generation of chloroacetylenes fig 5 c 1 or acetylene c 4 and the chloroacetylene would be rapidly transformed to acetylene through hydrogenolysis c 2 arnold and roberts 2000 the hydrogenation and polymerization of acetylene lead to the formation of ethene ethane and c3 c6 hydrocarbons c 3 arnold and roberts 2000 sulfidation does not modify these pathways but it slows down the transformation of acetylene fig s18 resulting in more presence of acetylene in the final product profile under electron excess conditions fig 4 trace amounts of partially dechlorinated products e g cis dce and vc were found in the nzvi systems but with sulfidation their generation was highly reduced especially under electron limited conditions fig 4 the relative abundance of chcs versus s nvzi also affects the product distribution shifting the degradation conditions from electron excess to limited favors the α elimination pathway of ct and cf with the percentage of cf and dcm reducing from 60 3 to 47 7 and 36 1 to 14 5 respectively fig 4b 4d but not for 1 1 1 tca and 1 1 dca the shortage of electrons under limited conditions also results in more accumulation of degradation intermediates for example the percentage of vc increased from 73 9 to 92 9 from electron excess to limited conditions for the degradation of 1 1 2 tca and that of acetylene for chlorinated ethenes increased from 1 2 to 13 2 to 18 9 95 7 this is because the further transformation of vc and acetylene was disfavored in the competition with parent chcs for electrons fig s17 and s18 the results reinforce the significance of investigations on the performance of s nzvi under conditions representative of napl contaminated sites 4 conclusions despite the widely reported effect of sulfidation of nzvi on the considerably enhanced degradation of tce we showed that this effect is compound specific for chcs with the enhancements for chlorinated ethenes being more significant than for chlorinated methanes and ethanes our results show that the mechanisms of improved electron conductivity and reduced hydrophobicity described in the literature explain the sulfidation induced phenomena associated with tce degradation may not be adequate to describe the varied improvement for a series of chcs investigated in this study the specific enhancement for chlorinated ethenes is likely because their reduction mechanism is different from the other chcs which may involve more of h than direct electron transfer and sulfidation probably favors the h mediated reduction however further studies are required to provide more direct evidence on the role of h in s nzvi for contaminant degradation and the dominant mechanism for specific compounds the results indicate that the degradation mechanisms associated with each contaminant may be a determining factor leading to the improved reactivity with sulfidation and the identification of such mechanisms is essential to understand the performance of s nzvi or other remediation agents at contaminated sites we showed that sulfidation resulted in highly improved or comparable d max of all the investigated chcs compared to nzvi but not all the electrons in the s nzvi can be utilized by chcs even under electron limited conditions chlorinated methanes and ethanes can achieve comparable d max by s nzvi under electron limited conditions despite their rate constant values spanning 3 orders of magnitude the results imply that d max which incorporates the effects of reactivity electron utilization degradation pathways and product distribution may serve as a more appropriate indicator than degradation rate constants for assessment of the overall performance of s nzvi for various chcs the presence of partially dechlorinated products which are toxic and more recalcitrant to reductive dechlorination indicates that the substantial decay of parent chcs does not always translate into the complete success and risk reduction of remediation efforts assessments on the degradation efficiency should include the degradation products our results show that sulfidation helps the generation of non chlorinated benign products by suppressing the hydrogenolysis and dehydrochlorination pathways for chlorinated methanes and ethanes however whether and how different s fe ratios synthesis methods iron and sulfur precursors and the nano versus micron size would affect the reduction pathways to generate different intermediates and products requires further investigations future

16878,finding a low cost and effective alternative to noble metal based catalyst has long been concerned in wastewater treatment and organic transformation this work developed a highly efficient sewage sludge based catalyst via a simple one step pyrolysis method and for the first time applied it in the catalytic reduction of nitrophenols due to the higher content of graphitic nitrogen abundant defect sites and low electron transfer resistance sewage sludge derived biochar obtained at 800 c ssbc 800 exhibits the best catalytic performance with the reaction rate of 0 48 min 1 and turnover frequency for 4 nitrophenol calculated to be 1 25 10 4 mmol mg 1 min 1 which is comparable to or even superior than some reported noble metal based catalyst moreover ssbc 800 showed good recyclability of 90 4 nitrophenol removal within 8 min after 4 runs and maintained high catalytic activity in reduction of other substituent nitrophenols such as 2 nitrophenol 0 54 min 1 3 nitrophenol 0 61 min 1 and 2 4 dinitrophenol 0 18 min 1 and in real water samples indicating its practical applicability the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra and electrochemical characterization demonstrate that ssbc 800 accelerates the dissociation of bh4 to form active hydrogen which is the main species responsible for 4 nitrophenol reduction while electron transfer reaction involving the surface bound hydride derived from the intimate contact between bh4 and ssbc 800 plays an important role in this process this research not only provides a novel valorization pathway for sewage sludge but also sheds new light on further designing of carbon based catalyst for nitrophenol reduction graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge biochar nitrophenol reduction graphitic n electron transfer 1 introduction nitrophenols are a class of highly toxic and non biodegradable organic pollutant commonly found in the waste effluents of dyeing pesticide and pharmaceutical industries gupta et al 2014 oturan et al 2000 it is highly desired to find a convenient and effective method for the removal of nitrophenols from aquatic environment and catalytic hydrogenation is the most attractive one the hydrogenation product aminophenols are less toxic easier to be mineralized than nitrophenols more importantly aminophenols can be used as chemical intermediates for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals dyes corrosion inhibitor agrochemicals and imaging agents which bring economic benefits vaidya et al 2003 xia et al 2016 therefore conversion of nitrophenols into value added aminophenols is of great importance both in environmental remediation and industrial synthesis cao et al 2020 das et al 2019 in the hydrogenation reduction of nitrophenols noble metal based catalysts e g ag au pd and pt firstly attract widespread attention due to their high catalytic efficiency fu et al 2018 2019 gao et al 2018 xi et al 2016 however the excessive cost and limited supplies of noble metals restricted their large scale application besides metal based catalysts tend to suffer from problems of poor durability easy agglomeration and metal leaching which could cause deactivation of the catalyst and secondary pollution wang et al 2018 in comparison carbocatalyst is an ideal candidate owing to the high stability readily availability environmental friendliness and biocompatible ren et al 2021 yang et al 2020 several carbon based catalysts such as reduced graphene oxide hu et al 2015 boron and nitrogen doped porous carbons van nguyen et al 2019 and nitrogen doped graphene kong et al 2013 have been proved to show certain catalytic ability in the hydrogenation reaction however the preparation processes of those carbon based catalysts are complicated and their catalytic efficiency is inferior to metal based catalyst it is essential to find an economic and highly efficient carbon based catalyst for this application sewage sludge is a mass produced byproduct of wastewater treatment with an estimation of 40 million tons every year yang et al 2015a conversion of sewage sludge into functional catalyst such as biochar is a promising method not only for sludge disposal but also for low cost catalyst preparation cieślik et al 2015 until now sewage sludge based carbon materials has been explored for some applications such as adsorbent smith et al 2009 capacitance materials xu et al 2020 and persulfate activation yu et al 2019 however less attention has been given on the field of catalytic hydrogenation it is well documented that pristine carbon material is almost inert for the hydrogenation reaction due to the deficient of active site but introduction of heteroatom especially nitrogen atoms can modulate the charge distribution of the carbon structure and create new charged site yang et al 2015b for example kong et al 2013 found that the pure graphene was inactive in the 4 nitrophenol 4 np reduction while n doped graphene displayed high catalytic efficiency in this reaction with the carbon atom adjacent to the doped nitrogen atom serving as the reactive site in addition as the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrophenols is a reduction process the catalyst with high electron transfer ability must be beneficial for the reaction sewage sludge is a complex matrix with abundant organic matter and inorganic minerals specially the microorganisms and extracellular polymeric substances in sewage sludge provide the possibility of nitrogen doping parnaudeau and dignac 2007 syed hassan et al 2017 the nitrogen species in the sewage sludge could form active cn bond after high temperature carbonization thus providing the possible site for the hydrogenation reaction meanwhile during pyrolysis the conductive graphitic carbon lattice was gradually formed within the biochar which is favorable for fast electron transfer zhang et al 2018 it is therefore supposed that the sewage sludge derived biochar ssbc also exhibit high catalytic activity for this organic reaction this study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of ssbc as a catalyst in the hydrogenation reduction of 4 np considering the unique structure properties e g n doping and graphitic structure and the advantage of waste recycling the ssbc is expected to be a promising low cost and powerful alternative to noble metal based catalyst for nitrophenols reduction the impact of pyrolysis temperature on the specific surface area pore size surface chemistry and correlative catalytic performance is investigated the catalytic active site inside the biochar and possible reaction mechanism of 4 np reduction are explored moreover the effectiveness in real water samples and the reduction of other nitrophenols e g 2 np 3 np and 2 4 dnp are also studied to verify the practical applicability 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials sodium borohydride nabh4 4 nitrophenol 4 np 2 nitrophenol 2 np 3 nitrophenol 3 np 2 4 dinitrophenol 2 4 dnp were purchased from sinopharm chemical regent co ltd shanghai china all the chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification 2 2 preparation of sewage sludge derived biochar the municipal sewage sludge used in this study was collected from xingsha wastewater treatment plant in changsha china the obtained solid was firstly dried in the oven at 105 c for 72 h then grounded and sifted through 100 mesh sieves for further use subsequently the sample was carbonated in a tubular furnace at the designed temperature for 120 min under constant nitrogen flow heating rate 5 c min nitrogen flow rate 100 ml min the final products pyrolyzed at the temperature of 400 600 800 and 1000 c were denoted as ssbc 400 ssbc 600 ssbc 800 and ssbc 1000 respectively 2 3 catalytic reduction of nitrophenols the catalytic performance of as prepared sewage sludge derived biochar was evaluated by reduction of nitrophenols in the presence of nabh4 typically 10 mg of ssbc was added to 50 ml of freshly prepared 4 np aqueous 0 2 mm solution followed by adding 0 076 g of nabh4 under continuous stirring at room temperature at a certain time interval 2 5 ml of the reaction solution was withdrawn filtrated with 0 45 μm filter membrane and measured using uv vis spectrophotometer at the absorbance wavelength of 400 nm for the recycling test after each reaction the catalyst was separated by centrifuge 8000 rpm 30 min rinsed several times with ultrapure water and then dried in an oven for 24 h before the next reaction the reduction of other nitrophenols was conducted following the same procedure of 4 np adsorption evaluation of 4 np was carried out as the same conditions of catalytic test without the addition of nabh4 an additional sorption isotherms experiment with ssbc 800 was also performed to investigate the adsorption behavior of 4 np details can be seen in text s1 in addition the catalytic activity of ssbc in real water sample including tape water lake water and river water respectively collected from laboratory lake of peach and hsiang river in changsha china was also conducted all those water samples were filtered with 0 45 μm membrane to remove the impurities detailed information about those water samples were provided in table s1 2 4 characterization the morphology of the catalyst was characterized by scanning electron microscope sem zeiss merlin fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra ftir spectrum gx usa within the wavenumbers ranging from 400 to 4000 cm 1 was used to investigate the surface functional group the specific surface area ssa and pore size distribution were acquired from the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm curve conducted on the quantachrome novawin nova 2000e x ray diffraction xrd were examined on bruker d8 advance using ni filtered cu kα radiation λ 1 54 å x ray photoelectron spectra xps was carried out by a thermo escalab 250 instrument under an al kαx ray radiation to study the element composition the element content was determined using an elemental analyzer vario micro cube zeta potential was determined with the zeta sizer nano zs malvern electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra were conducted on the bruker emx a300 raman spectra were obtained using the labram hr800 at the excitation wavelength of 532 nm electrochemical measurements including the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and chronoamperometry were performed on a chi 760e electrochemical workstation and details were shown in text s2 the uv vis spectrum was recorded with a uv 2700 spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 3600 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization of sewage sludge derived biochar the n2 adsorption desorption curves were conducted to determine the ssa of ssbc and related dates were presented in table s2 the ssa of ssbc400 was 44 15 m2 g and the value increased to 49 33 m2 g 62 29 m2 g 98 47 m2 g for ssbc 600 ssbc 800 and ssbc 1000 respectively table s2 during the pyrolysis of biomass three products were generated solid carbon matrix i e biochar volatile organic matters e g bio oil and non condensable gasses e g co co2 ch4 h2 h2s kambo and dutta 2015 with the increase of pyrolysis temperature the biomass molecular evolves towards a condensed structure along with the release of more organic matters and gasses from carbon matrix which may be the main reason for the larger ssa of ssbc 1000 collard and blin 2014 generally higher total pore volume and ssa could provide more active sites for the reaction and absorb more reactants thus resulting in a higher reactive activity as shown in fig 1 a the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms were in type iv model along with a distinct h2 hysteresis loop implying the existence of mesoporous network this was consistent with the pore size distribution plot with the average pore diameter of ssbc in the range of 5 6 7 5 nm fig s1 the mesoporous structure is beneficial to the diffusion of reactants and provides more access to inner reactive site during the catalysis process yang et al 2015b the surface functional group of ssbc was revealed by ftir spectra in fig 1b with the increase of pyrolysis temperature the intensity of peak corresponding to oh stretching 3624 cm 1 nh asymmetric stretching 3417 cm 1 conh 1433 cm 1 and co cn 1023 cm 1 gradually decreased or even disappeared indicating the decomposition fracture of carbohydrates and amino acid in sewage sludge during the calcination process the same decreasing trend was also observed for the bond of aliphatic ch stretching at 2853 2964 cm 1 due to the demethylation and dehydration reaction zhang et al 2015 meanwhile the development of cc stretching vibration 1584 cm 1 together with the reduction of co stretching vibration 1614 cm 1 was observed at temperature above 600 c which suggested the increased graphitization at higher pyrolysis temperature yu et al 2019 the weaker intensity of ssbc 1000 at 688 cm 1 and 785 cm 1 for aromatic ch wagging vibrations than that of ssbc 400 also indicated the intensified polymerization at ssbc 1000 zhang et al 2018 besides the peak belonging to si o vibration at 1089 cm 1 was detected implying the existence of inorganic minerals in ssbc zhang et al 2015 similarly the xrd pattern also showed that except for carbon sio2 with the characteristic value of around 26 6 was observed for all the ssbc samples fig 1c the origin of sio2 in ssbc was probably from the inorganic minerals such as glass and sand inherent in sewage sludge raman spectroscopy was carried out to identify the structure change of ssbc fig 1d all the samples exhibit three typical peaks namely a d band at about 1379 cm 1 a g band at about 1597 cm 1 and a 2d band at about 2800 cm 1 generally the d peak breathing vibration mode a1g symmetry is associated with defect edges of the graphitic carbon and the g peak tangential mode e2g symmetry is typically assigned to the graphite structure keown et al 2007 the ratio of id ig is expected to decrease with pyrolysis temperature due to the increased extent of graphitization but it is not the same for biomass derived carbon from the graphite g c to tetrahedral amorphous carbon ta c the amorphization trajectory divided it into three stage g c to nanocrystalline graphite ng c ng c to amorphous one a c and a c to ta c robertson and ferrari 2000 the transition process of ssbc could be in the reverse direction of stage 2 due to the presence of 2d band and the blue shift of g band from 1581 cm 1 characteristic position of graphite to 1597 cm 1 fig 1d therefore the d and g band in this study showed different features from graphite the d band and g band of ssbc were broad and overlapped especially in low pyrolysis temperature implying the multiphase of ssbc mcdonald wharry et al 2013 during the process of carbonization the biomass went through dehydrogenation polymerisation and condensation and become increasingly aromatic the aromatic clusters generated by the stacks of aromatic molecules were graphitic like and is generally termed as nanocrystalline therefore the microstructure of ssbc can be regarded as nanocrystallites sp2 carbon embedded in the amorphous matrix tsaneva et al 2014 in this case the d band in ssbc could be ascribed to the vibration of sp2 bonded carbon atoms in hexagonal aromatic rings and the development of d band represents greater structure ordering while the g band is likely to be aromatic ring breathing rather than e2g vibrations of crystalline graphite keown et al 2007 due to the incomplete carbonization large numbers of small aromatic ring still exist in ssbc 400 accordingly the increment of id ig from 400 to 800 c was attributed to the increasing proportion of larger aromatic rings with at least six rings in ssbc however at higher pyrolysis temperature of 1000 c the id ig of the sample decreased which could be the competition between ring growth and decrease in structure defects manifesting further approach of biochar structure to graphite the element composition of ssbc was shown in table s2 it can be seen that with the increase of pyrolysis temperature the content of c h o and n has gradually decreased which is ascribed to the decomposition of organic moleculars within the sewage sludge meanwhile the h c n c and o c ratio dropped steadily with pyrolysis temperature indicating the gradual carbonization and aromatization of ssbc zhang et al 2015 the xps survey proved the existence of carbon nitrogen oxygen element fig s2 which was consistent with the result of eds mapping fig s3 the deconvolution of c1s spectrum exhibited four peaks at about 284 74 ev 285 78 ev 287 30 ev and 288 96 ev which corresponding to cc cc coh cn co cn and π π shake up respectively fig s4 noteworthy the π π shake up only appeared at the temperature above 600 c and the content increased from 2 48 ssbc 600 to 3 57 ssbc 1000 which indicated the improved graphitization at higher pyrolysis temperature this is consistent with the decreasing ratio of o c from 0 71 to 0 29 table s1 heteroatom nitrogen has been reported as active site for hydrogenation reaction the high resolution n1s spectrum can be divided into four peaks i e pyridinic n around 398 67 ev pyrrolic n around 400 44 ev graphitic n around 401 21 ev and oxidized n around 403 55 ev fig 2 in ssbc 400 the nitrogen species display as pyridinic n 21 87 and the pyrrolic n 78 13 with an enhanced pyrolysis temperature to 600 c a new peak assigning to graphitic n emerged and the relative content increased from 9 05 ssbc 600 to 71 94 ssbc 800 and further to 90 09 ssbc 1000 meanwhile the fraction of pyrrolic n gradually decreased and eventually disappeared at the temperature above 800 c which indicates the transformation order of n species from pyrrolic n to pyridinic n and finally to graphitic n it is well known that graphitic n has higher thermal stability than the other two nitrogen species 3 2 catalytic performance of ssbc for nitrophenols reduction the catalytic activity of ssbc was evaluated by hydrogenation reduction of 4 np with nabh4 and the reaction was investigated by uv vis spectroscopy upon the addition of nabh4 the maximum absorption peak of 4 np shifted from 317 nm to 400 nm along with the color change from light yellow to dark yellow which is ascribed to the transformation of 4 nitrophenol to 4 nitrophenolate ion under alkaline conditions fig s5a qiu et al 2014 obviously nabh4 alone was incapable of reducing 4 np due to the kinetic barrier fig s5b after addition of ssbc 800 the absorption peak at 400 nm diminished and vanished finally while a new absorption peak at 300 nm that derived from 4 aminophenol 4 ap emerged and became gradually intensified cao et al 2020 simultaneously as the reaction proceeded the color of the system turned from yellow into colorless fig 3 a these results demonstrated the successful reduction of 4 np to 4 ap by ssbc 800 as pyrolysis temperature largely affect the property of biochar the catalytic hydrogenation of 4 np by different ssbc was studied fig s5c ssbc 400 was nearly inert for the reaction while ssbc 600 showed 58 conversion of 4 np within 20 min significantly ssbc 800 presented a promising catalytic activity of 100 4 np conversion at 8 min fig 3a and fig s5c however compared to ssbc 800 further increasing the pyrolysis temperature to 1000 c resulted in a slight decrease in 4 np conversion fig 3b showed the kinetic plots of the reduction reactions the approximately linear relationship between in ct c0 versus time demonstrated well fit of the reaction by pseudo first order kinetics the calculated reaction rate constant kapp for ssbc 600 ssbc 800 and ssbc 1000 was 0 046 0 48 and 0 26 min 1 respectively turn over frequency tof which was defined as the amount of reactant molecules converted to products by per unit mass of catalyst per minute was used to assess the catalytic efficiency the tof of ssbc was calculated to be 1 25 10 4 mmol mg 1 min 1 which was comparable to and even superior to some reported noble metal based catalyst such as au c 1 2 10 5 liu et al 2011 ag pei ahb 4 4 10 5 gao et al 2018 and pd cnt rgo 1 2 10 4 zhang et al 2014 table s3 noteworthy compared with those noble metal based materials with high cost and complicated production process the raw material used in this study was derived from the industrial waste sewage sludge and the preparation process was much simple and cost effective text s2 3 3 possible mechanism to determine whether the reaction process follows the eley rideal mechanism or the langmuir hinshelwood mechanism the dependence of kapp on the concentration of 4 np and nabh4 is investigated fig s6 showed a nonlinear relationship between them and the kapp increased with the increasing concentration of nabh4 while gradually decreased with 4 np in the eley rideal model where only one of the reactants adsorbed on the catalyst surface the kapp was supposed to increase as the rising of 4 np concentration this is contradictory with the experiment results the entire process was more suited to the langmuir hinshelwood model which illustrated that both the 4 np and bh4 adsorbed on the catalyst before interfacial electron transfer narayanan and devaki 2015 in this case 4 np at higher concentration led to a larger coverage of the catalyst surface and left with little accessible surface for the bh4 which consequently inhibit the reaction rate this can be further confirmed by the fitting results of adsorption isotherms as shown in fig s7 instead a higher concentration of nabh4 makes more bh4 occupy on the catalyst surface and thus accelerates the reaction to further illustrate the possible reaction process in the ssbc nabh4 4 np system epr spectra with 5 5 dimethylpyrroline n oxide dmpo as the spin trapper was conducted to demonstrate the existence of h radical species as shown in fig 4 a no signal appeared in the mixture solution of 4 np and ssbc 800 after addition of nabh4 an obvious signal that consisted of a 1 1 1 triplet of 1 2 1 triplet ah 22 57 g and an 16 62 g were detected which was assigned to the dmpoh adduct nguyen et al 2019 it is proposed that the active h species is derived from the dissociation of b h bond and ssbc accelerate the abstraction of hydrogen this is consistent with the results of chronoamperometric test fig 4b addition of nabh4 or 4 np had no obvious influence on the current output with bare electrode interestingly a significant current response was observed after the injection of nabh4 with the ssbc 800 electrode which was probably ascribed to the strong interaction between ssbc 800 and nabh4 it was supposed that ssbc 800 stimulated the hydrogenation of nabh4 to form more hydride on the surface of ssbc electrode besides the current increase was also detected after 4 np addition due to the electron transfer from ssbc to 4 np based on the above discussion a reasonable catalytic mechanism is presented which follows the langmuir hinshelwood model scheme 1 bh4 reacts with the active site of ssbc to form the surface bound hydride in the meantime 4 np is adsorbed onto the surface of ssbc 800 and captures the active hydrogen species and electrons from hydride complex finally the generated 4 ap desorbs from the active sites in this process the catalyst function as the adsorption sites for reactant molecules and electron transfer system between electron donor bh4 and electron acceptor 4 np as the kapp of ssbc follows the order of ssbc 800 ssbc 1000 ssbc 600 ssbc 400 we now discuss some possible factors affecting the catalytic activity larger pore size is favorable for the mass transportation of reactant to the inner reaction site of catalyst however it can be observed from fig s1 that all the ssbc sample have similar pore size pore size can t be the reason for the catalytic difference of ssbc with the increasing of pyrolysis temperature the specific area of ssbc increased slightly from 44 15 to 98 47 m2 g table s2 higher surface area would increase the adsorption of 4 np and thus facilitate the reaction rates the adsorption capacity of ssbc follows the order of ssbc 1000 ssbc 800 ssbc 600 ssbc 400 fig s8 the enhanced surface area may partly explain the higher catalytic activity of ssbc 800 and ssbc 1000 but can t explain the exceptional catalytic activity of ssbc 800 fig s8a as mentioned above electron transfer is an essential process for the reduction conversion of 4 np the charge transfer capacity of ssbc is assessed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis among which the semicircle diameter represents the interfacial charge transfer resistance fig s9b as expected the conductivity of ssbc increases with the pyrolysis temperature a significant decrease of semicircle size can be found when pyrolysis temperature of ssbc rising from 600 c to 800 c in this stage the aromatic rings are largely formed and thus ssbc 800 exhibits a much higher degree of graphitization than ssbc 600 compared with amorphous carbon graphitic carbon is more favorable for electron transfer however ssbc 1000 with higher conductivity showed lower kapp than ssbc 800 indicating that conductivity was not a determining factor for the catalytic hydrogenation of 4 np it is proposed that the high reactivity is derived from the active site in ssbc to exclude the effect of trace leaching metals on the catalytic hydrogenation of 4 np the dissolved fraction of ssbc 800 was extracted for this reaction no decrease of 4 np absorption peak was observed in fig s10a demonstrating the negligible contribution of leaching metals to the 4 np removal besides it was found that ssbc 800 after acid treatment rinsed with 2 m hcl for 48 h to remove the metal impurities exhibited comparable catalytic activity with the original one fig s10b thus we suppose that the as prepared carbon materials provide the catalytic site for this reaction previous studies reported that the carbon atom next to doped nitrogen could act as the catalytic site in the reduction reaction of 4 np kong et al 2013 wang et al 2017 introduction of heteroatoms nitrogen in the carbon frame induces the charge redistribution of the adjacent carbon atoms and endows it with metallic electronic structure and desirable activity in our study the change of catalytic activity as the increasing of pyrolysis temperature was probably ascribed to the transformation of n doping forms in ssbc pyridinic n and pyrrolic n present a weak correlation with the value of kapp fig s9c and d however a proximately positive liner relationship between the content of graphitic n and kapp was observed implying the significance of graphitic n in this reaction fig 5 a this is consistent with previous studies yang et al 2015b and shan et al 2019 also found a high correlation between the catalytic activity of 4 np reduction and the content of graphitic n yang et al 2016 demonstrated that graphitic n exhibited the lowest adsorption energy with nitroarenes and the longest n o bonds which may be the reason for its higher catalytic activity than other type of nitrogen species in the n doped graphene in addition the defect is an active adsorption site for hydrogen molecules hu et al 2015 2020 the higher ratio of id ig in ssbc 800 than ssbc 1000 indicates lower level of regularity and a higher defect density in ssbc 800 which might also contribute to its higher catalytic activity fig 5b moreover since the catalytic hydrogenation of 4 np proceeds when both the reactants diffuse and adsorb onto the surface of catalysts adsorption of reactants on the surface of ssbc is a critical step for the catalytic reaction as both the 4 nitrophenolate and bh4 are negative charged in the reaction solutions the catalyst with higher zeta potential should have stronger attraction for the reactants the zeta potential of ssbc follows the order of ssbc 800 ssbc 600 ssbc 1000 which could partly explain the higher catalytic activity of ssbc 800 table s4 based on above discussions the exceptional activity of ssbc 800 can be attributed to the high graphitic n content abundant defects site and relative higher zeta potential 3 4 catalytic reduction of different nitrophenols to explore the universality of ssbc 800 catalyst the catalytic hydrogenation of other nitrophenols was also conducted fig 6 a c showed that all the nitrophenols were convereted efficiently the strong absorption peaks of 2 np 414 nm 3 np 393 nm 2 4 dnp 448 nm decreased gradually as the reaction proceeded and new peaks belonging to the reaction products appeared the color of all reaction mixture changed to colorless finally indicating the complete hydrogenation of them as shown in fig 6d the kapp of nitrophenols are in the order of 3 np 2 np 4 np 2 4 dnp which is attributed to the combined effect of conjugation inductive and steric effect it is generally believed that 2 np and 4 np have a relatively stable group due to the conjugation effect that makes the negative charge of the phenoxide ion delocalized onto the nitro group in terms of the inductive effect 2 np with shorter distance between oh and no2 is supposed to have stronger inductive effect than 4 np and such interactions result in more positively charged nitrogen atoms in 2 np in the hydrogenation reaction nitrogen atom with positive charge is easier to be attacked by the negative charged active hydrogen and thus 2 np have high reactivity than 4 np as to the 3 np no direct conjugation effect happens and the stabilization of nitro group only relies on the weak inductive effect guo et al 2016 as a result 3 np has higher reactivity than 2 np and 4 np in addition compared with mononitrophenol 2 4 dnp has larger steric resistance and is expected to exhibit the lowest reactivity sun et al 2014 3 5 catalyst stability the reusability of the catalysts is an important factor for the potential application as displayed in fig 7 a after recycled for 4 times ssbc 800 remains 90 removal of 4 np within 8 min indicating the good durability the xrd pattern of used ssbc 800 presents no much difference from the fresh one fig s11a the id ig of spent ssbc 800 is 1 416 similar to ssbc 800 fig s11b the partial deactivation of ssbc 800 was probably caused by the adsorption of reaction products after mild heat treatment at 350 c the catalytic activity of ssbc 800 can be perfectly recovered 3 6 applicability in environmental water samples to estimate the catalytic efficiency of ssbc 800 in real aquatic systems reduction of 4 np in different water samples including tap water lake water and river water were also performed the kapp in different water sample follows the order of ultrapure water tap water 0 44 min 1 lake water 0 23 min 1 river water river water 0 22 min 1 it has been reported that dissolved oxygen do ions solution ph and natural organic matter could affect the reaction process to investigate the impact of do the catalytic reduction of 4 np was conducted with n2 protected fig s12a showed no significant difference in 4 np removal between the n2 conditions and atmosphere conditions besides it was found that inorganic ions including cl so4 2 and no3 k and na had negligible impact on the reduction of 4 np fig s12b interestingly the presence of ca2 and mg2 slightly accelerated this reaction it was speculated that ca2 and mg2 could stimulate the hydrogen release from nabh4 and thus provided more hydrogen resource for active h formation previous study also reported that alkaline earth metal halide could enhance the reactivity of nabh4 periasamy and thirumalaikumar 2000 therefore it was proposed that the lower kapp in real water samples was ascribed to the different solution ph table s1 to prove this hypothesis the effect of ph on the reduction of 4 np by ssbc 800 was investigated as presented in fig s12c with the increasing of solution ph from 3 71 to 9 12 the kapp decrease from 0 55 min 1 to 0 43 min 1 since the reduction of 4 np follows the langmuir hinshelwood model where adsorption of reactants is a critical step the stronger adsorption attraction contributes to higher catalytic activity the phssbc 800 is at about 3 8 which means that the surface of ssbc 800 is negative charged at ph 3 8 fig s13 meanwhile 4 np exists dominantly in the form of nitrophenolate anionic at ph 7 therefore the alkaline environment of lake water ph 7 58 and river water ph 7 65 would weaken the adsorption force among ssbc 800 bh4 and 4 np consequently reducing the catalytic activity moreover at higher solution ph the surface of ssbc 800 was more negative charged resulting in a larger electrostatic repulsion between bh4 and ssbc 800 in this case the kapp in real water samples is lower than ultrapure water however it can be seen that the impact of ph on the catalytic reduction of 4 np was not significant and cannot fully explain the much lower kapp in lake water and river water natural organic matter is a common interfering substance in water and humic acid ha is selected as the representative organic matter to evaluate its influence on 4 np reduction introduction of ha had impeded the reduction of 4 np and the kapp decrease from 0 48 min 1 to 0 17 min 1 in the range of 0 40 mg l ha fig s12d the inhibition effect was probably attributed to the competition between ha and reactants for available site on ssbc 800 wang et al 2019 according to table s1 the total organic carbon of lake water and river water is much higher than ultrapure water which may be the main reason for its lower kapp noteworthy although the kapp is suppressed in real water samples to some extent as shown in fig s14 4 np can be still completely converted in a relatively short time demonstrating the feasibility of ssbc 800 in practical application 4 conclusions based on the concept of changing waste to wealth sewage sludge was used as the precursor to prepare a highly efficient carbocatalyst by direct thermal treatment for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrophenols the impact of pyrolysis temperature on the structure and the subsequent catalytic efficiency of ssbc were investigated ssbc 800 possesses high content of graphitic nitrogen abundant defects site and good electron transfer capacity which is favorable for the hydrogenation reaction the tof of ssbc 800 for 4 np reduction 1 25 10 4 mmol mg 1 min 1 is comparable with some reported noble metal based catalyst but possessing the advantage of lower cost and simpler synthesis route moreover ssbc 800 shows good recyclability 90 4 np conversion within 8 min after 4 runs and catalytic universality for various substituent nitrophenols e g 2 np 3 np and 2 4 dnp although the catalytic activity was somewhat inhibited in real water samples it still maintains a relatively high conversion efficiency of 4 np demonstrating the possibility for practical application in the reaction process ssbc 800 interacts with bh4 to form surface bound hydride that subsequently attacks the adsorbed 4 np during which electron transfer happens from bh4 electron donor to 4 np electron acceptor with ssbc 800 as the electron shuttle this is the first research investigating the potential of biochar as a high efficient catalyst in nitrophenol reduction which not only broadens the application scope of biochar but also provides guidelines for further designing of carbon based catalyst in the wastewater treatment in addition this smart conversion of sewage sludge into value added material will inspire future studies to explore the biowaste as precursors for various functional materials declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no

16878,finding a low cost and effective alternative to noble metal based catalyst has long been concerned in wastewater treatment and organic transformation this work developed a highly efficient sewage sludge based catalyst via a simple one step pyrolysis method and for the first time applied it in the catalytic reduction of nitrophenols due to the higher content of graphitic nitrogen abundant defect sites and low electron transfer resistance sewage sludge derived biochar obtained at 800 c ssbc 800 exhibits the best catalytic performance with the reaction rate of 0 48 min 1 and turnover frequency for 4 nitrophenol calculated to be 1 25 10 4 mmol mg 1 min 1 which is comparable to or even superior than some reported noble metal based catalyst moreover ssbc 800 showed good recyclability of 90 4 nitrophenol removal within 8 min after 4 runs and maintained high catalytic activity in reduction of other substituent nitrophenols such as 2 nitrophenol 0 54 min 1 3 nitrophenol 0 61 min 1 and 2 4 dinitrophenol 0 18 min 1 and in real water samples indicating its practical applicability the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra and electrochemical characterization demonstrate that ssbc 800 accelerates the dissociation of bh4 to form active hydrogen which is the main species responsible for 4 nitrophenol reduction while electron transfer reaction involving the surface bound hydride derived from the intimate contact between bh4 and ssbc 800 plays an important role in this process this research not only provides a novel valorization pathway for sewage sludge but also sheds new light on further designing of carbon based catalyst for nitrophenol reduction graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge biochar nitrophenol reduction graphitic n electron transfer 1 introduction nitrophenols are a class of highly toxic and non biodegradable organic pollutant commonly found in the waste effluents of dyeing pesticide and pharmaceutical industries gupta et al 2014 oturan et al 2000 it is highly desired to find a convenient and effective method for the removal of nitrophenols from aquatic environment and catalytic hydrogenation is the most attractive one the hydrogenation product aminophenols are less toxic easier to be mineralized than nitrophenols more importantly aminophenols can be used as chemical intermediates for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals dyes corrosion inhibitor agrochemicals and imaging agents which bring economic benefits vaidya et al 2003 xia et al 2016 therefore conversion of nitrophenols into value added aminophenols is of great importance both in environmental remediation and industrial synthesis cao et al 2020 das et al 2019 in the hydrogenation reduction of nitrophenols noble metal based catalysts e g ag au pd and pt firstly attract widespread attention due to their high catalytic efficiency fu et al 2018 2019 gao et al 2018 xi et al 2016 however the excessive cost and limited supplies of noble metals restricted their large scale application besides metal based catalysts tend to suffer from problems of poor durability easy agglomeration and metal leaching which could cause deactivation of the catalyst and secondary pollution wang et al 2018 in comparison carbocatalyst is an ideal candidate owing to the high stability readily availability environmental friendliness and biocompatible ren et al 2021 yang et al 2020 several carbon based catalysts such as reduced graphene oxide hu et al 2015 boron and nitrogen doped porous carbons van nguyen et al 2019 and nitrogen doped graphene kong et al 2013 have been proved to show certain catalytic ability in the hydrogenation reaction however the preparation processes of those carbon based catalysts are complicated and their catalytic efficiency is inferior to metal based catalyst it is essential to find an economic and highly efficient carbon based catalyst for this application sewage sludge is a mass produced byproduct of wastewater treatment with an estimation of 40 million tons every year yang et al 2015a conversion of sewage sludge into functional catalyst such as biochar is a promising method not only for sludge disposal but also for low cost catalyst preparation cieślik et al 2015 until now sewage sludge based carbon materials has been explored for some applications such as adsorbent smith et al 2009 capacitance materials xu et al 2020 and persulfate activation yu et al 2019 however less attention has been given on the field of catalytic hydrogenation it is well documented that pristine carbon material is almost inert for the hydrogenation reaction due to the deficient of active site but introduction of heteroatom especially nitrogen atoms can modulate the charge distribution of the carbon structure and create new charged site yang et al 2015b for example kong et al 2013 found that the pure graphene was inactive in the 4 nitrophenol 4 np reduction while n doped graphene displayed high catalytic efficiency in this reaction with the carbon atom adjacent to the doped nitrogen atom serving as the reactive site in addition as the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrophenols is a reduction process the catalyst with high electron transfer ability must be beneficial for the reaction sewage sludge is a complex matrix with abundant organic matter and inorganic minerals specially the microorganisms and extracellular polymeric substances in sewage sludge provide the possibility of nitrogen doping parnaudeau and dignac 2007 syed hassan et al 2017 the nitrogen species in the sewage sludge could form active cn bond after high temperature carbonization thus providing the possible site for the hydrogenation reaction meanwhile during pyrolysis the conductive graphitic carbon lattice was gradually formed within the biochar which is favorable for fast electron transfer zhang et al 2018 it is therefore supposed that the sewage sludge derived biochar ssbc also exhibit high catalytic activity for this organic reaction this study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of ssbc as a catalyst in the hydrogenation reduction of 4 np considering the unique structure properties e g n doping and graphitic structure and the advantage of waste recycling the ssbc is expected to be a promising low cost and powerful alternative to noble metal based catalyst for nitrophenols reduction the impact of pyrolysis temperature on the specific surface area pore size surface chemistry and correlative catalytic performance is investigated the catalytic active site inside the biochar and possible reaction mechanism of 4 np reduction are explored moreover the effectiveness in real water samples and the reduction of other nitrophenols e g 2 np 3 np and 2 4 dnp are also studied to verify the practical applicability 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials sodium borohydride nabh4 4 nitrophenol 4 np 2 nitrophenol 2 np 3 nitrophenol 3 np 2 4 dinitrophenol 2 4 dnp were purchased from sinopharm chemical regent co ltd shanghai china all the chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification 2 2 preparation of sewage sludge derived biochar the municipal sewage sludge used in this study was collected from xingsha wastewater treatment plant in changsha china the obtained solid was firstly dried in the oven at 105 c for 72 h then grounded and sifted through 100 mesh sieves for further use subsequently the sample was carbonated in a tubular furnace at the designed temperature for 120 min under constant nitrogen flow heating rate 5 c min nitrogen flow rate 100 ml min the final products pyrolyzed at the temperature of 400 600 800 and 1000 c were denoted as ssbc 400 ssbc 600 ssbc 800 and ssbc 1000 respectively 2 3 catalytic reduction of nitrophenols the catalytic performance of as prepared sewage sludge derived biochar was evaluated by reduction of nitrophenols in the presence of nabh4 typically 10 mg of ssbc was added to 50 ml of freshly prepared 4 np aqueous 0 2 mm solution followed by adding 0 076 g of nabh4 under continuous stirring at room temperature at a certain time interval 2 5 ml of the reaction solution was withdrawn filtrated with 0 45 μm filter membrane and measured using uv vis spectrophotometer at the absorbance wavelength of 400 nm for the recycling test after each reaction the catalyst was separated by centrifuge 8000 rpm 30 min rinsed several times with ultrapure water and then dried in an oven for 24 h before the next reaction the reduction of other nitrophenols was conducted following the same procedure of 4 np adsorption evaluation of 4 np was carried out as the same conditions of catalytic test without the addition of nabh4 an additional sorption isotherms experiment with ssbc 800 was also performed to investigate the adsorption behavior of 4 np details can be seen in text s1 in addition the catalytic activity of ssbc in real water sample including tape water lake water and river water respectively collected from laboratory lake of peach and hsiang river in changsha china was also conducted all those water samples were filtered with 0 45 μm membrane to remove the impurities detailed information about those water samples were provided in table s1 2 4 characterization the morphology of the catalyst was characterized by scanning electron microscope sem zeiss merlin fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra ftir spectrum gx usa within the wavenumbers ranging from 400 to 4000 cm 1 was used to investigate the surface functional group the specific surface area ssa and pore size distribution were acquired from the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm curve conducted on the quantachrome novawin nova 2000e x ray diffraction xrd were examined on bruker d8 advance using ni filtered cu kα radiation λ 1 54 å x ray photoelectron spectra xps was carried out by a thermo escalab 250 instrument under an al kαx ray radiation to study the element composition the element content was determined using an elemental analyzer vario micro cube zeta potential was determined with the zeta sizer nano zs malvern electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra were conducted on the bruker emx a300 raman spectra were obtained using the labram hr800 at the excitation wavelength of 532 nm electrochemical measurements including the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and chronoamperometry were performed on a chi 760e electrochemical workstation and details were shown in text s2 the uv vis spectrum was recorded with a uv 2700 spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 3600 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization of sewage sludge derived biochar the n2 adsorption desorption curves were conducted to determine the ssa of ssbc and related dates were presented in table s2 the ssa of ssbc400 was 44 15 m2 g and the value increased to 49 33 m2 g 62 29 m2 g 98 47 m2 g for ssbc 600 ssbc 800 and ssbc 1000 respectively table s2 during the pyrolysis of biomass three products were generated solid carbon matrix i e biochar volatile organic matters e g bio oil and non condensable gasses e g co co2 ch4 h2 h2s kambo and dutta 2015 with the increase of pyrolysis temperature the biomass molecular evolves towards a condensed structure along with the release of more organic matters and gasses from carbon matrix which may be the main reason for the larger ssa of ssbc 1000 collard and blin 2014 generally higher total pore volume and ssa could provide more active sites for the reaction and absorb more reactants thus resulting in a higher reactive activity as shown in fig 1 a the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms were in type iv model along with a distinct h2 hysteresis loop implying the existence of mesoporous network this was consistent with the pore size distribution plot with the average pore diameter of ssbc in the range of 5 6 7 5 nm fig s1 the mesoporous structure is beneficial to the diffusion of reactants and provides more access to inner reactive site during the catalysis process yang et al 2015b the surface functional group of ssbc was revealed by ftir spectra in fig 1b with the increase of pyrolysis temperature the intensity of peak corresponding to oh stretching 3624 cm 1 nh asymmetric stretching 3417 cm 1 conh 1433 cm 1 and co cn 1023 cm 1 gradually decreased or even disappeared indicating the decomposition fracture of carbohydrates and amino acid in sewage sludge during the calcination process the same decreasing trend was also observed for the bond of aliphatic ch stretching at 2853 2964 cm 1 due to the demethylation and dehydration reaction zhang et al 2015 meanwhile the development of cc stretching vibration 1584 cm 1 together with the reduction of co stretching vibration 1614 cm 1 was observed at temperature above 600 c which suggested the increased graphitization at higher pyrolysis temperature yu et al 2019 the weaker intensity of ssbc 1000 at 688 cm 1 and 785 cm 1 for aromatic ch wagging vibrations than that of ssbc 400 also indicated the intensified polymerization at ssbc 1000 zhang et al 2018 besides the peak belonging to si o vibration at 1089 cm 1 was detected implying the existence of inorganic minerals in ssbc zhang et al 2015 similarly the xrd pattern also showed that except for carbon sio2 with the characteristic value of around 26 6 was observed for all the ssbc samples fig 1c the origin of sio2 in ssbc was probably from the inorganic minerals such as glass and sand inherent in sewage sludge raman spectroscopy was carried out to identify the structure change of ssbc fig 1d all the samples exhibit three typical peaks namely a d band at about 1379 cm 1 a g band at about 1597 cm 1 and a 2d band at about 2800 cm 1 generally the d peak breathing vibration mode a1g symmetry is associated with defect edges of the graphitic carbon and the g peak tangential mode e2g symmetry is typically assigned to the graphite structure keown et al 2007 the ratio of id ig is expected to decrease with pyrolysis temperature due to the increased extent of graphitization but it is not the same for biomass derived carbon from the graphite g c to tetrahedral amorphous carbon ta c the amorphization trajectory divided it into three stage g c to nanocrystalline graphite ng c ng c to amorphous one a c and a c to ta c robertson and ferrari 2000 the transition process of ssbc could be in the reverse direction of stage 2 due to the presence of 2d band and the blue shift of g band from 1581 cm 1 characteristic position of graphite to 1597 cm 1 fig 1d therefore the d and g band in this study showed different features from graphite the d band and g band of ssbc were broad and overlapped especially in low pyrolysis temperature implying the multiphase of ssbc mcdonald wharry et al 2013 during the process of carbonization the biomass went through dehydrogenation polymerisation and condensation and become increasingly aromatic the aromatic clusters generated by the stacks of aromatic molecules were graphitic like and is generally termed as nanocrystalline therefore the microstructure of ssbc can be regarded as nanocrystallites sp2 carbon embedded in the amorphous matrix tsaneva et al 2014 in this case the d band in ssbc could be ascribed to the vibration of sp2 bonded carbon atoms in hexagonal aromatic rings and the development of d band represents greater structure ordering while the g band is likely to be aromatic ring breathing rather than e2g vibrations of crystalline graphite keown et al 2007 due to the incomplete carbonization large numbers of small aromatic ring still exist in ssbc 400 accordingly the increment of id ig from 400 to 800 c was attributed to the increasing proportion of larger aromatic rings with at least six rings in ssbc however at higher pyrolysis temperature of 1000 c the id ig of the sample decreased which could be the competition between ring growth and decrease in structure defects manifesting further approach of biochar structure to graphite the element composition of ssbc was shown in table s2 it can be seen that with the increase of pyrolysis temperature the content of c h o and n has gradually decreased which is ascribed to the decomposition of organic moleculars within the sewage sludge meanwhile the h c n c and o c ratio dropped steadily with pyrolysis temperature indicating the gradual carbonization and aromatization of ssbc zhang et al 2015 the xps survey proved the existence of carbon nitrogen oxygen element fig s2 which was consistent with the result of eds mapping fig s3 the deconvolution of c1s spectrum exhibited four peaks at about 284 74 ev 285 78 ev 287 30 ev and 288 96 ev which corresponding to cc cc coh cn co cn and π π shake up respectively fig s4 noteworthy the π π shake up only appeared at the temperature above 600 c and the content increased from 2 48 ssbc 600 to 3 57 ssbc 1000 which indicated the improved graphitization at higher pyrolysis temperature this is consistent with the decreasing ratio of o c from 0 71 to 0 29 table s1 heteroatom nitrogen has been reported as active site for hydrogenation reaction the high resolution n1s spectrum can be divided into four peaks i e pyridinic n around 398 67 ev pyrrolic n around 400 44 ev graphitic n around 401 21 ev and oxidized n around 403 55 ev fig 2 in ssbc 400 the nitrogen species display as pyridinic n 21 87 and the pyrrolic n 78 13 with an enhanced pyrolysis temperature to 600 c a new peak assigning to graphitic n emerged and the relative content increased from 9 05 ssbc 600 to 71 94 ssbc 800 and further to 90 09 ssbc 1000 meanwhile the fraction of pyrrolic n gradually decreased and eventually disappeared at the temperature above 800 c which indicates the transformation order of n species from pyrrolic n to pyridinic n and finally to graphitic n it is well known that graphitic n has higher thermal stability than the other two nitrogen species 3 2 catalytic performance of ssbc for nitrophenols reduction the catalytic activity of ssbc was evaluated by hydrogenation reduction of 4 np with nabh4 and the reaction was investigated by uv vis spectroscopy upon the addition of nabh4 the maximum absorption peak of 4 np shifted from 317 nm to 400 nm along with the color change from light yellow to dark yellow which is ascribed to the transformation of 4 nitrophenol to 4 nitrophenolate ion under alkaline conditions fig s5a qiu et al 2014 obviously nabh4 alone was incapable of reducing 4 np due to the kinetic barrier fig s5b after addition of ssbc 800 the absorption peak at 400 nm diminished and vanished finally while a new absorption peak at 300 nm that derived from 4 aminophenol 4 ap emerged and became gradually intensified cao et al 2020 simultaneously as the reaction proceeded the color of the system turned from yellow into colorless fig 3 a these results demonstrated the successful reduction of 4 np to 4 ap by ssbc 800 as pyrolysis temperature largely affect the property of biochar the catalytic hydrogenation of 4 np by different ssbc was studied fig s5c ssbc 400 was nearly inert for the reaction while ssbc 600 showed 58 conversion of 4 np within 20 min significantly ssbc 800 presented a promising catalytic activity of 100 4 np conversion at 8 min fig 3a and fig s5c however compared to ssbc 800 further increasing the pyrolysis temperature to 1000 c resulted in a slight decrease in 4 np conversion fig 3b showed the kinetic plots of the reduction reactions the approximately linear relationship between in ct c0 versus time demonstrated well fit of the reaction by pseudo first order kinetics the calculated reaction rate constant kapp for ssbc 600 ssbc 800 and ssbc 1000 was 0 046 0 48 and 0 26 min 1 respectively turn over frequency tof which was defined as the amount of reactant molecules converted to products by per unit mass of catalyst per minute was used to assess the catalytic efficiency the tof of ssbc was calculated to be 1 25 10 4 mmol mg 1 min 1 which was comparable to and even superior to some reported noble metal based catalyst such as au c 1 2 10 5 liu et al 2011 ag pei ahb 4 4 10 5 gao et al 2018 and pd cnt rgo 1 2 10 4 zhang et al 2014 table s3 noteworthy compared with those noble metal based materials with high cost and complicated production process the raw material used in this study was derived from the industrial waste sewage sludge and the preparation process was much simple and cost effective text s2 3 3 possible mechanism to determine whether the reaction process follows the eley rideal mechanism or the langmuir hinshelwood mechanism the dependence of kapp on the concentration of 4 np and nabh4 is investigated fig s6 showed a nonlinear relationship between them and the kapp increased with the increasing concentration of nabh4 while gradually decreased with 4 np in the eley rideal model where only one of the reactants adsorbed on the catalyst surface the kapp was supposed to increase as the rising of 4 np concentration this is contradictory with the experiment results the entire process was more suited to the langmuir hinshelwood model which illustrated that both the 4 np and bh4 adsorbed on the catalyst before interfacial electron transfer narayanan and devaki 2015 in this case 4 np at higher concentration led to a larger coverage of the catalyst surface and left with little accessible surface for the bh4 which consequently inhibit the reaction rate this can be further confirmed by the fitting results of adsorption isotherms as shown in fig s7 instead a higher concentration of nabh4 makes more bh4 occupy on the catalyst surface and thus accelerates the reaction to further illustrate the possible reaction process in the ssbc nabh4 4 np system epr spectra with 5 5 dimethylpyrroline n oxide dmpo as the spin trapper was conducted to demonstrate the existence of h radical species as shown in fig 4 a no signal appeared in the mixture solution of 4 np and ssbc 800 after addition of nabh4 an obvious signal that consisted of a 1 1 1 triplet of 1 2 1 triplet ah 22 57 g and an 16 62 g were detected which was assigned to the dmpoh adduct nguyen et al 2019 it is proposed that the active h species is derived from the dissociation of b h bond and ssbc accelerate the abstraction of hydrogen this is consistent with the results of chronoamperometric test fig 4b addition of nabh4 or 4 np had no obvious influence on the current output with bare electrode interestingly a significant current response was observed after the injection of nabh4 with the ssbc 800 electrode which was probably ascribed to the strong interaction between ssbc 800 and nabh4 it was supposed that ssbc 800 stimulated the hydrogenation of nabh4 to form more hydride on the surface of ssbc electrode besides the current increase was also detected after 4 np addition due to the electron transfer from ssbc to 4 np based on the above discussion a reasonable catalytic mechanism is presented which follows the langmuir hinshelwood model scheme 1 bh4 reacts with the active site of ssbc to form the surface bound hydride in the meantime 4 np is adsorbed onto the surface of ssbc 800 and captures the active hydrogen species and electrons from hydride complex finally the generated 4 ap desorbs from the active sites in this process the catalyst function as the adsorption sites for reactant molecules and electron transfer system between electron donor bh4 and electron acceptor 4 np as the kapp of ssbc follows the order of ssbc 800 ssbc 1000 ssbc 600 ssbc 400 we now discuss some possible factors affecting the catalytic activity larger pore size is favorable for the mass transportation of reactant to the inner reaction site of catalyst however it can be observed from fig s1 that all the ssbc sample have similar pore size pore size can t be the reason for the catalytic difference of ssbc with the increasing of pyrolysis temperature the specific area of ssbc increased slightly from 44 15 to 98 47 m2 g table s2 higher surface area would increase the adsorption of 4 np and thus facilitate the reaction rates the adsorption capacity of ssbc follows the order of ssbc 1000 ssbc 800 ssbc 600 ssbc 400 fig s8 the enhanced surface area may partly explain the higher catalytic activity of ssbc 800 and ssbc 1000 but can t explain the exceptional catalytic activity of ssbc 800 fig s8a as mentioned above electron transfer is an essential process for the reduction conversion of 4 np the charge transfer capacity of ssbc is assessed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis among which the semicircle diameter represents the interfacial charge transfer resistance fig s9b as expected the conductivity of ssbc increases with the pyrolysis temperature a significant decrease of semicircle size can be found when pyrolysis temperature of ssbc rising from 600 c to 800 c in this stage the aromatic rings are largely formed and thus ssbc 800 exhibits a much higher degree of graphitization than ssbc 600 compared with amorphous carbon graphitic carbon is more favorable for electron transfer however ssbc 1000 with higher conductivity showed lower kapp than ssbc 800 indicating that conductivity was not a determining factor for the catalytic hydrogenation of 4 np it is proposed that the high reactivity is derived from the active site in ssbc to exclude the effect of trace leaching metals on the catalytic hydrogenation of 4 np the dissolved fraction of ssbc 800 was extracted for this reaction no decrease of 4 np absorption peak was observed in fig s10a demonstrating the negligible contribution of leaching metals to the 4 np removal besides it was found that ssbc 800 after acid treatment rinsed with 2 m hcl for 48 h to remove the metal impurities exhibited comparable catalytic activity with the original one fig s10b thus we suppose that the as prepared carbon materials provide the catalytic site for this reaction previous studies reported that the carbon atom next to doped nitrogen could act as the catalytic site in the reduction reaction of 4 np kong et al 2013 wang et al 2017 introduction of heteroatoms nitrogen in the carbon frame induces the charge redistribution of the adjacent carbon atoms and endows it with metallic electronic structure and desirable activity in our study the change of catalytic activity as the increasing of pyrolysis temperature was probably ascribed to the transformation of n doping forms in ssbc pyridinic n and pyrrolic n present a weak correlation with the value of kapp fig s9c and d however a proximately positive liner relationship between the content of graphitic n and kapp was observed implying the significance of graphitic n in this reaction fig 5 a this is consistent with previous studies yang et al 2015b and shan et al 2019 also found a high correlation between the catalytic activity of 4 np reduction and the content of graphitic n yang et al 2016 demonstrated that graphitic n exhibited the lowest adsorption energy with nitroarenes and the longest n o bonds which may be the reason for its higher catalytic activity than other type of nitrogen species in the n doped graphene in addition the defect is an active adsorption site for hydrogen molecules hu et al 2015 2020 the higher ratio of id ig in ssbc 800 than ssbc 1000 indicates lower level of regularity and a higher defect density in ssbc 800 which might also contribute to its higher catalytic activity fig 5b moreover since the catalytic hydrogenation of 4 np proceeds when both the reactants diffuse and adsorb onto the surface of catalysts adsorption of reactants on the surface of ssbc is a critical step for the catalytic reaction as both the 4 nitrophenolate and bh4 are negative charged in the reaction solutions the catalyst with higher zeta potential should have stronger attraction for the reactants the zeta potential of ssbc follows the order of ssbc 800 ssbc 600 ssbc 1000 which could partly explain the higher catalytic activity of ssbc 800 table s4 based on above discussions the exceptional activity of ssbc 800 can be attributed to the high graphitic n content abundant defects site and relative higher zeta potential 3 4 catalytic reduction of different nitrophenols to explore the universality of ssbc 800 catalyst the catalytic hydrogenation of other nitrophenols was also conducted fig 6 a c showed that all the nitrophenols were convereted efficiently the strong absorption peaks of 2 np 414 nm 3 np 393 nm 2 4 dnp 448 nm decreased gradually as the reaction proceeded and new peaks belonging to the reaction products appeared the color of all reaction mixture changed to colorless finally indicating the complete hydrogenation of them as shown in fig 6d the kapp of nitrophenols are in the order of 3 np 2 np 4 np 2 4 dnp which is attributed to the combined effect of conjugation inductive and steric effect it is generally believed that 2 np and 4 np have a relatively stable group due to the conjugation effect that makes the negative charge of the phenoxide ion delocalized onto the nitro group in terms of the inductive effect 2 np with shorter distance between oh and no2 is supposed to have stronger inductive effect than 4 np and such interactions result in more positively charged nitrogen atoms in 2 np in the hydrogenation reaction nitrogen atom with positive charge is easier to be attacked by the negative charged active hydrogen and thus 2 np have high reactivity than 4 np as to the 3 np no direct conjugation effect happens and the stabilization of nitro group only relies on the weak inductive effect guo et al 2016 as a result 3 np has higher reactivity than 2 np and 4 np in addition compared with mononitrophenol 2 4 dnp has larger steric resistance and is expected to exhibit the lowest reactivity sun et al 2014 3 5 catalyst stability the reusability of the catalysts is an important factor for the potential application as displayed in fig 7 a after recycled for 4 times ssbc 800 remains 90 removal of 4 np within 8 min indicating the good durability the xrd pattern of used ssbc 800 presents no much difference from the fresh one fig s11a the id ig of spent ssbc 800 is 1 416 similar to ssbc 800 fig s11b the partial deactivation of ssbc 800 was probably caused by the adsorption of reaction products after mild heat treatment at 350 c the catalytic activity of ssbc 800 can be perfectly recovered 3 6 applicability in environmental water samples to estimate the catalytic efficiency of ssbc 800 in real aquatic systems reduction of 4 np in different water samples including tap water lake water and river water were also performed the kapp in different water sample follows the order of ultrapure water tap water 0 44 min 1 lake water 0 23 min 1 river water river water 0 22 min 1 it has been reported that dissolved oxygen do ions solution ph and natural organic matter could affect the reaction process to investigate the impact of do the catalytic reduction of 4 np was conducted with n2 protected fig s12a showed no significant difference in 4 np removal between the n2 conditions and atmosphere conditions besides it was found that inorganic ions including cl so4 2 and no3 k and na had negligible impact on the reduction of 4 np fig s12b interestingly the presence of ca2 and mg2 slightly accelerated this reaction it was speculated that ca2 and mg2 could stimulate the hydrogen release from nabh4 and thus provided more hydrogen resource for active h formation previous study also reported that alkaline earth metal halide could enhance the reactivity of nabh4 periasamy and thirumalaikumar 2000 therefore it was proposed that the lower kapp in real water samples was ascribed to the different solution ph table s1 to prove this hypothesis the effect of ph on the reduction of 4 np by ssbc 800 was investigated as presented in fig s12c with the increasing of solution ph from 3 71 to 9 12 the kapp decrease from 0 55 min 1 to 0 43 min 1 since the reduction of 4 np follows the langmuir hinshelwood model where adsorption of reactants is a critical step the stronger adsorption attraction contributes to higher catalytic activity the phssbc 800 is at about 3 8 which means that the surface of ssbc 800 is negative charged at ph 3 8 fig s13 meanwhile 4 np exists dominantly in the form of nitrophenolate anionic at ph 7 therefore the alkaline environment of lake water ph 7 58 and river water ph 7 65 would weaken the adsorption force among ssbc 800 bh4 and 4 np consequently reducing the catalytic activity moreover at higher solution ph the surface of ssbc 800 was more negative charged resulting in a larger electrostatic repulsion between bh4 and ssbc 800 in this case the kapp in real water samples is lower than ultrapure water however it can be seen that the impact of ph on the catalytic reduction of 4 np was not significant and cannot fully explain the much lower kapp in lake water and river water natural organic matter is a common interfering substance in water and humic acid ha is selected as the representative organic matter to evaluate its influence on 4 np reduction introduction of ha had impeded the reduction of 4 np and the kapp decrease from 0 48 min 1 to 0 17 min 1 in the range of 0 40 mg l ha fig s12d the inhibition effect was probably attributed to the competition between ha and reactants for available site on ssbc 800 wang et al 2019 according to table s1 the total organic carbon of lake water and river water is much higher than ultrapure water which may be the main reason for its lower kapp noteworthy although the kapp is suppressed in real water samples to some extent as shown in fig s14 4 np can be still completely converted in a relatively short time demonstrating the feasibility of ssbc 800 in practical application 4 conclusions based on the concept of changing waste to wealth sewage sludge was used as the precursor to prepare a highly efficient carbocatalyst by direct thermal treatment for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrophenols the impact of pyrolysis temperature on the structure and the subsequent catalytic efficiency of ssbc were investigated ssbc 800 possesses high content of graphitic nitrogen abundant defects site and good electron transfer capacity which is favorable for the hydrogenation reaction the tof of ssbc 800 for 4 np reduction 1 25 10 4 mmol mg 1 min 1 is comparable with some reported noble metal based catalyst but possessing the advantage of lower cost and simpler synthesis route moreover ssbc 800 shows good recyclability 90 4 np conversion within 8 min after 4 runs and catalytic universality for various substituent nitrophenols e g 2 np 3 np and 2 4 dnp although the catalytic activity was somewhat inhibited in real water samples it still maintains a relatively high conversion efficiency of 4 np demonstrating the possibility for practical application in the reaction process ssbc 800 interacts with bh4 to form surface bound hydride that subsequently attacks the adsorbed 4 np during which electron transfer happens from bh4 electron donor to 4 np electron acceptor with ssbc 800 as the electron shuttle this is the first research investigating the potential of biochar as a high efficient catalyst in nitrophenol reduction which not only broadens the application scope of biochar but also provides guidelines for further designing of carbon based catalyst in the wastewater treatment in addition this smart conversion of sewage sludge into value added material will inspire future studies to explore the biowaste as precursors for various functional materials declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no

16879,a novel electrochemical advanced oxidation system aos has been recently developed for water disinfection where iodide is used to generate active iodine species in situ however the presence of iodide during water disinfection can lead to the formation of iodinated disinfection byproducts i dbps which have been shown to be more cyto and genotoxic than their chlorinated and brominated analogs in this study the formation of dbps was assessed in ultrapure water river water and secondary wastewater effluents treated by the aos a comprehensive total organic halogen and target dbp analysis was used that included 25 unregulated dbps and the total organic halogen tox quantified as total organic chlorine tocl total organic bromine tobr and total organic iodine toi ultrapure water disinfection only quantified iodoform tim at a maximum concentration of 0 90 0 05 µg l river water results show that toi increase from 1 3 0 3 µg l before disinfection t 0 to a maximum of 3 5 1 1 µg l tim and bromodiiodomethane bdim were the only targeted iodo trihalomethanes i thms that were quantified with a maximum total i thm concentration of 0 44 µg l secondary wastewater effluent disinfection results show that toi increased from 1 8 0 3 µg l t 0 to a maximum concentration of 35 3 0 3 µg l iodide and iodate were the main iodinated species exiting the aos system with a iodine recovery of 94 101 the results from this study show that the aos formed low levels of iodinated dbps in treated water sources that are comparable to the levels found in disinfected drinking water and wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection by products advanced oxidation electrochemical water treatment total organic halogen i thms toi 1 introduction water disinfection has been used worldwide in drinking water and wastewater to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms that cause waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid however water disinfection unintentionally produces disinfection byproducts dbps when chemical disinfectants react with natural organic matter anthropogenic pollutants and halide salts in source waters since dbps were first discovered in 1974 rook 1974 more than 700 dbps have been identified in disinfected waters krasner et al 2006a richardson 2011 richardson and kimura 2016 2020 richardson and postigo 2016 richardson and temes 2018 however only 12 dbps are currently monitored by canadian drinking water utilities health canada 2020 four trihalomethanes thms and five haloacetic acids make up the majority of regulated dbps and are predominantly formed by chlorination the most commonly used disinfectant crittenden 2012 alternative disinfectants i e combined chlorine can reduce the formation of regulated dbps however the use of alternative disinfectants may promote the formation of other unregulated classes of dbps including haloacetonitriles haloacetamides haloaldehydes haloketones halonitromethanes nitrosamines and iodinated thms i thms crittenden 2012 although these unregulated dbps are found at lower concentrations they have shown to be more cyto and genotoxic than regulated dbps muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2008 2004 richardson et al 2008 richardson and plewa 2020 wagner and plewa 2017 although chlorine s effectiveness as a disinfectant has many benefits it also has several disadvantages including ineffectiveness against certain pathogens driedger et al 2000 and generation of potentially toxic dbps one alternative to chemical disinfection is electrochemical disinfection the capability to treat wastewaters at ambient temperature and pressure low solid waste production and limited chemical addition while maintaining sufficient disinfection and decontamination makes electrochemical disinfection appealing feng et al 2016 however disadvantages include low treatment rates due to limited electrode surface area high energy consumption high suspended solids and the potential to generate dbps in recent years high surface area electrodes and electrochemical cells have been developed and optimized that address some disadvantages of electrochemical disinfection feng et al 2016 martínez huitle and ferro 2006 a new technology known as the advanced oxidation system aos is a carbon based packed bed electrochemical water treatment system that uses a graphite based electrode bed material iodide as its principle electrochemically active input chemical and a proprietary silica based spacer to separate electrodes within the device code et al 2020 the aos generates in situ active iodine species that serve as disinfectants at the anodic chamber code et al 2020 active iodine species are known to be effective oxidants against microbial pathogens gottardi 1999 iodine interferes with bacterial cellular function by oxidizing or iodinating proteins nucleotides of dna or rna or fatty acids ultimately leading to cell death arnitz et al 2015 gottardi 1999 mcdonnell and russell 1999 okochi et al 2005 while molecular iodine i2 is generally thought to be the main iodine species responsible for bacterial inactivation hypoiodious acid hoi and periodate io4 are also known to exhibit bactericidal properties arnitz et al 2015 gottardi 1999 okochi et al 2005 recent results have shown that the aos device exhibits high inactivation of bacteria escherichia coli 6 log reduction with low current density 0 6 ma cm2 and a contact time of 5 min moustafa et al 2021 another recent study found that municipal wastewater spiked with benzo a pyrene or 17β estradiol and treated by the aos removed the observed biological effects of these organic pollutants on examined aquatic organisms daphnia zebrafish and rainbow trout he et al 2021 additionally treatment of wastewater effluents by the aos reduced the bacterial load 103 colony forming unit cfu ml in untreated wastewaters to non detect he et al 2021 the aos contains cathodic cells that reduce electro generated oxidizing compounds and eliminate the release of oxidants in treated waters code et al 2020 as with all chemical disinfectants the active iodine species generated by the aos could potentially form dbps iodine based oxidants have been shown to react with organic molecules and natural organic matter to form iodinated dbps i dbps bichsel and von gunten 2000 bougeard et al 2010 jones et al 2012 2011 toxicological studies conducted in vitro have shown that i dbps are more toxic than brominated dbps br dbps and significantly more toxic than chlorine containing dbps cl dbps muellner et al 2007 wagner and plewa 2017 for example within its chemical class iodoform lc50 of 6 6 10 5 m has been found to be two orders of magnitude more cytotoxic than regulated bromoform lc50 of 3 96 10 3 m and chloroform lc50 of 9 62 10 3 m plewa and wagner 2009 wagner and plewa 2017 the higher toxicity of i dbps may pose a potential threat to public health richardson and plewa 2020 the objective of this study was to holistically evaluate dbp formation in ultrapure river and wastewater treated with the aos dbps were comprehensively analyzed with total organic halogen and target dbp analysis total organic halogen is a hollistic approach that can quantify the total concentration of halogenated compounds by halogen type that is total organic chlorine tocl total organic bromine tobr and total organic iodine toi hua and reckhow 2006 kimura et al 2017 kristiana et al 2015 yang et al 2014 the tox analysis provides critical information because it can holistically quantify all the halogenated organic material that is often missed by target methods cuthbertson et al 2019 krasner et al 2006b additionally positive correlations have been found between tox concentration and toxicity of disinfected waters ersan et al 2019 kristiana et al 2020 also toi has been linked to higher toxicity in disinfected waters yang et al 2014 target methods based on gas chromatography gc tandem mass spectrometry ms ms and gc ms that included i dbps dichloroiodomethane chlorodiiodomethane bromochloroiodomethane dibromoiodomethane bromodiiodomethane iodoform and iodoacetontirile were also used in this study ortega hernandez et al 2021 further this work studied the iodine speciation as a result of electrochemical disinfection by analyzing various iodine species in aos treated waters this study will help assess the formation of dbps by aos treatment of waters with varying levels of dissolved organic carbon results from this study will be used to improve the aos design and scale up and provide safe water by achieving high microbial inactivation and low formation of toxic dbps 2 experimental section 2 1 reagents and solutions potassium iodide 99 0 sodium chloride 99 0 sodium bromide 99 0 sodium iodate 99 0 sodium

micropure uv uf system thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa 2 2 advanced oxidation system water samples were treated with the advanced oxidation system aos that was patented us 10 654 731 b2 and created by biolargo water edmonton canada aos operational parameter optimization was performed in a 6 chamber aos reactor packed with graphite foam entegris and a proprietary spacer however dbp formation potential of water samples was performed using a 12 chamber aos reactor fig 1 the reactor was made of pvc with a height of 18 cm and an internal diameter of 4 5 cm platinum electrodes inserted into the anodes and cathodes were connected in parallel to the positive and negative outlets of a dc power supply bk precision respectively untreated waters were pumped into the aos by a

and 60 min the number of viable of e coli cells after treatment were determined by spiral plating whitney automatic spiral plater of 50 µl aliquots on lb agar plates were incubated at 37 c for 18 20 h before each experiment the aos was rinsed with ki for 30 min followed by ultrapure water for another 60 min e coli was not detected in the rinse cycle prior to sample treatment the aos underwent a preconditioning step of 30 min with 10 mg l ki in ultrapure water at 20 ma followed by a 30 minute ultrapure water rinse with no electricity applied for this study 6 l of untreated waters were processed at a flow rate of 80 ml min and a current of 20 ma across the aos total current density 1 25 ma cm2 total anodic active sites and hydraulic residence time of 3 6 mins electricity was

performance was assessed using three different water matrices ultrapure water river water and secondary wastewater effluent each water matrix was repeated in triplicate 2 3 sample collection river and municipal wastewater were collected in calgary ab canada river water was collected from the bow river approximately 4 km downstream of a major wastewater treatment plant on february 6th 2020 secondary

target dbps were quantified using two gas chromatography mass spectrometry ms methods an agilent 7890b gc with multi mode inlet coupled to a 7000c agilent tandem mass spectrometer ms ms santa clara ca was used to quantify 25 unregulated dbps including 7 iodinated dbps in ultrapure and river water samples iodoacetonitrile dichloroiodomethane bromochloroiodomethane dibromoiodomethane chlorodiiodomethane bromodiiodomethane iodoform details of the analytical method are detailed elsewhere ortega hernandez et al 2021 in brief samples were extracted by liquid liquid extraction with 3 3

regulated dbps in wastewater samples using an atomx xyz teledyne tekmar mason oh purge and trap p t system coupled to an hp 6890 gc coupled to a 5973 ms santa clara ca this method also quantified 7 iodinated dbps previously mentioned in the gc ms ms method in addition to 4 trihalomethanes chloroform bromoform dichlorobromomethane dibromochloromethane 6 haloacetonitriles trichloroacetonitrile

method detection limits were between 0 02 19 3 μg l all dbp analysis were quantified in triplicate dissolved organic carbon was measured using a shimadzu toc v kyoto japan according to standard method 5310 b baird et al 2017 other water quality parameters were determined with a hach loveland co usa 2100an turbidimeter shimadzu uv 2700 and mettler toledo seven compact ph meter 3 results and discussion 3 1 aos operational conditions the aos operational conditions were optimized to achieve a 6 log inactivation of e coli the optimal current density flow rate and ki concentration were identified and shown in fig 2 in fig 2 with 2 5 mg l ki the lowest ki concentration tested a 6 log inactivation was observed after 15 min of run time however for 5 mg l and 10 mg l ki e coli counts decreased below the quantification limit loq 2 6 within 5 min of run time representing an approximate 6 log reduction therefore aos treatment and dbp evaluation of water samples were conducted using the following conditions 1 25 ma cm2 total anodic active surfaces 80 ml min and 5 ppm ki the optimal current density required to achieve a 6 log reduction using the aos is similar to published values for e coli inactivation using other electrochemical cells ghasemian et al 2017 schmalz et al 2009 3 2 ultrapure water ultrapure water was treated by the aos to evaluate the formation of dbps in the absence of organic matter tox results are shown in fig 3 tocl and tobr throughout the run were on average 10 4 0 7 µg l as cl and 0 5 0 1 µg l as br respectively no measurable toi was detected trace levels of tocl could possibly be contributed from the ultrapure water system the tox sample process potassium iodide that was added to ultrapure water or the aos apparatus controls with ultrapure water processed through the tox analysis in triplicate had a tocl concentration of 7 3 2 7 µg l therefore the main contributor for tocl seems to originate from the ultrapure water and tox analysis controls did not detect tobr overall in the absence of organic matter a low formation of dbps was expected target dbp analysis only quantified a small amount of iodoform tim formation at 15 0 78 0 06 µg l and 45 0 90 0 05 µg l minute samples tim was not detected prior to aos treatment it is possible that tim might be produced from the reaction of active iodine species with graphite contained in the aos system 3 3 river water results aos treated river water was analyzed for tocl tobr toi and target dbps results are plotted in figs 4 and 5 toi results in fig 4 shows an initial concentration of 1 3 0 3 µg l as i followed by a slight increase during the first 35 min of aos operation with a maximum concentration of 3 5 1 1 µg l as i toi degradation was observed in the later half of aos operation with a final concentration of 2 0 1 0 µg l as i normalized toi values by doc concentration showed that a maximum of 0 41 µg l as i per mg of doc was formed tocl and tobr appeared to be consistent throughout the run with an average concentration of 9 8 1 2 µg l as cl and 1 8 0 01 µg l as br respectively these results suggest that tocl and tobr are not produced by the aos system for all three tox measurements in fig 4 a slow increase was observed for the first 5 min that could have been attributed to ultrapure water used in the aos cleaning procedure ultrapure water appears to be exiting the system during the first few minutes of operation which may dilute the tox measurements overall tox results showed a low toi formation 1 3 3 5 µg l as i despite processing river water with a relatively high doc concentration of 8 5 mg l in a study by pan et al toi was measured in chlorinated tap water across six major cities in china toi was quantified between 3 2 to 16 4 µg l with a mean of 7 8 µg l pan and zhang 2013 i thms were the only target dbps detected with a maximum total concentration of 0 44 0 02 µg l at 45 min of operation fig 5 dichloroiodomethane dcim bromochloroiodomethane bcim bromodiiodomethane bdim and iodoform tim were all quantified in aos processed samples where tim represented 84 of the total i thms however only bdim and tim were not detected in controls without aos treatment these results suggest that i thms with higher iodine substitution were preferentially formed in the aos system which has also been observed with other disinfectants in drinking water tugulea et al 2018 tugela et al found that water treatment systems with higher levels of iodide 10 µg l and higher iodide to bromide ratios primarily formed tim it was suggested that a higher iodide concentration might lead to higher concentration of active iodine species i e hypoiodous acid which can then react with the organic matter multiple times leading to a higher degree of iodination tugulea et al 2018 moustafa et al suggested that active iodine species within the aos are generated and accumulated within the anodic regions of the device moustafa et al 2021 it is hypothesized that a higher concentration of active iodine species within the anodic region may have led to multiple iodination reactions to preferentially form iodoform although i thms quantified in this study were characterized in disinfected river and wastewater most dbp literature have reported values primarily in drinking water and the following comparison is provided for context i thms quantified in this study were within range of i thms reported in drinking water richardson et al 2008 tugulea et al 2018 wei et al 2013 in a nationwide canadian study characterized six i thms across 64 drinking water utilities and revealed that i thms were detected in 46 out of 64 water treatment systems tugulea et al 2018 total i thm concentration were quantified between 0 02 μg l and 21 66 μg l with a median concentration of 0 358 µg l in the winter and 0 748 µg l in the summer also it was found that the highest i thm levels occurred in utilities where their water sources had naturally occurring ammonia as well as high bromide and iodide concentrations tugulea et al 2018 it is well understood that chlorine can react with ammonia to produce chloramines which in turn may form hypoiodous acid hoi in iodide containing waters bichsel and von gunten 1999 hoi can then react with organic matter to produce i thms bichsel and von gunten 2000 this was also observed in a study by smith et al where dbp formation in natural waters treated with chlorine and iodine were compared smith et al 2010 richardson et al tested chlorinated and chloraminated drinking water from 22 cities in the united states and canada for five iodo acids and two iodo trihalomethanes richardson et al 2008 they found both iodo trihalomethanes in all 22 plants with maximum levels of 10 2 µg l mean of 1 34 µg l for bcim and 7 9 µg l for dcim mean of 1 59 µg l in china wei et al measured 9 regulated haloacetic acids 4 regulated thms iodoacetic acid and iodoform tim in drinking waters from 13 water treatment plants in shanghai wei et al 2013 their study revealed that tim was present in all water treatment plants with a maximum concentration of 1 25 µg l and a median of 0 85 µg l in the winter and 0 40 µg l in the summer for the huangpu river i thm concentrations found in drinking water utilities across canada the united states and china have shown to be slightly higher than i thms produced by aos disinfected river water 3 4 secondary wastewater effluent dbp formation was also evaluated in aos treated secondary wastewater effluents tox results plotted in fig 6 show a toi increase during aos operation reaching a maximum concentration of 35 3 0 3 µg l as i after 45 min followed by a slight decrease towards the end of the run to 30 5 3 0 µg l as i a similar trend was observed in river water where toi slightly decreased towards the end of the run however normalized toi values by doc concentration had a maximum of 1 18 µg l as i per mg of doc which is 2 7x greater than river water it is possible that the different composition found in effluent organic matter compared to natural organic matter may react more readily with active iodine species nam et al 2008 despite both water samples having similar suva254 weishaar et al 2003 in a study by pan et al chlorinated secondary wastewater effluents in china produced a toi mean value of 14 1 µg l pan and zhang 2013 which was lower but within range than toi generated from the aos initial tocl and tobr values prior to aos treatment at t 0 were 99 4 3 9 µg l as cl and 5 2 0 1 µg l as br respectively tocl and tobr were 10 8 and 2 1 times higher in secondary wastewater effluents compared to river water possibly because wastewater may contain halogenated anthropogenic compounds that are not well removed from secondary treatment such as pesticides brominated flame retardants and pharmaceuticals barco bonilla et al 2010 chen et al 2015 2006 de boer et al 2003 deng et al 2015 kim et al 2013 köck schulmeyer et al 2013 metcalfe et al 2003 after aos treatment tocl and tobr remained consistent throughout the run with average values of 96 5 1 4 µg l as cl and 4 7 0 1 µg l as br respectively these results show that the aos treatment slightly reduces tocl and tobr that is initially present in wastewater effluents target dbp detected in processed waters are shown in fig 7 which include 4 thms 3 i thms and one han however the four thms dibromochloromethane dichlorobromomethane bromoform and chloroform dichloroacetonitrile and bromochloroiodomethane were already present in controls the aos system appears to form the higher substituted iodinated species cdim and tim due to high excess of iodide present 3 8 mg l as i this agrees with the obtained results from the ultrapure water and river water experiments the total i thm concentration was less than 1 0 087 µg l where tim had the largest contribution with 0 814 0 079 µg l a recent study on chlorinated wastewater effluents doc 7 38 mg l showed slightly lower total i thm concentration between 0 151 0 168 µg l ortega hernandez et al 2021 however secondary wastewater effluents processed by the aos in this study contained 4x higher doc concentration 29 7 mg l i thms levels were normalized to doc concentration and was found that the aos treated waters produced 0 033 µg i thms mg doc which is comparable to 0 023 µg i thms mg doc in chlorinated secondary effluents ortega hernandez et al 2021 3 5 iodine mass balance untreated waters containing an initial iodide concentration could be converted to other iodine species after aos treatment water was treated through a series of oxidation and reduction chambers where highly oxidized iodine species generated in the anodic chamber were intended to be reduced back to iodide at the final cathode moustafa et al 2021 the following redox half cell reactions show the possible iodine species that are relevant in the reactor dryhurst and elving 1967 okochi et al 2005 shanmugam et al 2014 torimura

triiodide i3 were analyzed before and after disinfection at time 0 15 and 45 min a mass balance was calculated from the measurement of i io3 io4 i3 and toi before and after treatment io3 was not detected in any of the water samples prior to aos treatment t 0 io4 and i3 figures s3 and s4 were not detected in any of the samples hoi was indirectly measured with i3 according to eqs 6 and 7 hoi can quickly react with excess i to form i2 with k 4 4 1012 m 2 s 1 eigen and kustin 1962 pillar et al 2013 i2 and i will be in equilibrium with i3 k 740 m 1 turner et al 1972 since i3 was not detected in samples then hoi was also considered not to be present at significant levels mass balance results for ultrapure water river water and secondary wastewater effluent are shown in fig 8 6 h o i i h k i 2 h 2 o 7 i 2 i i 3 iodide mass balance on ultrapure water showed an average iodide recovery of 95 5 2 0 at t 15 minutes and 94 2 1 9 at t 45 minutes fig 8a iodide and iodate were the only iodine species detected in the ultrapure water samples iodate made up an average of 29 0 1 5 of total iodine species at t 15 minutes and 30 5 0 6 at t 45 minutes while iodide made up the remaining portion toi was not detected before or after disinfection the iodide i levels used in the aos system and quantified in this study do not exceed the epa maximum tolerance level of 25 ppm of titratable iodine u s e p a 2006 furthermore iodate was found not to be genotoxic to mammalian cells not mutagenic to bacterial ames test or the recessive lethal test in drosophila melanogaster eckhardt et al 1982 poul et al 2004 a full recovery of iodinated species was not observed possibly because iodinated species might have adsorbed onto the expanded graphite electrodes within the aos previous studies have shown that iodide and iodate can adsorb onto activated carbon hoskins and karanfil 2002 mahmudov and huang 2011 results for river water showed an average iodide mass balance recovery of 98 3 2 7 at t 15 minutes and 101 1 0 6 at t 45 minutes fig 8b iodide iodate and a trace levels of toi were the only iodine species detected in treated river waters iodate made up an average of 24 0 3 8 of total iodine species at t 15 and 24 6 3 7 at t 45 minutes treated secondary wastewater effluent revealed an average iodide mass balance recovery of 93 6 9 5 at t 15 minutes and 95 1 6 0 at t 45 minutes as shown in fig 8c iodide iodate and a small amount of toi were the only iodine species detected in the wastewater samples iodate made up an average of 11 6 8 7 of total iodine species at t 15 minutes and 6 5 0 9 at t 45 minutes in one of the replicate trials at t 15 minutes a significantly higher iodate concentration was quantitated compared to the other trials leading a slightly larger standard deviation this could be due to faulty electrical connection at the final cathode in this trial which would result in a larger portion of iodate not being reduced back to iodide in the treated waters overall reduction of iodine species back to iodide was higher in secondary wastewater effluent followed by river water and ultrapure water furthermore the initial 5 ppm ki 3 8 ppm as i spike only generated up to 0 1 of iodinated dbps quantified as toi mainly i and io3 were the predominant species detected in the treated aos effluent 4 conclusions the aos is an new electrochemical water treatment system that generates active iodine species in situ that can achieve a 6 log e coli inactivation and reduce toxicity in aquatic organisms he et al 2021 moustafa et al 2021 however active iodine species can also produce dbps aos treatment forms i dbps at similar levels to chlorinated drinking waters and wastewater effluents i dbps in particular i thms ranged between 0 3 1 9 µg l across all the waters with tim as the major i dbp species possibly due to the high iodine to doc ratio that may promote repeated iodination from the three water matrices wastewater produced the highest toi 35 3 µg l as i followed by river water 3 5 1 1 µg l as i higher doc concentration might have resulted in a higher formation of i dbp this correlation was most evident in the toi data toi was not detected in ultrapure water iodine mass balance shows that 90 of iodine species exist as iodide and iodate with a very small portion 0 1 contributing to i dbp formation the results of this study show that the doc concentration is directly related to the formation of i dbps by the aos pre treatment prior to the aos could be considered for water sources with high organic content to minimize the dbp formation such as membrane filtration or ozone biological active filtration furthermore the study provided benchmark dbp levels of the operating conditions of the aos i e iodide concentration input hydraulic residence time and current density that will be further optimized for the next iteration of the aos scale up design overall this study suggests that the aos provides a safe means of treating water

16879,a novel electrochemical advanced oxidation system aos has been recently developed for water disinfection where iodide is used to generate active iodine species in situ however the presence of iodide during water disinfection can lead to the formation of iodinated disinfection byproducts i dbps which have been shown to be more cyto and genotoxic than their chlorinated and brominated analogs in this study the formation of dbps was assessed in ultrapure water river water and secondary wastewater effluents treated by the aos a comprehensive total organic halogen and target dbp analysis was used that included 25 unregulated dbps and the total organic halogen tox quantified as total organic chlorine tocl total organic bromine tobr and total organic iodine toi ultrapure water disinfection only quantified iodoform tim at a maximum concentration of 0 90 0 05 µg l river water results show that toi increase from 1 3 0 3 µg l before disinfection t 0 to a maximum of 3 5 1 1 µg l tim and bromodiiodomethane bdim were the only targeted iodo trihalomethanes i thms that were quantified with a maximum total i thm concentration of 0 44 µg l secondary wastewater effluent disinfection results show that toi increased from 1 8 0 3 µg l t 0 to a maximum concentration of 35 3 0 3 µg l iodide and iodate were the main iodinated species exiting the aos system with a iodine recovery of 94 101 the results from this study show that the aos formed low levels of iodinated dbps in treated water sources that are comparable to the levels found in disinfected drinking water and wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection by products advanced oxidation electrochemical water treatment total organic halogen i thms toi 1 introduction water disinfection has been used worldwide in drinking water and wastewater to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms that cause waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid however water disinfection unintentionally produces disinfection byproducts dbps when chemical disinfectants react with natural organic matter anthropogenic pollutants and halide salts in source waters since dbps were first discovered in 1974 rook 1974 more than 700 dbps have been identified in disinfected waters krasner et al 2006a richardson 2011 richardson and kimura 2016 2020 richardson and postigo 2016 richardson and temes 2018 however only 12 dbps are currently monitored by canadian drinking water utilities health canada 2020 four trihalomethanes thms and five haloacetic acids make up the majority of regulated dbps and are predominantly formed by chlorination the most commonly used disinfectant crittenden 2012 alternative disinfectants i e combined chlorine can reduce the formation of regulated dbps however the use of alternative disinfectants may promote the formation of other unregulated classes of dbps including haloacetonitriles haloacetamides haloaldehydes haloketones halonitromethanes nitrosamines and iodinated thms i thms crittenden 2012 although these unregulated dbps are found at lower concentrations they have shown to be more cyto and genotoxic than regulated dbps muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2008 2004 richardson et al 2008 richardson and plewa 2020 wagner and plewa 2017 although chlorine s effectiveness as a disinfectant has many benefits it also has several disadvantages including ineffectiveness against certain pathogens driedger et al 2000 and generation of potentially toxic dbps one alternative to chemical disinfection is electrochemical disinfection the capability to treat wastewaters at ambient temperature and pressure low solid waste production and limited chemical addition while maintaining sufficient disinfection and decontamination makes electrochemical disinfection appealing feng et al 2016 however disadvantages include low treatment rates due to limited electrode surface area high energy consumption high suspended solids and the potential to generate dbps in recent years high surface area electrodes and electrochemical cells have been developed and optimized that address some disadvantages of electrochemical disinfection feng et al 2016 martínez huitle and ferro 2006 a new technology known as the advanced oxidation system aos is a carbon based packed bed electrochemical water treatment system that uses a graphite based electrode bed material iodide as its principle electrochemically active input chemical and a proprietary silica based spacer to separate electrodes within the device code et al 2020 the aos generates in situ active iodine species that serve as disinfectants at the anodic chamber code et al 2020 active iodine species are known to be effective oxidants against microbial pathogens gottardi 1999 iodine interferes with bacterial cellular function by oxidizing or iodinating proteins nucleotides of dna or rna or fatty acids ultimately leading to cell death arnitz et al 2015 gottardi 1999 mcdonnell and russell 1999 okochi et al 2005 while molecular iodine i2 is generally thought to be the main iodine species responsible for bacterial inactivation hypoiodious acid hoi and periodate io4 are also known to exhibit bactericidal properties arnitz et al 2015 gottardi 1999 okochi et al 2005 recent results have shown that the aos device exhibits high inactivation of bacteria escherichia coli 6 log reduction with low current density 0 6 ma cm2 and a contact time of 5 min moustafa et al 2021 another recent study found that municipal wastewater spiked with benzo a pyrene or 17β estradiol and treated by the aos removed the observed biological effects of these organic pollutants on examined aquatic organisms daphnia zebrafish and rainbow trout he et al 2021 additionally treatment of wastewater effluents by the aos reduced the bacterial load 103 colony forming unit cfu ml in untreated wastewaters to non detect he et al 2021 the aos contains cathodic cells that reduce electro generated oxidizing compounds and eliminate the release of oxidants in treated waters code et al 2020 as with all chemical disinfectants the active iodine species generated by the aos could potentially form dbps iodine based oxidants have been shown to react with organic molecules and natural organic matter to form iodinated dbps i dbps bichsel and von gunten 2000 bougeard et al 2010 jones et al 2012 2011 toxicological studies conducted in vitro have shown that i dbps are more toxic than brominated dbps br dbps and significantly more toxic than chlorine containing dbps cl dbps muellner et al 2007 wagner and plewa 2017 for example within its chemical class iodoform lc50 of 6 6 10 5 m has been found to be two orders of magnitude more cytotoxic than regulated bromoform lc50 of 3 96 10 3 m and chloroform lc50 of 9 62 10 3 m plewa and wagner 2009 wagner and plewa 2017 the higher toxicity of i dbps may pose a potential threat to public health richardson and plewa 2020 the objective of this study was to holistically evaluate dbp formation in ultrapure river and wastewater treated with the aos dbps were comprehensively analyzed with total organic halogen and target dbp analysis total organic halogen is a hollistic approach that can quantify the total concentration of halogenated compounds by halogen type that is total organic chlorine tocl total organic bromine tobr and total organic iodine toi hua and reckhow 2006 kimura et al 2017 kristiana et al 2015 yang et al 2014 the tox analysis provides critical information because it can holistically quantify all the halogenated organic material that is often missed by target methods cuthbertson et al 2019 krasner et al 2006b additionally positive correlations have been found between tox concentration and toxicity of disinfected waters ersan et al 2019 kristiana et al 2020 also toi has been linked to higher toxicity in disinfected waters yang et al 2014 target methods based on gas chromatography gc tandem mass spectrometry ms ms and gc ms that included i dbps dichloroiodomethane chlorodiiodomethane bromochloroiodomethane dibromoiodomethane bromodiiodomethane iodoform and iodoacetontirile were also used in this study ortega hernandez et al 2021 further this work studied the iodine speciation as a result of electrochemical disinfection by analyzing various iodine species in aos treated waters this study will help assess the formation of dbps by aos treatment of waters with varying levels of dissolved organic carbon results from this study will be used to improve the aos design and scale up and provide safe water by achieving high microbial inactivation and low formation of toxic dbps 2 experimental section 2 1 reagents and solutions potassium iodide 99 0 sodium chloride 99 0 sodium bromide 99 0 sodium iodate 99 0 sodium

created by biolargo water edmonton canada aos operational parameter optimization was performed in a 6 chamber aos reactor packed with graphite foam entegris and a proprietary spacer however dbp formation potential of water samples was performed using a 12 chamber aos reactor fig 1 the reactor was made of pvc with a height of 18 cm and an internal diameter of 4 5 cm platinum electrodes inserted into the anodes and cathodes were connected in parallel to the positive and negative outlets of a dc power supply bk precision respectively untreated waters were pumped into the aos by a

target dbps were quantified using two gas chromatography mass spectrometry ms methods an agilent 7890b gc with multi mode inlet coupled to a 7000c agilent tandem mass spectrometer ms ms santa clara ca was used to quantify 25 unregulated dbps including 7 iodinated dbps in ultrapure and river water samples iodoacetonitrile dichloroiodomethane bromochloroiodomethane dibromoiodomethane chlorodiiodomethane bromodiiodomethane iodoform details of the analytical method are detailed elsewhere ortega hernandez et al 2021 in brief samples were extracted by liquid liquid extraction with 3 3

method detection limits were between 0 02 19 3 μg l all dbp analysis were quantified in triplicate dissolved organic carbon was measured using a shimadzu toc v kyoto japan according to standard method 5310 b baird et al 2017 other water quality parameters were determined with a hach loveland co usa 2100an turbidimeter shimadzu uv 2700 and mettler toledo seven compact ph meter 3 results and discussion 3 1 aos operational conditions the aos operational conditions were optimized to achieve a 6 log inactivation of e coli the optimal current density flow rate and ki concentration were identified and shown in fig 2 in fig 2 with 2 5 mg l ki the lowest ki concentration tested a 6 log inactivation was observed after 15 min of run time however for 5 mg l and 10 mg l ki e coli counts decreased below the quantification limit loq 2 6 within 5 min of run time representing an approximate 6 log reduction therefore aos treatment and dbp evaluation of water samples were conducted using the following conditions 1 25 ma cm2 total anodic active surfaces 80 ml min and 5 ppm ki the optimal current density required to achieve a 6 log reduction using the aos is similar to published values for e coli inactivation using other electrochemical cells ghasemian et al 2017 schmalz et al 2009 3 2 ultrapure water ultrapure water was treated by the aos to evaluate the formation of dbps in the absence of organic matter tox results are shown in fig 3 tocl and tobr throughout the run were on average 10 4 0 7 µg l as cl and 0 5 0 1 µg l as br respectively no measurable toi was detected trace levels of tocl could possibly be contributed from the ultrapure water system the tox sample process potassium iodide that was added to ultrapure water or the aos apparatus controls with ultrapure water processed through the tox analysis in triplicate had a tocl concentration of 7 3 2 7 µg l therefore the main contributor for tocl seems to originate from the ultrapure water and tox analysis controls did not detect tobr overall in the absence of organic matter a low formation of dbps was expected target dbp analysis only quantified a small amount of iodoform tim formation at 15 0 78 0 06 µg l and 45 0 90 0 05 µg l minute samples tim was not detected prior to aos treatment it is possible that tim might be produced from the reaction of active iodine species with graphite contained in the aos system 3 3 river water results aos treated river water was analyzed for tocl tobr toi and target dbps results are plotted in figs 4 and 5 toi results in fig 4 shows an initial concentration of 1 3 0 3 µg l as i followed by a slight increase during the first 35 min of aos operation with a maximum concentration of 3 5 1 1 µg l as i toi degradation was observed in the later half of aos operation with a final concentration of 2 0 1 0 µg l as i normalized toi values by doc concentration showed that a maximum of 0 41 µg l as i per mg of doc was formed tocl and tobr appeared to be consistent throughout the run with an average concentration of 9 8 1 2 µg l as cl and 1 8 0 01 µg l as br respectively these results suggest that tocl and tobr are not produced by the aos system for all three tox measurements in fig 4 a slow increase was observed for the first 5 min that could have been attributed to ultrapure water used in the aos cleaning procedure ultrapure water appears to be exiting the system during the first few minutes of operation which may dilute the tox measurements overall tox results showed a low toi formation 1 3 3 5 µg l as i despite processing river water with a relatively high doc concentration of 8 5 mg l in a study by pan et al toi was measured in chlorinated tap water across six major cities in china toi was quantified between 3 2 to 16 4 µg l with a mean of 7 8 µg l pan and zhang 2013 i thms were the only target dbps detected with a maximum total concentration of 0 44 0 02 µg l at 45 min of operation fig 5 dichloroiodomethane dcim bromochloroiodomethane bcim bromodiiodomethane bdim and iodoform tim were all quantified in aos processed samples where tim represented 84 of the total i thms however only bdim and tim were not detected in controls without aos treatment these results suggest that i thms with higher iodine substitution were preferentially formed in the aos system which has also been observed with other disinfectants in drinking water tugulea et al 2018 tugela et al found that water treatment systems with higher levels of iodide 10 µg l and higher iodide to bromide ratios primarily formed tim it was suggested that a higher iodide concentration might lead to higher concentration of active iodine species i e hypoiodous acid which can then react with the organic matter multiple times leading to a higher degree of iodination tugulea et al 2018 moustafa et al suggested that active iodine species within the aos are generated and accumulated within the anodic regions of the device moustafa et al 2021 it is hypothesized that a higher concentration of active iodine species within the anodic region may have led to multiple iodination reactions to preferentially form iodoform although i thms quantified in this study were characterized in disinfected river and wastewater most dbp literature have reported values primarily in drinking water and the following comparison is provided for context i thms quantified in this study were within range of i thms reported in drinking water richardson et al 2008 tugulea et al 2018 wei et al 2013 in a nationwide canadian study characterized six i thms across 64 drinking water utilities and revealed that i thms were detected in 46 out of 64 water treatment systems tugulea et al 2018 total i thm concentration were quantified between 0 02 μg l and 21 66 μg l with a median concentration of 0 358 µg l in the winter and 0 748 µg l in the summer also it was found that the highest i thm levels occurred in utilities where their water sources had naturally occurring ammonia as well as high bromide and iodide concentrations tugulea et al 2018 it is well understood that chlorine can react with ammonia to produce chloramines which in turn may form hypoiodous acid hoi in iodide containing waters bichsel and von gunten 1999 hoi can then react with organic matter to produce i thms bichsel and von gunten 2000 this was also observed in a study by smith et al where dbp formation in natural waters treated with chlorine and iodine were compared smith et al 2010 richardson et al tested chlorinated and chloraminated drinking water from 22 cities in the united states and canada for five iodo acids and two iodo trihalomethanes richardson et al 2008 they found both iodo trihalomethanes in all 22 plants with maximum levels of 10 2 µg l mean of 1 34 µg l for bcim and 7 9 µg l for dcim mean of 1 59 µg l in china wei et al measured 9 regulated haloacetic acids 4 regulated thms iodoacetic acid and iodoform tim in drinking waters from 13 water treatment plants in shanghai wei et al 2013 their study revealed that tim was present in all water treatment plants with a maximum concentration of 1 25 µg l and a median of 0 85 µg l in the winter and 0 40 µg l in the summer for the huangpu river i thm concentrations found in drinking water utilities across canada the united states and china have shown to be slightly higher than i thms produced by aos disinfected river water 3 4 secondary wastewater effluent dbp formation was also evaluated in aos treated secondary wastewater effluents tox results plotted in fig 6 show a toi increase during aos operation reaching a maximum concentration of 35 3 0 3 µg l as i after 45 min followed by a slight decrease towards the end of the run to 30 5 3 0 µg l as i a similar trend was observed in river water where toi slightly decreased towards the end of the run however normalized toi values by doc concentration had a maximum of 1 18 µg l as i per mg of doc which is 2 7x greater than river water it is possible that the different composition found in effluent organic matter compared to natural organic matter may react more readily with active iodine species nam et al 2008 despite both water samples having similar suva254 weishaar et al 2003 in a study by pan et al chlorinated secondary wastewater effluents in china produced a toi mean value of 14 1 µg l pan and zhang 2013 which was lower but within range than toi generated from the aos initial tocl and tobr values prior to aos treatment at t 0 were 99 4 3 9 µg l as cl and 5 2 0 1 µg l as br respectively tocl and tobr were 10 8 and 2 1 times higher in secondary wastewater effluents compared to river water possibly because wastewater may contain halogenated anthropogenic compounds that are not well removed from secondary treatment such as pesticides brominated flame retardants and pharmaceuticals barco bonilla et al 2010 chen et al 2015 2006 de boer et al 2003 deng et al 2015 kim et al 2013 köck schulmeyer et al 2013 metcalfe et al 2003 after aos treatment tocl and tobr remained consistent throughout the run with average values of 96 5 1 4 µg l as cl and 4 7 0 1 µg l as br respectively these results show that the aos treatment slightly reduces tocl and tobr that is initially present in wastewater effluents target dbp detected in processed waters are shown in fig 7 which include 4 thms 3 i thms and one han however the four thms dibromochloromethane dichlorobromomethane bromoform and chloroform dichloroacetonitrile and bromochloroiodomethane were already present in controls the aos system appears to form the higher substituted iodinated species cdim and tim due to high excess of iodide present 3 8 mg l as i this agrees with the obtained results from the ultrapure water and river water experiments the total i thm concentration was less than 1 0 087 µg l where tim had the largest contribution with 0 814 0 079 µg l a recent study on chlorinated wastewater effluents doc 7 38 mg l showed slightly lower total i thm concentration between 0 151 0 168 µg l ortega hernandez et al 2021 however secondary wastewater effluents processed by the aos in this study contained 4x higher doc concentration 29 7 mg l i thms levels were normalized to doc concentration and was found that the aos treated waters produced 0 033 µg i thms mg doc which is comparable to 0 023 µg i thms mg doc in chlorinated secondary effluents ortega hernandez et al 2021 3 5 iodine mass balance untreated waters containing an initial iodide concentration could be converted to other iodine species after aos treatment water was treated through a series of oxidation and reduction chambers where highly oxidized iodine species generated in the anodic chamber were intended to be reduced back to iodide at the final cathode moustafa et al 2021 the following redox half cell reactions show the possible iodine species that are relevant in the reactor dryhurst and elving 1967 okochi et al 2005 shanmugam et al 2014 torimura

triiodide i3 were analyzed before and after disinfection at time 0 15 and 45 min a mass balance was calculated from the measurement of i io3 io4 i3 and toi before and after treatment io3 was not detected in any of the water samples prior to aos treatment t 0 io4 and i3 figures s3 and s4 were not detected in any of the samples hoi was indirectly measured with i3 according to eqs 6 and 7 hoi can quickly react with excess i to form i2 with k 4 4 1012 m 2 s 1 eigen and kustin 1962 pillar et al 2013 i2 and i will be in equilibrium with i3 k 740 m 1 turner et al 1972 since i3 was not detected in samples then hoi was also considered not to be present at significant levels mass balance results for ultrapure water river water and secondary wastewater effluent are shown in fig 8 6 h o i i h k i 2 h 2 o 7 i 2 i i 3 iodide mass balance on ultrapure water showed an average iodide recovery of 95 5 2 0 at t 15 minutes and 94 2 1 9 at t 45 minutes fig 8a iodide and iodate were the only iodine species detected in the ultrapure water samples iodate made up an average of 29 0 1 5 of total iodine species at t 15 minutes and 30 5 0 6 at t 45 minutes while iodide made up the remaining portion toi was not detected before or after disinfection the iodide i levels used in the aos system and quantified in this study do not exceed the epa maximum tolerance level of 25 ppm of titratable iodine u s e p a 2006 furthermore iodate was found not to be genotoxic to mammalian cells not mutagenic to bacterial ames test or the recessive lethal test in drosophila melanogaster eckhardt et al 1982 poul et al 2004 a full recovery of iodinated species was not observed possibly because iodinated species might have adsorbed onto the expanded graphite electrodes within the aos previous studies have shown that iodide and iodate can adsorb onto activated carbon hoskins and karanfil 2002 mahmudov and huang 2011 results for river water showed an average iodide mass balance recovery of 98 3 2 7 at t 15 minutes and 101 1 0 6 at t 45 minutes fig 8b iodide iodate and a trace levels of toi were the only iodine species detected in treated river waters iodate made up an average of 24 0 3 8 of total iodine species at t 15 and 24 6 3 7 at t 45 minutes treated secondary wastewater effluent revealed an average iodide mass balance recovery of 93 6 9 5 at t 15 minutes and 95 1 6 0 at t 45 minutes as shown in fig 8c iodide iodate and a small amount of toi were the only iodine species detected in the wastewater samples iodate made up an average of 11 6 8 7 of total iodine species at t 15 minutes and 6 5 0 9 at t 45 minutes in one of the replicate trials at t 15 minutes a significantly higher iodate concentration was quantitated compared to the other trials leading a slightly larger standard deviation this could be due to faulty electrical connection at the final cathode in this trial which would result in a larger portion of iodate not being reduced back to iodide in the treated waters overall reduction of iodine species back to iodide was higher in secondary wastewater effluent followed by river water and ultrapure water furthermore the initial 5 ppm ki 3 8 ppm as i spike only generated up to 0 1 of iodinated dbps quantified as toi mainly i and io3 were the predominant species detected in the treated aos effluent 4 conclusions the aos is an new electrochemical water treatment system that generates active iodine species in situ that can achieve a 6 log e coli inactivation and reduce toxicity in aquatic organisms he et al 2021 moustafa et al 2021 however active iodine species can also produce dbps aos treatment forms i dbps at similar levels to chlorinated drinking waters and wastewater effluents i dbps in particular i thms ranged between 0 3 1 9 µg l across all the waters with tim as the major i dbp species possibly due to the high iodine to doc ratio that may promote repeated iodination from the three water matrices wastewater produced the highest toi 35 3 µg l as i followed by river water 3 5 1 1 µg l as i higher doc concentration might have resulted in a higher formation of i dbp this correlation was most evident in the toi data toi was not detected in ultrapure water iodine mass balance shows that 90 of iodine species exist as iodide and iodate with a very small portion 0 1 contributing to i dbp formation the results of this study show that the doc concentration is directly related to the formation of i dbps by the aos pre treatment prior to the aos could be considered for water sources with high organic content to minimize the dbp formation such as membrane filtration or ozone biological active filtration furthermore the study provided benchmark dbp levels of the operating conditions of the aos i e iodide concentration input hydraulic residence time and current density that will be further optimized for the next iteration of the aos scale up design overall this study suggests that the aos provides a safe means of treating water
