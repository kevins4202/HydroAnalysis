19830,electro dewatering edw is an alternative emerging and energy efficient technology that provides improved liquid solids separations in the dewatering of wastewater sludge the edw technology is not only an innovative dewatering method for significantly reducing the volume of wastewater sludge before re utilization or disposal but is also a promising emerging method which may potentially be used for decontamination purposes in this study the influence of the sludge properties e g electrical conductivity zeta potential specific cake resistance among others on their mechanical and electrical behaviour in terms of dewaterability and electro dewaterability the applied current current density from 20 to 80 a m2 and filter cloth position relative to the electrode was investigated a two sided filter press at lab scale with moving anode was used and the treatment performance of the edw process on two different types of wastewater sludge activated and digested was thoroughly assessed from both an electrochemical viewpoint and in terms of the dewatering rate the results showed that the conditioned digested sludge was more easily dewatered by mechanical dewatering mdw with 34 35 w of dry solids content compared to 19 20 w for the activated sludge thanks to the lower content of both the microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps and the volatile suspended solids fraction for the edw results the electrical conductivity of the sludge was pivotal to the dryness of the final solids and therefore also to the dewatering kinetics the results demonstrated that the activated sludge arrived at an equilibrium much faster after approximately 3600 s compared with digested sludge thanks to its lower electrical conductivity 0 8 ms cm providing a greater voltage drop across the cathode and therefore more repulsion of the solids from the cathode leading to continuously high filtrate flowrate also the edw performance was analysed by comparing the ratio of the filtrate volume collected at the anode to the volume collected at the cathode side for digested sludge at 5 bar 40 a m2 different positions of the filter cloth were tested but these configurations barely impacted the edw performance despite having a significant impact on the energy requirements at industrial scale it would be useful to position the filter cloths at some distance from the electrodes but this study shows that this benefit may be quickly outweighed by the loss in edw energy efficiency graphical abstract image 1 keywords electro dewatering wastewater sludge performance dryness level energy consumption two sided filter press 1 introduction over the last few decades the volume of municipal and industrial sewage sludge has increased many times due to the intensification of water purification and the cost of disposal of this sludge has increased due to more stringent legislation for the protection of the environment mahmoud et al 2011a 2013 2016 wastewater sludge is an important component of the product of wastewater treatment facilities the sludge has to be dewatered and toxic or noxious contaminants such as heavy metals microorganisms and hazardous organics have to be removed or inactivated before re use can be considered depending on the locality sludge may be reused as a valuable soil amendment composted incinerated or disposed to landfill tuan and sillanpää 2010a mahmoud et al 2011a 2013 the residual water content in the sludge is usually removed by mechanical processes involving gravitational settlers centrifuges belt filter presses and plate and frame filter presses and further dried if necessary by conventional thermal drying the dewatering efficiencies obtained with wastewater sludge are generally low with a practical limit of around 35 wt solids on a wet basis even when the sludge is conditioned before dewatering chen et al 2002 mahmoud et al 2011a 2016 a traditional thermal drying process can achieve a high sludge dryness level and provide good control and high destruction of contaminants however the energy consumption is proportional to the amount of water which must be evaporated and both high capital and operating costs are proportional to the water removal from wastewater sludge mahmoud et al 2008 2016 fytili and zabaniotou 2008 the minimum drying energy requirement refers to water vaporisation enthalpy of about 0 62 kwh kgwater removed and in industrial devices it can reach as high as 1 2 kwh kgwater removed gazbar et al 1994 perry and green 1997 mujumdar 2007 mahmoud et al 2008 2010 2011a 2013 depending on the type of wastewater sludge the electro dewatering edw is considered as one of the most effective emerging processes for the improvement of wastewater sludge dewatering efficiency mahmoud et al 2011a 2013 2016 in the edw process an electric field is applied during the conventional mechanical pressure dewatering mdw of the sludge to enhance the separation process efficiency with low energy consumption to increase the final dry solids content and to accelerate the dewatering kinetics saveyn et al 2005 2006 mahmoud et al 2010 2011a 2013 2016 citeau et al 2011 2012a 2016 glendinning et al 2010 tuan et al 2008 2012a iwata et al 2013 olivier et al 2014 feng et al 2014 recent studies investigated a wide range of scenarios in order to reduce the water content to optimize the operating mode for a desired final dry solids content and to obtain the best energetically and economically feasible edw process a number of these studies reported in literature are summarized in table 1 most of these studies are empirical and essentially focused on the process parameters and the sludge characteristics mahmoud et al 2010 2013 as shown in table 1 the studies are grouped based on the mode of dewatering where u edw refers to constant voltage i edw refers to constant current and e edw refers to constant electric field strength recently mahmoud and co workers compared the energy required to dewater and dry wastewater sludge for different combinations of either electrical or mechanical dewatering followed by thermal drying mahmoud et al 2008 2011a b 2013 2016 they demonstrated that to achieve a dryness fraction of 50 the optimum edw process had an energy consumption of 0 30 kwh kg of water removed which is less than 50 of the energy consumption of a thermal drying process mahmoud et al 2011a they also reported that by delaying the application of the electric field to the filter cake compression stage there was a potential saving in power consumption of around 10 12 in the case of u edw and about 30 46 in the case of i edw compared to the application of the electrical field from the start mahmoud et al 2016 for their part citeau and co workers with their new improvement in edw process by anode flushing anode filtrate recirculation based on the work of larue et al 2001 2006 showed that there was also a potential reduction in power consumption of around 12 19 in the case of i edw with anode flushing compared with no flushing to reach the same level in dryness of bentonite sludge 66 2 wt citeau et al 2016 in addition to its relative high dryness level and the energy efficiency in the dewatering of wastewater sludge edw technology is also a potential method of reducing bacterial pathogens in wastewater sludge esmaeily et al 2006 huang et al 2008 navab daneshmand et al 2012 they reported that the edw process offered an interesting disinfection method for the reduction to below detection limits of salmonella spp bacteria enteric viruses and fecal coliforms fc in their experiments navab daneshmand et al 2012 demonstrated that the principal source of total coliforms and escherichia coli inactivation mechanisms during the edw process was related to the significant temperature rise from ohmic heating this is also supported by the findings of yin et al 2018 indeed other studies pointed out that the edw process may also be a potential method for decontaminating hazardous substances via the migration of heavy metals and organic compounds such as oils and greases present in the sludge kim et al 2002 hwang and min 2003 yang et al 2005 tuan et al 2008 2012a b tuan and sillanpää 2010a b mahmoud et al 2010 2011a xu et al 2017 xiao et al 2017 the colloidal particles in the wastewater sludge usually possess a negative surface charge and therefore are surrounded by a layer with a higher density of positive charges and this phenomenon is referred to as the electric double layer when an electric field is applied the usually negative charged particles move towards the electrode of the opposite charge the water from pores and interstices commonly with associated cations is driven towards the negative electrode weber and stahl 2002 2003 yang et al 2009 mahmoud et al 2010 2011a ions species anions and cations are also subjected to electromigration transport according to their own ionic mobilities newman 1991 mahmoud et al 2003 2007 2010 mahmoud and hoadley 2012 the electro kinetic transport phenomena ek involved in sludge electro dewatering process includes the following phenomena electrophoresis eph electro osmosis eo electromigration em and electrolysis mahmoud et al 2010 2011a 2013 2016 besides the electro kinetic transport flow ekf there is also a hydraulic pressure driven flow filtration and or compression pdf in the edw process as shown in fig 1 from this the total transport flow in the edw process q e d w is the sum of the flux generated by the pressure driving force q p d f and the flux generated by the electrical field driving force q e k as schematically depicted in fig 1 the edw process thus induces the migration of negatively charged organic matter present in the sludge such as fatty acids humus substances among others xiao et al 2017 heavy metals are also migrated in their various speciations in both an abiotic form e g soluble adsorbed exchangeable precipitated organically complexed residual phases among others or biotic form e g extracellular and intracellular species kim et al 2002 hwang and min 2003 tuan et al 2008 2012a b tuan and sillanpää 2010a b mahmoud et al 2010 2011a as these toxic metals often limit the reuse of sludge in agriculture any reduction in heavy metals could be extremely beneficial to protect the public health and the environment hwang and min 2003 observed a large reduction of the heavy metal concentration such as zn mn pb cd ni in the sludge cake after an electro dewatering run tuan and co workers showed that concentration of na and k were reduced by 51 and 78 respectively in the sludge cake in comparison to experiments with only mechanical dewatering fe ions ca2 and mg2 concentrations were found to be lower in sludge at the anode and higher at the cathode while cr concentrations were increased in the sludge cake and anode effluent tuan and sillanpää 2010a b in their investigation mahmoud et al 2011a reported that the edw under high levels of applied voltage caused colouration and even odour of the water removed at the cathode side giving it a dark green brown appearance instead of grey colour at high levels of voltage they also observed an increase in the turbidity electrical conductivity and the total suspended solids tss of the water removed at the cathode side which is in line with the findings of chen et al 2011 they explained their experimental results by the combined effect of the electromigration of heavy metals microbial cells ions and intracellular organic matter the latter refers to substance which is initially inside the cells but leaks out due to the lysis or destruction of the cell walls recently xu et al 2017 reported that the edw process can also enhance the removal efficiency of aluminum ions al from sludge although electro dewatering has been widely studied by various researchers mentioned already these works deal mainly with the effect of the process parameters type of sludge conditioning and process variants including improvement in the process design and operation table 1 there are few publications focused on the influence of sludge electro physico chemical proprieties on their mechanical and electrical behaviour in terms of dewaterability and electro dewaterability moreover to the best of our knowledge there are no comparative studies which analyse the different contributions of the electrical resistance of the different elements of the edw system e g filter cloth at anode and cathode sides two conducting phases liquid solids sludge medium or to differentiate the relative contributions of electro kinetic transport and hydraulic pressure driven filtration and or compression and to compare the results obtained from the same electro dewatering device on the same type of sludge in a single process therefore the specific objectives of the present paper are to i provide an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms involved in the electro dewatering in a two sided filter press ii determine the sludge characteristics which most affect the edw performance by comparing two contrasting types of sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge samples and chemical conditioning an activated sludge and an anaerobically digested sludge from two wastewater treatment plants france were used in this study the physico chemical proprieties of the raw sludge are listed in table 2 the collected activated and digested sludge samples were kept in plastic bags stored at 4 c and used over a period of less than one and two weeks respectively this timeframe limits the effect of biochemical composition changes in the material and enables an acceptable reliability of the experiments prior to the tests a 2000 g of activated sludge sample or 207 g of digested sludge were left for 30 min of acclimatization in the open air in order to reach room temperature at around 20 1 c before conditioning the sludge was conditioned with a highly cationic linear polymer em 640 l provided from snf floerger manufacturer france aqueous polyelectrolyte solutions were prepared at 5 g l active polyelectrolyte concentration 0 5 according to the instructions given by the manufacturer snf floerger andrézieux france in order to allow the polyelectrolyte chains to unfold completely for optimized contact the polyelectrolyte solutions were prepared at least 20 min prior to application the em 640 l conditioner dose was 3 5 g conditioner per kg of dry sludge g kgds according to preliminary gravity drainage tests carried out by mahmoud et al 2011a 2016 in the case of the anaerobically digested sludge a liner polymer em340 l was used at a fixed dose of 9 g kgds olivier et al 2014 for the sludge conditioning step a conventional jar test device was used operating at 270 rpm for 30 s of intense mixing of the polyelectrolyte into the sludge and then followed by a 30 s of slow stirring at 20 rpm to promote flocs growth mahmoud et al 2011a 2016 after the conditioning stage the activated sludge was filtered using a laboratory batch drainage apparatus olivier et al 2004 mahmoud et al 2011a 2016 and then the thickened sludge was diluted to a suitable dry solids content with an appropriated amount of supernatant filtrate in a typical run the diluted and conditioned sludge was loaded manually at room temperature in the electro dewatering cell the initial solids contents in the cell s i n were 9 1 0 5 wt and 10 3 0 5 wt for the activated and digested sludge respectively 2 2 experimental device for the investigation of wastewater sludge electro dewatering a two sided laboratory experimental set up was made as shown in fig 2 provided by choquenet s a s chauny france and modified by citeau and co workers citeau et al 2011 2012a b citeau 2012 it is noteworthy that such a configuration is more adapted to simulate an industrial filter press which has also two sided flow this edw lab scale set up consist of i a horizontal cylindrical filtration compression cell made from polypropylene material to ensure the electrical insulation cake cross section 24 6 cm2 volume 69 5 cm3 ii a dc power supply ev202 consort allowing to monitor the voltage and current fluctuations maximum 300 v and 2 a iii two digital multimeters iso tech idm 73 to check and monitor voltage and current measurement in the edw system iv two precision electronic balances mettler usa for filtrate v two filtrate collectors and vi a computer and data acquisition software the polypropylene piston was designed to compress the sludge and to evacuate the water from the anode side each side of the cell was covered by a polypropylene filter cloth of 25 μm aperture and 390 μm of thickness sefar tetex mono sk025 sefar fyltis s a s france dimensionally stable electrodes made from titanium coated with mixed metal oxide mmo to prevent corrosion manufactured by industrie de nora italy and supplied by ecs electro chemical services saint genis france of 65 mm of diameter were used as perforated disk anode electrode the perforated disk anode is fitted to the piston and a similar perforated titanium disk is used as cathode two electrically insulated thermocouples used to measure the temperature of the filter cake and to stop the process when the temperature increase is too high mahmoud et al 2011a 2016 were placed at the cathode and anode inner sides inside the filter cake the computer logged the experimental data comprising the filtrate mass at the cathode and the anode sides the applied current and voltage the cake thickness and the anode and cathode temperatures every 3 s 2 3 experimental procedure the mechanical dewatering mdw and electro dewatering edw experiments were undertaken in the same equipment in a temperature controlled laboratory at 20 c 0 1 c the conditioned sludge with the suitable dry solids content 9 1 0 5 wt for activated sludge and 10 3 0 5 wt for the digested sludge was poured manually at room temperature into the electro dewatering cell in mdw there is no application of the electric field and a constant pressure was applied for 2 h at 5 bar for edw experiments these commenced with mdw at 5 bar for the first 10 min followed by the application of a selected current density these current densities were 20 40 and 80 a m2 for activated sludge and 40 and 80 a m2 for digested sludge electro dewatering these selected processing parameters were based on the operational conditions tested in the experiments campaigns carried out by mahmoud et al 2011a 2016 and citeau et al 2012a citeau 2012 all electro dewatering tests were carried out within a three day period two experiments per day and 6 experiments per series of three days each series of three days of experiments were repeated at least three times with the same processing conditions to evaluate the reproducibility of the results the curves shown in the graphs represent the average results and the error bars represent the standard deviations of three replicates for all experimental tests at the end of each experiment the dewatered cake was removed from the cell and weighed the average dry solids content was measured by drying at 105 c during 24 h and weighing according to the european standard procedure en 12880 the dry solids content was calculated continuously throughout the experiment from the recorded mass of the filtrate the partial evaporation of the extracted filtrate was considered in the calculations the average dry solids content of the sludge sample in the edw cell and the percentage of water removal in both mdw and edw run were measured using the method described by mahmoud et al 2011a 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 mdw run sludge dewaterability during mechanical dewatering mdw two steps can be distinguished the first is the filtration stage where a filter cake starts to build up against the filter the second is the compression stage where the piston comes in contact with the filter cake and the cake is compressed by the piston into a more compact form la heij 1994 la heij et al 1996 mahmoud et al 2008 in order to characterize the two sludge materials a simple series of mechanical dewatering filtration compression mdw experiments at an applied pressure 5 bar were performed in the two sided laboratory experimental set up without any electric field application the sludge dewaterability was then characterized using ruth s equation equation 1 ruth 1946 novak et al 1988 sorensen et al 1996 qi et al 2011 1 t v f p d f η α a v c 2 δ p a 2 v f η r m δ p a where v f is the filtrate volume m3 t is the time s a is the filter area m2 η is the dynamic viscosity of the filtrate pa s r m is the filter medium resistance m 1 α a v is the average specific resistance of the cake m kg c is the mass of cake solids deposited per volume of filtrate and is assumed constant and δ p is the applied pressure pa ruth s equation is based on flow through an incompressible material and therefore assumes that the filter cake has a constant porosity through the cake and for a given thickness there is a constant pressure drop across the cake and filter medium this leads to the constants in ruth s equation of c r m and also a constant liquid flow rate despite this assumption it is still useful for assessing the dewaterability filterability and compressibility of moderately and even extremely compressible materials such as wastewater sludge therefore the dewatering of a sludge in the filtration compression cell working under constant pressure was described using a t v f versus v f plot allowing the calculation of the average specific resistance of the cake α a v from the slope of the linear part of this plot the mdw runs were conducted for 2 h to reach the equilibrium point where no further dewatering occurred fig 3a b c and 4 a b c for activated and digested sludge respectively are characterized by plotting the dewatering properties of the average specific cake resistance and the specific filtration flow rate s f f δ p η α a v christensen et al 2015 against the dewatering time and the filtrate volume the resulting filter cake is also plotted as the average cake porosity and the cake thickness for comparison purposes with edw in the next section the filtrate volume collected separately at the cathode and anode ends are also recorded during the mechanical dewatering run mdw and shown in each figure it is clear from all these plots figs 3 and 4 that the conditioned digested sludge was more easily dewatered by mdw compared to the activated sludge the dry solids content at the end of the mdw run s f i n m d w was around 19 20 wt for the activated sludge and around 34 35 wt for the digested sludge the difference in mdw performance is attributed to the higher content of the microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps in the activated sludge a greater presence of eps leads to higher cake compressibility and an inferior final solids content mahmoud et al 2011a in fact the microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps will create a matrix which tends to hold the water and which has an elastic structure hard to squeeze by mdw mikkelsen and keiding 2002 citeau et al 2012a this is confirmed by figs 3a and 4a for the estimation of the average specific resistance values and consequently the specific flow rate which is around 2 63 1014 m kg for the activated sludge compared to around 1 90 1014 m kg in the case of the digested sludge the high average specific resistance of the activated sludge lowers the specific flow rate by a factor of 1 4 compared to the digested sludge conferring it the lower dewaterability table 2 monitoring the cake thickness as well as the average dry solids content during the experiments over time by a personal computer allowed the estimation of the cake volume and the average cake porosity evolution figs 3c and 4c show the cake thickness and the average cake porosity reduction during mdw run performed at a pressure of 5 bar the average cake porosity can be described as a function of the mass of dry solids m d s introduced in the edw cell the dryness level s t the liquid density ρ t l and the cake volume v t c a k e s l u d g e it can be then written as a function of these terms as follows ε c a k e s l u d g e m d s 1 s t s t ρ t l v t c a k e s l u d g e experimental analysis for 6 2 0 2 g of mass of dry solids matter initially introduced into the edw cell revealed a cake porosity of ε f i n m d w 0 734 and ε f i n m d w 0 551 at the end of the mechanical dewatering run for activated and digested sludge respectively table 2 3 2 edw run sludge electro dewaterability many authors including the present ones have already shown that the applied electric current density is pivotal to the dryness of the final solids and therefore also to the dewatering kinetics mahmoud et al 2010 2016 olivier et al 2014 2015 citeau et al 2011 2012a fig 5 depicts the typical mdw as well as the edw dewatering kinetics for both activated and digested sludge showing the effectiveness of the edw on the separate filtrate volume collected at the anode and cathode sides with different applied current densities for the same applied pressure 5 bar a large difference is depicted in the filtrate volumes collected at cathode and anode sides as shown in fig 5a b c d according to the theory of electro osmosis flow is induced towards the cathode electrode and thus the filtrate flow is increased at the cathode side for both activated and digested sludge as shown in fig 5c and d the electro osmosis effect is more pronounced for higher applied current density moreover as shown in fig 5a and b not only the dewatering rate at the anode side is lower than at the cathode side but also it seems that the dewatering rate is also inferior to mechanical dewatering for the digested sludge fig 5b there are two possible causes the first is the electrophoresis of particles towards the anode which results in a greater thickness of solid at the anode side compared to the cathode side which in turn leads to a greater filtration resistance the second possible cause is the evolution of oxygen gas bubbles that are too large to pass thorough the filter cloth and thus stay on the anode side which can act as a barrier against the anode filtrate flow rate either or both these effects at the anode side lead to a preferential dewatering rate at the cathode leading to a continuously high filtrate flow rate and a greater quantity of filtrate collected at the cathode looking at the overall dewatering kinetic the increase of the applied current density accelerates the edw kinetics as shown from the time t versus v 2 plot in fig 6 a b in the case of the activated sludge there is a large increase in the filtrate volume collected with increasing the applied current density from 0 to 80 a m2 as shown in fig 6a i for example at 1760 s the extra filtrate volume collected is increased from about δ v 2 3 03 10 10 m6 exp at 20 a m2 to δ v 2 6 33 10 10 m6 exp at 40 a m2 to δ v 2 1 08 10 9 m6 exp at 80 a m2 the corresponding average dry solids contents were 17 8 19 5 27 2 wt respectively as shown in the insert in fig 6a ii on the other hand the analysis of the extent of water removal in each dewatering step mdw and edw of process as well as the remaining water in dewatered sludge at the end of i edw test are also useful parameters to illustrate the effectiveness of water removal during the process as shown in the second insert in fig 6a iii the results indicate that more than 50 of the total water was removed by mdw before the application of the electric field when a current density was combined with mdw run the percentage of extra water removed increased considerably by at least 40 in the case of the digested sludge the results obtained at 0 40 and 80 a m2 are presented in fig 6b although that the conditioned digested sludge was more easily dewatered by mdw compared to the activated sludge the electro dewaterability shows a completely different behaviour comparatively after the mdw run for 2 h 7200 s the average cake solids content was around s f i n m d w 34 35 wt while it reached around s f i n e d w 47 48 wt with the application of the current density e g 40 a m2 corresponding to about 13 points of gain the increased electro dewatering kinetic response is also quantified by the increased filtrate volume collected and represented by time t versus v 2 plot as shown in fig 6b i fig 6b i ii clearly illustrates that the electro kinetic effect is relatively small in the early dewatering period of the digested sludge for example at 40 a m2 condition in the early period of the dewatering from 0 to 2800 s period i the effect of current density on the dewatering kinetics is minor compared with what is achieved by only mdw and consequently the dry solids contents were of the same order or even inferior compared to mdw this can be explained by the high electrolyte content and hence high electrical conductivity of the digested sludge 8 2 ms cm compared to only 0 8 ms cm in the case of activated sludge which may alter the electroosmotic flow rate and reduce the dewaterability due to the reduction of the electrical double layer of the particles citeau et al 2011 2012a the absolute zeta potential of particles and hence the electroosmotic flow decrease as reported by mahmoud et al 2010 after that from 2800 s onwards period ii the voltage and electrical resistance increased slowly followed by a sharp rise at the end of the process see section 3 2 2 fig 9b showing a linear trend increase of the dry solids content versus time the effect of the applied current density on the cake thickness and the average cake porosity is shown in fig 7 a and b in the case of the activated sludge the cake thickness decreased slowly from 2 77 cm to less than 0 98 cm in the case of 20 a m2 the amplitude of the decrease or shrinkage of the cake sludge thickness is obviously more pronounced at 40 and 80 a m2 as shown in fig 7a the edw run allowed a cake thickness reduction of around 65 20 a m2 and 75 40 a m2 compared to around 49 in the case of mdw run with knowledge of the cake sludge temperature the dryness level s t the change in liquid density ρ t l and the cake volume v t c a k e s l u d g e during the experiments over time the average cake porosity evolution can be quantified and shown in the insert in fig 7a experimental data show that the average cake porosity decreases with increasing electric current density as previously observed for activated sludge edw the cake thickness of the digested sludge decreased with increasing electric current density fig 7b shows that the cake thickness reduced by 66 for mdw and for edw the reduction was 78 and 84 for 40 and 80 a m2 respectively 3 2 1 synergetic thermal effect analysis the electro dewatering system is essentially an electrochemical reactor this implies that the edw reactor exhibits a considerable ohmic heating mahmoud et al 2010 2011a 2016 citeau et al 2012b 2016 navab daneshmand et al 2015 the electrical current that passes through sludge and the increase in sludge resistance release heat that is defined as ohmic or joule heating according to joule s law the ohmic heating energy q j is expressed as i2rcell where i is the electric current a and rcell is the cell electrical resistance which includes the resistance of the sludge cavity and between the filter cloths and their respective electrodes ohm mahmoud et al 2010 2011a 2016 r cell depends on the sludge the filter cloth thickness filter cake dryness and ionic concentration citeau et al 2012b it can be represented by the sum of the ohmic drop in the cell chamber i r c e l l u o h m u f i l t e r a n o d e u c a k e s l u d g e b e d u f i l t e r c a t h o d e as reported by mahmoud et al 2006 the ohmic drop in the filter cloth over its thickness δ f i l t e r 2 u f i l t e r a n o d e i r f i l t e r a n o d e 3 u f i l t e r c a t h o d e i r f i l t e r c a t h o d e the ohmic drop in the sludge cake bed over its thickness δ c a k e s l u d g e b e d 4 u c a k e s l u d g e b e d i r b e d where r is the various electrical resistances of filter cloths and sludge cake bed which represents the contribution of each element to the overall electric resistance of the cell the ohmic heating seems to play a substantive role in the electro dewatering process mahmoud et al 2010 2011a citeau et al 2012b 2016 navab daneshmand et al 2015 it results in a considerable change in the water viscosity and therefore an essential acceleration of the dewatering rate weber 2002 weber and stahl 2002 2003 clayton et al 2006 mahmoud et al 2008 2011a 2016 this ohmic heating effect may also play a synergistic role in facilitating the removal of some of the remaining water in the dewatered sludge as reported by mahmoud et al 2011a 2016 it will heat the sludge internally increasing its temperature and consequently decreasing the liquid viscosity which can force moisture out of the solid capillaries and also reduce the resistance of the sludge to compressive forces clayton et al 2006 mahmoud et al 2008 2011a 2016 for an electro dewatering run as show in fig 7c and d the temperature of both activated and digested sludge cake increase with the applied current density as the dewatering proceeds the temperature rise is more pronounced for incremental increases in applied current density however high absolute temperature due to ohmic heating could adversely affect the edw cell equipment filtering cloths electrodes and ultimately hampering the edw process therefore if the temperature increase is too large it may become necessary for the operator to stop the process in order to prevent the deterioration of both the filtering cloths and the electrodes used according to the instructions given by the manufacturer mahmoud et al 2011a 2016 the average temperature of sludge cake was in the range of 20 30 c exp 20 a m2 20 50 c exp 40 a m2 20 65 c exp 80 a m2 in the case of activated sludge and in the range of 20 45 c exp 40 a m2 and 20 68 c exp 80 a m2 for digested sludge the variation of the dynamic water viscosity corresponding to these ranges of temperature was calculated and normalized with its value at 20 c and computed according to η t η 20 c as shown in fig 7e and f the ohmic heating effect on the η t η 20 c is obviously more pronounced for incremental increases in applied current density for both activated and digested sludge as the dewatering proceeds the corresponding decrease in viscosity of almost 28 60 and 72 in the case of activated sludge and around 48 and 73 in the case of digested sludge fig 7e and f consequently the ohmic heating contribution in decreasing viscosity resulted in an essential acceleration of the dewatering kinetic facilitating the removal of some of the remaining water which would normally be difficult to remove therefore concurrently with the electro osmotic flow it can be concluded that providing the ohmic heating is not excessive then it has a synergetic effect in enhancing water removal and hence dewatering kinetics and this in line with the findings of weber and stahl 2002 mahmoud et al 2011a 2016 3 2 2 electrical resistance effect analysis the electrical current flow through porous medium is dependent on the conductivity of the solids namely the dispersed phase and the liquid phases namely the continuous phase helfferich 1962 mahmoud et al 2006 2010 several theories have been proposed for the transport of electrical current in mixtures helfferich 1962 mahmoud et al 2006 2010 electrical conductivity of porous medium is complex and varies with the mobility and the affinity of ions with which solid particles are in contact helfferich 1962 for very low conductivity of the liquid phase the specific conductivity of the porous medium is enhanced by the presence of solids particles in contrast when the liquid phase conductivity is high then its contribution to electrical transport becomes more significant mahmoud and co workers mahmoud et al 2006 2010 based on the pioneering work developed by wyllie and southwick 1954 sauer et al 1955 helfferich 1962 reported that the electrical current is considered to pass through three different paths within the cake sludge bed each of these is depicted in fig 8 the first 1 is when the current passes through alternating layers of particles and interstitial solution 2 through particles in contact with each other and 3 in the channel of the liquid phase in most cases process 1 predominates however contribution of 2 is significant for low conducting liquids if the conductivity of the liquid is considerably higher than that of the particles the third mechanism becomes the most important for the sake of clarity only the results obtained at 40 a m2 and 5 bar for both sludges are presented and discussed in this section fig 9 shows the transient behaviour of electrical current voltage and the corresponding cake dryness plots during edw run performed at 40 a m2 for both sludges when looking more closely at the transient behaviour of electrical current plots fig 9a and b it is clear that for activated sludge only a few minutes 200 360 s are necessary before the electro osmotic flow rate becomes much higher than the pressure driven filtrate flow rate period ii in fig 9a meanwhile for digested sludge as early illustrated section 3 2 the electro kinetic effect is relatively small in the early dewatering period and only from 2800 s onwards the electro osmotic flow rate overtakes the mdw flow rate period ii in fig 9b this is related to the difference in the physico chemical characteristics of the two sludge e g electrical conductivity as shown in table 2 in the period i the corresponding overall electrical resistance was in range of 340 420 ohm for activated sludge however for digested sludge the electrical resistance is for a long period at around 180 ohm highest overall electrical resistances were recorded with activated sludge in agreement with its lowest electrical conductivity 0 8 ms cm thereafter in period ii the voltage and electrical resistance increased slowly followed by a sharp rise showing a linear trend increase of the dry solids content versus time at the end of the process the electrical resistance of the cake formed is too high and electro dewatering eventually stops and no more water is removed mahmoud et al 2011a 2016 citeau et al 2012a however the high initial electrolyte content of digested sludge and hence the cake sludge bed electrical conductivity 1 02 ms cm compared to only 0 21 ms cm for activated sludge fig 9a and b would limit the water driven effect assured by the ionized mobile liquid displacement under the applied electric field citeau et al 2012a thereafter when the cake sludge bed electrical conductivity of digested sludge is reduced to a sufficient value around 0 17 ms cm the electrical current passes through alternating layers of particles and interstitial solution and through particles in contact with each other consequently an electro osmotic flow is created and this accounts for the acceleration of the filtrate removal compared to mdw run as shown in fig 9b a complementary series of experiments was carried out for digested sludge under 5 bar 40 a m2 for four different configurations in order to understand the electrical behaviour of the cake sludge bed and the influence of the components of the overall electrical resistance fig 10 a shows four configurations and their equivalent electric circuits represented by three resistances connected in series the filter cloth at the anode the filter cloth at the cathode sides and the cake sludge bed a electrodes and cake sludge bed separated by filter cloths at anode and cathode sides b the cathode electrode in direct contact with cake sludge bed c the anode electrode in direct contact with cake sludge bed d both electrodes in direct contact with cake sludge bed the configurations performed in this study allow the measuring of the overall cell voltage and the voltage coming from each element cloth filter anode cloth filter cathode both filter cloths and cake sludge bed by a simple subtracting with respect to the related configuration assuming a serial connection of the three resistances and with knowledge of these voltages the various resistances during the experiments over time can be calculated from equations 5 7 and then be represented in fig 10b as follows citeau et al 2012a 5 r f i l t e r a n o d e c a t h o d e u f i l t e r a n o d e c a t h o d e c o n f a u b e d c o n f d

f d 1 r b e d c o n f d it can be inferred in fig 10b that in period i of edw test the electric resistance of filter cloth at the anode side rfilter anode was higher than the electric resistance of filter cloth at the cathode side rfilter cathode and the electric resistance of cake sludge bed rbed in period ii from 2800 s onwards the electrical resistance of cake sludge bed rbed increased slowly to become gradually more important than the resistance on the cathode side at the end of the process the electrical resistance of the cake formed is too high and electro dewatering eventually stops and no more water is removed which is in line with the results obtained and presented in fig 9b on the other hand it can be determined the fractional resistance which represents the contribution of each element to the overall electric resistance for the four different configurations a b c d in general the fractional resistance f e of an element is equal to 8 f e r e r o v e r a l l where re and roverall are the electrical resistance of the element and the total edw system respectively hence the fractional resistance corresponding to the filter cloth at anode and cathode sides configuration a

fractional resistance on a large range of dry solids content fig 10c and d represents the fractional resistance of the different elements of the edw cell for the digested sludge versus the dry solids content for the four different configurations when both electrodes were separated from the cake sludge bed by the filter cloths configuration a the electric resistance of filter cloths reaches up to 75 82 of the overall resistance however the trend of this fractional resistance carried by filter cloth at anode and cathode sides f 1 remains nearly constant during edw run in configuration b the factional resistance of the filter cloth at anode side f 2 decreases from 65 to about 15 during the edw run in configuration c the fractional resistance of the filter cloth at cathode side f 3 increases and after reaching a maximum around 35 it decreases to about 5 with dry solids content in other words fig 10c also depicts the non uniformity of the current distributions caused by the heterogeneous changes in cake sludge bed conductivity and hence may explain the variation in the dewatering kinetics during the electro dewatering process for sludge sample to another one on the other hand as can be seen from fig 10d it is clear that in the range of 22 24 wt of dry solids content the fractional resistance of the filter cloth at anode side is predominate about 58 65 of the fractional resistance results from the filter cloth at anode side and around 12 18 from the filter cloth at cathode side while more than 20 from the cake sludge bed therefore the filter cloth at anode side is more conductive than the cake sludge to be treated as expected thereafter in the range of 24 33 wt more than 20 coming from the cake sludge bed and about 42 45 from the filter cloth at anode side compared to around 24 32 from the filter cloth at cathode side showing that the fractional resistance is mainly caused by the filter cloths finally in the range of 33 44 wt the increase of electrical resistance of cake sludge bed formed is more pronounced and more than 30 of the fractional resistance comes from the cake sludge bed compared to 30 38 from the filter cloth at anode side and less of 5 8 from the filter cloth at cathode side at the end from about 45 wt onwards the electrical resistance of the cake sludge bed formed is too high and electro dewatering eventually stops and no more water is removed finally from an energetically point of view it is clear from a perusal of fig 10e that the best strategy to reduce the energy consumption in kwh per unit mass of the dry solids kwh kgds for the tests carried out for four different configurations is observed in configuration d when the electrodes were placed in direct contact with the cake sludge bed according to fig 10e the power consumption required to achieve a target cake dryness e g 40 wt was around 0 61 kwh kgds for configuration a around 0 32 kwh kgds for configuration b around 0 18 kwh kgds for configuration c and only around 0 08 for kwh kgds for configuration d as a result it seems that there is a potential saving in power consumption of about 80 in configuration d when both electrodes are in direct contact with the cake sludge bed about 62 in configuration c about 44 in configuration b compared to the common configuration a when both electrodes and cake sludge bed separated by filter cloth at anode and cathode sides these experimental observations are in line with the findings by saveyn et al 2006 yu et al 2010 and citeau et al 2012a however although positioning the filter cloths away from the electrodes have a significant effect on the process energy efficiency when the electrodes are in direct contact with the cake sludge bed configuration d this configuration is likely to hinder the discharge of the cake at the end of the dewatering cycle in a continuous and larger scale process in order to tackle such hindering one option would be to manufacture electrodes which have the filter cloth built into them otherwise the selection of alternative filter cloths with lower electric resistance can also be a good option used to enhance the electro dewatering energy efficiency 3 2 3 influence of the filter cloth position on the filtrate volume collected at anode and cathode sides the influence of the filter cloth position relative to the electrode was also investigated for digested sludge under 5 bar 40 a m2 for four configurations the ratio of the filtrate volume collected at the anode to the volume collected at the cathode side vanode vcathode was analysed and compared against mdw the latter should give a volume ratio close to one since a two sided dewatering chamber should not preference one side over the other for the specific conditions 5 bar 40 a m2 the electro dewatering flowrate from each electrode was shown to be unaffected by the position of the filter cloth for any of the electrode arrangements as shown in fig 11 a this means that although there are energy savings from moving the filter cloth toward the electrodes this is does not infer better dewatering performance the volume collected at the anode for digested sludge is very consistent for all the configurations and therefore as the ratio is also consistent then the volume collected at the cathode will also be consistent starting at a value of 1 2 the ratio of the filtrate volume collected at the anode to the volume collected at the cathode side vanode vcathode gradually reduced to 0 4 towards the end of the electro dewatering process which indicates a progressive decrease in water content of the sludge from 59 2 down to 88 5 comparing activated sludge to digested sludge fig 11b shows the filtrate volume collected at the anode side for both digested sludge 40 a m2 and activated sludge 20 and 40 a m2 the outliers are the bottom two lines which are activated sludge and the top line which is digested sludge mdw in the case of the activated sludge 25 more liquid is collected at the anode in the first 600 s which changes the hydrodynamics after edw is switched on the effect of the higher flowrate from the cathode due to edw is very apparent from the figure below fig 11c which is just plotted from the point that edw is initiated the results also show that activated sludge arrives at an equilibrium much faster after approximately 3600 s compared with digested sludge which is still dewatering after 7200 s likewise for comparison there is a large reduction in dewatering time required to reach a same target ratio 0 6 the time is reduced from 3000 s in the case of digested sludge to only 840 s in the case of activated sludge at 40 a m2 as shown in fig 11c this is due to the difference in the physico chemical characteristics of raw sludge electrical conductivity as mentioned earlier for low electrical conductivity 0 8 ms cm for the activated sludge the specific conductivity of the porous medium is enhanced by the presence of solids particles on the other hand a lower conductivity provides a greater voltage drop across the cathode and therefore more repulsion of the solids from the cathode this provides better access for the liquid to pass leading to continuously high filtrate flowrate the effect is more pronounced for incremental increases in applied current density for the activated sludge as shown in fig 11c for example the time is reduced from about dt1 1320 s to dt2 840 s to reach the target ratio 0 6 with increasing the applied current density from 20 to 40 a m2 as shown in fig 11c 4 conclusions the objective of this study was to compare the electro dewatering performance of two very different wastewater sludge the conditioned digested sludge was more easily dewatered without the application of an electric field by mdw compared to the activated sludge the average specific resistance of both sludge was measured and the activated sludge resistance was 28 greater than the digested sludge however during edw the activated sludge is more strongly impacted by the application of the electric field and compared with mdw the final solids fraction is increased by up to 20 percentage points at 40 a m2 the differences between the activated and digested sludge can be summarized as follows the relatively high electrical conductivity of digested sludge ratio of kdigested sludge kactivated sludge 5 allows current to bypass via the liquid phase particularly in the early stages the two sided configuration allowed the measurement of filtrate volume at both the anode and cathode the ratio of the filtrate volume collected at the anode to cathode decreased with activated over digested sludge and increasing current ohmic heating helps dewatering synergistically for both sludge but the higher resistance for activated sludge leads to a higher heating rate and higher cake temperatures for the same applied current density e g at 40 a m2 the circuit resistances were tested by changing the position of the filter cloths relative to the electrodes the electro dewatering flowrate from each electrode was shown to be unaffected by the position of the filter cloth for any of the electrode arrangements these experiments showed that there is a potential reduction in power consumption of about 80 when both electrodes were placed in direct contact with the cake sludge moving the filter cloths away from the electrodes provides a more efficient area for filter cake discharge but this will come at the expense of the edw energy efficiency acknowledgements the authors would like to thank all authors of the

19830,electro dewatering edw is an alternative emerging and energy efficient technology that provides improved liquid solids separations in the dewatering of wastewater sludge the edw technology is not only an innovative dewatering method for significantly reducing the volume of wastewater sludge before re utilization or disposal but is also a promising emerging method which may potentially be used for decontamination purposes in this study the influence of the sludge properties e g electrical conductivity zeta potential specific cake resistance among others on their mechanical and electrical behaviour in terms of dewaterability and electro dewaterability the applied current current density from 20 to 80 a m2 and filter cloth position relative to the electrode was investigated a two sided filter press at lab scale with moving anode was used and the treatment performance of the edw process on two different types of wastewater sludge activated and digested was thoroughly assessed from both an electrochemical viewpoint and in terms of the dewatering rate the results showed that the conditioned digested sludge was more easily dewatered by mechanical dewatering mdw with 34 35 w of dry solids content compared to 19 20 w for the activated sludge thanks to the lower content of both the microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps and the volatile suspended solids fraction for the edw results the electrical conductivity of the sludge was pivotal to the dryness of the final solids and therefore also to the dewatering kinetics the results demonstrated that the activated sludge arrived at an equilibrium much faster after approximately 3600 s compared with digested sludge thanks to its lower electrical conductivity 0 8 ms cm providing a greater voltage drop across the cathode and therefore more repulsion of the solids from the cathode leading to continuously high filtrate flowrate also the edw performance was analysed by comparing the ratio of the filtrate volume collected at the anode to the volume collected at the cathode side for digested sludge at 5 bar 40 a m2 different positions of the filter cloth were tested but these configurations barely impacted the edw performance despite having a significant impact on the energy requirements at industrial scale it would be useful to position the filter cloths at some distance from the electrodes but this study shows that this benefit may be quickly outweighed by the loss in edw energy efficiency graphical abstract image 1 keywords electro dewatering wastewater sludge performance dryness level energy consumption two sided filter press 1 introduction over the last few decades the volume of municipal and industrial sewage sludge has increased many times due to the intensification of water purification and the cost of disposal of this sludge has increased due to more stringent legislation for the protection of the environment mahmoud et al 2011a 2013 2016 wastewater sludge is an important component of the product of wastewater treatment facilities the sludge has to be dewatered and toxic or noxious contaminants such as heavy metals microorganisms and hazardous organics have to be removed or inactivated before re use can be considered depending on the locality sludge may be reused as a valuable soil amendment composted incinerated or disposed to landfill tuan and sillanpää 2010a mahmoud et al 2011a 2013 the residual water content in the sludge is usually removed by mechanical processes involving gravitational settlers centrifuges belt filter presses and plate and frame filter presses and further dried if necessary by conventional thermal drying the dewatering efficiencies obtained with wastewater sludge are generally low with a practical limit of around 35 wt solids on a wet basis even when the sludge is conditioned before dewatering chen et al 2002 mahmoud et al 2011a 2016 a traditional thermal drying process can achieve a high sludge dryness level and provide good control and high destruction of contaminants however the energy consumption is proportional to the amount of water which must be evaporated and both high capital and operating costs are proportional to the water removal from wastewater sludge mahmoud et al 2008 2016 fytili and zabaniotou 2008 the minimum drying energy requirement refers to water vaporisation enthalpy of about 0 62 kwh kgwater removed and in industrial devices it can reach as high as 1 2 kwh kgwater removed gazbar et al 1994 perry and green 1997 mujumdar 2007 mahmoud et al 2008 2010 2011a 2013 depending on the type of wastewater sludge the electro dewatering edw is considered as one of the most effective emerging processes for the improvement of wastewater sludge dewatering efficiency mahmoud et al 2011a 2013 2016 in the edw process an electric field is applied during the conventional mechanical pressure dewatering mdw of the sludge to enhance the separation process efficiency with low energy consumption to increase the final dry solids content and to accelerate the dewatering kinetics saveyn et al 2005 2006 mahmoud et al 2010 2011a 2013 2016 citeau et al 2011 2012a 2016 glendinning et al 2010 tuan et al 2008 2012a iwata et al 2013 olivier et al 2014 feng et al 2014 recent studies investigated a wide range of scenarios in order to reduce the water content to optimize the operating mode for a desired final dry solids content and to obtain the best energetically and economically feasible edw process a number of these studies reported in literature are summarized in table 1 most of these studies are empirical and essentially focused on the process parameters and the sludge characteristics mahmoud et al 2010 2013 as shown in table 1 the studies are grouped based on the mode of dewatering where u edw refers to constant voltage i edw refers to constant current and e edw refers to constant electric field strength recently mahmoud and co workers compared the energy required to dewater and dry wastewater sludge for different combinations of either electrical or mechanical dewatering followed by thermal drying mahmoud et al 2008 2011a b 2013 2016 they demonstrated that to achieve a dryness fraction of 50 the optimum edw process had an energy consumption of 0 30 kwh kg of water removed which is less than 50 of the energy consumption of a thermal drying process mahmoud et al 2011a they also reported that by delaying the application of the electric field to the filter cake compression stage there was a potential saving in power consumption of around 10 12 in the case of u edw and about 30 46 in the case of i edw compared to the application of the electrical field from the start mahmoud et al 2016 for their part citeau and co workers with their new improvement in edw process by anode flushing anode filtrate recirculation based on the work of larue et al 2001 2006 showed that there was also a potential reduction in power consumption of around 12 19 in the case of i edw with anode flushing compared with no flushing to reach the same level in dryness of bentonite sludge 66 2 wt citeau et al 2016 in addition to its relative high dryness level and the energy efficiency in the dewatering of wastewater sludge edw technology is also a potential method of reducing bacterial pathogens in wastewater sludge esmaeily et al 2006 huang et al 2008 navab daneshmand et al 2012 they reported that the edw process offered an interesting disinfection method for the reduction to below detection limits of salmonella spp bacteria enteric viruses and fecal coliforms fc in their experiments navab daneshmand et al 2012 demonstrated that the principal source of total coliforms and escherichia coli inactivation mechanisms during the edw process was related to the significant temperature rise from ohmic heating this is also supported by the findings of yin et al 2018 indeed other studies pointed out that the edw process may also be a potential method for decontaminating hazardous substances via the migration of heavy metals and organic compounds such as oils and greases present in the sludge kim et al 2002 hwang and min 2003 yang

charge and therefore are surrounded by a layer with a higher density of positive charges and this phenomenon is referred to as the electric double layer when an electric field is applied the usually negative charged particles move towards the electrode of the opposite charge the water from pores and interstices commonly with associated cations is driven towards the negative electrode weber and stahl 2002 2003 yang et al 2009 mahmoud et al 2010 2011a ions species anions and cations are also subjected to electromigration transport according to their own ionic mobilities newman 1991 mahmoud et

the electrical field driving force q e k as schematically depicted in fig 1 the edw process thus induces the migration of negatively charged organic matter present in the sludge such as fatty acids

these toxic metals often limit the reuse of sludge in agriculture any reduction in heavy metals could be extremely beneficial to protect the public health and the environment hwang and min 2003 observed a large reduction of the heavy metal concentration such as zn mn pb cd ni in the sludge cake after an electro dewatering run tuan and co workers showed that concentration of na and k were reduced by 51 and 78 respectively in the sludge cake in comparison to experiments with only mechanical dewatering fe ions ca2 and mg2 concentrations were found to be lower in sludge at the anode and higher at the cathode while cr concentrations were increased in the sludge cake and anode effluent tuan and sillanpää 2010a b in their investigation mahmoud et al 2011a reported that the edw under high levels of applied voltage caused colouration and even odour of the water removed at the cathode side giving it a dark green brown appearance instead of grey colour at high levels of voltage they also observed an increase in the turbidity electrical conductivity and the total suspended solids tss of the water removed at the cathode side which is in line with the findings of chen et al 2011 they explained their experimental results by the combined effect of the electromigration of heavy metals microbial cells ions and intracellular organic matter the latter refers to substance which is initially inside the cells but leaks out due to the lysis or destruction of the cell walls recently xu et al 2017 reported that the edw process can also enhance the removal efficiency of aluminum ions al from sludge although electro dewatering has been widely studied by various researchers mentioned already these works deal mainly with the effect of the process parameters type of sludge conditioning and process variants including improvement in the process design and operation table 1 there are few publications focused on the influence of sludge electro physico chemical proprieties on their mechanical and electrical behaviour in terms of dewaterability and electro dewaterability moreover to the best of our knowledge there are no comparative studies which analyse the different contributions of the electrical resistance of the different elements of the edw system e g filter cloth at anode and cathode sides two conducting phases liquid solids sludge medium or to differentiate the relative contributions of electro kinetic transport and hydraulic pressure driven filtration and or compression and to compare the results obtained from the same electro dewatering device on the same type of sludge in a single process therefore the specific objectives of the present paper are to i provide an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms involved in the electro dewatering in a two sided filter press ii determine the sludge characteristics which most affect the edw performance by comparing two contrasting types of sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge samples and chemical conditioning an activated sludge and an anaerobically digested sludge from two wastewater treatment plants france were used in this study the physico chemical proprieties of the raw sludge are listed in table 2 the collected activated and digested sludge samples were kept in plastic bags stored at 4 c and used over a period of less than one and two weeks respectively this timeframe limits the effect of biochemical composition changes in the material and enables an acceptable reliability of the experiments prior to the tests a 2000 g of activated sludge sample or 207 g of digested sludge were left for 30 min of acclimatization in the open air in order to reach room temperature at around 20 1 c before conditioning the sludge was conditioned with a highly cationic linear polymer em 640 l provided from snf floerger manufacturer france aqueous polyelectrolyte solutions were prepared at 5 g l active polyelectrolyte concentration 0 5 according to the instructions given by the manufacturer snf floerger andrézieux france in order to allow the polyelectrolyte chains to unfold completely for optimized contact the polyelectrolyte solutions were prepared at least 20 min prior to application the em 640 l conditioner dose was 3 5 g conditioner per kg of dry sludge g kgds according to preliminary gravity drainage tests carried out by mahmoud et al 2011a 2016 in the case of the anaerobically digested sludge a liner polymer em340 l was used at a fixed dose of 9 g kgds olivier et al 2014 for the sludge conditioning step a conventional jar test device was used operating at 270 rpm for 30 s of intense mixing of the polyelectrolyte into the sludge and then followed by a 30 s of slow stirring at 20 rpm to promote flocs growth mahmoud et al 2011a 2016 after the conditioning stage the activated sludge was filtered using a laboratory batch drainage apparatus olivier et al 2004 mahmoud et al 2011a 2016 and then the thickened sludge was diluted to a suitable dry solids content with an appropriated amount of supernatant filtrate in a typical run the diluted and conditioned sludge was loaded manually at room temperature in the electro dewatering cell the initial solids contents in the cell s i n were 9 1 0 5 wt and 10 3 0 5 wt for the activated and digested sludge respectively 2 2 experimental device for the investigation of wastewater sludge electro dewatering a two sided laboratory experimental set up was made as shown in fig 2 provided by choquenet s a s chauny france and modified by citeau and co workers citeau et al 2011 2012a b citeau 2012 it is noteworthy that such a configuration is more adapted to simulate an industrial filter press which has also two sided flow this edw lab scale set up consist of i a horizontal cylindrical

thermocouples used to measure the temperature of the filter cake and to stop the process when the temperature increase is too high mahmoud et al 2011a 2016 were placed at the cathode and anode inner sides inside the filter cake the computer logged the experimental data comprising the filtrate mass at the cathode and the anode sides the applied current and voltage the cake thickness and the anode and cathode temperatures every 3 s 2 3 experimental procedure the mechanical dewatering mdw and electro dewatering edw experiments were undertaken in the same equipment in a temperature controlled laboratory at 20 c 0 1 c the conditioned sludge with the suitable dry solids content 9 1 0 5 wt for activated sludge and 10 3 0 5 wt for the digested sludge was poured manually at room temperature into the electro dewatering cell in mdw there is no application of the electric field and a constant pressure was applied for 2 h at 5 bar for edw experiments these commenced with mdw at 5 bar for the first 10 min followed by the application of a selected current density these current densities were 20 40 and 80 a m2 for activated sludge and 40 and 80 a m2 for digested sludge electro dewatering these selected processing parameters were based on the operational conditions tested in the experiments campaigns carried out by mahmoud et al 2011a 2016 and citeau et al 2012a citeau 2012 all electro dewatering tests were carried out within a three day period two experiments per day and 6 experiments per series of three days each series of three days of experiments were repeated at least three times with the same processing conditions to evaluate the reproducibility of the results the curves shown in the graphs represent the average results and the error bars represent the standard deviations of three replicates for all experimental tests at the end of each experiment the dewatered cake was removed from the cell and weighed the average dry solids content was measured by drying at 105 c during 24 h and weighing according to the european standard procedure en 12880 the dry solids content was calculated continuously throughout the experiment from the recorded mass of the filtrate the partial evaporation of the extracted filtrate was considered in the calculations the average dry solids content of the sludge sample in the edw cell and the percentage of water removal in both mdw and edw run were measured using the method described by mahmoud et al 2011a 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 mdw run sludge dewaterability during mechanical dewatering mdw two steps can be distinguished the first is the filtration stage where a filter cake starts to build up against the filter the second is the compression stage where the piston comes in contact with the filter cake and the cake is compressed by the piston into a more compact form la heij 1994 la heij et al 1996 mahmoud et al 2008 in order to characterize the two sludge materials a simple series of mechanical dewatering filtration compression mdw experiments at an applied pressure 5 bar were performed in the two sided laboratory experimental set up without any electric field application the sludge dewaterability was then characterized using ruth s equation equation 1 ruth 1946 novak et al 1988 sorensen et al 1996 qi et al 2011 1 t v f p d f η α a v c 2 δ p a 2 v f η r m δ p a where v f is the filtrate volume m3 t is the time s a is the filter area m2 η is the dynamic viscosity of the filtrate pa s r m is the filter medium resistance m 1 α a v is the average specific resistance of the cake m kg c is the mass of cake solids deposited per volume of filtrate and is assumed constant and δ p is the applied pressure pa ruth s equation is based on flow through an incompressible material and therefore assumes that the filter cake has a constant porosity through the cake and for a given thickness there is a constant pressure drop across the cake and filter medium this leads to the constants in ruth s equation of c r m and also a constant liquid flow rate despite this assumption it is still useful for assessing the dewaterability filterability and compressibility of moderately and even extremely compressible materials such as wastewater sludge therefore the dewatering of a sludge in the filtration compression cell working under constant pressure was described using a t v f versus v f plot allowing the calculation of the average specific resistance of the cake α a v from the slope of the linear part of this plot the mdw runs were conducted for 2 h to reach the equilibrium point where no further dewatering occurred fig 3a b c and 4 a b c for activated and digested sludge respectively are characterized by plotting the dewatering properties of the average specific cake resistance and the specific filtration flow rate s f f δ p η α a v christensen et al 2015 against the dewatering time and the filtrate volume the resulting filter cake is also plotted as the average cake porosity and the cake thickness for comparison purposes with edw in the next section the filtrate volume collected separately at the cathode and anode ends are also recorded during the mechanical dewatering run mdw and shown in each figure it is clear from all these plots figs 3 and 4 that the conditioned digested sludge was more easily dewatered by mdw compared to the activated sludge the dry solids content at the end of the mdw run s f i n m d w was around 19 20 wt for the activated sludge and around 34 35 wt for the digested sludge the difference in mdw performance is attributed to the higher content of the microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps in the activated sludge a greater presence of eps leads to higher cake compressibility and an inferior final solids content mahmoud et al 2011a in fact the microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps will create a matrix which tends to hold the water and which has an elastic structure hard to squeeze by mdw mikkelsen and keiding 2002 citeau et al 2012a this is confirmed by figs 3a and 4a for the estimation of the average specific resistance values and consequently the specific flow rate which is around 2 63 1014 m kg for the activated sludge compared to around 1 90 1014 m kg in the case of the digested sludge the high average specific resistance of the activated sludge lowers the specific flow rate by a factor of 1 4 compared to the digested sludge conferring it the lower dewaterability table 2 monitoring the cake thickness as well as the average dry solids content during the experiments over time by a personal computer allowed the estimation of the cake volume and the average cake porosity evolution figs 3c and 4c show the cake thickness and the average cake porosity reduction during mdw run performed at a pressure of 5 bar the average cake porosity can be described as a function of the mass of dry solids m d s introduced in the edw cell the dryness level s t the liquid density ρ t l and the cake volume v t c a k e s l u d g e it can be then written as a function of these terms as follows ε c a k e s l u d g e m d s 1 s t s t ρ t l v t c a k e s l u d g e experimental analysis for 6 2 0 2 g of mass of dry solids matter initially introduced into the edw cell revealed a cake porosity of ε f i n m d w 0 734 and ε f i n m d w 0 551 at the end of the mechanical dewatering run for activated and digested sludge respectively table 2 3 2 edw run sludge electro dewaterability many authors including the present ones have already shown that the applied electric current density is pivotal to the dryness of the final solids and therefore also to the dewatering kinetics mahmoud et al 2010 2016 olivier et al 2014 2015 citeau et al 2011 2012a fig 5 depicts the typical mdw as well as the edw dewatering kinetics for both activated and digested sludge showing the effectiveness of the edw on the separate filtrate volume collected at the anode and cathode sides with different applied current densities for the same applied pressure 5 bar a large difference is depicted in the filtrate volumes collected at cathode and anode sides as shown in fig 5a b c d according to the theory of electro osmosis flow is induced towards the cathode electrode and thus the filtrate flow is increased at the cathode side for both activated and digested sludge as shown in fig 5c and d the electro osmosis effect is more pronounced for higher applied current density moreover as shown in fig 5a and b not only the dewatering rate at the anode side is lower than at the cathode side but also it seems that the dewatering rate is also inferior to mechanical dewatering for the digested sludge fig 5b there are two possible causes the first is the electrophoresis of particles towards the anode which results in a greater thickness of solid at the anode side compared to the cathode side which in turn leads to a greater filtration resistance the second possible cause is the evolution of oxygen gas bubbles that are too large to pass thorough the filter cloth and thus stay on the anode side which can act as a barrier against the anode filtrate flow rate either or both these effects at the anode side lead to a preferential dewatering rate at the cathode leading to a continuously high filtrate flow rate and a greater quantity of filtrate collected at the cathode looking at the overall dewatering kinetic the increase of the applied current density accelerates the edw kinetics as shown from the time t versus v 2 plot in fig 6 a b in the case of the activated sludge there is a large increase in the filtrate volume collected with increasing the applied current density from 0 to 80 a m2 as shown in fig 6a i for example at 1760 s the extra filtrate volume collected is increased from about δ v 2 3 03 10 10 m6 exp at 20 a m2 to δ v 2 6 33 10 10 m6 exp at 40 a m2 to δ v 2 1 08 10 9 m6 exp at 80 a m2 the corresponding average dry solids contents were 17 8 19 5 27 2 wt respectively as shown in the insert in fig 6a ii on the other hand the analysis of the extent of water removal in each dewatering step mdw and edw of process as well as the remaining water in dewatered sludge at the end of i edw test are also useful parameters to illustrate the effectiveness of water removal during the process as shown in the second insert in fig 6a iii the results indicate that more than 50 of the total water was removed by mdw before the application of the electric field when a current density was combined with mdw run the percentage of extra water removed increased considerably by at least 40 in the case of the digested sludge the results obtained at 0 40 and 80 a m2 are presented in fig 6b although that the conditioned digested sludge was more easily dewatered by mdw compared to the activated sludge the electro dewaterability shows a completely different behaviour comparatively after the mdw run for 2 h 7200 s the average cake solids content was around s f i n m d w 34 35 wt while it reached around s f i n e d w 47 48 wt with the application of the current density e g 40 a m2 corresponding to about 13 points of gain the increased electro dewatering kinetic response is also quantified by the increased filtrate volume collected and represented by time t versus v 2 plot as shown in fig 6b i fig 6b i ii clearly illustrates that the electro kinetic effect is relatively small in the early dewatering period of the digested sludge for example at 40 a m2 condition in the early period of the dewatering from 0 to 2800 s period i the effect of current density on the dewatering kinetics is minor compared with what is achieved by only mdw and consequently the dry solids contents were of the same order or even inferior compared to mdw this can be explained by the high electrolyte content and hence high electrical conductivity of the digested sludge 8 2 ms cm compared to only 0 8 ms cm in the case of activated sludge which may alter the electroosmotic flow rate and reduce the dewaterability due to the reduction of the electrical double layer of the particles citeau et al 2011 2012a the absolute zeta potential of particles and hence the electroosmotic flow decrease as reported by mahmoud et al 2010 after that from 2800 s onwards period ii the voltage and electrical resistance increased slowly followed by a sharp rise at the end of the process see section 3 2 2 fig 9b showing a linear trend increase of the dry solids content versus time the effect of the applied current density on the cake thickness and the average cake porosity is shown in fig 7 a and b in the case of the activated sludge the cake thickness decreased slowly from 2 77 cm to less than 0 98 cm in the case of 20 a m2 the amplitude of the decrease or shrinkage of the cake sludge thickness is obviously more pronounced at 40 and 80 a m2 as shown in fig 7a the edw run allowed a cake thickness reduction of around 65 20 a m2 and 75 40 a m2 compared to around 49 in the case of mdw run with knowledge of the cake sludge temperature the dryness level s t the change in liquid density ρ t l and the cake volume v t c a k e s l u d g e during the experiments over time the average cake porosity evolution can be quantified and shown in the insert in fig 7a experimental data show that the average cake porosity decreases with increasing electric current density as previously observed for activated sludge edw the cake thickness of the digested sludge decreased with increasing electric current density fig 7b shows that the cake thickness reduced by 66 for mdw and for edw the reduction was 78 and 84 for 40 and 80 a m2 respectively 3 2 1 synergetic thermal effect analysis the electro dewatering system is essentially an electrochemical reactor this implies that the edw reactor exhibits a considerable ohmic heating mahmoud et al 2010 2011a 2016 citeau et al 2012b 2016 navab daneshmand et al 2015 the electrical current that passes through sludge and the increase in sludge resistance release heat that is defined as ohmic or joule heating according to joule s law the ohmic heating energy q j is expressed as i2rcell where i is the electric current a and rcell is the cell electrical resistance which includes the resistance of the sludge cavity and between the filter cloths and their respective electrodes ohm mahmoud et al 2010 2011a 2016 r cell depends on the sludge the filter cloth thickness filter cake dryness and ionic concentration citeau et al 2012b it can be represented by the sum of the ohmic drop in the cell chamber i r c e l l u o h m u f i l t e r a n o d e u c a k e s l u d g e b e d u f i l t e r c a t h o d e as reported by mahmoud et al 2006 the ohmic drop in the filter cloth over its thickness δ f i l t e r 2 u f i l t e r a n o d e i r f i l t e r a n o d e 3 u f i l t e r c a t h o d e i r f i l t e r c a t h o d e the ohmic drop in the sludge cake bed over its thickness δ c a k e s l u d g e b e d 4 u c a k e s l u d g e b e d i r b e d where r is the various electrical resistances of filter cloths and sludge cake bed which represents the contribution of each element to the overall electric resistance of the cell the ohmic heating seems to play a substantive role in the electro dewatering process mahmoud et al 2010 2011a citeau et al 2012b 2016 navab daneshmand et al 2015 it results in a considerable change in the water viscosity and therefore an essential acceleration of the dewatering rate weber 2002 weber and stahl 2002 2003 clayton et al 2006 mahmoud et al 2008 2011a 2016 this ohmic heating effect may also play a synergistic role in facilitating the removal of some of the remaining water in the dewatered sludge as reported by mahmoud et al 2011a 2016 it will heat the sludge internally increasing its temperature and consequently decreasing the liquid viscosity which can force moisture out of the solid capillaries and also reduce the resistance of the sludge to compressive forces clayton et al 2006 mahmoud et al 2008 2011a 2016 for an electro dewatering run as show in fig 7c and d the temperature of both activated and digested sludge cake increase with the applied current density as the dewatering proceeds the temperature rise is more pronounced for incremental increases in applied current density however high absolute temperature due to ohmic heating could adversely affect the edw cell equipment filtering cloths electrodes and ultimately hampering the edw process therefore if the temperature increase is too large it may become necessary for the operator to stop the process in order to prevent the deterioration of both the filtering cloths and the electrodes used according to the instructions given by the manufacturer mahmoud et al 2011a 2016 the average temperature of sludge cake was in the range of 20 30 c exp 20 a m2 20 50 c exp 40 a m2 20 65 c exp 80 a m2 in the case of activated sludge and in the range of 20 45 c exp 40 a m2 and 20 68 c exp 80 a m2 for digested sludge the variation of the dynamic water viscosity corresponding to these ranges of temperature was calculated and normalized with its value at 20 c and computed according to η t η 20 c as shown in fig 7e and f the ohmic heating effect on the η t η 20 c is obviously more pronounced for incremental increases in applied current density for both activated and digested sludge as the dewatering proceeds the corresponding decrease in viscosity of almost 28 60 and 72 in the case of activated sludge and around 48 and 73 in the case of digested sludge fig 7e and f consequently the ohmic heating contribution in decreasing viscosity resulted in an essential acceleration of the dewatering kinetic facilitating the removal of some of the remaining water which would normally be difficult to remove therefore concurrently with the electro osmotic flow it can be concluded that providing the ohmic heating is not excessive then it has a synergetic effect in enhancing water removal and hence dewatering kinetics and this in line with the findings of weber and stahl 2002 mahmoud et al 2011a 2016 3 2 2 electrical resistance effect analysis the electrical current flow through porous medium is dependent on the conductivity of the solids namely the dispersed phase and the liquid phases namely the continuous phase helfferich 1962 mahmoud et al 2006 2010 several theories have been proposed for the transport of electrical current in mixtures helfferich 1962 mahmoud et al 2006 2010 electrical conductivity of porous medium is complex and varies with the mobility and the affinity of ions with which solid particles are in contact helfferich 1962 for very low conductivity of the liquid phase the specific conductivity of the porous medium is enhanced by the presence of solids particles in contrast when the liquid phase conductivity is high then its contribution to electrical transport becomes more significant mahmoud and co workers mahmoud et al 2006 2010 based on the pioneering work developed by wyllie and southwick 1954 sauer et al 1955 helfferich 1962 reported that the electrical current is considered to pass through three different paths within the cake sludge bed each of these is depicted in fig 8 the first 1 is when the current passes through alternating layers of particles and interstitial solution 2 through particles in contact with each other and 3 in the channel of the liquid phase in most cases process 1 predominates however contribution of 2 is significant for low conducting liquids if the conductivity of the liquid is considerably higher than that of the particles the third mechanism becomes the most important for the sake of clarity only the results obtained at 40 a m2 and 5 bar for both sludges are presented and discussed in this section fig 9 shows the transient behaviour of electrical current voltage and the corresponding cake dryness plots during edw run performed at 40 a m2 for both sludges when looking more closely at the transient behaviour of electrical current plots fig 9a and b it is clear that for activated sludge only a few minutes 200 360 s are necessary before the electro osmotic flow rate becomes much higher than the pressure driven filtrate flow rate period ii in fig 9a meanwhile for digested sludge as early illustrated section 3 2 the electro kinetic effect is relatively small in the early dewatering period and only from 2800 s onwards the electro osmotic flow rate overtakes the mdw flow rate period ii in fig 9b this is related to the difference in the physico chemical characteristics of the two sludge e g electrical conductivity as shown in table 2 in the period i the corresponding overall electrical resistance was in range of 340 420 ohm for activated sludge however for digested sludge the electrical resistance is for a long period at around 180 ohm highest overall electrical resistances were recorded with activated sludge in agreement with its lowest electrical conductivity 0 8 ms cm thereafter in period ii the voltage and electrical resistance increased slowly followed by a sharp rise showing a linear trend increase of the dry solids content versus time at the end of the process the electrical resistance of the cake formed is too high and electro dewatering eventually stops and no more water is removed mahmoud et al 2011a 2016 citeau et al 2012a however the high initial electrolyte content of digested sludge and hence the cake sludge bed electrical conductivity 1 02 ms cm compared to only 0 21 ms cm for activated sludge fig 9a and b would limit the water driven effect assured by the ionized mobile liquid displacement under the applied electric field citeau et al 2012a thereafter when the cake sludge bed electrical conductivity of digested sludge is reduced to a sufficient value around 0 17 ms cm the electrical current passes through alternating layers of particles and interstitial solution and through particles in contact with each other consequently an electro osmotic flow is created and this accounts for the acceleration of the filtrate removal compared to mdw run as shown in fig 9b a complementary series of experiments was carried out for digested sludge under 5 bar 40 a m2 for four different configurations in order to understand the electrical behaviour of the cake sludge bed and the influence of the components of the overall electrical resistance fig 10 a shows four configurations and their equivalent electric circuits represented by three resistances connected in series the filter cloth at the anode the filter cloth at the cathode sides and the cake sludge bed a electrodes and cake sludge bed separated by filter cloths at anode and cathode sides b the cathode electrode in direct contact with cake sludge bed c the anode electrode in direct contact with cake sludge bed d both electrodes in direct contact with cake sludge bed the configurations performed in this study allow the measuring of the overall cell voltage and the voltage coming from each element cloth filter anode cloth filter cathode both filter cloths and cake sludge bed by a simple subtracting with respect to the related configuration assuming a serial connection of the three resistances and with knowledge of these voltages the various resistances during the experiments over time can be calculated from equations 5 7 and then be represented in fig 10b as follows citeau et al 2012a 5 r f i l t e r a n o d e c a t h o d e u f i l t e r a n o d e c a t h o d e c o n f a u b e d c o n f d

f d 1 r b e d c o n f d it can be inferred in fig 10b that in period i of edw test the electric resistance of filter cloth at the anode side rfilter anode was higher than the electric resistance of filter cloth at the cathode side rfilter cathode and the electric resistance of cake sludge bed rbed in period ii from 2800 s onwards the electrical resistance of cake sludge bed rbed increased slowly to become gradually more important than the resistance on the cathode side at the end of the process the electrical resistance of the cake formed is too high and electro dewatering eventually stops and no more water is removed which is in line with the results obtained and presented in fig 9b on the other hand it can be determined the fractional resistance which represents the contribution of each element to the overall electric resistance for the four different configurations a b c d in general the fractional resistance f e of an element is equal to 8 f e r e r o v e r a l l where re and roverall are the electrical resistance of the element and the total edw system respectively hence the fractional resistance corresponding to the filter cloth at anode and cathode sides configuration a

fractional resistance on a large range of dry solids content fig 10c and d represents the fractional resistance of the different elements of the edw cell for the digested sludge versus the dry solids content for the four different configurations when both electrodes were separated from the cake sludge bed by the filter cloths configuration a the electric resistance of filter cloths reaches up to 75 82 of the overall resistance however the trend of this fractional resistance carried by filter cloth at anode and cathode sides f 1 remains nearly constant during edw run in configuration b the factional resistance of the filter cloth at anode side f 2 decreases from 65 to about 15 during the edw run in configuration c the fractional resistance of the filter cloth at cathode side f 3 increases and after reaching a maximum around 35 it decreases to about 5 with dry solids content in other words fig 10c also depicts the non uniformity of the current distributions caused by the heterogeneous changes in cake sludge bed conductivity and hence may explain the variation in the dewatering kinetics during the electro dewatering process for sludge sample to another one on the other hand as can be seen from fig 10d it is clear that in the range of 22 24 wt of dry solids content the fractional resistance of the filter cloth at anode side is predominate about 58 65 of the fractional resistance results from the filter cloth at anode side and around 12 18 from the filter cloth at cathode side while more than 20 from the cake sludge bed therefore the filter cloth at anode side is more conductive than the cake sludge to be treated as expected thereafter in the range of 24 33 wt more than 20 coming from the cake sludge bed and about 42 45 from the filter cloth at anode side compared to around 24 32 from the filter cloth at cathode side showing that the fractional resistance is mainly caused by the filter cloths finally in the range of 33 44 wt the increase of electrical resistance of cake sludge bed formed is more pronounced and more than 30 of the fractional resistance comes from the cake sludge bed compared to 30 38 from the filter cloth at anode side and less of 5 8 from the filter cloth at cathode side at the end from about 45 wt onwards the electrical resistance of the cake sludge bed formed is too high and electro dewatering eventually stops and no more water is removed finally from an energetically point of view it is clear from a perusal of fig 10e that the best strategy to reduce the energy consumption in kwh per unit mass of the dry solids kwh kgds for the tests carried out for four different configurations is observed in configuration d when the electrodes were placed in direct contact with the cake sludge bed according to fig 10e the power consumption required to achieve a target cake dryness e g 40 wt was around 0 61 kwh kgds for configuration a around 0 32 kwh kgds for configuration b around 0 18 kwh kgds for configuration c and only around 0 08 for kwh kgds for configuration d as a result it seems that there is a potential saving in power consumption of about 80 in configuration d when both electrodes are in direct contact with the cake sludge bed about 62 in configuration c about 44 in configuration b compared to the common configuration a when both electrodes and cake sludge bed separated by filter cloth at anode and cathode sides these experimental observations are in line with the findings by saveyn et al 2006 yu et al 2010 and citeau et al 2012a however although positioning the filter cloths away from the electrodes have a significant effect on the process energy efficiency when the electrodes are in direct contact with the cake sludge bed configuration d this configuration is likely to hinder the discharge of the cake at the end of the dewatering cycle in a continuous and larger scale process in order to tackle such hindering one option would be to manufacture electrodes which have the filter cloth built into them otherwise the selection of alternative filter cloths with lower electric resistance can also be a good option used to enhance the electro dewatering energy efficiency 3 2 3 influence of the filter cloth position on the filtrate volume collected at anode and cathode sides the influence of the filter cloth position relative to the electrode was also investigated for digested sludge under 5 bar 40 a m2 for four configurations the ratio of the filtrate volume collected at the anode to the volume collected at the cathode side vanode vcathode was analysed and compared against mdw the latter should give a volume ratio close to one since a two sided dewatering chamber should not preference one side over the other for the specific conditions 5 bar 40 a m2 the electro dewatering flowrate from each electrode was shown to be unaffected by the position of the filter cloth for any of the electrode arrangements as shown in fig 11 a this means that although there are energy savings from moving the filter cloth toward the electrodes this is does not infer better dewatering performance the volume collected at the anode for digested sludge is very consistent for all the configurations and therefore as the ratio is also consistent then the volume collected at the cathode will also be consistent starting at a value of 1 2 the ratio of the filtrate volume collected at the anode to the volume collected at the cathode side vanode vcathode gradually reduced to 0 4 towards the end of the electro dewatering process which indicates a progressive decrease in water content of the sludge from 59 2 down to 88 5 comparing activated sludge to digested sludge fig 11b shows the filtrate volume collected at the anode side for both digested sludge 40 a m2 and activated sludge 20 and 40 a m2 the outliers are the bottom two lines which are activated sludge and the top line which is digested sludge mdw in the case of the activated sludge 25 more liquid is collected at the anode in the first 600 s which changes the hydrodynamics after edw is switched on the effect of the higher flowrate from the cathode due to edw is very apparent from the figure below fig 11c which is just plotted from the point that edw is initiated the results also show that activated sludge arrives at an equilibrium much faster after approximately 3600 s compared with digested sludge which is still dewatering after 7200 s likewise for comparison there is a large reduction in dewatering time required to reach a same target ratio 0 6 the time is reduced from 3000 s in the case of digested sludge to only 840 s in the case of activated sludge at 40 a m2 as shown in fig 11c this is due to the difference in the physico chemical characteristics of raw sludge electrical conductivity as mentioned earlier for low electrical conductivity 0 8 ms cm for the activated sludge the specific conductivity of the porous medium is enhanced by the presence of solids particles on the other hand a lower conductivity provides a greater voltage drop across the cathode and therefore more repulsion of the solids from the cathode this provides better access for the liquid to pass leading to continuously high filtrate flowrate the effect is more pronounced for incremental increases in applied current density for the activated sludge as shown in fig 11c for example the time is reduced from about dt1 1320 s to dt2 840 s to reach the target ratio 0 6 with increasing the applied current density from 20 to 40 a m2 as shown in fig 11c 4 conclusions the objective of this study was to compare the electro dewatering performance of two very different wastewater sludge the conditioned digested sludge was more easily dewatered without the application of an electric field by mdw compared to the activated sludge the average specific resistance of both sludge was measured and the activated sludge resistance was 28 greater than the digested sludge however during edw the activated sludge is more strongly impacted by the application of the electric field and compared with mdw the final solids fraction is increased by up to 20 percentage points at 40 a m2 the differences between the activated and digested sludge can be summarized as follows the relatively high electrical conductivity of digested sludge ratio of kdigested sludge kactivated sludge 5 allows current to bypass via the liquid phase particularly in the early stages the two sided configuration allowed the measurement of filtrate volume at both the anode and cathode the ratio of the filtrate volume collected at the anode to cathode decreased with activated over digested sludge and increasing current ohmic heating helps dewatering synergistically for both sludge but the higher resistance for activated sludge leads to a higher heating rate and higher cake temperatures for the same applied current density e g at 40 a m2 the circuit resistances were tested by changing the position of the filter cloths relative to the electrodes the electro dewatering flowrate from each electrode was shown to be unaffected by the position of the filter cloth for any of the electrode arrangements these experiments showed that there is a potential reduction in power consumption of about 80 when both electrodes were placed in direct contact with the cake sludge moving the filter cloths away from the electrodes provides a more efficient area for filter cake discharge but this will come at the expense of the edw energy efficiency acknowledgements the authors would like to thank all authors of the

19831,the feasibility of using fe0 s2o8 2 conditioning zero valence iron zvi persulfate ps integrated with horizontal electro dewatering hed to improve the dewaterability of activated sludge as was evaluated the removal and migration of free and bound water in the zvi ps hed process were determined along with the organic matter migration between the solid and liquid phases of as biosolids results showed that the optimum conditioning dosages were determined as 0 35 g zvi g dry solids ds and 0 15 g ps g ds on the basis of capillary suction time variation the lowest final water content wc of 83 67 in as occurred after the hed treatment at 40 v and 120 min as determined using the response surface methodology despite the disruption of as flocs and microbial cells through so 4 oxidation during the zvi ps conditioning the particle size and mass fractal dimension of the as flocs remained relatively stable as the zeta potential increased from 8 5 mv to 4 6 mv the coagulation of fe3 from the oxidation of fe2 by ps contributed to the relatively stable condition which favored the subsequent momentum of the electroosmotic flow moreover the zvi ps conditioning decreased the bound water content bwc from 1 83 g g ds to 1 38 g g ds and increased the free water content fwc from 60 27 g g ds to 60 91 g g ds indicating a transformation from free water to bound water after the zvi ps hed process the fwc and bwc were removed significantly with ratios of 96 32 and 79 78 respectively along with water removal through the zvi ps hed process the organic matter in the supernatant filtrate initially increased and further rose at the hed stage the analysis of the extracellular polymeric substance eps content showed that the proteins pns and polysaccharides pss at the liquid and solid phases decreased due to oxidative degradation furthermore the zvi ps stage significantly reduced the pns content of slime to 57 22 the pss content of eps to 68 50 and the pn like substances in the slime and tightly bound eps to 74 90 and 52 47 respectively in addition the wc of as correlated with the contents of pn and microbial by product like material in slime as well as tryptophan in tb eps and the low eps content in as indicated good dewaterability thus zvi ps should be selected as a pretreatment prior to hed graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge fe0 s2o8 2 conditioning

sludge wwtps wastewater treatment plants zvi zero valence iron 1 introduction the activated sludge as process is the most widely used wastewater treatment technology peng et al 2015 and produces substantial amounts of waste as in china the dry sludge 80 water content wc production reached 35 million tons at the end of 2015 xu et al 2017 sludge treatment and disposal are costly and account for up to 60 of the total operating costs of wastewater treatment plants wwtps gao et al 2015 hao et al 2010 li et al 2016a zhao et al 2017 thus sludge reduction has become a serious problem dewatering is a key operation for the cost effective reduction in sludge volume this operation involves several technologies such as mechanical filter electroosmosis thermal drying and constructed wetlands centrifugation filter pressing and other mechanical dewatering technologies have been widely used in wwtps however they can only remove free water and an insignificant amount of interstitial water thereby resulting in the high wc 65 80 of the sludge cake mahmoud et al 2016 tuan et al 2008 in recent years electro dewatering has been considered an efficient method for dewatering as electroosmosis is associated with the popular electrokinetic function which can drive water movement from anode to cathode and induce the migration of ions reduce the interstitial and capillary water and ultimately increase the amount of dry solids mahmoud et al 2016 tuan et al 2008 vesilind 1994 zhou et al 2007 reported that a horizontal electric field application for as leads to the wc values of 97 92 chu et al 2005 pointed out that a 50 v horizontal electric field decreases the wc of dewatered digested sludge in the range of 95 8 92 3 qian et al 2016 found that magnetic field conditioning combined with horizontal electro dewatering hed can improve as dewaterability and decrease the wc of as from 99 33 to 89 98 electric field and mechanical compressions are complementary and their combination improves dewatering gazbar et al 1994 yoshida 1993 citeau et al 2012 showed that hed combined with mechanical pressure the dry matter of agro industrial sludge to reach 40 w w after 3 h of hed with a current density of 80 a m2 moreover they indicated that mechanical pressure does not contribute to the increased hed flowrate since 2012 so 4 which presents a high redox potential of 2 60 v has been used in sludge conditioning and has performed satisfactorily in sludge dewatering because of its high degradability for extracellular polymeric substance eps and disruption of inner cells during oxidation shi et al 2016 in general so 4 can be activated by heat uv or a transition metal mn eqs 1 2 and 3 and the capillary suction time cst value of as can be reduced by approximately 88 when so 4 is obtained through fe ii activated persulfate ps zhen et al 2012 zhou et al 2015 observed that the cst of as decreases by over 50 when it is conditioned with 4 g l ps and 15 g l zero valence iron zvi during this process the reactions occur for so 4 production in accordance with eqs 4 and 5 in the study of li et al 2016b the hybrid process of electrolysis electrocoagulation zvi activated ps reduces the srf and cst of municipal sludge by 87 4 and 49 1 respectively in the advanced oxidization processes of fe ii ps and zvi ps zvi is more stable and more low cost than fe2 salt song et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 and can be recycled by electromagnets zanetti and godio 2006 1 2 3 4 fe s 2 o 8 2 fe ii 2 so 4 2 5 thus zvi ps can be regarded as an effective conditioning unit for improving the subsequent dewatering processes such as hed eps degradation and cell disruption during so 4 oxidation strengthen the reduction in interstitial and capillary water by using hed however to the best of our knowledge research on the combination of zvi ps and hed is limited in the present study the zvi ps hed process was used to treat as through batch experiments and its effects on the moisture and organics of as during this process were investigated accordingly the structure of as samples after each zvi ps hed stage was analyzed through sem and fractal methods differential scanning calorimetry dsc was performed to determine the variations in free water and distributions of water in as moreover the organics in the supernatant filtrate and eps layers of the as matrix were determined excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy and high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec were employed to identify the typical organic components in the as matrix and ultimately provide clues related to the zvi ps hed process 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge sample and analysis methods as samples were collected from an urban wwtp in beijing china and then immediately transferred to the laboratory within 2 h after 2 h of gravity sedimentation the concentrated as was taken as raw as and stored at 4 c in a refrigerator table 1 shows the main characteristics of raw as wc total suspended solids g l and volatile suspended solids g l were determined following standard methods apha 2005 the ph was measured using a ph meter pb 10 sartorius stedim biotech co ltd beijing china cst was tested using a cst meter 304b triton electronic co ltd uk with chromatography paper 17 chr whatman international ltd england the zeta potential was recorded using a zetasizer nano z system malvern co uk following electrophoresis theory conductivity was measured using a conductivity meter ec215 beijing kanggaote science and technology co ltd china the aforementioned and subsequent experiments were completed within 5 days and in triplicate to ensure reproducibility 2 2 experimental procedure the main experimental procedure is shown in fig 1 for the zvi ps conditioning a traditional jar test was performed using a six paddle stirring apparatus jty 6 tangshan dachang chemicals ltd china for each test 300 ml of as was transferred into a 500 ml beaker firstly both zvi 98 purity aladdin chemistry co ltd beijing china and ps ar sinopharm chemical reagents co beijing china were added into the beaker the beakers were then stirred at 100 rpm for 30 min after the treatment the cst was measured secondly the conditioned as was transferred to the hed apparatus fig 1c for gravity drainage without pressure and voltages the hed apparatus was made of plexiglass 85 mm 42 mm 65 mm a pair of iro2 ta2o5 meshes were taken as the anode and cathode to prevent corrosion and prolong the service life of the electrodes citeau et al 2015 mahmoud et al 2010 zhang et al 2017a the distance between the two electrodes was 65 mm the bottom of the filter chamber and electrodes were covered with a polypropylene filter cloth with a 5 μm aperture the valve of the filtrate pipe was opened to start draining and the filtrate was collected using a beaker on a balance draining continued until no more than two drops of filtrate were collected within 10 min 4 h were necessary and the wc of drained as by gravity was tested accordingly finally different voltages were provided using a variable dc power supply dh1719a 4 dahua electronic co ltd china during hed to drive the electric osmosis of water from the anode to the cathode and the water flowed across the polypropylene filter cloth the filtered water was regularly collected in a conical flask for weight measurement 2 3 response surface methodology rsm for activated sludge hed response surface methodology rsm an experimental technique was designed to determine the optimal response within specified ranges of factors yang et al 2009 in this study a central composite design ccd was used to optimize the operation parameters of hed khuri and cornell 1996 voltage and dewatering duration were regarded as independent variables and denoted as x 1 and x 2 the wc and energy consumption of dewatered sludge were selected as responses to y 1 and y 2 respectively the ccd consisted of 2k factorial points five replicates of central points and 2k 4 star points where k refers to the number of independent factors the two operation variables were considered at five levels namely two star points 1 41 and 1 41 low point 1 central point 0 and high point 1 tables 2 and 3 present the scope and level of the two factors and the complete experimental design respectively the experimental design combines linear and quadratic mathematical models that were selected or rejected on the basis of the p value probability with a 95 confidence level the corresponding equations are as follows 6 y 1 a 0 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 ε 7 y 2 b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b 11 x 1 2 b 22 x 2 2 b 12 x 1 x 2 ε where a 0 a 1 a 2 b 0 b 1 b 2 b 12 b 11 b 22 and ε represent the model regression coefficients the optimization goal was to minimize the wc and the energy consumption of the dewatered sludge using design expert 8 0 2 4 measurement of free and bound water contents bound water content bwc was measured via dsc lee and lee 1995 first the sample temperature of as decreased to 60 c at a rate of 10 c min under the assumption that the free water in the sample was frozen then temperature increased to 40 c at the same rate the absorbed or released heat in the as sample could be integrated using the peak area of the endothermic and exothermic curves free water content fwc could be obtained using the heat peak area under the endothermic curve bwc could be determined using the difference between fwc and total water content twc which was measured using standard methods apha 2005 8 w b w t δ h δ h 0 where w b and w t are the bwc and twc of the as samples respectively kg kg δ h is the amount of energy absorbed in the as samples and δ h 0 is the standard melting heat of ice 334 7 j g the tests were conducted in duplicate 2 5 extraction and analytical methods of eps fractions the eps layers namely slime loosely bound lb eps and tightly bound tb eps of as were extracted through centrifugation and ultrasonication methods yu et al 2008 the buffer solution ph 7 contained na3po4 nah2po4 nacl and kcl at a molar ratio of 2 4 9 1 the conductivity of the buffers was adjusted with deionized water to match those of the as samples after all the eps layers were extracted the particulates in each layer were filtered through polyether sulfone membranes with a pore size of 0 45 μm then the corresponding eps components such as polysaccharides pss proteins pns and humic acid like materials has were determined ps content was analyzed using the anthrone method with glucose as a standard pns and has contents were determined using the modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin bsa beijing aoboxing biotechnology co ltd china and has sigma usa as standards respectively qian et al 2015 in the modified lowry method color development was measured with and without the addition of cuso4 when cuso4 is omitted color development is due to humic compounds box 1983 and chromogenic amino acids peterson 1979 without cuso4 the color developed by bsa decreased to 20 but no decrease was observed for has the mutual interference of pns and humic compounds was addressed as shown in eqs 9 12 9 atotal aprotein ahumic 10 ablind 0 2 aprotein ahumie 11 aprotein 1 25 atotal ablind 12 ahumic ablind 0 2 aprotein where atotal is the total absorbance with cuso4 ablind is the total absorbance without cuso4 ahumic is the absorbance due to humic compounds and aprotein is the absorbance due to pns 2 6 supernatant filtrate and eps characterization the supernatant filtrate total eps and eps layered fractions of as were collected during the zvi ps hed process moreover the ph and conductivity were measured other sludge parameters including total organic carbon toc soluble cod scod and suspended solids were analyzed following standard methods apha 2005 the typical organics in the as matrix were identified using eem detection the eem fluorescence spectrum was obtained via fluorescence spectroscopy f 7000 hitachi japan with scanning emission spectra from 220 to 600 nm at 1 nm increments at varying excitation wavelengths from 200 nm to 400 nm at 5 nm increments to analyze the eem fluorescence spectrum quantitatively we performed fluorescence regional integration fri analysis and calculated the integration of the volume beneath each eem region chen et al 2003 the normalized excitation emission area volumes φ i n and φ t n with a unit of au nm2 referring to the values of regions i ii iii iv and v table 4 and the entire region and the percent fluorescence response ρ i n ϕ i n ϕ t n 100 were calculated following the method proposed by chen et al 2003 the eps mainly consisted of high molecular weight pss pns ha glycoproteins nucleic acids and phospholipids liu and pang 2003 to explore the change in eps compounds during the zvi ps hed process we analyzed the molecular weights mws of the organics in the supernatant filtrate total eps and eps layers hpsec was used to determine the mw of the organic compounds in as the hpsec device consisted of a waters 2487 dual λ absorbance detector and waters 1525 pump system a shodex kw 802 5 gel chromatography column shoko japan was used for organic material separation the mobile phase namely milli q water buffered with 5 mm phosphate to ph 6 8 and 0 01 m nacl was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane and then degassed for 30 min by ultrasonication before use a 200 μl sample was injected at a flow rate of 0 8 ml min 1 polystyrene sulfonate standards sigma aldrich usa of mws of 1 8 32 kda were used for apparent mw calibration wang et al 2010 2 7 activated sludge morphology before the observation of as morphology the as samples were freeze dried under vacuum at 60 c for 72 h and then sputter coated with gold for sem observation quanta 200 fei usa zhang et al 2017b the particle size distributions psds of as were determined through a small angle light scattering test with a laser scattering instrument malvern mastersizer 2000 malvern uk mean particle size and median particle size d 50 could be derived from the psd curves wu et al 2002 and mass fractal dimension d f was determined using the following equation tuan et al 2002 wu et al 2002 13 q 4 π n sin δ 2 λ where q is the difference between the incident and scattered wave vectors of the radiation beam in the medium n is the refractive index of the suspending medium δ is the scattering angle and λ is the wavelength of the radiation in a vacuum the total scattered light intensity i is a function of q they display a power law relationship that is expressed as follows 14 i q d f 2 8 statistical analysis correlation analysis on as filterability and the key factors were carried out using the ibm spss statistics 22 software the linear correlation between the key factors and wc was evaluated with pearson s correlation coefficient r the correlation r can range between 1 and 1 where 1 denotes a perfect negative correlation 1 means a perfect positive correlation and 0 indicates the absence of a relationship the correlations were considered statistically significant at a 95 confidence interval probability p 0 05 zhang et al 2015 zhen et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of the zvi ps process batch experiments were conducted to determine the optimum dosages of zvi and ps for as conditioning namely 0 35 g g ds zvi and 0 15 g g ds ps as shown in the supplementary materials si before the following hed unit the as samples were pre conditioned with these optimum dosages the main characteristics of the conditioned as are shown in table 5 3 2 rsm optimization of the hed process in accordance with the ccd in table 3 the linear and second order polynomial equations 15 and 16 were obtained after the data fitting respectively 15 y 1 92 26764 0 10652 x 1 0 027006

and 7 the p values less than 0 05 indicated that the model terms were significant reliable models could then be used to predict the optimum dewatering conditions for as the optimum dewatering conditions 40 v and 120 min were determined for the experimental set through design expert 8 0 the corresponding wc of zvi ps hed treated as was 83 67 wt in addition the wc of zvi ps conditioned as after drainage under gravity as was 92 30 the individual hed treatment led to 90 90 of wc for dewatered as at 40 v for 120 min thus the combined zvi ps hed performed better than individual zvi ps or hed as indicated in table 3 the energy consumption was 0 23 kw h kg of removed water at optimum conditions the economic feasibility of zvi ps hed classical fenton and fenton like processes is presented in table 8 the total cost of the zvi ps hed process was determined as 0 162 usd kg ds and the process was more low cost than classical fenton and fenton like processes 3 3 as morphology the variations in particle size and d f are shown in fig 2 in the zvi ps hed process no obvious changes in d 10 d 50 and d f of as occurred whereas d 90 slightly decreased at the zvi ps stage and then increased at the hed stage fig 3 shows the corresponding sem images of the as flocs at each stage of the zvi ps hed process as indicated in fig 3a and b some coccoid microorganisms and intact cell structure could be observed in the raw as after zvi ps conditioning floc breakage and cell debris were observed fig 3c and d and such effects indicated that the zvi ps oxidation could disintegrate the eps and flocs and then disrupt microbial cells in as he et al 2016 however slight changes in particle size and compactness of as implied that the fe iii produced through eq 3 resulted in coagulation among the broken as flocs and partially counteracted the as disruption by zvi ps oxidation this result could be supported by the increase in the zeta potential of as from 8 52 mv to 4 60 mv after zvi ps conditioning and the decrease in the repulsive forces among the as flocs accordingly ibeid et al 2015 tuan and sillanpaa 2010 as shown in fig 2e and f the hed treatment resulted in porous and coarse surfaces for the dewatered as as well as some cell debris these phenomena were mainly attributed to the electro chemical reactions eqs 17 and 18 which led to the production and release of bubbles oxygen and hydrogen near the anode and cathode sides of the cell mahmoud et al 2010 and to the appearance of void pits in the as surface in addition ohmic heating effects contributed to the breakage of as flocs and cell disruption mahmoud et al 2010 tuan et al 2008 yang et al 2011 zhen et al 2013 17 anode 6 h 2 o 4 h 3 o aq o 2 g 4 e 18 cathode 2 h 2 o 4 e 2 oh aq h 2 g compared with those of raw as the zeta potential of zvi ps conditioned as increased and its d 90 slightly decreased moreover the wc of individual hed treated as was higher than that of zvi ps hed treated as thus the increased zeta potential was beneficial for the hed treatment and better dewatering efficiency was accompanied by a slight decrease in d 90 of conditioned as 3 4 variations in water distribution in as in the zvi ps hed process the dsc thermograms for the as samples at three stages are presented in fig 4 the endothermic curve ranging from 0 c to 25 c was slightly larger than the exothermic curve ranging from 0 c to 20 c the crossed fraction in the curve of the exothermic peak might be ascribed to the aggressive rate of temperature decline 10 c min he et al 2016 the absorbed peak areas were 282 2 270 3 and 254 9 mj mg for as at the three stages of the zvi ps hed process the contents of water fractions in the as samples at the zvi ps hed stages are shown in table 9 after zvi ps conditioning the bwc of the as cake decreased by 0 45 g g ds whereas the fwc increased by 0 64 g g ds implying that the so 4 oxidation transformed some bound water into free water this result was attributed to the disintegration of eps flocs and the disruption of microbial cells in as he et al 2016 the above mentioned transformation phenomenon is consistent with the results of song et al 2016 and li et al 2016b the interstitial and capillary water in the eps of the zvi ps conditioned as were easily removed by the electric field force of the electroosmosis xu et al 2016 after the hed process the bwc and fwc decreased significantly with the corresponding rates approaching 73 2 and 96 4 respectively this result was attributed to the effects of electroosmosis electrophoresis and ohmic heating under a horizontal electric field at the hed stage mahmoud et al 2010 olivier et al 2014 tuan et al 2008 which induced the displacement of the bulk water molecules and the movement of solid particles as well as the reduction in viscosity in as matrix thereafter these functions facilitated the removal of some of the remaining water the conductivity of the supernatant filtrate increased from 1 05 ms cm 1 to 5 03 ms cm 1 after the zvi ps treatment this implied that the accumulation of so4 2 from ps decomposition would increase the conductivity of sludge bulk and thus enhance the performance of current and electro osmosis dewatering citeau et al 2015 xue et al 2015 the reduction rate of bound water in the zvi ps hed process was around 79 78 which was higher than that in the hed process with 22 22 qian et al 2016 this result indicated that so 4 oxidation conditioning performed better than the coupling magnetic conditioning in the latter process in addition the zeta potential 4 6 mv of the zvi ps conditioned as was higher than that of the coupling magnetic conditioned as 9 17 mv in the study of qian et al 2016 implying the high momentum of the electroosmotic flow and the good performance of the subsequent hed unit in the zvi ps hed process shaplro and probsteln 1993 vane and zang 1997 3 5 changes in organic matter distribution of as matrix 3 5 1 organic content of supernatant filtrate and eps the variations in scod and toc in the supernatant filtrate of the as matrix are shown in fig 5 scod and toc continued to increase as the zvi ps hed process proceeded zvi ps conditioning caused eps degradation and cell disruption zhao et al 2016 and then released some organics to the supernatant filtrate of the as consequently the scod and toc of the as were 2 18 and 6 16 times higher than those of the raw as in comparison with as zvi is a reductant while ps is an oxidant thus ps may destroy the as components but so 4 produced by zvi activated ps reaction will be a stronger oxidant than single ps this deduction could be proved by section s4 in si during the hed stage the contents of scod and toc increased to 14 04 and 13 93 g g ds respectively in the previous study of yuan et al 2010 and zhen et al 2013 the eps and inner cells are destroyed by electrolysis reactions eqs 17 and 18 and ohmic heating effect and organics and bound water are released into the filtrate this finding is consistent with the observation in the present study the variations in the pn ps and ha contents of the supernatant filtrate and the different eps layers slime lb eps tb eps of the as matrix during the zvi ps hed process are presented in fig 6 among the eps components pn was the predominant one as shown in fig 6a the pn contents were 11 83 6 96 and 8 49 mg g ds in slime lb eps and tb eps fractions for raw as respectively after zvi ps oxidation treatment the pn content of slime decreased to approximately 57 22 and remained stable in lb and tb eps however the total pn content of eps still decreased in the supernatant of the conditioned as matrix the pn exhibited a decreasing trend for pss zvi ps conditioning led to their reduction in the three eps layers and supernatant whereas hed treatment resulted in their increase in lb eps and decrease in slime and filtrate the different variations in pn and ps indicated that the latter was easily degraded by zvi ps conditioning liang et al 2015 in fig 6c at the zvi ps stage ha decreased in the slime and supernatant and increased in lb and tb eps at the hed stage an opposite trend was observed for the ha content 3 5 2 eem fluorescence spectra of eps and supernatant filtrate the eem fluorescence spectra of the supernatant filtrate and eps layers in the as matrix during the zvi ps process are presented in si and the corresponding fri results are illustrated in figs 7 and 8 as indicated in fig 7a the φ t n values of the five regions for the supernatant filtrate at the three stages were 38 40 27 10 and 71 00 107 au nm2 respectively this result was contrary to the scod and toc variations after the zvi ps stage during eem detection the identified five types of organics only contributed partially to the scod or toc value presented in fig 5 at the zvi ps stage the φ i n value of region i slightly increased whereas the φ i n values of the four other regions slightly declined moreover at the hed stage the φ i n value of region i decreased whereas the φ i n values of regions ii v increased significantly especially for region iv as shown in fig 7b the ρ i n value of region i showed a similar varying trend with the φ i n value during the zvi ps hed process the ρ i n values continued to decrease for region iii whereas continued to increase for region iv especially at the hed stage in addition the ρ i n for regions ii and v remained nearly stable according to the φ i n φ t n and ρ i n values of slime lb eps and tb eps during the zvi ps hed process fig 8 the typical organic matters assigned to the five regions showed the highest contents in tb eps as indicated in fig 8a after zvi ps conditioning the φ t n values decreased in slime and tb eps whereas increased in lb eps for each typical organic matter related to the five regions tyrosine in slime was approximately stable fulvic acid like materials and has in lb eps changed slightly and soluble microbial byproduct like materials in tb eps presented a significant increase except for these substances other typical organic matters showed similarly varying trends with the corresponding φ t n values this phenomenon showed differences from the variation in the total eps shown in fig 6 which contains other organic matter species that were excluded by the eem measurement moreover figs 6 and 7 show that the increase in the typical organics in lb eps after the zvi ps stage could be attributed to the transportation and transformation from tb eps fractions the decrease in the φ t n values of the eps and supernatant indicated that degradation occurred for the five types of organic matter in previous studies the increase in sludge dewaterability depended on the decrease in aromatic and tryptophan pn like substances in soluble eps cao et al 2016a b zhang et al 2014 s eps dai et al 2017 tb eps li et al 2016b or total eps liu et al 2016 qian et al 2016 these results are nearly consistent with those of our study furthermore the hed treatment decreased the said organics in the three eps layers whereas slightly decreased the aromatic and tryptophan in tb eps as shown in fig 8b after the zvi ps stage the p i n values of aromatic and tryptophan in slime and lb eps and that of the soluble microbial byproduct like materials in lb eps increased however the p i n values of the soluble microbial byproduct like materials and has in tb eps increased during the hed stage the increase in p i n values mainly occurred for the aromatic or soluble microbial byproduct like materials 3 5 3 influence of eps composition on as dewaterability table 10 shows the correlations between wc and composition of eps fraction of as during the zvi ps hed process strong positive correlations were found between wc and the concentrations of pn in slime r 1 00 р 0 01 and microbial by product like material in slime r 0 997 р 0 48 in addition positive correlations existed between wc and the concentrations of tryptophan in tb eps r 0 997 р 0 051 in previous studies the correlations between sludge dewaterability improvement and eps fraction variations were determined as follows the decrease in pn and pss in slime xu et al 2011 yuan et al 2011 pn in slime pn and pss in total eps zhou et al 2014 and pn in slime and lb eps yu et al 2008 these results are nearly consistent with those of our study the zvi ps conditioning led to similar variations in eps fractions and a decrease in the cst of as 3 5 4 high performance size exclusion chromatography of supernatant filtrate total eps and eps layers fig 9 shows the variations in the organics with typical mws in the supernatant filtrate and eps of the as matrix during the zvi ps hed process the organic compounds of high mw 5000 da may comprise pns and pss the organic compounds of moderate mw 1000 5000 da may comprise humic substances and the organic matter of low mw 1000 da may comprise organic building blocks lyko et al 2008 as indicated in fig 9a the contents of the organic building blocks pns and pss increased during the conditioning and dewatering treatments whereas the humic substances showed a slight decrease for the eps layers fig 9b indicates that pns and pss in tb eps decreased at the zvi ps stage as well as the compounds of moderate and low mws these specific organic compounds remained stable for the slime and lb eps layers after the hed treatment the aforementioned organic compounds in tb eps continued to decrease whereas the organic building blocks with an mw of 320 da appeared in the slime and lb eps layers possibly due to the broken down products of humics huber et al 2011 in addition the organic compounds with a mw of 43000 da appeared in the slime eps 4 conclusion in this study zvi ps integrated with hed was used to treat as the zvi ps hed process decreased the wc of as from 98 62 to 83 67 under optimal operation conditions the zvi ps conditioning was proved to be an effective pretreatment for as hed during the zvi ps process some bound water transformed into free water bwc and fwc decreased significantly after the hed stage the increases in zeta potential and coagulation phenomenon after the zvi ps treatment enhanced the subsequent momentum of the electroosmotic flow the zvi ps conditioning contributed to the significant degradation in the pns of slime pss of eps and the pn like substances of slime and tb eps this result improved dewaterability concurrently the hed treatment decreased the contents of the pns and protein like substances in eps acknowledgments this work was supported by the

19831,the feasibility of using fe0 s2o8 2 conditioning zero valence iron zvi persulfate ps integrated with horizontal electro dewatering hed to improve the dewaterability of activated sludge as was evaluated the removal and migration of free and bound water in the zvi ps hed process were determined along with the organic matter migration between the solid and liquid phases of as biosolids results showed that the optimum conditioning dosages were determined as 0 35 g zvi g dry solids ds and 0 15 g ps g ds on the basis of capillary suction time variation the lowest final water content wc of 83 67 in as occurred after the hed treatment at 40 v and 120 min as determined using the response surface methodology despite the disruption of as flocs and microbial cells through so 4 oxidation during the zvi ps conditioning the particle size and mass fractal dimension of the as flocs remained relatively stable as the zeta potential increased from 8 5 mv to 4 6 mv the coagulation of fe3 from the oxidation of fe2 by ps contributed to the relatively stable condition which favored the subsequent momentum of the electroosmotic flow moreover the zvi ps conditioning decreased the bound water content bwc from 1 83 g g ds to 1 38 g g ds and increased the free water content fwc from 60 27 g g ds to 60 91 g g ds indicating a transformation from free water to bound water after the zvi ps hed process the fwc and bwc were removed significantly with ratios of 96 32 and 79 78 respectively along with water removal through the zvi ps hed process the organic matter in the supernatant filtrate initially increased and further rose at the hed stage the analysis of the extracellular polymeric substance eps content showed that the proteins pns and polysaccharides pss at the liquid and solid phases decreased due to oxidative degradation furthermore the zvi ps stage significantly reduced the pns content of slime to 57 22 the pss content of eps to 68 50 and the pn like substances in the slime and tightly bound eps to 74 90 and 52 47 respectively in addition the wc of as correlated with the contents of pn and microbial by product like material in slime as well as tryptophan in tb eps and the low eps content in as indicated good dewaterability thus zvi ps should be selected as a pretreatment prior to hed graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge fe0 s2o8 2 conditioning

sludge wwtps wastewater treatment plants zvi zero valence iron 1 introduction the activated sludge as process is the most widely used wastewater treatment technology peng et al 2015 and produces substantial amounts of waste as in china the dry sludge 80 water content wc production reached 35 million tons at the end of 2015 xu et al 2017 sludge treatment and disposal are costly and account for up to 60 of the total operating costs of wastewater treatment plants wwtps gao et al 2015 hao et al 2010 li et al 2016a zhao et al 2017 thus sludge reduction has become a serious problem dewatering is a key operation for the cost effective reduction in sludge volume this operation involves several technologies such as mechanical filter electroosmosis thermal drying and constructed wetlands centrifugation filter pressing and other mechanical dewatering technologies have been widely used in wwtps however they can only remove free water and an insignificant amount of interstitial water thereby resulting in the high wc 65 80 of the sludge cake mahmoud et al 2016 tuan et al 2008 in recent years electro dewatering has been considered an efficient method for dewatering as electroosmosis is associated with the popular electrokinetic function which can drive water movement from anode to cathode and induce the migration of ions reduce the interstitial and capillary water and ultimately increase the amount of dry solids mahmoud et al 2016 tuan et al 2008 vesilind 1994 zhou et al 2007 reported that a horizontal electric field application for as leads to the wc values of 97 92 chu et al 2005 pointed out that a 50 v horizontal electric field decreases the wc of dewatered digested sludge in the range of 95 8 92 3 qian et al 2016 found that magnetic field conditioning combined with horizontal electro dewatering hed can improve as dewaterability and decrease the wc of as from 99 33 to 89 98 electric field and mechanical compressions are complementary and their combination improves dewatering gazbar et al 1994 yoshida 1993 citeau et al 2012 showed that hed combined with mechanical pressure the dry matter of agro industrial sludge to reach 40 w w after 3 h of hed with a current density of 80 a m2 moreover they indicated that mechanical pressure does not contribute to the increased hed flowrate since 2012 so 4 which presents a high redox potential of 2 60 v has been used in sludge conditioning and has performed satisfactorily in sludge dewatering because of its high degradability for extracellular polymeric substance eps and disruption of inner cells during oxidation shi et al 2016 in general so 4 can be activated by heat uv or a transition metal mn eqs 1 2 and 3 and the capillary suction time cst value of as can be reduced by approximately 88 when so 4 is obtained through fe ii activated persulfate ps zhen et al 2012 zhou et al 2015 observed that the cst of as decreases by over 50 when it is conditioned with 4 g l ps and 15 g l zero valence iron zvi during this process the reactions occur for so 4 production in accordance with eqs 4 and 5 in the study of li et al 2016b the hybrid process of electrolysis electrocoagulation zvi activated ps reduces the srf and cst of municipal sludge by 87 4 and 49 1 respectively in the advanced oxidization processes of fe ii ps and zvi ps zvi is more stable and more low cost than fe2 salt song et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 and can be recycled by electromagnets zanetti and godio 2006 1 2 3 4 fe s 2 o 8 2 fe ii 2 so 4 2 5 thus zvi ps can be regarded as an effective conditioning unit for improving the subsequent dewatering processes such as hed eps degradation and cell disruption during so 4 oxidation strengthen the reduction in interstitial and capillary water by using hed however to the best of our knowledge research on the combination of zvi ps and hed is limited in the present study the zvi ps hed process was used to treat as through batch experiments and its effects on the moisture and organics of as during this process were investigated accordingly the structure of as samples after each zvi ps hed stage was analyzed through sem and fractal methods differential scanning calorimetry dsc was performed to determine the variations in free water and distributions of water in as moreover the organics in the supernatant filtrate and eps layers of the as matrix were determined excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy and high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec were employed to identify the typical organic components in the as matrix and ultimately provide clues related to the zvi ps hed process 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge sample and analysis methods as samples were collected from an urban wwtp in beijing china and then immediately transferred to the laboratory within 2 h after 2 h of gravity sedimentation the concentrated as was taken as raw as and stored at 4 c in a refrigerator table 1 shows the main characteristics of raw as wc total suspended solids g l and volatile suspended solids g l were determined following standard methods apha 2005 the ph was measured using a ph meter pb 10 sartorius stedim biotech co ltd beijing china cst was tested using a cst meter 304b triton electronic co ltd uk with chromatography paper 17 chr whatman international ltd england the zeta potential was recorded using a zetasizer nano z system malvern co uk following electrophoresis theory conductivity was measured using a conductivity meter ec215 beijing kanggaote science and technology co ltd china the aforementioned and subsequent experiments were completed within 5 days and in triplicate to ensure reproducibility 2 2 experimental procedure the main experimental procedure is shown in fig 1 for the zvi ps conditioning a traditional jar test was performed using a six paddle stirring apparatus jty 6 tangshan dachang chemicals ltd china for each test 300 ml of as was transferred into a 500 ml beaker firstly both zvi 98 purity aladdin chemistry co ltd beijing china and ps ar sinopharm chemical reagents co beijing china were added into the beaker the beakers were then stirred at 100 rpm for 30 min after the treatment the cst was measured secondly the conditioned as was transferred to the hed apparatus fig 1c for gravity drainage without pressure and voltages the hed apparatus was made of plexiglass 85 mm 42 mm 65 mm a pair of iro2 ta2o5 meshes were taken as the anode and cathode to prevent corrosion and prolong the service life of the electrodes citeau et al 2015 mahmoud et al 2010 zhang et al 2017a the distance between the two electrodes was 65 mm the bottom of the filter chamber and electrodes were covered with a polypropylene filter cloth with a 5 μm aperture the valve of the filtrate pipe was opened to start draining and the filtrate was collected using a beaker on a balance draining continued until no more than two drops of filtrate were collected within 10 min 4 h were necessary and the wc of drained as by gravity was tested accordingly finally different voltages were provided using a variable dc power supply dh1719a 4 dahua electronic co ltd china during hed to drive the electric osmosis of water from the anode to the cathode and the water flowed across the polypropylene filter cloth the filtered water was regularly collected in a conical flask for weight measurement 2 3 response surface methodology rsm for activated sludge hed response surface methodology rsm an experimental technique was designed to determine the optimal response within specified ranges of factors yang et al 2009 in this study a central composite design ccd was used to optimize the operation parameters of hed khuri and cornell 1996 voltage and dewatering duration were regarded as independent variables and denoted as x 1 and x 2 the wc and energy consumption of dewatered sludge were selected as responses to y 1 and y 2 respectively the ccd consisted of 2k factorial points five replicates of central points and 2k 4 star points where k refers to the number of independent factors the two operation variables were considered at five levels namely two star points 1 41 and 1 41 low point 1 central point 0 and high point 1 tables 2 and 3 present the scope and level of the two factors and the complete experimental design respectively the experimental design combines linear and quadratic mathematical models that were selected or rejected on the basis of the p value probability with a 95 confidence level the corresponding equations are as follows 6 y 1 a 0 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 ε 7 y 2 b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b 11 x 1 2 b 22 x 2 2 b 12 x 1 x 2 ε where a 0 a 1 a 2 b 0 b 1 b 2 b 12 b 11 b 22 and ε represent the model regression coefficients the optimization goal was to minimize the wc and the energy consumption of the dewatered sludge using design expert 8 0 2 4 measurement of free and bound water contents bound water content bwc was measured via dsc lee and lee 1995 first the sample temperature of as decreased to 60 c at a rate of 10 c min under the assumption that the free water in the sample was frozen then temperature increased to 40 c at the same rate the absorbed or released heat in the as sample could be integrated using the peak area of the endothermic and exothermic curves free water content fwc could be obtained using the heat peak area under the endothermic curve bwc could be determined using the difference between fwc and total water content twc which was measured using standard methods apha 2005 8 w b w t δ h δ h 0 where w b and w t are the bwc and twc of the as samples respectively kg kg δ h is the amount of energy absorbed in the as samples and δ h 0 is the standard melting heat of ice 334 7 j g the tests were conducted in duplicate 2 5 extraction and analytical methods of eps fractions the eps layers namely slime loosely bound lb eps and tightly bound tb eps of as were extracted through centrifugation and ultrasonication methods yu et al 2008 the buffer solution ph 7 contained na3po4 nah2po4 nacl and kcl at a molar ratio of 2 4 9 1 the conductivity of the buffers was adjusted with deionized water to match those of the as samples after all the eps layers were extracted the particulates in each layer were filtered through polyether sulfone membranes with a pore size of 0 45 μm then the corresponding eps components such as polysaccharides pss proteins pns and humic acid like materials has were determined ps content was analyzed using the anthrone method with glucose as a standard pns and has contents were determined using the modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin bsa beijing aoboxing biotechnology co ltd china and has sigma usa as standards respectively qian et al 2015 in the modified lowry method color development was measured with and without the addition of cuso4 when cuso4 is omitted color development is due to humic compounds box 1983 and chromogenic amino acids peterson 1979 without cuso4 the color developed by bsa decreased to 20 but no decrease was observed for has the mutual interference of pns and humic compounds was addressed as shown in eqs 9 12 9 atotal aprotein ahumic 10 ablind 0 2 aprotein ahumie 11 aprotein 1 25 atotal ablind 12 ahumic ablind 0 2 aprotein where atotal is the total absorbance with cuso4 ablind is the total absorbance without cuso4 ahumic is the absorbance due to humic compounds and aprotein is the absorbance due to pns 2 6 supernatant filtrate and eps characterization the supernatant filtrate total eps and eps layered fractions of as were collected during the zvi ps hed process moreover the ph and conductivity were measured other sludge parameters including total organic carbon toc soluble cod scod and suspended solids were analyzed following standard methods apha 2005 the typical organics in the as matrix were identified using eem detection the eem fluorescence spectrum was obtained via fluorescence spectroscopy f 7000 hitachi japan with scanning emission spectra from 220 to 600 nm at 1 nm increments at varying excitation wavelengths from 200 nm to 400 nm at 5 nm increments to analyze the eem fluorescence spectrum quantitatively we performed fluorescence regional integration fri analysis and calculated the integration of the volume beneath each eem region chen et al 2003 the normalized excitation emission area volumes φ i n and φ t n with a unit of au nm2 referring to the values of regions i ii iii iv and v table 4 and the entire region and the percent fluorescence response ρ i n ϕ i n ϕ t n 100 were calculated following the method proposed by chen et al 2003 the eps mainly consisted of high molecular weight pss pns ha glycoproteins nucleic acids and phospholipids liu and pang 2003 to explore the change in eps compounds during the zvi ps hed process we analyzed the molecular weights mws of the organics in the supernatant filtrate total eps and eps layers hpsec was used to determine the mw of the organic compounds in as the hpsec device consisted of a waters 2487 dual λ absorbance detector and waters 1525 pump system a shodex kw 802 5 gel chromatography column shoko japan was used for organic material separation the mobile phase namely milli q water buffered with 5 mm phosphate to ph 6 8 and 0 01 m nacl was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane and then degassed for 30 min by ultrasonication before use a 200 μl sample was injected at a flow rate of 0 8 ml min 1 polystyrene sulfonate standards sigma aldrich usa of mws of 1 8 32 kda were used for apparent mw calibration wang et al 2010 2 7 activated sludge morphology before the observation of as morphology the as samples were freeze dried under vacuum at 60 c for 72 h and then sputter coated with gold for sem observation quanta 200 fei usa zhang et al 2017b the particle size distributions psds of as were determined through a small angle light scattering test with a laser scattering instrument malvern mastersizer 2000 malvern uk mean particle size and median particle size d 50 could be derived from the psd curves wu et al 2002 and mass fractal dimension d f was determined using the following equation tuan et al 2002 wu et al 2002 13 q 4 π n sin δ 2 λ where q is the difference between the incident and scattered wave vectors of the radiation beam in the medium n is the refractive index of the suspending medium δ is the scattering angle and λ is the wavelength of the radiation in a vacuum the total scattered light intensity i is a function of q they display a power law relationship that is expressed as follows 14 i q d f 2 8 statistical analysis correlation analysis on as filterability and the key factors were carried out using the ibm spss statistics 22 software the linear correlation between the key factors and wc was evaluated with pearson s correlation coefficient r the correlation r can range between 1 and 1 where 1 denotes a perfect negative correlation 1 means a perfect positive correlation and 0 indicates the absence of a relationship the correlations were considered statistically significant at a 95 confidence interval probability p 0 05 zhang et al 2015 zhen et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of the zvi ps process batch experiments were conducted to determine the optimum dosages of zvi and ps for as conditioning namely 0 35 g g ds zvi and 0 15 g g ds ps as shown in the supplementary materials si before the following hed unit the as samples were pre conditioned with these optimum dosages the main characteristics of the conditioned as are shown in table 5 3 2 rsm optimization of the hed process in accordance with the ccd in table 3 the linear and second order polynomial equations 15 and 16 were obtained after the data fitting respectively 15 y 1 92 26764 0 10652 x 1 0 027006 x 2 16 y 2 0 37733 0 013773 x 1 6 03211 e 003 x 2 1 666667 e 005 x 1 x 2 1 41250 e 004 x 1 2 2 40278 e 005 x 2 2 the corresponding results of the analysis of variance anova are presented in tables 6 and 7 the p values less than 0 05 indicated that the model terms were significant reliable models could then be used to predict the optimum dewatering conditions for as the optimum dewatering conditions 40 v and 120 min were determined for the experimental set through design expert 8 0 the corresponding wc of zvi ps hed treated as was 83 67 wt in addition the wc of zvi ps conditioned as after drainage under gravity as was 92 30 the individual hed treatment led to 90 90 of wc for dewatered as at 40 v for 120 min thus the combined zvi ps hed performed better than individual zvi ps or hed as indicated in table 3 the energy consumption was 0 23 kw h kg of removed water at optimum conditions the economic feasibility of zvi ps hed classical fenton and fenton like processes is presented in table 8 the total cost of the zvi ps hed process was determined as 0 162 usd kg ds and the process was more low cost than classical fenton and fenton like processes 3 3 as morphology the variations in particle size and d f are shown in fig 2 in the zvi ps hed process no obvious changes in d 10 d 50 and d f of as occurred whereas d 90 slightly decreased at the zvi ps stage and then increased at the hed stage fig 3 shows the corresponding sem images of the as flocs at each stage of the zvi ps hed process as indicated in fig 3a and b some coccoid microorganisms and intact cell structure could be observed in the raw as after zvi ps conditioning floc breakage and cell debris were observed fig 3c and d and such effects indicated that the zvi ps oxidation could disintegrate the eps and flocs and then disrupt microbial cells in as he et al 2016 however slight changes in particle size and compactness of as implied that the fe iii produced through eq 3 resulted in coagulation among the broken as flocs and partially counteracted the as disruption by zvi ps oxidation this result could be supported by the increase in the zeta potential of as from 8 52 mv to 4 60 mv after zvi ps conditioning and the decrease in the repulsive forces among the as flocs accordingly ibeid et al 2015 tuan and sillanpaa 2010 as shown in fig 2e and f the hed treatment resulted in porous and coarse surfaces for the dewatered as as well as some cell debris these phenomena were mainly attributed to the electro chemical reactions eqs 17 and 18 which led to the production and release of bubbles oxygen and hydrogen near the anode and cathode sides of the cell mahmoud et al 2010 and to the appearance of void pits in the as surface in addition ohmic heating effects contributed to the breakage of as flocs and cell disruption mahmoud et al 2010 tuan et al 2008 yang et al 2011 zhen et al 2013 17 anode 6 h 2 o 4 h 3 o aq o 2 g 4 e 18 cathode 2 h 2 o 4 e 2 oh aq h 2 g compared with those of raw as the zeta potential of zvi ps conditioned as increased and its d 90 slightly decreased moreover the wc of individual hed treated as was higher than that of zvi ps hed treated as thus the increased zeta potential was beneficial for the hed treatment and better dewatering efficiency was accompanied by a slight decrease in d 90 of conditioned as 3 4 variations in water distribution in as in the zvi ps hed process the dsc thermograms for the as samples at three stages are presented in fig 4 the endothermic curve ranging from 0 c to 25 c was slightly larger than the exothermic curve ranging from 0 c to 20 c the crossed fraction in the curve of the exothermic peak might be ascribed to the aggressive rate of temperature decline 10 c min he et al 2016 the absorbed peak areas were 282 2 270 3 and 254 9 mj mg for as at the three stages of the zvi ps hed process the contents of water fractions in the as samples at the zvi ps hed stages are shown in table 9 after zvi ps conditioning the bwc of the as cake decreased by 0 45 g g ds whereas the fwc increased by 0 64 g g ds implying that the so 4 oxidation transformed some bound water into free water this result was attributed to the disintegration of eps flocs and the disruption of microbial cells in as he et al 2016 the above mentioned transformation phenomenon is consistent with the results of song et al 2016 and li et al 2016b the interstitial and capillary water in the eps of the zvi ps conditioned as were easily removed by the electric field force of the electroosmosis xu et al 2016 after the hed process the bwc and fwc decreased significantly with the corresponding rates approaching 73 2 and 96 4 respectively this result was attributed to the effects of electroosmosis electrophoresis and ohmic heating under a horizontal electric field at the hed stage mahmoud et al 2010 olivier et al 2014 tuan et al 2008 which induced the displacement of the bulk water molecules and the movement of solid particles as well as the reduction in viscosity in as matrix thereafter these functions facilitated the removal of some of the remaining water the conductivity of the supernatant filtrate increased from 1 05 ms cm 1 to 5 03 ms cm 1 after the zvi ps treatment this implied that the accumulation of so4 2 from ps decomposition would increase the conductivity of sludge bulk and thus enhance the performance of current and electro osmosis dewatering citeau et al 2015 xue et al 2015 the reduction rate of bound water in the zvi ps hed process was around 79 78 which was higher than that in the hed process with 22 22 qian et al 2016 this result indicated that so 4 oxidation conditioning performed better than the coupling magnetic conditioning in the latter process in addition the zeta potential 4 6 mv of the zvi ps conditioned as was higher than that of the coupling magnetic conditioned as 9 17 mv in the study of qian et al 2016 implying the high momentum of the electroosmotic flow and the good performance of the subsequent hed unit in the zvi ps hed process shaplro and probsteln 1993 vane and zang 1997 3 5 changes in organic matter distribution of as matrix 3 5 1 organic content of supernatant filtrate and eps the variations in scod and toc in the supernatant filtrate of the as matrix are shown in fig 5 scod and toc continued to increase as the zvi ps hed process proceeded zvi ps conditioning caused eps degradation and cell disruption zhao et al 2016 and then released some organics to the supernatant filtrate of the as consequently the scod and toc of the as were 2 18 and 6 16 times higher than those of the raw as in comparison with as zvi is a reductant while ps is an oxidant thus ps may destroy the as components but so 4 produced by zvi activated ps reaction will be a stronger oxidant than single ps this deduction could be proved by section s4 in si during the hed stage the contents of scod and toc increased to 14 04 and 13 93 g g ds respectively in the previous study of yuan et al 2010 and zhen et al 2013 the eps and inner cells are destroyed by electrolysis reactions eqs 17 and 18 and ohmic heating effect and organics and bound water are released into the filtrate this finding is consistent with the observation in the present study the variations in the pn ps and ha contents of the supernatant filtrate and the different eps layers slime lb eps tb eps of the as matrix during the zvi ps hed process are presented in fig 6 among the eps components pn was the predominant one as shown in fig 6a the pn contents were 11 83 6 96 and 8 49 mg g ds in slime lb eps and tb eps fractions for raw as respectively after zvi ps oxidation treatment the pn content of slime decreased to approximately 57 22 and remained stable in lb and tb eps however the total pn content of eps still decreased in the supernatant of the conditioned as matrix the pn exhibited a decreasing trend for pss zvi ps conditioning led to their reduction in the three eps layers and supernatant whereas hed treatment resulted in their increase in lb eps and decrease in slime and filtrate the different variations in pn and ps indicated that the latter was easily degraded by zvi ps conditioning liang et al 2015 in fig 6c at the zvi ps stage ha decreased in the slime and supernatant and increased in lb and tb eps at the hed stage an opposite trend was observed for the ha content 3 5 2 eem fluorescence spectra of eps and supernatant filtrate the eem fluorescence spectra of the supernatant filtrate and eps layers in the as matrix during the zvi ps process are presented in si and the corresponding fri results are illustrated in figs 7 and 8 as indicated in fig 7a the φ t n values of the five regions for the supernatant filtrate at the three stages were 38 40 27 10 and 71 00 107 au nm2 respectively this result was contrary to the scod and toc variations after the zvi ps stage during eem detection the identified five types of organics only contributed partially to the scod or toc value presented in fig 5 at the zvi ps stage the φ i n value of region i slightly increased whereas the φ i n values of the four other regions slightly declined moreover at the hed stage the φ i n value of region i decreased whereas the φ i n values of regions ii v increased significantly especially for region iv as shown in fig 7b the ρ i n value of region i showed a similar varying trend with the φ i n value during the zvi ps hed process the ρ i n values continued to decrease for region iii whereas continued to increase for region iv especially at the hed stage in addition the ρ i n for regions ii and v remained nearly stable according to the φ i n φ t n and ρ i n values of slime lb eps and tb eps during the zvi ps hed process fig 8 the typical organic matters assigned to the five regions showed the highest contents in tb eps as indicated in fig 8a after zvi ps conditioning the φ t n values decreased in slime and tb eps whereas increased in lb eps for each typical organic matter related to the five regions tyrosine in slime was approximately stable fulvic acid like materials and has in lb eps changed slightly and soluble microbial byproduct like materials in tb eps presented a significant increase except for these substances other typical organic matters showed similarly varying trends with the corresponding φ t n values this phenomenon showed differences from the variation in the total eps shown in fig 6 which contains other organic matter species that were excluded by the eem measurement moreover figs 6 and 7 show that the increase in the typical organics in lb eps after the zvi ps stage could be attributed to the transportation and transformation from tb eps fractions the decrease in the φ t n values of the eps and supernatant indicated that degradation occurred for the five types of organic matter in previous studies the increase in sludge dewaterability depended on the decrease in aromatic and tryptophan pn like substances in soluble eps cao et al 2016a b zhang et al 2014 s eps dai et al 2017 tb eps li et al 2016b or total eps liu et al 2016 qian et al 2016 these results are nearly consistent with those of our study furthermore the hed treatment decreased the said organics in the three eps layers whereas slightly decreased the aromatic and tryptophan in tb eps as shown in fig 8b after the zvi ps stage the p i n values of aromatic and tryptophan in slime and lb eps and that of the soluble microbial byproduct like materials in lb eps increased however the p i n values of the soluble microbial byproduct like materials and has in tb eps increased during the hed stage the increase in p i n values mainly occurred for the aromatic or soluble microbial byproduct like materials 3 5 3 influence of eps composition on as dewaterability table 10 shows the correlations between wc and composition of eps fraction of as during the zvi ps hed process strong positive correlations were found between wc and the concentrations of pn in slime r 1 00 р 0 01 and microbial by product like material in slime r 0 997 р 0 48 in addition positive correlations existed between wc and the concentrations of tryptophan in tb eps r 0 997 р 0 051 in previous studies the correlations between sludge dewaterability improvement and eps fraction variations were determined as follows the decrease in pn and pss in slime xu et al 2011 yuan et al 2011 pn in slime pn and pss in total eps zhou et al 2014 and pn in slime and lb eps yu et al 2008 these results are nearly consistent with those of our study the zvi ps conditioning led to similar variations in eps fractions and a decrease in the cst of as 3 5 4 high performance size exclusion chromatography of supernatant filtrate total eps and eps layers fig 9 shows the variations in the organics with typical mws in the supernatant filtrate and eps of the as matrix during the zvi ps hed process the organic compounds of high mw 5000 da may comprise pns and pss the organic compounds of moderate mw 1000 5000 da may comprise humic substances and the organic matter of low mw 1000 da may comprise organic building blocks lyko et al 2008 as indicated in fig 9a the contents of the organic building blocks pns and pss increased during the conditioning and dewatering treatments whereas the humic substances showed a slight decrease for the eps layers fig 9b indicates that pns and pss in tb eps decreased at the zvi ps stage as well as the compounds of moderate and low mws these specific organic compounds remained stable for the slime and lb eps layers after the hed treatment the aforementioned organic compounds in tb eps continued to decrease whereas the organic building blocks with an mw of 320 da appeared in the slime and lb eps layers possibly due to the broken down products of humics huber et al 2011 in addition the organic compounds with a mw of 43000 da appeared in the slime eps 4 conclusion in this study zvi ps integrated with hed was used to treat as the zvi ps hed process decreased the wc of as from 98 62 to 83 67 under optimal operation conditions the zvi ps conditioning was proved to be an effective pretreatment for as hed during the zvi ps process some bound water transformed into free water bwc and fwc decreased significantly after the hed stage the increases in zeta potential and coagulation phenomenon after the zvi ps treatment enhanced the subsequent momentum of the electroosmotic flow the zvi ps conditioning contributed to the significant degradation in the pns of slime pss of eps and the pn like substances of slime and tb eps this result improved dewaterability concurrently the hed treatment decreased the contents of the pns and protein like substances in eps acknowledgments this work was supported by the

19832,lake water constituents such as chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom and nitrate absorb sunlight which induces an array of photochemical reactions although these reactions are a substantial driver of pollutant degradation in lakes they are insufficiently understood in particular on large scales here we provide for the first time comprehensive photochemical maps covering a large geographic region using photochemical kinetics modeling for 1048 lakes across sweden we simulated the steady state concentrations of four photoreactive transient species which are continuously produced and consumed in sunlit lake waters we then simulated the transient induced photochemical transformation of organic pollutants to gain insight into the relevance of the different photoreaction pathways we found that boreal lakes were often unfavorable environments for photoreactions mediated by hydroxyl radicals oh and carbonate radical anions co3 while photoreactions mediated by cdom triplet states 3cdom and to a lesser extent singlet oxygen 1o2 were the most prevalent these conditions promote the photodegradation of phenols which are used as plastic medical drug and herbicide precursors when cdom concentrations increase as is currently commonly the case in boreal areas such as sweden 3cdom will also increase promoting its importance in photochemical pathways even more graphical abstract image 1 keywords boreal lakes browning modeling photochemistry photochemical transients pollutants 1 introduction photochemically induced processes are important for the attenuation of xenobiotics such as residues of medical drugs and pesticides in sunlit waters fenner et al 2013 environmental persistence defined as the transformation half life of a chemical regulates the exposure of organisms to the substance the extent of its transport and diffuse pollution and the resilience towards environmental contamination boethling et al 2009 zou et al 2015a to protect resources such as plants aquatic biota and drinking water it is therefore crucial to understand the environmental fate and degradation pathways of pollutants fenner et al 2013 parker and mitch 2016 however little to nothing is known about the role of different photoreactions for pollutant degradation on large geographic scales especially in boreal regions where the largest lake area on earth is located verpoorter et al 2014 to gain first insight into the relevance of the different photoreaction pathways in boreal lakes we conducted a modeling study which allowed a large scale simulation of the likely photochemical behavior for a range of different compounds while subject to a number of necessary assumptions and uncertainties our model simulations contribute along with laboratory and field measurements which provide more detailed direct observations for specific compounds but are more time and cost intensive a key component towards an integrated approach in assessing chemical persistence in aquatic biomes for different climate zones zou et al 2015a 2015b the photodegradation pathways of pollutants can be divided in direct photolysis and indirect photochemistry in direct photolysis degradation is triggered by photon absorption by the pollutant itself in indirect photochemistry transformation is caused by reaction with photogenerated transient species boreen et al 2003 these transient species such as triplet states 3cdom singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh are mostly produced in reactions with photochemical sensitizers such as chromophoric dom cdom and nitrate canonica et al 2005 cawley et al 2015 in the presence of bicarbonate and carbonate the carbonate radical co3 is also produced canonica et al 2005 upon photon absorption cdom yields 3cdom 1o2 and oh while dom is a sink of oh and co3 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 nitrate acts as photochemical oh source and indirectly as co3 source in the presence of inorganic carbon via photogenerated oh wallace et al 2010 here we used a unique large scale dataset of concentration data on total organic carbon toc a measure of dom and nitrate as well as inorganic carbon levels ph values and lake water cdom absorption spectra which are available across 14 degrees of latitude for 1048 boreal lakes in sweden koehler et al 2014 with their comparatively high toc concentrations these water environments are representative of boreal lakes in general sobek et al 2007 we combined the observations with atmospheric radiative transfer and aquatic photochemical kinetics modeling to resolve which photoreaction pathways are generally the most important in boreal lakes how these reflect in the environmental persistence of chemical compound classes and how the relevance of photoreaction pathways may change when browning larsen et al 2011 and eutrophication occur 2 methods 2 1 radiation absorption calculations water chemical and cdom absorbance data from 1048 lakes distributed across sweden between latitudes from 55 n to 69 n were obtained from the 2009 swedish national lake inventory which was conducted by the swedish university of agricultural sciences lake water had been sampled between 6 september and 24 november 2009 in most cases in the middle of the lake at 0 5 m depth more details and lake properties have been published earlier erlandsson et al 2012 koehler et al 2014 cdom absorbed photons p a c d o m d a y mol photons m 3 day 1 were calculated for sep 22 2009 autumnal equinox and 280 600 nm 1 nm resolution from the surface of each lake in 0 005 m increments down to the target lake depths as 1 p a c d o m d a y z λ min λ max e o d d a y λ 0 a g λ e k d λ z d λ where z is depth m λ min and λ max is the minimal and maximal wavelength nm e o d d a y λ 0 is daily integrated downwelling scalar irradiation just below the water surface mol photons m 2 day 1 nm 1 a g is the cdom napierian absorption coefficient m 1 and k d is the vertical attenuation coefficient for downward irradiance m 1 the parameter a g was calculated from measured cdom absorbance koehler et al 2014 k d was estimated using regression relationships with a g derived from literature data n 565 for nine wavelengths between 300 and 400 nm subsequent fitting of an exponential function was carried out to obtain continuous spectra koehler et al 2014 for each lake daily integrated downwelling irradiation just below the water surface e o d d a y λ 0 mol photons m 2 day 1 nm 1 was simulated for the autumnal equinox 2009 sep 22 as described in detail earlier koehler et al 2014 briefly clear sky downwelling spectra of global and diffuse irradiance reaching the water air interface were derived for 280 600 nm with an hourly time step using the atmospheric radiative transfer model libradtran 1 6 mayer et al 2011 the clear sky irradiance spectra were corrected for attenuation by clouds using a cloud effect function kasten and czeplak 1980 which was parameterized using uv irradiance measurements from norrköping sweden during 2008 n 2400 total cloud cover data was retrieved from the archive of the operational mesoscale analysis system mesan at the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute hāggmark et al 2000 transmittance of the above water surface irradiance across the air water interface was calculated separately for the diffuse and direct fraction the just below water surface hourly diffuse and direct irradiance spectra were converted to downwelling irradiance spectra and integrated to obtain daily irradiation spectra nitrate absorbed photons p a c d o m d a y mol photons m 3 day 1 were calculated as 2 p a n o 3 d a y z λ min λ max ε n o 3 λ c n o 3 a g λ e o d d a y λ 0 a g λ e k d λ z d λ where ε n o 3 is the molar absorption coefficient of nitrate l μg n 1 m 1 and c n o 3 is nitrate concentration μg n l 1 the depth specific cdom and nitrate absorbed photons were integrated down to z 0 05 m and down to the average depth z avg of each lake using the trapezoid rule photon absorption by nitrite was not considered because its concentration was usually below the detection limit of the analytical method and more importantly because cdom usually strongly prevailed over nitrate as oh source therefore it is expected that cdom out competes also nitrite for oh generation 2 2 photochemical modeling to calculate the steady state concentration of the photoreactive transient species the photon fluxes absorbed by cdom and nitrate were expressed as p a i z where i cdom or no3 units are mol photons l 1 s 1 the formation rates of hydroxyl radicals oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 mol l 1 s 1 were calculated as 3 4 r 1 o 2 t o t z φ 1 o 2 c d o m p a c d o m z as the formation quantum yield of oh by cdom image 3 takes into account all known and poorly known processes of oh photoproduction by cdom including the photo fenton reactions triggered by irradiation of fe species vione et al 2014 the formation quantum yields of photoreactive transients by irradiated cdom may vary among different aquatic environments but such variations are more limited than the environmental variability might suggest values from available literature sources were used for the relevant quantum yields vione et al 2014 the steady state oh z mol l 1 day averaged value referred to a water column of depth z takes into account the scavenging of oh by organic matter and inorganic carbon expressed as 5 where toc is total organic carbon mgc l 1 the reaction rate constants of oh with bicarbonate carbonate and organic matter were derived from the literature buxton et al 1988 brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 for 1o2 one should consider its formation by irradiated cdom r o 2 1 t o t eq 4 and its deactivation upon collision with the water solvent which has a first order rate constant of k d 2 5 105 s 1 therefore the steady state 1o2 concentration is o 2 1 z r t o t z k d 1 latch and mcneill 2006 the carbonate radical co3 is produced by oh oxidation of inorganic carbon hco3 and co3 2 and by 3cdom oxidation of co3 2 canonica et al 2005 the two pathways give the following formation rates for co3 mol l 1 s 1 bodrato and vione 2014 6 7 it is image 7 and usually image 8 co3 is mostly scavenged by dom and its steady state concentration mol l 1 was expressed as 8 where image 10 was taken as the average of available literature values canonica et al 2005 finally the cdom triplet states 3cdom are produced by cdom irradiation and are deactivated by a number of processes including internal conversion and reaction with dissolved o2 these processes can be described by an overall first order rate constant k 5 105 s 1 canonica and freiburghaus 2001 the steady state 3cdom z mol l 1 was expressed as 9 c d o m 3 z φ c d o m 3 c d o m p a c d o m z k with φ c d o m 3 c d o m taken from the literature vione et al 2014 2 3 kinetics of direct and indirect pollutant photolysis a rather simple way to assess the environmental significance of the transient steady state concentrations calculated previously is to see how they may translate into the degradation kinetics of xenobiotics with known photoreactivity as first model substance we chose the pharmaceutical acetaminophen which is commonly found in swedish lakes zou et al 2015a and reacts with co3 de laurentiis et al 2014 apart from acetaminophen however the xenobiotics that are commonly found in swedish lakes such as diclofenac or ibuprofen zou et al 2015a 2015b do not cover a sufficiently wide range of photochemical reactivity to provide insight into the general photochemical behavior of swedish lakes for these reasons they are hardly suitable to assess the phototransformation pathways of boreal lakes therefore in addition to acetaminophen apap we chose four more model pollutants for which 1 all or at least the majority of the relevant photochemical reaction rate constants are known table 1 2 the reaction pathways differ strongly and 3 the photochemical behavior is already known for temperate lakes avetta et al 2014 de laurentiis et al 2014 passananti et al 2014 fabbri et al 2015 vione et al 2015 specifically we chose the fungicide dimethomorph dmm the solar filter ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate ehmc the herbicide fenuron fen and nicotine nic we included ehmc because it undergoes very efficient direct photolysis vione et al 2015 as well as dmm and fen because of the significant role played by 3cdom together with oh in their transformation avetta et al 2014 fabbri et al 2015 nic was chosen because it is almost exclusively photodegraded by reaction with oh passananti et al 2014 assume a pollutant substrate s at concentration s mol l 1 which can be degraded by direct photolysis and by reaction with oh co3 1o2 and 3cdom assume also the following key parameters for s photolysis quantum yield φ s absorbed photon flux p a s z mol photons l 1 s 1 and second order reaction rate constants k s j l mol 1 s 1 where j oh co3 1o2 or 3cdom the degradation rate of s due to photochemical reactions is the following mol l 1 s 1 10 r s z φ s p a s z s j k s j j z where j z mol l 1 is the daily and depth averaged steady state concentration of the transient species j calculated as described above referred to the depth z the values of φ s and k s j were parameterized according to table 1 p a s z mol photons l 1 s 1 was calculated as 11 p a s z s λ min λ max ε s λ a g λ e o d d a y λ 0 a g λ e k d λ z d λ where ε s λ is the molar absorption coefficient of s l mol 1 cm 1 the pseudo first order degradation rate constant is k s z r s z s 1 the value of k s z is independent of s provided that the latter is very low e g below 1 μmol l 1 and does not affect p a c d o m z note that the main light absorber in surface waters is cdom with usually negligible contributions from other solution constituents loiselle et al 2008 the rate r s z is expressed in mol l 1 s 1 units thus k s z has units of s 1 more intuitive data can be obtained with units of day 1 as k s d a y z 8 5 10 4 1 k s z the half life time of s in day units in a water column of depth z is given by t 1 2 d a y z ln 2 k s d a y z 1 2 4 model assumptions first of all phototransformation kinetics of the model compounds was determined under the assumption of thorough mixing of the lake water for model parameterization we assumed that certain photochemical parameters are universally valid because they are referred to substances that do not vary in nature among different environments and specifically the formation quantum yield of oh by nitrate the reaction rate constants of oh with bicarbonate and carbonate buxton et al 1988 vione et al 2009 the reaction rate constants of apap dmm ehmc fen and nic with oh co3 and 1o2 avetta et al 2014 de laurentiis et al 2014 passananti et al 2014 fabbri et al 2015 vione et al 2015 as well as the first order inactivation rate constant of 1o2 upon collision with the water solvent latch and mcneill 2006 however other photochemical parameters may depend on the environment such as the formation quantum yields of the transient species from irradiated cdom the reaction rate constants of oh and co3 with dom the first order inactivation rate constant of 3cdom and the second order reaction rate constants of 3cdom with apap dmm ehmc and fen these parameters were taken from the literature brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 canonica and freiburghaus 2001 canonica et al 2005 vione et al 2014 but all the cited studies were conducted in temperate water samples hence there is a degree of uncertainty of how appropriate it is to use these values for boreal lakes we justify this model assumption with the fact that dom was found to show only a limited molecular and photochemical variability across inland waters worldwide specifically ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry revealed a substantial overlap in molecular level patterns for dom in inland waters across biomes and continents kellerman et al 2014 the individual compounds were largely overlapping between fresh dom prior to substantial light exposure in boreal lakes and photolabile compounds from congo river water and vice versa i e dom with substantial light exposure and photoresistant dom stubbins et al 2010 kellerman et al 2014 also the wavelength integrated apparent quantum yield for photochemical dom mineralization varied by only a factor of 12 across a variety of boreal polar temperate and tropical lakes including saline lagoons which covered a very wide range in chemical and optical water properties koehler et al 2016 finally considering that boreal lakes appear to be favorable environments for reactions triggered by 3cdom and 1o2 vide infra the values we used here for φ 3 c d o m c d o m and φ o 2 1 c d o m are in the lower range of those reported for temperate water bodies vione et al 2014 therefore we likely underestimated the formation of 3cdom and 1o2 in boreal lake water i e we conducted a conservative calculation all lake photoactivity parameters used in the model are reported in table sm1 of the supplementary material hereafter sm 2 5 model validation to assess the performance of the atmospheric radiative transfer model under clear sky conditions uv irradiance observed during 2008 in norrköping in southern sweden with a total cloud cover of less than 10 was compared to clear sky irradiance simulated for the same place and time a linear regression between observed and simulated clear sky irradiance gave a r2 of 0 998 n 996 cloud corrected irradiance was validated using a 100 fold cross validation in which for each sub validation 2375 observations were used for regression and 25 observations were used for prediction for overcast sky with total cloud cover exceeding 90 the mean bias error was 1 2 and the normalized root mean squared error was 29 koehler et al 2014 cdom absorbed photons calculated similarly as for this study were earlier used to simulate photochemical cdom mineralization rates in the water column and proved to be in good agreement with observed depth profiles koehler et al 2014 groeneveld et al 2015 the approach used to calculate the steady state concentrations of photoreactive transients and the photochemical half life times of xenobiotics has been previously validated by comparison with available field data of surface water photoreactivity in european temperate water bodies the half life times predicted by the model were usually comparable with field ones within the respective uncertainties of both model predictions and field assessments or they were included within the variability range provided for the field data bodrato and vione 2014 to validate the pollutant degradation modeling we used observations on the persistence of two xenobiotics in swedish lakes specifically for carbamazepine in norra bergundasjön and for ibuprofen in boren zou et al 2015a 2015b validation was possible for these two compounds because their photochemical reactivity is sufficiently known at least as far as the main photoreaction pathways are concerned and photochemistry may play an important role in their attenuation matamoros et al 2009 the potential importance of photochemistry in the attenuation of carbamazepine and ibuprofen is suggested by a comparison between the observed persistence zou et al 2015a 2015b and the known biodegradation kinetics quintana et al 2005 benotti and brownawell 2009 girardi et al 2013 for the validation simulation for norra bergundasjön we used water chemistry data measured during may to october 2015 h olofsson unpublished data irradiance spectra simulated for the same place and time period and the lake average depth of 3 3 m the photochemical kinetics model estimated oh ave 1 2 10 18 mol l 1 we then assumed that carbamazepine mainly reacts with oh de laurentiis et al 2012 and used the reported second order reaction rate constant of the process k c a r b a m a z e p i n e o h 8 109 l mol 1 s 1 wols and hofman caris 2012 to calculate the half life time for the validation simulation for boren we used average water chemistry data from 2013 to 2015 http ext dokument lansstyrelsen se ostergotland msv sjo mo03 pdf irradiance spectra simulated for the same place and time period and the lake average depth of 5 4 m ibuprofen is mainly transformed by oh and 3cdom reactions and in both cases the reaction rate constants are 1 1010 l mol 1 s 1 vione et al 2011 wols and hofman caris 2012 the photochemical kinetics model estimated oh 5 15 10 18 mol l 1 and 3cdom 7 20 10 17 mol l 1 which allowed us to calculate half life times 2 6 statistical analyses principal components analysis pca was carried out on column autoscaled data using the chemometric software v parvus on the whole dataset 1048 samples 18 variables the percent explained variance on the first and second principal component was 38 9 and 23 2 respectively loadings analysis emphasizes interrelationships among variables where correlations anti correlations and non correlations correspond to parallel anti parallel and perpendicular loadings respectively forina et al 2008 relationships between the steady state concentrations of the simulated photoreactive transients and the concentrations of total organic carbon and nitrate as well as the irradiance were analyzed using linear least square regression models right skewed variables were logarithmically transformed before analysis after adding a small constant value if the dataset included zero values model significance was assessed using regression analysis of variance differences were considered significant if p value 0 05 linear regression lines are shown for the relationships where r2 0 25 analyses were conducted using r3 1 1 r d c team 2014 2 7 data representation color coded maps visualizing patterns across the swedish lakes were produced using the sweden rds file provided in the database of global administrative areas gadm 2015 http gadm org country and the function spplot of the r package sp in r3 1 1 r d c team 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations and control of photoreactive transient species the spatial distribution of toc fig 1 a was mirrored in the simulated steady state concentrations of cdom triplet states in the 5 cm upper layer of the water column 3cdom 5cm fig 2 a the same was the case for singlet oxygen 1o2 5cm fig sm1a in sm coherently a principal component analysis pca revealed strong correlations of 3cdom 5cm and 1o2 5cm with toc as shown by the similar loading values for these variables fig 3 considering that high toc waters are generally rich in cdom loiselle et al 2008 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 this correlation is simultaneously caused by elevated 3cdom and 1o2 formation rates following photon absorption by cdom in the water surface layer and by deactivation of 3cdom and 1o2 that is largely independent of toc latch and mcneill 2006 both the simulated 3cdom 5cm and the 3cdom avg values the latter referred to the average lake depth avg were lower in north western sweden fig 2a b where toc concentrations are usually low often 5 mgc l 1 fig 1a for 3cdom avg the correlation with toc was weaker compared to 3cdom 5cm fig 3 likely because the photochemically active photons are largely absorbed by cdom in the first meter of the water column across the study lakes absorption saturation koehler et al 2014 consequently photochemistry is inhibited in the poorly illuminated deeper water layers wenk et al 2011 aarnos et al 2012 dampening the toc 3cdom relationship only a small amount in the variability of simulated photoreactive transients was explained by the photon flux fig sm2 r2 0 25 in the present case fall equinox in sweden irradiance variations across the country were relatively limited and largely linked to the latitude allowing other factors to play a more important role indeed the photochemical production of transient species depends not only on the irradiance but most notably on water chemistry and depth in some cases 3cdom and 1o2 the chemistry only influences the photoproduction processes while in other cases oh and co3 it affects both formation and scavenging of the transients vione et al 2014 in the water column of lakes the irradiance absorption saturation induces a plateau in the formation rate of oh with increasing cdom but a similar effect does not take place for oh scavenging by dom vione et al 2014 consequently we found oh scavenging to be a major factor that controlled the simulated oh avg in the high toc lakes under study producing low oh avg levels compared to temperate lakes minella et al 2016 in our case the lakes with the highest oh avg values were the relatively low toc lakes of north western sweden fig 2d the radical co3 is mainly formed upon oxidation of inorganic carbon by oh because dom scavenges both co3 and oh involved in co3 generation vione et al 2014 the simulated co3 5cm and co3 avg values were usually higher in the low toc lakes of north western sweden than in other parts of the country fig 2e and f and low compared to temperate regions canonica et al 2005 minella et al 2016 3 2 indirect photochemical pollutant degradation performance of the pollutant degradation modeling was assessed by comparing simulated vs observed half life times of two compounds for two swedish lakes zou et al 2015a 2015b specifically a half life time of 1400 days had been measured for carbamazepine in norra bergundasjön in late spring with a 95 confidence interval of 780 5700 days zou et al 2015a our modeled half life times of 400 900 days are in reasonable agreement with the observations moreover the observed half life time of ibuprofen was 4 10 days in lake boren zou et al 2015b the simulated half life times of 3 5 10 6 days mostly due to the reactions with 3cdom were almost exactly in the same range as the field observations this finding suggests that cdom in boreal lakes can trigger 3cdom induced triplet sensitization processes in agreement with literature reports concerning the elevated cdom photoactivity in polar environments de laurentiis et al 2013 hence in both validation cases the model predictions derived from the steady state concentrations of the photoreactive transient species were accurate within a factor of maximally two when compared to field data which is a reasonable result for the modeling of xenobiotics phototransformation the successful validation provides confidence that the model predictions can be extended to other pollutants as well in particular in order to get insight into the details of the prevailing photochemical processes in swedish lakes we chose five compounds that span a wide range of reactivity and allow by photochemical fate modeling for a thorough assessment of the main photoreaction pathways in swedish lake water the assessment was carried out by comparing model predictions for boreal lakes with the well known behavior of the chosen molecules in temperate environments while our simulation study allowed a first large scale assessment of the likely photochemical behavior for a range of compounds in boreal lakes laboratory and field studies are needed to provide detailed system and compound specific observations and substantiate the patterns we found using photochemical modeling the generally high cdom content in the study lakes restricts sunlight penetration into the water column and hence direct photolysis of pollutants this makes the simulated photoreactive transient species highly relevant for indirect photochemical degradation wallace et al 2010 wenk et al 2011 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 to gain insight into the photoreaction pathways prevailing in boreal lakes we considered the half life times of the anthropogenic pollutants apap dmm ehmc fen and nic referred to the average lake depth the simulated half life times t ½ which are inversely proportional to the photodegradation rate constants ranged from weeks for ehmc and apap to months for dmm and fen fig 4 a d table 2 the median water retention time of 24 742 swedish lakes amounted to 120 days with a range of 7 days to 3 3 years between the 2 5th and the 97 5th percentiles müller et al 2013 therefore with the exception of nic with many years of photochemical lifetime see below the predicted photochemical lifetimes of our model compounds were on the short end of the typical water retention times in swedish lakes the longest t ½ values of apap dmm and fen were found in the north western lakes where the lowest values of 3cdom avg were predicted in agreement the pseudo first order photodegradation rate constants of apap dmm and fen correlated positively with 3cdom avg fig 3 suggesting that their phototransformation was almost exclusively accounted for by 3cdom this is different from the general behavior in temperate water bodies where co3 is a key photoreactive transient in the photodegradation of apap and where oh plays important roles in dmm and fen transformation table 2 avetta et al 2014 de laurentiis et al 2014 fabbri et al 2015 the simulated photochemical half life times of nic which mainly reacts with oh passananti et al 2014 reached up to years or even a few decades in high toc boreal lakes fig 4e table 2 in accordance with the low values of oh avg in these environments this finding means that biodegradation benotti and brownawell 2009 would be by far the main transformation pathway for nic in lake water with a mostly negligible contribution by photochemistry by comparison photochemical half life times of several months are expected for nic in temperate lakes table 2 passananti et al 2014 overall the general conditions that prevail in many of the studied swedish lakes would favor the reactions induced by 3cdom to the detriment of processes induced by oh and co3 3 3 photochemical behavior of boreal lakes the results of the above photochemical modeling can be extended to broader classes of naturally occurring molecules and anthropogenic pollutants table 2 most notably indirect photoreactions with 3cdom can induce effective degradation of phenols and phenylurea herbicides gerecke et al 2001 also 3cdom is an important source of the reactive oxygen species o2 and of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 through oxidation of organic compounds by electron or hydrogen transfer followed by reaction with oxygen richard et al 2007 these and other species are involved in the decomposition of cdom and can impose oxidative stress on aquatic organisms aarnos et al 2012 glaeser et al 2014 high c dom lakes would also be favorable environments for degradation processes induced by 1o2 which had a similar geographic distribution as 3cdom fig sm1 singlet oxygen is important in the phototransformation of anionic chlorophenols commonly used as pesticides herbicides and disinfectants gerdes et al 1997 in low c dom boreal lakes co3 could significantly photodegrade aromatic amines and thiols which are widely used for pesticides pharmaceuticals dyes and odors larson and zepp 1988 moreover oh could significantly oxidize refractory pollutants such as the pharmaceutical carbamazepine table 1 yan and song 2014 the xenobiotics that would accumulate in high cdom boreal lakes are biorefractory compounds prevalently reacting with oh or co3 however due to similar reduction potentials of 3cdom and co3 canonica et al 2005 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 compounds are unlikely to react fast with co3 and be at the same time unreactive toward 3cdom an exception may be represented by some aromatic amines that are oxidized fast by 3cdom in a first reaction step but that undergo efficient back reduction and hence inhibition of degradation in the presence of elevated dom levels wenk et al 2011 moreover accumulation is expected for biorecalcitrant xenobiotics that mainly react with oh such as for instance carbamazepine the second most refractory pollutant in lake norra bergundasjön southern sweden zou et al 2015b and some hydrocarbons table 2 3 4 effects of eutrophication and browning toc and nitrate levels in a given lake may undergo long term changes because of phenomena such as increasing cdom concentration browning monteith et al 2007 larsen et al 2011 and eutrophication quirós 2003 using a space for time replacement approach the correlation plots of the simulated steady state concentrations of the photoreactive transient species with toc and nitrate give some insight into the possible impact of such increases fig 5 and sm3 specifically given that 3cdom 5cm fig 5a r 2 0 76 and p 0 001 and 1o2 5cm fig sm3a r 2 0 76 and p 0 001 were positively correlated with toc toc changes will proportionally modify these transient concentrations the correlation was weaker but still significant for 3cdom avg fig 5b r2 0 29 and p 0 001 and 1o2 avg fig sm3b r 2 0 29 and p 0 001 for instance assuming irradiance and water depth do not undergo important variations a doubling of toc from 10 to 20 mgc l 1 would produce on average a 60 increase in 3cdom avg and 1o2 avg in contrast the inverse relationships between toc and oh avg r 2 0 33 and p 0 001 and co3 avg r 2 0 31 and p 0 001 suggest that oh and co3 induced reactions would be further inhibited by browning fig 4d f differently from toc we found no strong relationships between the simulated photoreactive transients and nitrate all r2 0 17 fig sm4 this result is expected for 3cdom given that nitrate plays no role in its generation or deactivation in the case of oh it indicates that cdom strongly prevailed over nitrate as oh source hence as opposed to toc changes nitrate changes brought about by e g eutrophication will not have considerable consequences for indirect photochemical reactions in boreal lakes 4 conclusions lakes are more numerous at boreal and arctic latitudes than anywhere else on earth verpoorter et al 2014 and lakes in these areas commonly exhibit high cdom concentrations we conclude that 3cdom mediated photoreactions controlled by water chemistry are likely highly important processes behind the transformation of natural and anthropogenic organic compounds in these waters the conditions in boreal lakes could favor the phototransformation of phenolic compounds including the chlorophenolates and of phenylureas with ongoing climate change dom and cdom concentrations are expected to increase in northern inland waters larsen et al 2011 which we expect to further facilitate these 3cdom

19832,lake water constituents such as chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom and nitrate absorb sunlight which induces an array of photochemical reactions although these reactions are a substantial driver of pollutant degradation in lakes they are insufficiently understood in particular on large scales here we provide for the first time comprehensive photochemical maps covering a large geographic region using photochemical kinetics modeling for 1048 lakes across sweden we simulated the steady state concentrations of four photoreactive transient species which are continuously produced and consumed in sunlit lake waters we then simulated the transient induced photochemical transformation of organic pollutants to gain insight into the relevance of the different photoreaction pathways we found that boreal lakes were often unfavorable environments for photoreactions mediated by hydroxyl radicals oh and carbonate radical anions co3 while photoreactions mediated by cdom triplet states 3cdom and to a lesser extent singlet oxygen 1o2 were the most prevalent these conditions promote the photodegradation of phenols which are used as plastic medical drug and herbicide precursors when cdom concentrations increase as is currently commonly the case in boreal areas such as sweden 3cdom will also increase promoting its importance in photochemical pathways even more graphical abstract image 1 keywords boreal lakes browning modeling photochemistry photochemical transients pollutants 1 introduction photochemically induced processes are important for the attenuation of xenobiotics such as residues of medical drugs and pesticides in sunlit waters fenner et al 2013 environmental persistence defined as the transformation half life of a chemical regulates the exposure of organisms to the substance the extent of its transport and diffuse pollution and the resilience towards environmental contamination boethling et al 2009 zou et al 2015a to protect resources such as plants aquatic biota and drinking water it is therefore crucial to understand the environmental fate and degradation pathways of pollutants fenner et al 2013 parker and mitch 2016 however little to nothing is known about the role of different photoreactions for pollutant degradation on large geographic scales especially in boreal regions where the largest lake area on earth is located verpoorter et al 2014 to gain first insight into the relevance of the different photoreaction pathways in boreal lakes we conducted a modeling study which allowed a large scale simulation of the likely photochemical behavior for a range of different compounds while subject to a number of necessary assumptions and uncertainties our model simulations contribute along with laboratory and field measurements which provide more detailed direct observations for specific compounds but are more time and cost intensive a key component towards an integrated approach in assessing chemical persistence in aquatic biomes for different climate zones zou et al 2015a 2015b the photodegradation pathways of pollutants can be divided in direct photolysis and indirect photochemistry in direct photolysis degradation is triggered by photon absorption by the pollutant itself in indirect photochemistry transformation is caused by reaction with photogenerated transient species boreen et al 2003 these transient species such as triplet states 3cdom singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh are mostly produced in reactions with photochemical sensitizers such as chromophoric dom cdom and nitrate canonica et al 2005 cawley et al 2015 in the presence of bicarbonate and carbonate the carbonate radical co3 is also produced canonica et al 2005 upon photon absorption cdom yields 3cdom 1o2 and oh while dom is a sink of oh and co3 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 nitrate acts as photochemical oh source and indirectly as co3 source in the presence of inorganic carbon via photogenerated oh wallace et al 2010 here we used a unique large scale dataset of concentration data on total organic carbon toc a measure of dom and nitrate as well as inorganic carbon levels ph values and lake water cdom absorption spectra which are available across 14 degrees of latitude for 1048 boreal lakes in sweden koehler et al 2014 with their comparatively high toc concentrations these water environments are representative of boreal lakes in general sobek et al 2007 we combined the observations with atmospheric radiative transfer and aquatic photochemical kinetics modeling to resolve which photoreaction pathways are generally the most important in boreal lakes how these reflect in the environmental persistence of chemical compound classes and how the relevance of photoreaction pathways may change when browning larsen et al 2011 and eutrophication occur 2 methods 2 1 radiation absorption calculations water chemical and cdom absorbance data from 1048 lakes distributed across sweden between latitudes from 55 n to 69 n were obtained from the 2009 swedish national lake inventory which was conducted by the swedish university of agricultural sciences lake water had been sampled between 6 september and 24 november 2009 in most cases in the middle of the lake at 0 5 m depth more details and lake properties have been published earlier erlandsson et al 2012 koehler et al 2014 cdom absorbed photons p a c d o m d a y mol photons m 3 day 1 were calculated for sep 22 2009 autumnal equinox and 280 600 nm 1 nm resolution from the surface of each lake in 0 005 m increments down to the target lake depths as 1 p a c d o m d a y z λ min λ max e o d d a y λ 0 a g λ e k d λ z d λ where z is depth m λ min and λ max is the minimal and maximal wavelength nm e o d d a y λ 0 is daily integrated downwelling scalar irradiation just below the water surface mol photons m 2 day 1 nm 1 a g is the cdom napierian absorption coefficient m 1 and k d is the vertical attenuation coefficient for downward irradiance m 1 the parameter a g was calculated from measured cdom absorbance koehler et al 2014 k d was estimated using regression relationships with a g derived from literature data n 565 for nine wavelengths between 300 and 400 nm subsequent fitting of an exponential function was carried out to obtain continuous spectra koehler et al 2014 for each lake daily integrated downwelling irradiation just below the water surface e o d d a y λ 0 mol photons m 2 day 1 nm 1 was simulated for the autumnal equinox 2009 sep 22 as described in detail earlier koehler et al 2014 briefly clear sky downwelling spectra of global and diffuse irradiance reaching the water air interface were derived for 280 600 nm with an hourly time step using the atmospheric radiative transfer model libradtran 1 6 mayer et al 2011 the clear sky irradiance spectra were corrected for attenuation by clouds using a cloud effect function kasten and czeplak 1980 which was parameterized using uv irradiance measurements from norrköping sweden during 2008 n 2400 total cloud cover data was retrieved from the archive of the operational mesoscale analysis system mesan at the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute hāggmark et al 2000 transmittance of the above water surface irradiance across the air water interface was calculated separately for the diffuse and direct fraction the just below water surface hourly diffuse and direct irradiance spectra were converted to downwelling irradiance spectra and integrated to obtain daily irradiation spectra nitrate absorbed photons p a c d o m d a y mol photons m 3 day 1 were calculated as 2 p a n o 3 d a y z λ min λ max ε n o 3 λ c n o 3 a g λ e o d d a y λ 0 a g λ e k d λ z d λ where ε n o 3 is the molar absorption coefficient of nitrate l μg n 1 m 1 and c n o 3 is nitrate concentration μg n l 1 the depth specific cdom and nitrate absorbed photons were integrated down to z 0 05 m and down to the average depth z avg of each lake using the trapezoid rule photon absorption by nitrite was not considered because its concentration was usually below the detection limit of the analytical method and more importantly because cdom usually strongly prevailed over nitrate as oh source therefore it is expected that cdom out competes also nitrite for oh generation 2 2 photochemical modeling to calculate the steady state concentration of the photoreactive transient species the photon fluxes absorbed by cdom and nitrate were expressed as p a i z where i cdom or no3 units are mol photons l 1 s 1 the formation rates of hydroxyl radicals oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 mol l 1 s 1 were calculated as 3 4 r 1 o 2 t o t z φ 1 o 2 c d o m p a c d o m z as the formation quantum yield of oh by cdom image 3 takes into account all known and poorly known processes of oh photoproduction by cdom including the photo fenton reactions triggered by irradiation of fe species vione et al 2014 the formation quantum yields of photoreactive transients by irradiated cdom may vary among different aquatic environments but such variations are more limited than the environmental variability might suggest values from available literature sources were used for the relevant quantum yields vione et al 2014 the steady state oh z mol l 1 day averaged value referred to a water column of depth z takes into account the scavenging of oh by organic matter and inorganic carbon expressed as 5 where toc is total organic carbon mgc l 1 the reaction rate constants of oh with bicarbonate carbonate and organic matter were derived from the literature buxton et al 1988 brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 for 1o2 one should consider its formation by irradiated cdom r o 2 1 t o t eq 4 and its deactivation upon collision with the water solvent which has a first order rate constant of k d 2 5 105 s 1 therefore the steady state 1o2 concentration is o 2 1 z r t o t z k d 1 latch and mcneill 2006 the carbonate radical co3 is produced by oh oxidation of inorganic carbon hco3 and co3 2 and by 3cdom oxidation of co3 2 canonica et al 2005 the two pathways give the following formation rates for co3 mol l 1 s 1 bodrato and vione 2014 6 7 it is image 7 and usually image 8 co3 is mostly scavenged by dom and its steady state concentration mol l 1 was expressed as 8 where image 10 was taken as the average of available literature values canonica et al 2005 finally the cdom triplet states 3cdom are produced by cdom irradiation and are deactivated by a number of processes including internal conversion and reaction with dissolved o2 these processes can be described by an overall first order rate constant k 5 105 s 1 canonica and freiburghaus 2001 the steady state 3cdom z mol l 1 was expressed as 9 c d o m 3 z φ c d o m 3 c d o m p a c d o m z k with φ c d o m 3 c d o m taken from the literature vione et al 2014 2 3 kinetics of direct and indirect pollutant photolysis a rather simple way to assess the environmental significance of the transient steady state concentrations calculated previously is to see how they may translate into the degradation kinetics of xenobiotics with known photoreactivity as first model substance we chose the pharmaceutical acetaminophen which is commonly found in swedish lakes zou et al 2015a and reacts with co3 de laurentiis et al 2014 apart from acetaminophen however the xenobiotics that are commonly found in swedish lakes such as diclofenac or ibuprofen zou et al 2015a 2015b do not cover a sufficiently wide range of photochemical reactivity to provide insight into the general photochemical behavior of swedish lakes for these reasons they are hardly suitable to assess the phototransformation pathways of boreal lakes therefore in addition to acetaminophen apap we chose four more model pollutants for which 1 all or at least the majority of the relevant photochemical reaction rate constants are known table 1 2 the reaction pathways differ strongly and 3 the photochemical behavior is already known for temperate lakes avetta et al 2014 de laurentiis et al 2014 passananti et al 2014 fabbri et al 2015 vione et al 2015 specifically we chose the fungicide dimethomorph dmm the solar filter ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate ehmc the herbicide fenuron fen and nicotine nic we included ehmc because it undergoes very efficient direct photolysis vione et al 2015 as well as dmm and fen because of the significant role played by 3cdom together with oh in their transformation avetta et al 2014 fabbri et al 2015 nic was chosen because it is almost exclusively photodegraded by reaction with oh passananti et al 2014 assume a pollutant substrate s at concentration s mol l 1 which can be degraded by direct photolysis and by reaction with oh co3 1o2 and 3cdom assume also the following key parameters for s photolysis quantum yield φ s absorbed photon flux p a s z mol photons l 1 s 1 and second order reaction rate constants k s j l mol 1 s 1 where j oh co3 1o2 or 3cdom the degradation rate of s due to photochemical reactions is the following mol l 1 s 1 10 r s z φ s p a s z s j k s j j z where j z mol l 1 is the daily and depth averaged steady state concentration of the transient species j calculated as described above referred to the depth z the values of φ s and k s j were parameterized according to table 1 p a s z mol photons l 1 s 1 was calculated as 11 p a s z s λ min λ max ε s λ a g λ e o d d a y λ 0 a g λ e k d λ z d λ where ε s λ is the molar absorption coefficient of s l mol 1 cm 1 the pseudo first order degradation rate constant is k s z r s z s 1 the value of k s z is independent of s provided that the latter is very low e g below 1 μmol l 1 and does not affect p a c d o m z note that the main light absorber in surface waters is cdom with usually negligible contributions from other solution constituents loiselle et al 2008 the rate r s z is expressed in mol l 1 s 1 units thus k s z has units of s 1 more intuitive data can be obtained with units of day 1 as k s d a y z 8 5 10 4 1 k s z the half life time of s in day units in a water column of depth z is given by t 1 2 d a y z ln 2 k s d a y z 1 2 4 model assumptions first of all phototransformation kinetics of the model compounds was determined under the assumption of thorough mixing of the lake water for model parameterization we assumed that certain photochemical parameters are universally valid because they are referred to substances that do not vary in nature among different environments and specifically the formation quantum yield of oh by nitrate the reaction rate constants of oh with bicarbonate and carbonate buxton et al 1988 vione et al 2009 the reaction rate constants of apap dmm ehmc fen and nic with oh co3 and 1o2 avetta et al 2014 de laurentiis et al 2014 passananti et al 2014 fabbri et al 2015 vione et al 2015 as well as the first order inactivation rate constant of 1o2 upon collision with the water solvent latch and mcneill 2006 however other photochemical parameters may depend on the environment such as the formation quantum yields of the transient species from irradiated cdom the reaction rate constants of oh and co3 with dom the first order inactivation rate constant of 3cdom and the second order reaction rate constants of 3cdom with apap dmm ehmc and fen these parameters were taken from the literature brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 canonica and freiburghaus 2001 canonica et al 2005 vione et al 2014 but all the cited studies were conducted in temperate water samples hence there is a degree of uncertainty of how appropriate it is to use these values for boreal lakes we justify this model assumption with the fact that dom was found to show only a limited molecular and photochemical variability across inland waters worldwide specifically ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry revealed a substantial overlap in molecular level patterns for dom in inland waters across biomes and continents kellerman et al 2014 the individual compounds were largely overlapping between fresh dom prior to substantial light exposure in boreal lakes and photolabile compounds from congo river water and vice versa i e dom with substantial light exposure and photoresistant dom stubbins et al 2010 kellerman et al 2014 also the wavelength integrated apparent quantum yield for photochemical dom mineralization varied by only a factor of 12 across a variety of boreal polar temperate and tropical lakes including saline lagoons which covered a very wide range in chemical and optical water properties koehler et al 2016 finally considering that boreal lakes appear to be favorable environments for reactions triggered by 3cdom and 1o2 vide infra the values we used here for φ 3 c d o m c d o m and φ o 2 1 c d o m are in the lower range of those reported for temperate water bodies vione et al 2014 therefore we likely underestimated the formation of 3cdom and 1o2 in boreal lake water i e we conducted a conservative calculation all lake photoactivity parameters used in the model are reported in table sm1 of the supplementary material hereafter sm 2 5 model validation to assess the performance of the atmospheric radiative transfer model under clear sky conditions uv irradiance observed during 2008 in norrköping in southern sweden with a total cloud cover of less than 10 was compared to clear sky irradiance simulated for the same place and time a linear regression between observed and simulated clear sky irradiance gave a r2 of 0 998 n 996 cloud corrected irradiance was validated using a 100 fold cross validation in which for each sub validation 2375 observations were used for regression and 25 observations were used for prediction for overcast sky with total cloud cover exceeding 90 the mean bias error was 1 2 and the normalized root mean squared error was 29 koehler et al 2014 cdom absorbed photons calculated similarly as for this study were earlier used to simulate photochemical cdom mineralization rates in the water column and proved to be in good agreement with observed depth profiles koehler et al 2014 groeneveld et al 2015 the approach used to calculate the steady state concentrations of photoreactive transients and the photochemical half life times of xenobiotics has been previously validated by comparison with available field data of surface water photoreactivity in european temperate water bodies the half life times predicted by the model were usually comparable with field ones within the respective uncertainties of both model predictions and field assessments or they were included within the variability range provided for the field data bodrato and vione 2014 to validate the pollutant degradation modeling we used observations on the persistence of two xenobiotics in swedish lakes specifically for carbamazepine in norra bergundasjön and for ibuprofen in boren zou et al 2015a 2015b validation was possible for these two compounds because their photochemical reactivity is sufficiently known at least as far as the main photoreaction pathways are concerned and photochemistry may play an important role in their attenuation matamoros et al 2009 the potential importance of photochemistry in the attenuation of carbamazepine and ibuprofen is suggested by a comparison between the observed persistence zou et al 2015a 2015b and the known biodegradation kinetics quintana et al 2005 benotti and brownawell 2009 girardi et al 2013 for the validation simulation for norra bergundasjön we used water chemistry data measured during may to october 2015 h olofsson unpublished data irradiance spectra simulated for the same place and time period and the lake average depth of 3 3 m the photochemical kinetics model estimated oh ave 1 2 10 18 mol l 1 we then assumed that carbamazepine mainly reacts with oh de laurentiis et al 2012 and used the reported second order reaction rate constant of the process k c a r b a m a z e p i n e o h 8 109 l mol 1 s 1 wols and hofman caris 2012 to calculate the half life time for the validation simulation for boren we used average water chemistry data from 2013 to 2015 http ext dokument lansstyrelsen se ostergotland msv sjo mo03 pdf irradiance spectra simulated for the same place and time period and the lake average depth of 5 4 m ibuprofen is mainly transformed by oh and 3cdom reactions and in both cases the reaction rate constants are 1 1010 l mol 1 s 1 vione et al 2011 wols and hofman caris 2012 the photochemical kinetics model estimated oh 5 15 10 18 mol l 1 and 3cdom 7 20 10 17 mol l 1 which allowed us to calculate half life times 2 6 statistical analyses principal components analysis pca was carried out on column autoscaled data using the chemometric software v parvus on the whole dataset 1048 samples 18 variables the percent explained variance on the first and second principal component was 38 9 and 23 2 respectively loadings analysis emphasizes interrelationships among variables where correlations anti correlations and non correlations correspond to parallel anti parallel and perpendicular loadings respectively forina et al 2008 relationships between the steady state concentrations of the simulated photoreactive transients and the concentrations of total organic carbon and nitrate as well as the irradiance were analyzed using linear least square regression models right skewed variables were logarithmically transformed before analysis after adding a small constant value if the dataset included zero values model significance was assessed using regression analysis of variance differences were considered significant if p value 0 05 linear regression lines are shown for the relationships where r2 0 25 analyses were conducted using r3 1 1 r d c team 2014 2 7 data representation color coded maps visualizing patterns across the swedish lakes were produced using the sweden rds file provided in the database of global administrative areas gadm 2015 http gadm org country and the function spplot of the r package sp in r3 1 1 r d c team 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations and control of photoreactive transient species the spatial distribution of toc fig 1 a was mirrored in the simulated steady state concentrations of cdom triplet states in the 5 cm upper layer of the water column 3cdom 5cm fig 2 a the same was the case for singlet oxygen 1o2 5cm fig sm1a in sm coherently a principal component analysis pca revealed strong correlations of 3cdom 5cm and 1o2 5cm with toc as shown by the similar loading values for these variables fig 3 considering that high toc waters are generally rich in cdom loiselle et al 2008 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 this correlation is simultaneously caused by elevated 3cdom and 1o2 formation rates following photon absorption by cdom in the water surface layer and by deactivation of 3cdom and 1o2 that is largely independent of toc latch and mcneill 2006 both the simulated 3cdom 5cm and the 3cdom avg values the latter referred to the average lake depth avg were lower in north western sweden fig 2a b where toc concentrations are usually low often 5 mgc l 1 fig 1a for 3cdom avg the correlation with toc was weaker compared to 3cdom 5cm fig 3 likely because the photochemically active photons are largely absorbed by cdom in the first meter of the water column across the study lakes absorption saturation koehler et al 2014 consequently photochemistry is inhibited in the poorly illuminated deeper water layers wenk et al 2011 aarnos et al 2012 dampening the toc 3cdom relationship only a small amount in the variability of simulated photoreactive transients was explained by the photon flux fig sm2 r2 0 25 in the present case fall equinox in sweden irradiance variations across the country were relatively limited and largely linked to the latitude allowing other factors to play a more important role indeed the photochemical production of transient species depends not only on the irradiance but most notably on water chemistry and depth in some cases 3cdom and 1o2 the chemistry only influences the photoproduction processes while in other cases oh and co3 it affects both formation and scavenging of the transients vione et al 2014 in the water column of lakes the irradiance absorption saturation induces a plateau in the formation rate of oh with increasing cdom but a similar effect does not take place for oh scavenging by dom vione et al 2014 consequently we found oh scavenging to be a major factor that controlled the simulated oh avg in the high toc lakes under study producing low oh avg levels compared to temperate lakes minella et al 2016 in our case the lakes with the highest oh avg values were the relatively low toc lakes of north western sweden fig 2d the radical co3 is mainly formed upon oxidation of inorganic carbon by oh because dom scavenges both co3 and oh involved in co3 generation vione et al 2014 the simulated co3 5cm and co3 avg values were usually higher in the low toc lakes of north western sweden than in other parts of the country fig 2e and f and low compared to temperate regions canonica et al 2005 minella et al 2016 3 2 indirect photochemical pollutant degradation performance of the pollutant degradation modeling was assessed by comparing simulated vs observed half life times of two compounds for two swedish lakes zou et al 2015a 2015b specifically a half life time of 1400 days had been measured for carbamazepine in norra bergundasjön in late spring with a 95 confidence interval of 780 5700 days zou et al 2015a our modeled half life times of 400 900 days are in reasonable agreement with the observations moreover the observed half life time of ibuprofen was 4 10 days in lake boren zou et al 2015b the simulated half life times of 3 5 10 6 days mostly due to the reactions with 3cdom were almost exactly in the same range as the field observations this finding suggests that cdom in boreal lakes can trigger 3cdom induced triplet sensitization processes in agreement with literature reports concerning the elevated cdom photoactivity in polar environments de laurentiis et al 2013 hence in both validation cases the model predictions derived from the steady state concentrations of the photoreactive transient species were accurate within a factor of maximally two when compared to field data which is a reasonable result for the modeling of xenobiotics phototransformation the successful validation provides confidence that the model predictions can be extended to other pollutants as well in particular in order to get insight into the details of the prevailing photochemical processes in swedish lakes we chose five compounds that span a wide range of reactivity and allow by photochemical fate modeling for a thorough assessment of the main photoreaction pathways in swedish lake water the assessment was carried out by comparing model predictions for boreal lakes with the well known behavior of the chosen molecules in temperate environments while our simulation study allowed a first large scale assessment of the likely photochemical behavior for a range of compounds in boreal lakes laboratory and field studies are needed to provide detailed system and compound specific observations and substantiate the patterns we found using photochemical modeling the generally high cdom content in the study lakes restricts sunlight penetration into the water column and hence direct photolysis of pollutants this makes the simulated photoreactive transient species highly relevant for indirect photochemical degradation wallace et al 2010 wenk et al 2011 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 to gain insight into the photoreaction pathways prevailing in boreal lakes we considered the half life times of the anthropogenic pollutants apap dmm ehmc fen and nic referred to the average lake depth the simulated half life times t ½ which are inversely proportional to the photodegradation rate constants ranged from weeks for ehmc and apap to months for dmm and fen fig 4 a d table 2 the median water retention time of 24 742 swedish lakes amounted to 120 days with a range of 7 days to 3 3 years between the 2 5th and the 97 5th percentiles müller et al 2013 therefore with the exception of nic with many years of photochemical lifetime see below the predicted photochemical lifetimes of our model compounds were on the short end of the typical water retention times in swedish lakes the longest t ½ values of apap dmm and fen were found in the north western lakes where the lowest values of 3cdom avg were predicted in agreement the pseudo first order photodegradation rate constants of apap dmm and fen correlated positively with 3cdom avg fig 3 suggesting that their phototransformation was almost exclusively accounted for by 3cdom this is different from the general behavior in temperate water bodies where co3 is a key photoreactive transient in the photodegradation of apap and where oh plays important roles in dmm and fen transformation table 2 avetta et al 2014 de laurentiis et al 2014 fabbri et al 2015 the simulated photochemical half life times of nic which mainly reacts with oh passananti et al 2014 reached up to years or even a few decades in high toc boreal lakes fig 4e table 2 in accordance with the low values of oh avg in these environments this finding means that biodegradation benotti and brownawell 2009 would be by far the main transformation pathway for nic in lake water with a mostly negligible contribution by photochemistry by comparison photochemical half life times of several months are expected for nic in temperate lakes table 2 passananti et al 2014 overall the general conditions that prevail in many of the studied swedish lakes would favor the reactions induced by 3cdom to the detriment of processes induced by oh and co3 3 3 photochemical behavior of boreal lakes the results of the above photochemical modeling can be extended to broader classes of naturally occurring molecules and anthropogenic pollutants table 2 most notably indirect photoreactions with 3cdom can induce effective degradation of phenols and phenylurea herbicides gerecke et al 2001 also 3cdom is an important source of the reactive oxygen species o2 and of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 through oxidation of organic compounds by electron or hydrogen transfer followed by reaction with oxygen richard et al 2007 these and other species are involved in the decomposition of cdom and can impose oxidative stress on aquatic organisms aarnos et al 2012 glaeser et al 2014 high c dom lakes would also be favorable environments for degradation processes induced by 1o2 which had a similar geographic distribution as 3cdom fig sm1 singlet oxygen is important in the phototransformation of anionic chlorophenols commonly used as pesticides herbicides and disinfectants gerdes et al 1997 in low c dom boreal lakes co3 could significantly photodegrade aromatic amines and thiols which are widely used for pesticides pharmaceuticals dyes and odors larson and zepp 1988 moreover oh could significantly oxidize refractory pollutants such as the pharmaceutical carbamazepine table 1 yan and song 2014 the xenobiotics that would accumulate in high cdom boreal lakes are biorefractory compounds prevalently reacting with oh or co3 however due to similar reduction potentials of 3cdom and co3 canonica et al 2005 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 compounds are unlikely to react fast with co3 and be at the same time unreactive toward 3cdom an exception may be represented by some aromatic amines that are oxidized fast by 3cdom in a first reaction step but that undergo efficient back reduction and hence inhibition of degradation in the presence of elevated dom levels wenk et al 2011 moreover accumulation is expected for biorecalcitrant xenobiotics that mainly react with oh such as for instance carbamazepine the second most refractory pollutant in lake norra bergundasjön southern sweden zou et al 2015b and some hydrocarbons table 2 3 4 effects of eutrophication and browning toc and nitrate levels in a given lake may undergo long term changes because of phenomena such as increasing cdom concentration browning monteith et al 2007 larsen et al 2011 and eutrophication quirós 2003 using a space for time replacement approach the correlation plots of the simulated steady state concentrations of the photoreactive transient species with toc and nitrate give some insight into the possible impact of such increases fig 5 and sm3 specifically given that 3cdom 5cm fig 5a r 2 0 76 and p 0 001 and 1o2 5cm fig sm3a r 2 0 76 and p 0 001 were positively correlated with toc toc changes will proportionally modify these transient concentrations the correlation was weaker but still significant for 3cdom avg fig 5b r2 0 29 and p 0 001 and 1o2 avg fig sm3b r 2 0 29 and p 0 001 for instance assuming irradiance and water depth do not undergo important variations a doubling of toc from 10 to 20 mgc l 1 would produce on average a 60 increase in 3cdom avg and 1o2 avg in contrast the inverse relationships between toc and oh avg r 2 0 33 and p 0 001 and co3 avg r 2 0 31 and p 0 001 suggest that oh and co3 induced reactions would be further inhibited by browning fig 4d f differently from toc we found no strong relationships between the simulated photoreactive transients and nitrate all r2 0 17 fig sm4 this result is expected for 3cdom given that nitrate plays no role in its generation or deactivation in the case of oh it indicates that cdom strongly prevailed over nitrate as oh source hence as opposed to toc changes nitrate changes brought about by e g eutrophication will not have considerable consequences for indirect photochemical reactions in boreal lakes 4 conclusions lakes are more numerous at boreal and arctic latitudes than anywhere else on earth verpoorter et al 2014 and lakes in these areas commonly exhibit high cdom concentrations we conclude that 3cdom mediated photoreactions controlled by water chemistry are likely highly important processes behind the transformation of natural and anthropogenic organic compounds in these waters the conditions in boreal lakes could favor the phototransformation of phenolic compounds including the chlorophenolates and of phenylureas with ongoing climate change dom and cdom concentrations are expected to increase in northern inland waters larsen et al 2011 which we expect to further facilitate these 3cdom mediated photoreactions at the expense of direct photolysis and the processes mediated by oh and co3 acknowledgements bk and lt acknowledge funding from the swedish research council for environment

19833,breakpoint chlorination can be commonly observed in the chlorination of water treatments when ammonia is present in this study it was found that breakpoint chlorination can remarkably eliminate a ubiquitous and chlorine refractory micropollutant carbamazepine cbz with the removal of 72 at neutral condition at neutral ph low cbz elimination was observed at a chlorine ammonia molar ratio cl n of 1 0 and higher cbz elimination was observed as cl n ratio increased from 1 0 to 1 6 breakpoint indicating that cbz elimination was closely related to the generation and decomposition of chloramines the chloramines generation and decomposition rates were affected by the ph so that the cbz elimination rate was highest at ph 7 0 and lower in acidic and basic solutions ph 5 5 and ph 9 5 respectively the cbz elimination at ph 7 0 was 72 4 after 10 min of breakpoint chlorination while reaction times about 30 min and 60 min were required to achieve the same elimination at ph 5 5 and ph 9 5 respectively breakpoint chlorination of cbz was strongly suppressed by radical scavenger tbuoh and moderately suppressed by n2 purging the inhibiting ratios being 87 7 and 27 8 at breakpoint respectively electron spin resonance experiments suggested that unidentified radicals were generated by breakpoint chlorination the oh and unidentified radical species contributions to cbz elimination were 23 7 and 76 3 respectively when a pseudo steady state breakpoint chlorination was performed in a microinjection system with nitrobenzene as oh probe although cbz were efficiently eliminated breakpoint chlorination of cbz generated adsorbable organic chlorine the cytotoxicity of the cbz solution was therefore increased by breakpoint chlorination suggesting that biological risk caused by the breakpoint chlorination of micropollutants should be taken into consideration keywords breakpoint chlorination carbamazepine radical species adsorbable organic halide cytotoxicity 1 introduction chlorination is extensively used in water treatments to inactivate microorganisms because it is effective cheap and easily performed deborde and von gunten 2008 it has recently been suggested that chlorination can also efficiently decompose micropollutants such as estrogenic compounds endocrine disruptors antibiotics uv filters and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs abdallah et al 2015 gao et al 2016 hu et al 2003 negreira et al 2015 microorganism inactivation and micropollutant decomposition by chlorination are affected by many factors including the operational steps one or two steps chlorine addition the chlorine dose the contact time and the aquatic matrices acero et al 2013 cheng et al 2015 li et al 2017b pang et al 2016 ammonia is one of the aquatic matrices affecting the performance of chlorination because it allows chlorine to be transformed into chloramines including monochloramine nh2cl dichloramine nhcl2 and trichloramine ncl3 the total chlorine residual and chlorine species vary as the chlorine to ammonia molar ratio cl n varies which is widely known as breakpoint chlorination breakpoint chlorination occurs in the chlorination of wastewater effluent and reclaimed water where the ammonia nitrogen is approximately 0 5 1 mg l and chlorine dosage is approximately 1 10 mg l krasner et al 2009 sun et al 2016 some interesting oxidation processes have been observed in the process of breakpoint chlorination including the oxidation of ammonia and the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps under circumneutral conditions and at cl n 1 0 the total chlorine residual equals the chloramines concentration and chloramines concentration reaches a maximum at cl n 1 5 to 1 7 breakpoint ammonia is oxidized to nitrogen and nitrate and the total chlorine residual reaches a minimum jafvert and valentine 1992 the formation of dbps is strongly related to breakpoint chlorination shang et al 2000 and schreiber and mitch 2007 found that the generation of nitrogenous dbps such as cyanogen chloride and n nitrosodimethylamine ndma was strongly promoted at breakpoint while charrois and hrudey 2007 found that the ndma reached a maximum at cl n 1 0 the oxidation mechanism of breakpoint chlorination has attracted lots of interests and some of the reactions were listed in table s1 in supplementary material some oxidative species were reported to be generated by breakpoint chlorination for instance nitrogen hydroxide noh were suggested as a transient reactive intermediate responsible for the oxidation of ammonia wei and morris 1974 peroxynitrite and oh were probably generated near breakpoint by the breakpoint chlorination of dimethylamine schreiber and mitch 2007 it has also been suggested that amine radicals single oxygen radicals and superoxide are probably generated by breakpoint chlorination buxton et al 1988 kirsch et al 2006 despite many studies having been performed the mechanisms involved in breakpoint chlorination are still poorly understood both qualitatively and quantitatively driss and bouhelassa 2014 shen 2014 what s more the elimination transformation and environmental fates of recalcitrant micropollutants in the process of breakpoint chlorination have not previously been investigated previous investigations have studied the kinetics byproducts and influencing factors of chlorination of micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products abdallah et al 2015 herbicides tawk et al 2015 and food additives li et al 2017a but few information of the chlorine refractory micropollutants has been reported in breakpoint chlorination process to the best of our knowledge few studies of the oxidation of micropollutants by breakpoint chlorination have been published carbamazepine cbz an antiepileptic drug is one of the most ubiquitous micropollutants in aquatic systems mohapatra et al 2014 the molecular formula of c15h12n2o and chemical structure are shown in fig s1 cbz usually exists as the protonated form in the groundwater and wastewater with the pka of 13 9 cbz is recalcitrant to biodegradation resistant to chlorination and unsusceptible to photolysis clara et al 2004 de laurentiis et al 2012 soufan et al 2013 cbz is therefore persistent and is found in the treated wastewater effluent reclaimed water and surface water it has previously been suggested that uv uv h2o2 uv chlorine or uv s2o8 2 or ozone driven advanced oxidation processes generating radical species such as oh cl and so4 were efficient for cbz elimination deng et al 2013 mcdowell et al 2005 wang et al 2016 however the breakpoint chlorination of cbz in water treatments has not been studied the aim of this study was to investigate the elimination of cbz by breakpoint chlorination we studied the cbz degradation kinetics by breakpoint chlorination at different cl n ratios the influencing factors and roles of reactive species the chlorine substituted dbps and the cytotoxicity of the cbz solution generated by breakpoint chlorination were also investigated 2 materials and experiments 2 1 materials ammonia chloride 99 pure cbz 98 pure and sodium hypochlorite solution containing 10 active chlorine were obtained from j k scientific beijing china high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade nitrobenzene nb tert butanol tbuoh and formic acid were obtained from aladdin industrial corporation beijing china hplc grade organic solvents methanol and acetonitrile were obtained from j t baker through avantor beijing china analytical grade sodium hydroxide and sodium dihydrogen phosphate were obtained from guangfu fine chemical research institute tianjin china all solutions were prepared using ultrapure water 18 25 mω cm produced by a milli q purification system 2 2 experimental procedures experiments involving chlorination and chloramination of cbz were conducted by spiking chlorine and chloramine into cbz solutions respectively the chloramine was prepared 20 min before chloramination experiments by mixing chlorine and ammonia at cl n 0 98 and 1 31 resulting in the total chloramines of 238 and 115 μm for chloramination experiments respectively breakpoint chlorination experiments were conducted by spiking specified amounts of chlorine into a mixture of cbz 8 5 μm and ammonia 142 9 μm n giving chlorine dose of 0 563 8 μm in all the experiments the solution ph was buffered with 20 mm nah2po4 and adjusted to required ph by adding 4 m naoh aliquots sampled at specified times were analyzed for cbz concentration total chlorine adsorbable organic halide aox and cytotoxicity the chlorine residual was quenched by 3 times of stoichiometry na2s2o3 before measuring cbz concentration while it was not quenched before measuring aox and cytotoxicity reductive quenchers of na2s2o3 or ascorbic acid were reported to affect the measurements of aox and cytotoxicity du et al 2016 scavenging experiments were conducted by adding 10 mm tbuoh to quench most radical species e g oh amidogen radicals and reactive chlorine species or n2 purging to quench aerobic reactions the de oxygen processes were conducted by continually bubbling n2 into the mixture of cbz and ammonia keeping the dissolved oxygen below 1 0 mg l the dissolved oxygen was measured using a dissolved oxygen optical probe optiox metterler toledo china the other operating conditions were the same as used in the breakpoint chlorination experiments the breakpoint chlorination happens rapidly at neutral condition resulting in that it was difficult to observe the steady state of radical species and cbz degradation kinetics in this study a microinjection system was employed to inject chlorine and ammonia simultaneously and to achieve a pseudo steady state of breakpoint chlorination as shown in fig s2 in supplementary material in such a pseudo steady state the breakpoint chlorination reactions and the generations of radical species continuously happened throughout the experiments meanwhile the competition kinetics of nb and cbz was conducted where nb was used as the oh probe the microinjection system consists of a reactor containing 50 ml cbz solution 8 5 μm buffered with 20 mm nah2po4 at ph 7 0 a magnetic stirrer and two microinjectors to allow a chlorine stock and an ammonia stock to be added at injection rates of 50 and 50 μl min respectively chlorination or breakpoint chlorination microinjection experiments were conducted by injecting chlorine stock only or chlorine and ammonia stocks simultaneously respectively the chlorine stock and ammonia stock concentration were 113 mm cl2 and 28 6 mm n respectively the final chlorine dose and ammonia dose after an injection time of 10 min were 1130 μm cl2 and 286 μm n respectively and the cl n was 3 90 higher than breakpoint aliquots were collected at specified times for cbz and nb determinations 2 3 analytical methods the cbz and nb concentrations were determined using a hplc coupling with diode array detectors lc 20 at shimadzu kyoto japan separation was achieved using an ods c18 column 150 4 2 mm 5 μm particle size j k scientific shanghai china the mobile phases for cbz analysis were methanol and 10 mm phosphate with 0 1 formic acid and the flow rate was 1 ml min at a constant volume ratio of 60 40 the mobile phases for nb analysis were acetonitrile and 10 mm phosphate with 0 1 formic acid and the flow rate was 1 ml min at a constant volume ratio of 40 60 the injection volume was 20 μl free chlorine and total chlorine were determined using the n n diethyl 1 4 phenylenediamine sulfate method described previously usepa 1978 the aox concentration and cytotoxicities of original cbz solution and the cbz solution treated by breakpoint chlorination were determined using a micro coulometric titration method and the chinese hamster ovary cell cho exposure method respectively the samples were desalinated and concentrated using solid phase extraction columns the aox and cytotoxicity were analyzed as described previously du et al 2016 yang et al 2015 and the detailed process was listed in the supplementary material text s1 the cbz recovery factor of the solid phase extraction method was 90 9 no other halides except chlorine were present in the experimental processes thus the aox concentration was regarded as being the adsorbable organic chlorine aocl concentration radical species were analyzed using an electron spin resonance instrument esr jes fa200 japan 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 50 mm was used as the spin trap for transient radical species 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of cbz by breakpoint chlorination the cbz degradation kinetics by chlorination chloramination and breakpoint chlorination are shown in fig 1 a neglected cbz was eliminated by chlorination and chloramines monochloramine cl n 0 98 and dichloramine cl n 1 31 after 5 min it has previously been found that cbz is recalcitrant to chlorine with a half life 52 d at neutral conditions soufan et al 2013 while the cbz degradation of cbz by chloramination was not ever reported however remarkable cbz was eliminated by breakpoint chlorination at cl n 1 18 and cl n 1 6 the eliminations being 18 3 and 67 4 respectively after 5 min the cbz elimination at 5 min by breakpoint chlorination was significantly affected by the cl n ratio which was related to the variations of total chlorine residual and chlorine species as shown in fig 1 b in this study the ammonia was 142 9 μm n and the chlorine dose ranged from 0 to 563 8 μm as the cl n ratio increased from 1 0 to 1 6 breakpoint the concentration of chloramines was maximum at cl n 1 0 and decreased to a minimum by being oxidized to nitrogen and nitrate at breakpoint accordingly the cbz elimination remarkably increased from 9 7 to 67 4 with increasing cl n from 1 0 to 1 6 the cbz elimination gradually decreased to 50 0 as cl n was further increased to 4 0 at which case most of the chloramines were oxidized and free chlorine would recur being similar to the promotion on the cbz degradation breakpoint chlorination has also been reported to enhance the oxidation processes responsible for the nitrogenous dbps ndbps formation schreiber and mitch 2007 it has previously been proposed that some transient intermediates of nitrogen hydroxide and its derivatives e g peroxylnitrite and oh are responsible for the promoting oxidation processes schreiber and mitch 2007 wei and morris 1974 thus some reactive species were proposed to be generated and contribute to the cbz degradation the generated reactive species would have been related to the decay of chloramines at cl n 1 0 3 2 effects of solution ph it has been reported that the solution ph affects the chloramines reactions at breakpoint chlorination jafvert and valentine 1987 in this study the influence of ph on the degradation kinetics of cbz by breakpoint chlorination was studied as shown in fig 2 a it was found that the cbz degradation rate was highest at ph 7 0 medium at ph 5 5 and lowest at ph 9 5 the cbz degraded by breakpoint chlorination cl n 1 6 reached to a similar equilibrium at all ph values being approximately 72 after the reaction times of 30 10 and 60 min for ph 5 5 7 0 and 9 5 respectively with the breakpoint chlorination reactions completed the total chloramines residual became stable and the cbz elimination reached maximum after the above reaction times thus the influence of ph on the total chlorine residual and the cbz elimination at different cl n ratios were studied after the reaction times of 30 10 and 60 min for ph 5 5 7 0 and 9 5 respectively as shown in fig 2 b as cl n increased from 0 to 1 37 1 0 and 0 82 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 9 5 respectively the chloramine concentrations equaling to the total chlorine residuals increased from 0 to maximums being 200 162 and 151 μm cl2 respectively as cl n further increased to breakpoint cl n 1 6 the chloramine concentrations decreased to minimums at all ph values correspondingly the cbz eliminations increased from 0 to 26 4 16 5 and 15 7 as the cl n increased from 0 to 1 37 1 0 and 0 82 at ph 5 5 ph 7 0 and ph 9 5 respectively and the cbz eliminations reached maximums at cl n 1 6 at all ph values being 75 85 the chloramines e g nh2cl and nhcl2 formation rates and decomposition rates at acidic or basic conditions were lower than that at neutral condition saunier and selleck 1979 which would help to understand the influence of ph on the cbz degradation kinetics by breakpoint chlorination cl n 1 6 nh2cl is mainly generated from hocl reacting with nh3 table s1 reaction 1 because the dissociations constant pka of hocl and nh3 are 7 5 and 9 2 respectively the nh2cl formation rate at neutral ph would be 23 times higher than that at ph 5 5 and similar to that at ph 9 5 qiang and adams 2004 furthermore nhcl2 is mainly generated via the reaction between hocl and nh2cl table s1 reaction 2 driss et al 2014 qiang and adams 2004 resulting in that nhcl2 formation at neutral ph would be 0 76 times and 76 times as fast as those at ph 5 5 and ph 9 5 respectively both nh2cl and nhcl2 formation rates at neutral ph are fast accelerating the reaction 2 and reaction 5 in table s1 and leading to the fast decompositions of chloramines and the fast generation of reactive species as a result the cbz degradation kinetics was observed to be faster at neutral ph than those at basic or acidic conditions the influence of ph on the cbz elimination at cl n ratios of 0 82 1 6 were related to the stabilities of chloramines at different ph values at cl n ratios of 0 82 1 6 the total chlorine residual became stable after 30 10 and 60 min at ph 5 5 7 0 and 9 5 respectively but the total chlorine residual concentration equaling to the chloramine concentrations was highest at ph 5 5 medium at ph 7 0 and lowest at ph 9 5 wei and morris 1974 found that the nhcl2 concertation would be higher at acidic condition than that at basic condition because nhcl2 may react with hydroxyl anion reaction 5 table s1 as results more nhcl2 was accumulated at the cl n ratios of 0 82 1 37 at ph 5 5 while more nhcl2 decomposed into other products at ph 9 5 thus at a specific cl n ratio the decomposed chloramines were therefore higher in basic solution than in neutral or acidic solutions resulting in higher cbz elimination at basic condition than at acidic solution the influence of ph on chloramine reactions leading to that the cbz elimination was affected could be reflected by the positive relationships between decomposed chloramine maximum chloramine observed chloramine and cbz elimination as shown in fig 2 c however further research will be required to identify the mechanisms influencing the process related to the generation of reactive species 3 3 roles of radical species 3 3 1 effects of tbuoh and n2 purging the total chlorine residuals and cbz eliminations at different cl n ratios with and without the scavenger tbuoh presence 10 mm and with and without n2 purging dissolved oxygen 1 0 mg l are shown in fig 3 though radical species reactions were quenched by the scavengers the total chlorine residual curves were not affected the chloramines reactions include radical ways and non radical ways the observed results indicated that the main reactions responsible for the chloramines formation and decomposition were not affected such as reactions 5 10 in table s1 however cbz elimination was strongly inhibited by tbuoh presenting and moderately inhibited by n2 purging the inhibition ratios being 87 7 and 27 8 at breakpoint cl n 1 6 respectively scavenger of tbuoh can react with oh and cl with the second order rate constants of 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 and 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 respectively fang et al 2014 nitroxyl radical can also be quenched by tbuoh de nooy et al 1995 the inhibitive effect of tbuoh on the cbz elimination suggested that radical species such as oh nitroxyl radicals and reactive chlorine species of cl etc made important contributions kemper et al 2010 especially the contributions of radicals that can be quenched by tbuoh but not by n2 purging were significant schreiber and mitch 2007 proposed that noh generated through the decomposition of nhcl2 table s1 reaction 5 can react with dissolved oxygen and generate peroxynitrous acid onooh pka 6 8 peroxynitrous acid is unstable and isomerizes to form nitric acid nitrogen dioxide radicals no2 and hydroxyl radicals oh as shown in eqs 1 and 2 the inhibitive effect of n2 purging suggested that the derivatives of noh reacting with oxygen contributed partly to the elimination of cbz 1 noh o 2 onooh 2 3 3 2 electron spin resonance spectra the esr spectra acquired from the chlorination chloramination and breakpoint chlorination are shown in fig 4 radicals were not observed in the processes of chlorination and chloramination but significant radical signals were observed in the breakpoint chlorination process the radical signals were stronger when the cl n ratio was closer to breakpoint cl n 1 6 than at other cl n ratios similar results were found in a previous study ratnayake bandara et al 1992 and the signal was attributed to the 2 n chloroimino 5 5 dimethylpyrrolidine l oxyl generated via the reaction between the nitroxyl radical and dmpo shi et al 1994 observed similar electron spin resonance spectra and attributed it to the signals of 5 5 dimethylpyrrolidine 2 oxyl generated via the reaction between peroxynitrite and dmpo however a dmpo oh signal generated from oh and dmpo was not observed because the oh concentration was too low to generate dmpo oh or the generated dmpo oh at a low concentration was destroyed by nitroxyl radicals or peroxynitrite previous studies suggested that oh was generated by breakpoint chlorination in the presence of o2 therefore the insignificant signal of oh based on the esr result was in accordance with the moderate influences of n2 purging on the cbz elimination few studies of the esr spectra of radical species in breakpoint chlorination processes have been performed but we speculate that oh plays a minor role in breakpoint chlorination process and that the generation of other reactive species e g nitroxyl radicals or peroxynitrite could be more important 3 3 3 pseudo steady state of breakpoint chlorination in a microinjection system microinjection experiments were performed to quantitatively examine the roles of radical species responsible for cbz elimination by breakpoint chlorination and the results are shown in fig 5 in the microinjection system and in the presence of cbz and nb chlorine and ammonia were injected into the reaction solution continually to achieve a pseudo steady state of breakpoint chlorination as shown in fig s1 the degradation of cbz and nb followed pseudo first order kinetics after a reaction time of 2 min indicating that steady state was achieved and the transient radical species concentrations remained constant after 2 min the reaction between nb and oh is well known and has a second order rate constant of 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 but the reactions between nb and other unknown radical species generated by breakpoint chlorination is unclear we assumed that nb was eliminated through volatilization and oh oxidation eq 3 and that cbz was eliminated through oh oxidation and oxidation by other radical species eq 4 3 4 in eqs 3 and 4 nb and cbz are the nb and cbz concentrations in m respectively oh and ri are the steady state concentrations in m of oh and other radicals respectively k vol nb is the pseudo first order kinetic constant for nb volatilization calculated to be 9 3 10 5 s 1 from the chlorination experiment results k oh nb is the second order rate constant for the reaction between oh and nb 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 k oh cbz is the second order rate constant for the reaction between oh and cbz 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 mcdowell et al 2005 k app nb and k app cbz are the apparent pseudo first order kinetic constants for nb 4 3 10 4 s 1 and cbz 2 47 10 3 s 1 by breakpoint chlorination in the microinjection system respectively and k ri cbz is the second order rate constant for the reactions between cbz and other radicals in m 1 s 1 therefore in the microinjection system and after a reaction time of 2 min oh can be calculated using k app nb k vol nb k oh nb and the proportion of cbz eliminated through oh oxidation can be calculated to be 23 7 from k oh cbz oh k app cbz because the nb degradation via other radicals were neglected based on the presumption oh may be overestimated however the equation still gives a general sense of the maximum oh contribution 23 7 to cbz degradation by breakpoint chlorination the semi quantitative result for the oh contribution agrees with the effect of de oxygenation n2 purging on the elimination of cbz in summary cbz elimination by breakpoint chlorination was attributed to the formation of oh and other unidentified radical species contributing about 23 7 and 76 3 respectively of the total amount of cbz eliminated 3 4 adsorbable organic halogen and cytotoxicity evaluation the chlorine treated solutions may induce the formation of aocl and the increase of relative toxicities xue et al 2016 the aocl and cho cell cytotoxicity were measured for the breakpoint chlorination of cbz as shown in fig 6 a although less than 9 7 of the cbz was eliminated at cl n ratios 1 0 the aocl concentration increased to 8 19 μg l and cytotoxicity increased to 2 5 μg phenol l increasing the cl n ratio from 1 0 to 1 6 caused the remarkable cbz elimination to 67 4 and the aocl concentration and cytotoxicity increased to 9 77 μg l and 4 05 μg phenol l respectively gradual increases in the aocl concentration and cytotoxicity were also observed in breakpoint chlorination of reclaimed water du et al 2016 excess chlorine at cl n ratios 1 6 increased the aocl concentration to 11 03 μg l and cytotoxicity to 5 39 μg phenol l because of the inert reactivity of cbz to chlorine the gradual increase of aocl and cytotoxicity should be resulted from the reaction between chlorine and the intermediates the relationship between the aocl concentration and cytotoxicity is shown in fig 6 b in general the cytotoxicity of the breakpoint chlorinated cbz solutions increased linearly as the aocl concentration increased r 2 0 853 this important contribution of aocl to cytotoxicity was also found by du et al 2016 the dbps speciation of the aocl could address the cytotoxicity evaluation in breakpoint chlorination of cbz and need further studies what s more the aocl concentration did not explain all of the cytotoxicity indicating that non chlorine substituted dbps e g ndbps may also induce cytotoxicity limited to the analytical methods the total ndbp concentration can not be completely measured in future studies it would be interesting to investigate ndbp formation and to investigate the relationship between cytotoxicity and the ndbp concentration in the breakpoint chlorination of micropollutants 4 conclusions in this study we novelly found that chlorine and chloramine refractory cbz was remarkably removed by breakpoint chlorination the solution ph was found to have an essential influence on the chloramines generation and decomposition rates and then affect the cbz degradation rate and eliminations at different cl n ratios the radical species study results indicated that reactive species e g noh oh and nitroxyl generating from chloramines decomposition made important contributions to the oxidation processes the oh radical appeared to contribute 23 7 of the total amount of cbz eliminated but the contributions of other radical species need to be studied further side effects of the aocl formation and cytotoxicity were found in the breakpoint chlorination of cbz and these should be taken into consideration in general the promoted oxidation performance of breakpoint chlorination on cbz removal indicated the future application for drinking water and reclaimed water treatment where some oxidant and bio refractory pollutant can be efficiently removed simultaneously with the ammonia removal acknowledgements this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china

19833,breakpoint chlorination can be commonly observed in the chlorination of water treatments when ammonia is present in this study it was found that breakpoint chlorination can remarkably eliminate a ubiquitous and chlorine refractory micropollutant carbamazepine cbz with the removal of 72 at neutral condition at neutral ph low cbz elimination was observed at a chlorine ammonia molar ratio cl n of 1 0 and higher cbz elimination was observed as cl n ratio increased from 1 0 to 1 6 breakpoint indicating that cbz elimination was closely related to the generation and decomposition of chloramines the chloramines generation and decomposition rates were affected by the ph so that the cbz elimination rate was highest at ph 7 0 and lower in acidic and basic solutions ph 5 5 and ph 9 5 respectively the cbz elimination at ph 7 0 was 72 4 after 10 min of breakpoint chlorination while reaction times about 30 min and 60 min were required to achieve the same elimination at ph 5 5 and ph 9 5 respectively breakpoint chlorination of cbz was strongly suppressed by radical scavenger tbuoh and moderately suppressed by n2 purging the inhibiting ratios being 87 7 and 27 8 at breakpoint respectively electron spin resonance experiments suggested that unidentified radicals were generated by breakpoint chlorination the oh and unidentified radical species contributions to cbz elimination were 23 7 and 76 3 respectively when a pseudo steady state breakpoint chlorination was performed in a microinjection system with nitrobenzene as oh probe although cbz were efficiently eliminated breakpoint chlorination of cbz generated adsorbable organic chlorine the cytotoxicity of the cbz solution was therefore increased by breakpoint chlorination suggesting that biological risk caused by the breakpoint chlorination of micropollutants should be taken into consideration keywords breakpoint chlorination carbamazepine radical species adsorbable organic halide cytotoxicity 1 introduction

chlorination can also efficiently decompose micropollutants such as estrogenic compounds endocrine disruptors antibiotics uv filters and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs abdallah et al 2015 gao et al 2016 hu et al 2003 negreira et al 2015 microorganism inactivation and micropollutant decomposition by chlorination are affected by many factors including the operational steps one or two steps chlorine addition the chlorine dose the contact time and the aquatic matrices acero et al 2013 cheng et al 2015 li et al 2017b pang et al 2016 ammonia is one of the aquatic matrices affecting the performance of chlorination because it allows chlorine to be transformed into chloramines including monochloramine nh2cl dichloramine nhcl2 and trichloramine ncl3 the total chlorine residual and chlorine species vary as the chlorine to ammonia molar ratio cl n varies which is widely known as breakpoint chlorination breakpoint chlorination occurs in the chlorination of wastewater effluent and reclaimed water where the ammonia nitrogen is approximately 0 5 1 mg l and chlorine dosage is approximately 1 10 mg l krasner et al 2009 sun et al 2016 some interesting oxidation processes have been observed in the process of breakpoint chlorination including the oxidation of ammonia and the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps under circumneutral conditions and at cl n 1 0 the total chlorine residual equals the chloramines concentration and chloramines concentration reaches a maximum at cl n 1 5 to 1 7 breakpoint ammonia is oxidized to nitrogen and nitrate and the total chlorine residual reaches a minimum jafvert and valentine 1992 the formation of dbps is strongly related to breakpoint chlorination shang et al 2000 and schreiber and mitch 2007 found that the generation of nitrogenous dbps such as cyanogen chloride and n nitrosodimethylamine ndma was strongly promoted at breakpoint while charrois and hrudey 2007 found that the ndma reached a maximum at cl n 1 0 the oxidation mechanism of breakpoint chlorination has attracted lots of interests and some of the reactions were listed in table s1 in supplementary material some oxidative species were reported to be generated by breakpoint chlorination for instance nitrogen hydroxide noh were suggested as a transient reactive intermediate responsible for the oxidation of ammonia wei and morris 1974 peroxynitrite and oh were probably generated near breakpoint by the breakpoint chlorination of dimethylamine schreiber and mitch 2007 it has also been suggested that amine radicals single oxygen radicals and superoxide are probably generated by breakpoint chlorination buxton et al 1988 kirsch et al 2006 despite many studies having been performed the mechanisms involved in breakpoint chlorination are still poorly understood both qualitatively and quantitatively driss and bouhelassa 2014 shen 2014 what s more the elimination transformation and environmental fates of recalcitrant micropollutants in the process of breakpoint chlorination have not previously been investigated previous investigations have studied the kinetics byproducts and influencing factors of chlorination of micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products abdallah et al 2015 herbicides tawk et al 2015 and food additives li et al 2017a but few information of the chlorine refractory micropollutants has been reported in breakpoint chlorination process to the best of our knowledge few studies of the oxidation of micropollutants by breakpoint chlorination have been published carbamazepine cbz an antiepileptic drug is one of the most ubiquitous micropollutants in aquatic systems mohapatra et al 2014 the molecular formula of c15h12n2o and chemical structure are shown in fig s1 cbz usually exists as the protonated form in the groundwater and wastewater with the pka of 13 9 cbz is recalcitrant to biodegradation resistant to chlorination and unsusceptible to photolysis clara et al 2004 de laurentiis et al 2012 soufan et al 2013 cbz is therefore persistent and is found in the treated wastewater effluent reclaimed water and surface water it has previously been suggested that uv uv h2o2 uv chlorine or uv s2o8 2 or ozone driven advanced oxidation processes generating radical species such as oh cl and so4 were efficient for cbz elimination deng et al 2013 mcdowell et al 2005 wang et al 2016 however the breakpoint chlorination of cbz in water treatments has not been studied the aim of this study was to investigate the elimination of cbz by breakpoint chlorination we studied the cbz degradation kinetics by breakpoint chlorination at different cl n ratios the influencing factors and roles of reactive species the chlorine substituted dbps and the cytotoxicity of the cbz solution generated by breakpoint chlorination were also investigated 2 materials and experiments 2 1 materials ammonia chloride 99 pure cbz 98 pure and sodium hypochlorite solution containing 10 active chlorine were obtained from j k scientific beijing china high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade nitrobenzene nb tert butanol tbuoh and formic acid were obtained from aladdin industrial corporation beijing china hplc grade organic solvents methanol and acetonitrile were obtained from j t baker through avantor beijing china analytical grade sodium hydroxide and sodium dihydrogen phosphate were obtained from guangfu fine chemical research institute tianjin china all solutions were prepared using ultrapure water 18 25 mω cm produced by a milli q purification system 2 2 experimental procedures experiments involving chlorination and chloramination of cbz were conducted by spiking chlorine and chloramine into cbz solutions respectively the chloramine was prepared 20 min before chloramination experiments by mixing chlorine and ammonia at cl n 0 98 and 1 31 resulting in the total chloramines of 238 and 115 μm for chloramination experiments respectively breakpoint chlorination experiments were conducted by spiking specified amounts of chlorine into a mixture of cbz 8 5 μm and ammonia 142 9 μm n giving chlorine dose of 0 563 8 μm in all the experiments the solution ph was buffered with 20 mm nah2po4 and adjusted to required ph by adding 4 m naoh aliquots sampled at specified times were analyzed for cbz concentration total chlorine adsorbable organic halide aox and cytotoxicity the chlorine residual was quenched by 3 times of stoichiometry na2s2o3 before measuring cbz concentration while it was not quenched before measuring aox and cytotoxicity reductive quenchers of na2s2o3 or ascorbic acid were reported to affect the measurements of aox and cytotoxicity du et al 2016 scavenging experiments were conducted by adding 10 mm tbuoh to quench most radical species e g oh amidogen radicals and reactive chlorine species or n2 purging to quench aerobic reactions the de oxygen processes were conducted by continually bubbling n2 into the mixture of cbz and ammonia keeping the dissolved oxygen below 1 0 mg l the dissolved oxygen was measured using a dissolved oxygen optical probe optiox metterler toledo china the other operating conditions were the same as used in the breakpoint chlorination experiments the breakpoint chlorination happens rapidly at neutral condition resulting in that it was difficult to observe the steady state of radical species and cbz degradation kinetics in this study a microinjection system was employed to inject chlorine and ammonia simultaneously and to achieve a pseudo steady state of breakpoint chlorination as shown in fig s2 in supplementary material in such a pseudo steady state the breakpoint chlorination reactions and the generations of radical species continuously happened throughout the experiments meanwhile the competition kinetics of nb and cbz was conducted where nb was used as the oh probe the microinjection system consists of a reactor containing 50 ml cbz solution 8 5 μm buffered with 20 mm nah2po4 at ph 7 0 a magnetic stirrer and two microinjectors to allow a chlorine stock and an ammonia stock to be added at injection rates of 50 and 50 μl min respectively chlorination or breakpoint chlorination microinjection experiments were conducted by injecting chlorine stock only or chlorine and ammonia stocks simultaneously respectively the chlorine stock and ammonia stock concentration were 113 mm cl2 and 28 6 mm n respectively the final chlorine dose and ammonia dose after an injection time of 10 min were 1130 μm cl2 and 286 μm n respectively and the cl n was 3 90 higher than breakpoint aliquots were collected at specified times for cbz and nb determinations 2 3 analytical methods the cbz and nb concentrations were determined using a hplc coupling with diode array detectors lc 20 at shimadzu kyoto japan separation was achieved using an ods c18 column 150 4 2 mm 5 μm particle size j k scientific shanghai china the mobile phases for cbz analysis were methanol and 10 mm phosphate with 0 1 formic acid and the flow rate was 1 ml min at a constant volume ratio of 60 40 the mobile phases for nb analysis were acetonitrile and 10 mm phosphate with 0 1 formic acid and the flow rate was 1 ml min at a constant volume ratio of 40 60 the injection volume was 20 μl free chlorine and total chlorine were determined using the n n diethyl 1 4 phenylenediamine sulfate method described previously usepa 1978 the aox concentration and cytotoxicities of original cbz solution and the cbz solution treated by breakpoint chlorination were determined using a micro coulometric titration method and the chinese hamster ovary cell cho exposure method respectively the samples were desalinated and concentrated using solid phase extraction columns the aox and cytotoxicity were analyzed as described previously du et al 2016 yang et al 2015 and the detailed process was listed in the supplementary material text s1 the cbz recovery factor of the solid phase extraction method was 90 9 no other halides except chlorine were present in the experimental processes thus the aox concentration was regarded as being the adsorbable organic chlorine aocl concentration radical species were analyzed using an electron spin resonance instrument esr jes fa200 japan 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 50 mm was used as the spin trap for transient radical species 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of cbz by breakpoint chlorination the cbz degradation kinetics by chlorination chloramination and breakpoint chlorination are shown in fig 1 a neglected cbz was eliminated by chlorination and chloramines monochloramine cl n 0 98 and dichloramine cl n 1 31 after 5 min it has previously been found that cbz is recalcitrant to chlorine with a half life 52 d at neutral conditions soufan et al 2013 while the cbz degradation of cbz by chloramination was not ever reported however remarkable cbz was eliminated by breakpoint chlorination at cl n 1 18 and cl n 1 6 the eliminations being 18 3 and 67 4 respectively after 5 min the cbz elimination at 5 min by breakpoint chlorination was significantly affected by the cl n ratio which was related to the variations of total chlorine residual and chlorine species as shown in fig 1 b in this study the ammonia was 142 9 μm n and the chlorine dose ranged from 0 to 563 8 μm as the cl n ratio increased from 1 0 to 1 6 breakpoint the concentration of chloramines was maximum at cl n 1 0 and decreased to a minimum by being oxidized to nitrogen and nitrate at breakpoint accordingly the cbz elimination remarkably increased from 9 7 to 67 4 with increasing cl n from 1 0 to 1 6 the cbz elimination gradually decreased to 50 0 as cl n was further increased to 4 0 at which case most of the chloramines were oxidized and free chlorine would recur being similar to the promotion on the cbz degradation breakpoint chlorination has also been reported to enhance the oxidation processes responsible for the nitrogenous dbps ndbps formation schreiber and mitch 2007 it has previously been proposed that some transient intermediates of nitrogen hydroxide and its derivatives e g peroxylnitrite and oh are responsible for the promoting oxidation processes schreiber and mitch 2007 wei and morris 1974 thus some reactive species were proposed to be generated and contribute to the cbz degradation the generated reactive species would have been related to the decay of chloramines at cl n 1 0 3 2 effects of solution ph it has been reported that the solution ph affects the chloramines reactions at breakpoint chlorination jafvert and valentine 1987 in this study the influence of ph on the degradation kinetics of cbz by breakpoint chlorination was studied as shown in fig 2 a it was found that the cbz degradation rate was highest at ph 7 0 medium at ph 5 5 and lowest at ph 9 5 the cbz degraded by breakpoint chlorination cl n 1 6 reached to a similar equilibrium at all ph values being approximately 72 after the reaction times of 30 10 and 60 min for ph 5 5 7 0 and 9 5 respectively with the breakpoint chlorination reactions completed the total chloramines residual became stable and the cbz elimination reached maximum after the above reaction times thus the influence of ph on the total chlorine residual and the cbz elimination at different cl n ratios were studied after the reaction times of 30 10 and 60 min for ph 5 5 7 0 and 9 5 respectively as shown in fig 2 b as cl n increased from 0 to 1 37 1 0 and 0 82 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 9 5 respectively the chloramine concentrations equaling to the total chlorine residuals increased from 0 to maximums being 200 162 and 151 μm cl2 respectively as cl n further increased to breakpoint cl n 1 6 the chloramine concentrations decreased to minimums at all ph values correspondingly the cbz eliminations increased from 0 to 26 4 16 5 and 15 7 as the cl n increased from 0 to 1 37 1 0 and 0 82 at ph 5 5 ph 7 0 and ph 9 5 respectively and the cbz eliminations reached maximums at cl n 1 6 at all ph values being 75 85 the chloramines e g nh2cl and nhcl2 formation rates and decomposition rates at acidic or basic conditions were lower than that at neutral condition saunier and selleck 1979 which would help to understand the influence of ph on the cbz degradation kinetics by breakpoint chlorination cl n 1 6 nh2cl is mainly generated from hocl reacting with nh3 table s1 reaction 1 because the dissociations constant pka of hocl and nh3 are 7 5 and 9 2 respectively the nh2cl formation rate at neutral ph would be 23 times higher than that at ph 5 5 and similar to that at ph 9 5 qiang and adams 2004 furthermore nhcl2 is mainly generated via the reaction between hocl and nh2cl table s1 reaction 2 driss et al 2014 qiang and adams 2004 resulting in that nhcl2 formation at neutral ph would be 0 76 times and 76 times as fast as those at ph 5 5 and ph 9 5 respectively both nh2cl and nhcl2 formation rates at neutral ph are fast accelerating the reaction 2 and reaction 5 in table s1 and leading to the fast decompositions of chloramines and the fast generation of reactive species as a result the cbz degradation kinetics was observed to be faster at neutral ph than those at basic or acidic conditions the influence of ph on the cbz elimination at cl n ratios of 0 82 1 6 were related to the stabilities of chloramines at different ph values at cl n ratios of 0 82 1 6 the total chlorine residual became stable after 30 10 and 60 min at ph 5 5 7 0 and 9 5 respectively but the total chlorine residual concentration equaling to the chloramine concentrations was highest at ph 5 5 medium at ph 7 0 and lowest at ph 9 5 wei and morris 1974 found that the nhcl2 concertation would be higher at acidic condition than that at basic condition because nhcl2 may react with hydroxyl anion reaction 5 table s1 as results more nhcl2 was accumulated at the cl n ratios of 0 82 1 37 at ph 5 5 while more nhcl2 decomposed into other products at ph 9 5 thus at a specific cl n ratio the decomposed chloramines were therefore higher in basic solution than in neutral or acidic solutions resulting in higher cbz elimination at basic condition than at acidic solution the influence of ph on chloramine reactions leading to that the cbz elimination was affected could be reflected by the positive relationships between decomposed chloramine maximum chloramine observed chloramine and cbz elimination as shown in fig 2 c however further research will be required to identify the mechanisms influencing the process related to the generation of reactive species 3 3 roles of radical species 3 3 1 effects of tbuoh and n2 purging the total chlorine residuals and cbz eliminations at different cl n ratios with and without the scavenger tbuoh presence 10 mm and with and without n2 purging dissolved oxygen 1 0 mg l are shown in fig 3 though radical species reactions were quenched by the scavengers the total chlorine residual curves were not affected the chloramines reactions include radical ways and non radical ways the observed results indicated that the main reactions responsible for the chloramines formation and decomposition were not affected such as reactions 5 10 in table s1 however cbz elimination was strongly inhibited by tbuoh presenting and moderately inhibited by n2 purging the inhibition ratios being 87 7 and 27 8 at breakpoint cl n 1 6 respectively scavenger of tbuoh can react with oh and cl with the second order rate constants of 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 and 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 respectively fang et al 2014 nitroxyl radical can also be quenched by tbuoh de nooy et al 1995 the inhibitive effect of tbuoh on the cbz elimination suggested that radical species such as oh nitroxyl radicals and reactive chlorine species of cl etc made important contributions kemper et al 2010 especially the contributions of radicals that can be quenched by tbuoh but not by n2 purging were significant schreiber and mitch 2007 proposed that noh generated through the decomposition of nhcl2 table s1 reaction 5 can react with dissolved oxygen and generate peroxynitrous acid onooh pka 6 8 peroxynitrous acid is unstable and isomerizes to form nitric acid nitrogen dioxide radicals no2 and hydroxyl radicals oh as shown in eqs 1 and 2 the inhibitive effect of n2 purging suggested that the derivatives of noh reacting with oxygen contributed partly to the elimination of cbz 1 noh o 2 onooh 2 3 3 2 electron spin resonance spectra the esr spectra acquired from the chlorination chloramination and breakpoint chlorination are shown in fig 4 radicals were not observed in the processes of chlorination and chloramination but significant radical signals were observed in the breakpoint chlorination process the radical signals were stronger when the cl n ratio was closer to breakpoint cl n 1 6 than at other cl n ratios similar results were found in a previous study ratnayake bandara et al 1992 and the signal was attributed to the 2 n chloroimino 5 5 dimethylpyrrolidine l oxyl generated via the reaction between the nitroxyl radical and dmpo shi et al 1994 observed similar electron spin resonance spectra and attributed it to the signals of 5 5 dimethylpyrrolidine 2 oxyl generated via the reaction between peroxynitrite and dmpo however a dmpo oh signal generated from oh and dmpo was not observed because the oh concentration was too low to generate dmpo oh or the generated dmpo oh at a low concentration was destroyed by nitroxyl radicals or peroxynitrite previous studies suggested that oh was generated by breakpoint chlorination in the presence of o2 therefore the insignificant signal of oh based on the esr result was in accordance with the moderate influences of n2 purging on the cbz elimination few studies of the esr spectra of radical species in breakpoint chlorination processes have been performed but we speculate that oh plays a minor role in breakpoint chlorination process and that the generation of other reactive species e g nitroxyl radicals or peroxynitrite could be more important 3 3 3 pseudo steady state of breakpoint chlorination in a microinjection system microinjection experiments were performed to quantitatively examine the roles of radical species responsible for cbz elimination by breakpoint chlorination and the results are shown in fig 5 in the microinjection system and in the presence of cbz and nb chlorine and ammonia were injected into the reaction solution continually to achieve a pseudo steady state of breakpoint chlorination as shown in fig s1 the degradation of cbz and nb followed pseudo first order kinetics after a reaction time of 2 min indicating that steady state was achieved and the transient radical species concentrations remained constant after 2 min the reaction between nb and oh is well known and has a second order rate constant of 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 but the reactions between nb and other unknown radical species generated by breakpoint chlorination is unclear we assumed that nb was eliminated through volatilization and oh oxidation eq 3 and that cbz was eliminated through oh oxidation and oxidation by other radical species eq 4 3 4 in eqs 3 and 4 nb and cbz are the nb and cbz concentrations in m respectively oh and ri are the steady state concentrations in m of oh and other radicals respectively k vol nb is the pseudo first order kinetic constant for nb volatilization calculated to be 9 3 10 5 s 1 from the chlorination experiment results k oh nb is the second order rate constant for the reaction between oh and nb 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 k oh cbz is the second order rate constant for the reaction between oh and cbz 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 mcdowell et al 2005 k app nb and k app cbz are the apparent pseudo first order kinetic constants for nb 4 3 10 4 s 1 and cbz 2 47 10 3 s 1 by breakpoint chlorination in the microinjection system respectively and k ri cbz is the second order rate constant for the reactions between cbz and other radicals in m 1 s 1 therefore in the microinjection system and after a reaction time of 2 min oh can be calculated using k app nb k vol nb k oh nb and the proportion of cbz eliminated through oh oxidation can be calculated to be 23 7 from k oh cbz oh k app cbz because the nb degradation via other radicals were neglected based on the presumption oh may be overestimated however the equation still gives a general sense of the maximum oh contribution 23 7 to cbz degradation by breakpoint chlorination the semi quantitative result for the oh contribution agrees with the effect of de oxygenation n2 purging on the elimination of cbz in summary cbz elimination by breakpoint chlorination was attributed to the formation of oh and other unidentified radical species contributing about 23 7 and 76 3 respectively of the total amount of cbz eliminated 3 4 adsorbable organic halogen and cytotoxicity evaluation the chlorine treated solutions may induce the formation of aocl and the increase of relative toxicities xue et al 2016 the aocl and cho cell cytotoxicity were measured for the breakpoint chlorination of cbz as shown in fig 6 a although less than 9 7 of the cbz was eliminated at cl n ratios 1 0 the aocl concentration increased to 8 19 μg l and cytotoxicity increased to 2 5 μg phenol l increasing the cl n ratio from 1 0 to 1 6 caused the remarkable cbz elimination to 67 4 and the aocl concentration and cytotoxicity increased to 9 77 μg l and 4 05 μg phenol l respectively gradual increases in the aocl concentration and cytotoxicity were also observed in breakpoint chlorination of reclaimed water du et al 2016 excess chlorine at cl n ratios 1 6 increased the aocl concentration to 11 03 μg l and cytotoxicity to 5 39 μg phenol l because of the inert reactivity of cbz to chlorine the gradual increase of aocl and cytotoxicity should be resulted from the reaction between chlorine and the intermediates the relationship between the aocl concentration and cytotoxicity is shown in fig 6 b in general the cytotoxicity of the breakpoint chlorinated cbz solutions increased linearly as the aocl concentration increased r 2 0 853 this important contribution of aocl to cytotoxicity was also found by du et al 2016 the dbps speciation of the aocl could address the cytotoxicity evaluation in breakpoint chlorination of cbz and need further studies what s more the aocl concentration did not explain all of the cytotoxicity indicating that non chlorine substituted dbps e g ndbps may also induce cytotoxicity limited to the analytical methods the total ndbp concentration can not be completely measured in future studies it would be interesting to investigate ndbp formation and to investigate the relationship between cytotoxicity and the ndbp concentration in the breakpoint chlorination of micropollutants 4 conclusions in this study we novelly found that chlorine and chloramine refractory cbz was remarkably removed by breakpoint chlorination the solution ph was found to have an essential influence on the chloramines generation and decomposition rates and then affect the cbz degradation rate and eliminations at different cl n ratios the radical species study results indicated that reactive species e g noh oh and nitroxyl generating from chloramines decomposition made important contributions to the oxidation processes the oh radical appeared to contribute 23 7 of the total amount of cbz eliminated but the contributions of other radical species need to be studied further side effects of the aocl formation and cytotoxicity were found in the breakpoint chlorination of cbz and these should be taken into consideration in general the promoted oxidation performance of breakpoint chlorination on cbz removal indicated the future application for drinking water and reclaimed water treatment where some oxidant and bio refractory pollutant can be efficiently removed simultaneously with the ammonia removal acknowledgements this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china

19834,characteristics of extracellular polymeric substances eps in activated sludge strongly depend on wastewater substrates proteinaceous substrates pros present in heterogeneous polymeric form are intrinsic and important parts of wastewater substrates for microorganisms in activated sludge systems however correlations between pros and characteristics of eps are scarce this study systematically explored the impacts of monomeric mono low polymeric lop and high polymeric hip pros on compositions and functional groups of eps in activated sludge the results showed that the change of polymerization degree of pros significantly altered the composition of eps compared to epsmono pros the proportion of proteins in epslop pros and epship pros increased by 12 8 and 27 7 respectively while that of polysaccharides decreased by 22 9 and 63 6 respectively moreover the proportion of humic compounds in epslop pros and epship pros were 6 and 16 fold higher than that in epsmono pros respectively the accumulation of humic compounds in eps increased the unsaturation degree of eps molecules and thereby reduced the energy requirement for electrons transition of amide bonds and aromatic groups size exclusion chromatography sec analyses detected more molecular clusters in epship pros indicating more complex composition of eps in hip pros fed activated sludge spectroscopic characterization revealed the dominance of hydrocarbon protein polysaccharide and aromatic associated bonds in all three eps nevertheless with the increase of polymerization degree of pros the protein associated bonds such as conh co nc nh increased while the polysaccharide associated bonds such as coc coh ocoh decreased this paper paves a path to understand the role of pros in affecting the production and characteristics of eps in biological wastewater treatment systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge extracellular polymeric substances proteinaceous substrate size exclusion chromatography fourier transform infrared spectroscopy x ray photoelectron spectroscopy 1 introduction extracellular polymeric substances eps are important in biological wastewater treatment systems because they are ubiquitously present and usually influence the treatment performance of systems sheng et al 2010 ni and yu 2012 as a key structural material of microbial aggregates the characteristics of eps largely determine the structure surface charge hydrophobicity flocculability settleability dewaterability adsorption ability of microbial aggregates in biological wastewater treatment systems liu and fang 2003 li and yang 2007 badireddy et al 2010 sheng et al 2010 kavitha et al 2014 2015 zhou et al 2014 the eps matrix of microbial aggregates also contributes to the retention accumulation and stabilization of associated exoenzymes that used for substrate degradation wingender et al 1999 cadoret et al 2002 in addition of special contemporary importance eps have been reported as important influential foulants in membrane bioreactors mbr and eps with different characteristics brought different fouling behaviors banu et al 2009 2011 meng et al 2009 wang et al 2009 lin et al 2014 chen et al 2017 hence in depth research of those exopolymers in microbial aggregates is of high importance not only to understand and control the microbial aggregations effluent qualities and process dynamics of biological wastewater treatment systems but also to mitigate or even overcome the barrier of biofouling in mbr systems since eps originate from metabolism or lysis of microorganisms and the wastewater itself the characteristics of eps are sensitive to or even governed by the operational conditions of biological wastewater treatment systems sheng et al 2010 one of the most considerable concerns for scientists or practitioners who investigate or design biological wastewater treatment systems is the impacts of wastewater constituents on eps many evidences have proved that different substrates in wastewater have significant effects on microbial communities and their metabolisms and thereby influence their production of eps sponza 2003 investigated the effects of different wastewater industrial or municipal on the formation of eps in continuous fed completely stirred tank reactor and concluded that eps compositions depend more on substrate type rather than on other operating conditions sheng et al 2006 found that rhodopseudomonas acidophila would produce more eps using benzoate as the substrate than using acetate propionate or butyrate li and yang 2007 reported that activated sludge fed with glucose has more eps production than that fed with acetate wang et al 2014b also found significantly different physicochemical properties of eps between sweet potato starch and glucose fed activated sludge previous studies about correlation between inlet substrate and eps have mostly focused on small molecular weight mw constituents such as acetate propionate butyrate glucose phenol benzoate etc except few studies on starch sheng et al 2006 li and yang 2007 ye et al 2011 wang et al 2014b however the metabolizing behaviors of these simple substrates may not accurately reflect the complex situations in actual biological wastewater treatment systems where the wastewater substrates for microorganisms consist of a much broad range of molecules and macromolecules levine et al 1991 the compositions of substrate in wastewater vary considerably and are site specific but typically contain 40 60 proteins 25 50 carbohydrate and 10 lipids metcalf and eddy 2003 proteinaceous organic matters are considered as an intrinsic and important part of substrates for microorganisms in biological wastewater treatment systems eliosov and argaman 1995 confer and logan 1997a most of proteinaceous substrates pros in wastewater are present in heterogeneous polymeric forms such as particulate proteins polypeptides lipoproteins glycoproteins etc confer et al 1995 found that more than 75 of total amino acids in a wastewater are contained in compounds larger than 1000 atomic mass units these macromolecular pros have to be depolymerized by exoenzymes to monomers or oligomers before becoming available for microorganisms confer and logan 1997a mosquera corral et al 2003 since eps matrix of microbial aggregates is an important accommodation of extracellular hydrolysis process flemming and wingender 2010 the presence of high content polymeric pros in wastewater is more likely to affect the production and characteristics of eps in microbial aggregates studies involved in the polymeric substrates in wastewater have been reported continuously during the last two decades nevertheless most of these researches concentrated on the degradation mechanism of polymeric substrates eliosov and argaman 1995 confer and logan 1997a 1997b mosquera corral et al 2003 karahan et al 2005 dimock and morgenroth 2006 as well as the influences of polymeric substrates on microfauna populations puigagut et al 2007 sludge granulation de kreuk et al 2010 wagner et al 2015 carbon and energy footprint of wastewater treatment process gori et al 2011 sludge settleability martins et al 2011 wang et al 2013 and nutrient removal jabari et al 2016 wang et al 2017 few researches have investigated the impacts of polymeric substrates on the nature of eps wang et al 2014b took sweet potato starch as the proxy to study the effects of polysaccharides on properties of eps in activated sludge however the polysaccharides may not comprehensively reflect the complex macromolecules in actual wastewater previous research also found that the availability of azocasein protein and amylose polysaccharide to exoenzymes in dispersed activated sludge were different cadoret et al 2002 therefore considering the importance and the broad mw range of pros in wastewater the present work aims to identify the impacts of monomeric mono low polymeric lop and high polymeric hip pros on chemical compositions and functional groups of eps in biological wastewater treatment systems the eps were characterized using combined methods of size exclusion chromatography sec ultraviolet visible uv vis adsorption spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps techniques to the best of our knowledge these correlations between pros and nature of eps have not been thoroughly studied yet filling this research gap can permit us to better understand the importance of pros in determining the

fragmentized boiled egg white bew with a mean representative diameter of 47 94 3 20 μm fig s1 were used as the model substrates of mono pros lop pros and hip pros respectively the corresponding sbrs were named as sbrmono pros sbrlop pros and sbrhip pros respectively aspartic acid is common monomeric units of protein peptone is a mixture of soluble low polymeric polypeptide formed by partial hydrolysis of protein fragmentized boiled egg white is typical particulate high polymeric protein therefore they well represent the monomer low polymeric and high polymeric proteinaceous substrates the selection was also based on the consideration that these three can be easily acquired except for the substrate type all other components in synthetic wastewater were identical the influent was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c to prevent the degradation or hydrolysis of substrates key operational parameters of sbrs are shown in table 1 detailed configurations and operational cycles of sbrs were identical to wang et al 2017 after all the sbrs reached steady state the eps of activated sludge in each sbr were extracted for characterization the corresponding eps in sbrmono pros sbrlop pros and sbrhip pros were named as epsmono pros epslop pros and epship pros respectively 2 2 eps extraction cation exchange resin cer method was used for extraction of total bound eps the cer method was selected because it was found to superior to other methods in terms of yield and minimal disruption of eps frølund et al 1996 the eps was not further classified as loosely bound eps and tightly bound eps as these two terms are experimentally defined and inconsistent results regarding this classification were often obtained in previous studies wang et al 2014a the detailed procedures of this extraction method could be found elsewhere frølund et al 1996 wang et al 2014b and the cer used in this study was dower marathon c 20 50 mesh in na form fluka 91973 total bound eps was quantified by dissolved organic carbon doc the major components of eps including proteins polysaccharides and humic compounds were quantified separately by chemical colorimetric methods 2 3 analytical methods all the routine analysis of sbrs including chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were performed according to the standard methods apha 1998 all water samples used for routine analysis were obtained by centrifuging the mixed liquor at 8000 g the dissolved oxygen do and ph were determined by a dissolved oxygen meter hi9146 hanna italy and ph meter hi98191 hanna italy respectively the particle size distribution of fragmentized bew was measured with a laser particle size analyzer ls230 svm beckman usa over a 0 4 2000 μm size range the determination of protease activity was performed according to the procedures described in li and chróst 2006 with respect to the composition analysis of eps the proteins and humic compounds were determined by modified lowry method frølund et al 1996 and bovine serum albumin v900933 vetec sigma aldrich and humic acid 53680 sigma aldrich were used as the standards the polysaccharides was measured by phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 and glucose v900392 vetec sigma aldrich was selected as the standard the total organic matter exist in eps was quantified by doc using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l cpn shimadzu japan the mw distribution of eps was determined by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system 1260 infinity ii agilent technologies inc us equipped with an uv detector and a sec column bio sec 5 300 å 7 8 300 mm agilent technologies inc us sodium phosphate 10020418 sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china solution 150 mm ph 7 0 was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the injection volume of sample was 10 μl and the column temperature was set at 25 c the detection was carried out at wavelength of 210 nm the sec column was calibrated by standard proteins with molecular mass of 0 137 13 7 44 3 150 670 kda protein standard mix 15 600 kda 69385 sigma aldrich uv vis absorption spectrum of eps was collected with an automatic scanning uv vis spectrophotometer tu 1810 beijing purkinje general instrument co ltd china at 200 800 nm ftir spectrum of freeze dried eps was obtained using a ftir spectrometer nicolet 6700 thermo scientific co usa with resolution of 4 cm 1 and scan range of 400 4000 cm 1 the freeze drying of eps were conducted by a lyophilizer fd 1a 50 beijing boyikang

for determining the speciation of the components a software package xps peak was used to fit the xps spectra peaks 3 results and discussion 3 1 general observations the sbrs generally reached steady state 1 month after inoculation fig 1 the mlss of sbrmono pros sbrlop pros and sbrhip pros in steady state were 2140 330 3124 505 and 2513 405 mg l 1 respectively despite that the three sbrs had same sludge retention time srt it suggests that the variation of substrates resulted in different growth yields of biomass similarly mosquera corral et al 2003 found that the biomass yield on aspartic acid is only half of that on soy proteins in a biofilm airlift suspension reactor in spite of this the mlvss mlss ratio in all three sbrs gradually increased from 60 at the beginning of inoculation to 90 at the steady state fig 1 suggesting the well enrichment of biomass during the acclimation period the cycle behaviors of cod nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in bulk liquid of the three sbrs were examined in steady state the cycle behavior of po4 3 p was not determined since the sbrs in this experiment did not involve enhanced biological phosphorus removal and different degradation profiles of these components in sbrs were observed figs s2 and s3 since polypeptides and polysaccharides with lesser than six or seven monomeric units approximately 1000 da can transport across bacterial cell wall and be assimilated directly by bacteria law 1980 confer and logan 1997a aspartic acid as a mono pros with mw of 133 da could be taken up directly by bacteria therefore the degradation of aspartic acid was relatively fast compared to the other two polymeric pros and the cod concentration in bulk liquid of sbrmono pros sharply decreased from 200 mg l 1 to lower than 50 mg l 1 within 5 min of cycle time fig s2 soya peptone was a mixture of soluble low polymeric polypeptides formed by partial hydrolysis of soya proteins taking up of soya peptone requires an additional hydrolysis process by bacteria therefore it took 30 min for sbrlop pros to decrease bulk liquid cod from 200 mg l 1 to lower than 50 mg l 1 fig s2 as for sbrhip pros the profile of cod in bulk liquid was lower than 50 mg l 1 throughout the cycle time fig s2 this is because the fragmentized bew were in particulate form and their hydrolysis should be much more difficult than soluble soya peptone dimock and morgenroth 2006 they could be trapped by activated sludge once they were fed into the reactor and their hydrolysis mainly occurred within the activated sludge flocs since hydrolysis is widely considered as the rate limiting step hydrolytic products monomers or oligomers were consumed at a higher rate than they were produced which likely caused no introduction of soluble hydrolytic products into the bulk liquid martins et al 2011 this explains the stable low level cod in bulk liquid of sbrhip pros the cycle behaviors of nitrogen demonstrated that the degradation of pros was accompanied by typical ammonification and nitrification processes fig s3 it is noteworthy that the increase of polymerization degree of pros reduced the rate of ammonification as well as the release of ammonia fig s3 a and thereby weakened the nitrification activity in sbrs fig s3 b and c 3 2 compositions of eps the compositions of epsmono pros epslop pros and epship pros are shown in fig 2 the doc of eps was obtained to quantify the total bound eps within each activated sludge while the proteins polysaccharides and humic compounds were determined for composition comparison among three eps as an indicator of total organic matters the doc content of eps corresponded well to the sum of eps components for all three eps suggesting that proteins polysaccharides and humic compounds were the major components of eps in this experiment epship pros had the highest doc content 40 3 0 5 mg doc g vss 1 followed by epsmono pros 23 1 1 5 mg doc g vss 1 and then epslop pros 12 9 1 1 mg doc g vss 1 fig 2 indicating that the variation of polymerization degree of pros directly altered the production of eps in activated sludge we originally expected that the activated sludge in sbrmono pros would produce the lowest amount of eps because less extracellular hydrolysis enzymes were required during mono pros degradation the unexpected results indicated that hydrolysis process was not the single factor affecting the production of eps in activated sludge it was reported that the bacteria in microbial aggregates tend to produce more eps in uncomfortable situations for survival fang et al 2002 priester et al 2006 sheng et al 2010 mono pros although small in mw was difficult to be captured from bulk liquid by microbial cells in activated sludge therefore more eps would be produced for trapping such substrate from the environment hip pros could be easily enmeshed by activated sludge flocs from the bulk liquid but was difficult to be taken up more exoenzymes would be secreted and immobilized in eps for hydrolysis of those exogenous macromolecules lop pros with a moderate mw was neither difficult to be captured nor difficult to be hydrolyzed therefore lop pros may be the most comfortable substrate in this experiment and thereby causing the lowest eps content of activated sludge in sbrlop pros in addition to the total content of eps the eps composition was also found to be much different among epsmono pros epslop pros and epship pros fig 2 actually the proportion of eps components was more important in determining the characteristics of eps than the total amounts of eps liao et al 2001 table 2 lists the proportions of each component and the mass ratios of proteins polysaccharides pn ps in the three eps with the increase of polymerization degree of pros from mono pros to lop pros and to hip pros the proportion of proteins in eps increased from 0 43 to 0 49 and to 0 55 while the proportion of polysaccharides in eps decreased notably from 0 56 to 0 43 and to 0 20 this directly led to the ratio of pn ps in epsmono pros epslop pros and epship pros increased significantly from 0 77 to 1 1 and to 2 7 surprisingly the content of humic compounds in eps also increased with the polymerization degree of pros the proportion of humic compounds in eps increased from 0 015 in epsmono pros to 0 088 in epslop pros and to 0 24 in epship pros therefore the activated sludge tended to produced more proteins and humic compounds but less polysaccharides in eps with the increase of polymerization degree of pros the degradation of polymeric pros needs great amounts of exoenzymes which are proteins it well known that exoenzymes in activated sludge mainly originate from activated sludge itself by cell autolysis or active excretion since a lot of biomass in activated sludge system is present in the form of microbial aggregates the direct contact between cells and substrates becomes difficult the macromolecule substrates must be first retained in the eps layer and then to be hydrolyzed before becoming available therefore it was found that a significant part of hydrolytic activity was associated with the eps of activated sludge flocs and very little hydrolytic activity was detected in the bulk water surrounding activated sludge flocs frølund et al 1995 moreover the higher the mw of a substrate the more the hydrolytic activity was associated to the eps cadoret et al 2002 it means that large amount of exoenzymes would be immobilized in eps of activated sludge when high polymeric pros was fed the determination of protease activity in activated sludge showed that the protease activity increased from 8 27 0 19 μm l 1 h 1 with mono pros to 9 13 0 82 μm l 1 h 1 with lop pros 10 increase and to 9 34 0 92 μm l 1 h 1 with hip pros 13 increase within 6 days cultivation fig s4 it may be the reason that the content of proteins in epslop pros and epship pros was systematically prevalent over polysaccharides and there was higher proteins content in epship pros than that in epslop pros regarding to humic compounds in eps they have long been considered as a component of eps yet their detailed function in eps was not well understood flemming and wingender 2010 believed that humic compounds can possibly act as electron donor or acceptor to permit redox activity in microbial aggregates nevertheless some other researchers suggested that humic compounds in eps might be much related to the hydrolysis process burns 1989 found that the extracellular enzymes in biofilm can form stable complexes with humic compounds and these complexes were extremely resistant to thermal denaturation dehydration and proteolysis wetzel 1991 reported that humic compounds can immobilize exoenzymes in a chemically stable but reversible suppressed form it was proposed that in this complexes the exoenzymes were protected from environment and could be reactivated to full enzyme activity at same or displaced sites frølund et al 1995 also found that an increased esterase activity in activated sludge corresponded to an increased content of humic compounds in eps in this study the increase of humic compound content was accompanied with the increase of proteins in eps which was a result of enhanced hydrolysis activity caused by the increase of the polymerization degree of pros this again suggests the possible association of humic compounds with the hydrolysis process in microbial aggregates it is well known that proteins instead of polysaccharides were the largest eps fraction in most mixed culture such as activated sludge possibly due to the exoenzymes entrapped in eps matrix frølund et al 1996 thus the high content of polysaccharides in epsmono pros was unusual and noticeable polysaccharides in eps were generally considered to be used primarily for cell adhesion aggregation and cohesion but sorption and accumulation of organic or inorganic nutrients that difficult to be captured from the environment were also reported as an important function of some charged hydrophilic or hydrophobic polysaccharides flemming and wingender 2010 in this experiment the substrate used in sbrmono pros was aspartic acid which has two carboxyl groups and was a negatively charged hydrophilic amino acid as bacteria in microbial aggregates have negatively charged but hydrophobic cell surface it is difficult for them to capture aspartic acid from liquid bulk because of the electrostatic repulsion and hydrophobic effect it was reported that the presence of large amounts of primarily neutral and hydrophilic polysaccharides contributed to the more neutral and hydrophilic nature of activated sludge neyens and baeyens 2003 therefore the high content of polysaccharides in epsmono pros were likely a biological result to reduce electrostatic repulsion and hydrophobic effect to allow the accumulation of aspartic acids from bulk liquid to eps matrix as substrate source 3 3 mw distribution of eps the sec profiles of epsmono pros epslop pros and epship pros are shown in fig 3 which are consistent well with previous studies görner et al 2003 ras et al 2011 regardless of the types of pros used the eps had broad spectra of mw distribution from 10 kda to 600 kda indicating the heterogeneous macromolecular characteristics of eps ras et al 2011 believed that the different size clusters of eps were much associated with the different metabolism activities in microbial aggregates and had different functions in microbial aggregation formation the eps were also found to have bimodal distribution of mw fig 3 the bimodal mw distribution of microbial products was also reported by other researchers and was thought to have great significance for possible alleviating membrane fouling of mbr malamis and andreadakis 2009 fig 3 shows that two size clusters occurred in all three sec profiles of eps i a high mw fraction 670 kda with retention time of 5 3 min and ii a moderate mw fraction 13 7 kda with retention time of 11 6 min it indicates that these two fractions may be the intrinsic components of eps and were independent of the polymerization degree of pros on the other hand three additional size clusters located in 0 137 kda 13 7 kda and 0 137 kda with retention times of iii 10 7 min iv 11 2 min and v 13 9 min respectively were identified only in sec profile of epship pros implying the higher diversity of composition in epship pros than those in epsmono pros and epslop pros it suggests that some other moderate and low mw compounds were produced when hip pros was fed these additional size clusters in epship pros could be mainly attributed to additional exoenzymes as well as some subsidiary compounds produced and accumulated in the eps matrix during the hip pros hydrolysis process 3 4 uv vis spectra of eps since eps contain large quantities of aromatic structures and unsaturated fatty chains with various types of functional groups sheng et al 2010 uv vis absorption spectroscopy was used to evaluate those functional groups in the three eps as shown in fig 4 consistent with the previous study all three eps had significant absorbance in the uv region with two absorption bands at 210 220 nm and 255 265 nm meng et al 2016 the absorption band at 210 220 nm can be attributed to n π electron transitions of the amide bond in proteins as well as the carboxyl carbonyl or ester in eps molecules the absorption band at 255 265 nm could be assigned to π π electron transitions in aromatic and poly aromatic compounds of eps such as tryptophan tyrosine phenylalanine related amino acids or proteins as well as humic compounds chen et al 2013 meng et al 2016 no significant difference in profiles of uv vis spectra were observed between epsmono pros and epslop pros however in terms of epship pros the absorption peak wavelengths shifted significantly toward the longer wavelength region red shift absorption in the uv vis region is related to the transition of electrons the red shift of uv vis spectrum usually indicates that the energy required for electron transition was reduced and thereby implies the change of molecular structures unsaturated functional groups such as conjugated systems and double bond systems in molecules have large impacts on peak wavelengths and absorption intensities of uv vis spectrum chen et al 2013 the electrons in relatively large conjugated systems are more easily affected by low energy photons and thus the absorption peak wavelengths of uv vis spectrum tend to red shift chen et al 2013 in the current experiment the composition analysis of eps has showed that humic compounds greatly increased in epship pros compared to epsmono pros and epslop pros fig 2 humic compounds have long been considered to contain large amount of phenolic and polyaromatic moieties in their molecules flemming and wingender 2010 on the other hand aromatic compounds typically contain conjugated planar ring systems with delocalized π electron clouds instead of discrete alternating single and double bonds therefore the high content of humic compounds with large amount of conjugated systems in epship pros may be the reason for the red shift of epship pros uv vis spectrum 3 5 ftir spectra of eps it is generally believed that the 1800 600 cm 1 region of ftir spectra can provide main information about compositions and functionalities of eps components badireddy et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 yin et al 2015 the ftir of eps can be divided into six predominant regions associated with several characteristic functional groups 1700 1600 cm 1 amide i region associated with proteins 1600 1500 cm 1 amide ii region associated with proteins 1500 1300 cm 1 carboxylic group containing and hydrocarbon like compounds 1300 1200 cm 1 amide iii region associated with proteins 1200 900 cm 1 polysaccharides and nucleic acids and 900 600 cm 1 fingerprint region badireddy et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 yin et al 2015 therefore the related regions of ftir spectra in this experiment were extracted to compare the impacts of polymerization degree of pros fig 5 corresponded with the previous studies various bands appeared almost in all six regions of ftir implying the complex protein and polysaccharide associated functional groups and compositions of eps badireddy et al 2008 yuan et al 2011 yin et al 2015 in general the ftir profiles for epsmono pros epslop pros and epship pros were semblable indicating that the main functional groups were quite similar for the three eps however a closer inspection shows difference of the ftir profile of epship pros from those of epsmono pros and epslop pros the detailed band assignments for ftir spectral features of eps are given in table 3 based on literature screening badireddy et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 as shown in fig 5 the bands at 1635 1164 1075 957 and 860 cm 1 were appeared in all three eps being consistent with that eps contain proteins polysaccharides lipids dna and aromatic compounds with abundance of functional groups like co coo coh co coc conh cn nh nh2 opo etc a weak band at 1526 cm 1 was only detected in ftir of epship pros indicating the relatively higher amount of conh in epship pros than in epsmono pros and epslop pros the band at 1385 cm 1 appeared in both ftir of epsmono pros and epslop pros directly suggesting the presence of coo containing compounds such as amino acids and uronic acids in both eps however the corresponding position in ftir of epship pros was covered by wide bands from 1403 to 1358 cm 1 indicating that the coo containing compounds in epship pros were more associated with amino acids than in epsmono pros and epslop pros in addition the bands at 957 and 860 cm 1 in ftir of epsmono pros and epslop pros became stronger in ftir of epship pros revealing the relatively higher contents of aromatic compounds and nucleic acids in epship pros than in epsmono pros and epslop pros the distinguishable ftir spectral features of epship pros from epsmono pros and epslop pros are a result of their different compositions the higher contents of conh and amino acids associated coo in epship pros are mainly due to the higher content of proteins in epship pros the larger amount of humic compounds in epship pros might also increase the ring vibrations of aromatic compounds at band of 860 cm 1 due to slow hydrolysis of particulate substrate it was harder for bacteria in sbrhip pros to obtain sufficient substrates for growth comparing to sbrmono pros and sbrlop pros therefore the relatively higher opo stretches in epship pros likely originated from larger release of nucleic acids during endogenous decay of bacteria in sbrhip pros 3 6 xps of eps further information on atomic compositions of the three eps was determined by broad survey scan of xps over the energy range of 0 1200 ev as shown in fig 6 the core level peaks of c 1s 286 ev and o 1s 532 ev were detected in xps spectra indicating high elemental abundances of c and o in the eps as an indispensable element in proteins of eps n with low elemental abundance was also detected as n 1s peak at position of 400 ev the presence of a strong na signal at the position of 1072 ev was mainly attributed to the eps extraction method cer method in which na form cation exchange resin exchanged na with ca and mg in eps matrix to weaken the cross linkage between eps moieties and allow efficient eps extraction the mass fractions of c o and n in the three eps are provided in table 4 comparing with the previous studies the n c ratios of eps in this experiment were consistent with that in badireddy et al 2010 which studied the glucose fed activated sludge but lower than that in yin et al 2015 which studied the mixed culture dominated by ammonia oxidizing bacteria therefore the origins and microbial communities of sludge have significant impact on the element composition of eps in terms of three situation in this experiment the n c molar ratio increased in the order of epsmono pros 0 028 epslop pros 0 053 epship pros 0 128 indicating that n containing compounds were substantially increased with the increase of polymerization degree of pros on the other hand epslop pros had much higher o c molar ratio than epsmono pros and epship pros suggesting that epslop pros was rich in o containing compounds as each peak in xps spectra corresponds to electrons with a characteristic binding energy from a particular element the high resolution scans of c 1s o 1s and n 1s were performed and decomposed to obtain the detailed information on chemical functionalities of eps fig 7 because carbon c 1s was the main element of eps accounted for 60 of total atoms according to the element composition analysis of xps each functional group was quantified as molar ratio to total carbon c 1s to facilitate the comparison of functionalities among the three eps table 4 the c 1s peak could be resolved into four different bond peaks in all three eps fig 7 a1 b1 and c1 yuan et al 2011 yin et al 2015 hao et al 2016 however different peak areas of each bond indicate their different contents within eps the peak at 284 8 ev was attributed to c c h predominantly from hydrocarbon like compounds including polysaccharides or side chains of amino acids and lipids it was the most prevalent functional group in all three eps with the molar ratio of 60 to total carbon the peak at 286 3 ev was associated with c o n from amide alcohol or ether amine groups in proteins and polysaccharides which also represents a relatively large percentage about 20 30 to total carbon in all three eps the weak peak at 288 0 ev was due to groups of c o or o c o which are usually presented in carboxylate carbonyl amide acetal or hemiacetal another weak peak at 289 0 ev was contributed by o c oh or o c or as in groups of carboxyl or ester from carboxylate and uronic acids as can be seen in table 4 the contents of c c h and c o n in eps did not change significantly with the change of pros due to universality of these functional groups in organic matters of eps however the molar ratios of c o or o c o in epsmono pros epslop pros and epship pros increased from 2 7 to 8 6 and to 12 2 respectively while the molar ratio of o c oh or o c or decreased from 6 8 to 5 1 and to 2 6 respectively the composition analysis has shown that protein content in eps increased greatly with the increase of polymerization degree of pros hence the large quantities of proteins in eps could increase the amide content in eps and thereby the amount of c o groups in eps on the other hand the different contents of o c oh or o c or in epsmono pros epslop pros and epship pros are mainly attributed to different contents of carbonyl in fed pros for example as the mono pros aspartic acid has 2 carboxyl groups in each molecule in addition as the lop pros soya peptone will also get more carboxyl groups in partial proteolysis of soya proteins the cleavage of a peptide bond produces a carboxyl and an amino group as for hip pros the functionality of carboxyl groups is low because of the dehydration condensation reaction between carboxyl and amino group it might be the reason that the molar ratios of o c oh or o c or in epsmono pros and epslop pros were relatively higher than that in epship pros the o 1s peak of each eps was decomposed into two peaks fig 7 a2 b2 and c2 o c bond in carbonyl carboxylate amide or ester groups at a binding energy of 531 4 ev and c o c or c o h in alcohol hemiacetal or acetal groups at a binding energy of 532 7 ev yuan et al 2011 yin et al 2015 hao et al 2016 it was noteworthy that the molar ratio of c o c or c o h to total carbon decreased from 23 2 to 22 8 and to 12 4 in epsmono pros epslop pros and epship pros respectively table 4 as c o c or c o h is much associated with polysaccharides in eps badireddy et al 2008 yin et al 2015 this result is in good agreement with the composition analysis that the mass ratio of polysaccharides in eps were in the order of epsmono pros epslop pros epship pros in terms of o c bond epslop pros had the highest molar ratio of o c to total carbon among the three eps the reason was not well understood but could be related to the high amount of oxygen containing properties in epslop pros the n 1s peak could be decomposed into two peaks fig 7 a3 b3 and c3 the peak at 400 1 ev caused by nonprotonated nitrogen n nonpr in amides and amines and the peak at 401 6 ev originated from protonated amines n pr in basic amino acids or amino sugars yuan et al 2011 yin et al 2015 the molar ratio of n nonpr to total carbon was found to be increased from epsmono pros to epslop pros and then to epship pros corresponding to the increase of proteins in eps in lop pros and hip pros fed microbial aggregates on the other hand the n pr was only detected in epship pros to a certain extent indicating that more complex proteins were introduced into epship pros during the hydrolysis of hip pros 4 conclusions the current study explored the impact of polymerization degree of proteinaceous substrates i e mono lop and hip pros on chemical compositions and functional groups of eps in activated sludge systems the main findings of this study are summarized as follows 1 the change of polymerization degree of pros significantly altered the composition of eps in activated sludge compared to epsmono pros the proportion of proteins in epslop pros and epship pros increased by 12 8 and 27 7 respectively while the proportion of polysaccharides decreased by 22 9 and 63 6 respectively creating much higher protein polysaccharide ratio in epslop pros 1 1 and epship pros 2 7 than that in epsmono pros 0 77 moreover the proportion of humic compounds in epslop pros and epship pros were 6 and 16 fold higher than that in epsmono pros respectively 2 the increase of proteins and humic compounds in epship pros resulted in its more complex mw distribution than epsmono pros and epslop pros moreover the accumulation of humic compounds in epship pros increased the unsaturation degree of eps molecules and thereby reduced the energy requirement for electrons transition of amide bonds and aromatic groups in epship pros 3 the spectroscopic characterization revealed the dominance of hydrocarbon protein polysaccharide and aromatic associated bonds in all three eps nevertheless with the increase of polymerization degree of pros the protein associated bonds such as conh co nc nh increased while the polysaccharide associated bonds such as coc coh ocoh decreased the high cost of residual sludge treatment and membrane fouling are two major setbacks of activated sludge process or mbr system both issues are strongly influenced by the composition and properties of eps in activated sludge the results from this study provide better understanding on how pros in influent would impact residual sludge production and membrane fouling and may shed lights on how to alleviate both problems by

19834,characteristics of extracellular polymeric substances eps in activated sludge strongly depend on wastewater substrates proteinaceous substrates pros present in heterogeneous polymeric form are intrinsic and important parts of wastewater substrates for microorganisms in activated sludge systems however correlations between pros and characteristics of eps are scarce this study systematically explored the impacts of monomeric mono low polymeric lop and high polymeric hip pros on compositions and functional groups of eps in activated sludge the results showed that the change of polymerization degree of pros significantly altered the composition of eps compared to epsmono pros the proportion of proteins in epslop pros and epship pros increased by 12 8 and 27 7 respectively while that of polysaccharides decreased by 22 9 and 63 6 respectively moreover the proportion of humic compounds in epslop pros and epship pros were 6 and 16 fold higher than that in epsmono pros respectively the accumulation of humic compounds in eps increased the unsaturation degree of eps molecules and thereby reduced the energy requirement for electrons transition of amide bonds and aromatic groups size exclusion chromatography sec analyses detected more molecular clusters in epship pros indicating more complex composition of eps in hip pros fed activated sludge spectroscopic characterization revealed the dominance of hydrocarbon protein polysaccharide and aromatic associated bonds in all three eps nevertheless with the increase of polymerization degree of pros the protein associated bonds such as conh co nc nh increased while the polysaccharide associated bonds such as coc coh ocoh decreased this paper paves a path to understand the role of pros in affecting the

2009 lin et al 2014 chen et al 2017 hence in depth research of those exopolymers in microbial aggregates is of high importance not only to understand and control the microbial aggregations effluent qualities and process dynamics of biological wastewater treatment systems but also to mitigate or even overcome the barrier of biofouling in mbr systems since eps originate from metabolism or lysis of microorganisms and the wastewater itself the characteristics of eps are sensitive to or even governed by the operational conditions of biological wastewater treatment systems sheng et al 2010 one of the most considerable concerns for scientists or practitioners who investigate or design biological wastewater treatment systems is the impacts of wastewater constituents on eps many evidences have proved that different substrates in wastewater have significant effects on microbial communities and their metabolisms and thereby influence their production of eps sponza 2003 investigated the effects of different wastewater industrial or municipal on the formation of eps in continuous fed completely stirred tank reactor and concluded that eps compositions depend more on substrate type rather than on other operating conditions sheng et al 2006 found that rhodopseudomonas acidophila would produce more eps using benzoate as the substrate than using acetate propionate or butyrate li and yang 2007 reported that activated sludge fed with glucose has more eps production than that fed with acetate wang et al 2014b also found significantly different physicochemical properties of eps between sweet potato starch and glucose fed activated sludge previous studies about correlation between inlet substrate and eps have mostly focused on small molecular weight mw constituents such as acetate propionate butyrate glucose phenol benzoate etc except few studies on starch sheng et al 2006 li and yang 2007 ye et al 2011 wang et al 2014b however the metabolizing behaviors of these simple substrates may not accurately reflect the complex situations in actual biological wastewater treatment systems where the wastewater substrates for microorganisms consist of a much broad range of molecules and macromolecules levine et al 1991 the compositions of substrate in wastewater vary considerably and are site specific but typically contain 40 60 proteins 25 50 carbohydrate and 10 lipids metcalf and eddy 2003 proteinaceous organic matters are considered as an intrinsic and important part of substrates for microorganisms in biological wastewater treatment systems eliosov and argaman 1995 confer and logan 1997a most of proteinaceous substrates pros in wastewater are present in heterogeneous polymeric forms such as particulate proteins polypeptides lipoproteins glycoproteins etc confer et al 1995 found that more than 75 of total amino acids in a wastewater are contained in compounds larger than 1000 atomic mass units these macromolecular pros have to be depolymerized by exoenzymes to monomers or oligomers before becoming available for microorganisms confer and logan 1997a mosquera corral et al 2003 since eps matrix of microbial aggregates is an important accommodation of extracellular hydrolysis process flemming and wingender 2010 the presence of high content polymeric pros in wastewater is more likely to affect the production and characteristics of eps in microbial aggregates studies involved in the polymeric substrates in wastewater have been reported continuously during the last two decades nevertheless most of these researches concentrated on the degradation mechanism of polymeric substrates eliosov and argaman 1995 confer and logan 1997a 1997b mosquera corral et al 2003 karahan et al 2005 dimock and morgenroth 2006 as well as the influences of polymeric substrates on microfauna populations puigagut et al 2007 sludge granulation de kreuk et al 2010 wagner et al 2015 carbon and energy footprint of wastewater treatment process gori et al 2011 sludge settleability martins et al 2011 wang et al 2013 and nutrient removal jabari et al 2016 wang et al 2017 few researches have investigated the impacts of polymeric substrates on the nature of eps wang et al 2014b took sweet potato starch as the proxy to study the effects of polysaccharides on properties of eps in activated sludge however the polysaccharides may not comprehensively reflect the complex macromolecules in actual wastewater previous research also found that the availability of azocasein protein and amylose polysaccharide to exoenzymes in dispersed activated sludge were different cadoret et al 2002 therefore considering the importance and the broad mw range of pros in wastewater the present work aims to identify the impacts of monomeric mono low polymeric lop and high polymeric hip pros on chemical compositions and functional groups of eps in biological wastewater treatment systems the eps were characterized using combined methods of size exclusion chromatography sec ultraviolet visible uv vis adsorption spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps techniques to the best of our knowledge these correlations between pros and nature of eps have not been thoroughly studied yet filling this research gap can permit us to better understand the importance of pros in determining the functional constituents of eps in biological wastewater treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup experiments were carried out parallelly in three identical aerobic sequencing batch reactors sbrs which had a working volume of 5 l with 30 cm in height and 18 cm in diameter each sbr was seeded to 3000 mg suspended solid l 1 with activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in hangzhou china a synthetic wastewater the detailed composition can refer to tables s1 and s2 with an initial carbon source of 400 mg cod l 1 and nitrogen source of 60 mg kjeldahl n l 1 was served as the feed medium of each sbr for comparison aspartic acid 62004736 sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china soya peptone 69047737 sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china and fragmentized boiled egg white bew with a mean representative diameter of 47 94 3 20 μm fig s1 were used as the model substrates of mono pros lop pros and hip pros respectively the corresponding sbrs were named as sbrmono pros sbrlop pros and sbrhip pros respectively aspartic acid is common monomeric units of protein peptone is a mixture of soluble low polymeric polypeptide formed by partial hydrolysis of protein fragmentized boiled egg white is typical particulate high polymeric protein therefore they well represent the monomer low polymeric and high polymeric proteinaceous substrates the selection was also based on the consideration that these three can be easily acquired except for the substrate type all other components in synthetic wastewater were identical the influent was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c to prevent the degradation or hydrolysis of substrates key operational parameters of sbrs are shown in table 1 detailed configurations and operational cycles of sbrs were identical to wang et al 2017 after all the sbrs reached steady state the eps of activated sludge in each sbr were extracted for characterization the corresponding eps in sbrmono pros sbrlop pros and sbrhip pros were named as epsmono pros epslop pros and epship pros respectively 2 2 eps extraction cation exchange resin cer method was used for extraction of total bound eps the cer method was selected because it was found to superior to other methods in terms of yield and minimal disruption of eps frølund et al 1996 the eps was not further classified as loosely bound eps and tightly bound eps as these two terms are experimentally defined and inconsistent results regarding this classification were often obtained in previous studies wang et al 2014a the detailed procedures of this extraction method could be found elsewhere frølund et al 1996 wang et al 2014b and the cer used in this study was dower marathon c 20 50 mesh in na form fluka 91973 total bound eps was quantified by dissolved organic carbon doc the major components of eps including proteins polysaccharides and humic compounds were quantified separately by chemical colorimetric methods 2 3 analytical methods all the routine analysis of sbrs including chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were performed according to the standard methods apha 1998 all water samples used for routine analysis were obtained by centrifuging the mixed liquor at 8000 g the dissolved oxygen do and ph were determined by a dissolved oxygen meter hi9146 hanna italy and ph meter hi98191 hanna italy respectively the particle size distribution of fragmentized bew was measured with a laser particle size analyzer ls230 svm beckman usa over a 0 4 2000 μm size range the determination of protease activity was performed according to the procedures described in li and chróst 2006 with respect to the composition analysis of eps the proteins and humic compounds were determined by modified lowry method frølund et al 1996 and bovine serum albumin v900933 vetec sigma aldrich and humic acid 53680 sigma aldrich were used as the standards the polysaccharides was measured by phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 and glucose v900392 vetec sigma aldrich was selected as the standard the total organic matter exist in eps was quantified by doc using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l cpn shimadzu japan the mw distribution of eps was determined by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system 1260 infinity ii agilent technologies inc us equipped with an uv detector and a sec column bio sec 5 300 å 7 8 300 mm agilent technologies inc us sodium phosphate 10020418 sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china solution 150 mm ph 7 0 was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the injection volume of sample was 10 μl and the column temperature was set at 25 c the detection was carried out at wavelength of 210 nm the sec column was calibrated by standard proteins with molecular mass of 0 137 13 7 44 3 150 670 kda protein standard mix 15 600 kda 69385 sigma aldrich uv vis absorption spectrum of eps was collected with an automatic scanning uv vis spectrophotometer tu 1810 beijing purkinje general instrument co ltd china at 200 800 nm ftir spectrum of freeze dried eps was obtained using a ftir spectrometer nicolet 6700 thermo scientific co usa with resolution of 4 cm 1 and scan range of 400 4000 cm 1 the freeze drying of eps were conducted by a lyophilizer fd 1a 50 beijing boyikang laboratory instruments co ltd china xps of freeze dried eps was performed using a xps spectrometer escalab 250 thermo fisher scientific co usa the xps measurements were conducted using al kα 1486 6 ev radiation the binding energies were calibrated using the c 1s peak 284 6 ev the xps analysis consisted of a broad survey scan for determining the major element composition and a high resolution scan for determining the speciation of the components a software package xps peak was used to fit the xps spectra peaks 3 results and discussion 3 1 general observations the sbrs generally reached steady state 1 month after inoculation fig 1 the mlss of sbrmono pros sbrlop pros and sbrhip pros in steady state were 2140 330 3124 505 and 2513 405 mg l 1 respectively despite that the three sbrs had same sludge retention time srt it suggests that the variation of substrates resulted in different growth yields of biomass similarly mosquera corral et al 2003 found that the biomass yield on aspartic acid is only half of that on soy proteins in a biofilm airlift suspension reactor in spite of this the mlvss mlss ratio in all three sbrs gradually increased from 60 at the beginning of inoculation to 90 at the steady state fig 1 suggesting the well enrichment of biomass during the acclimation period the cycle behaviors of cod nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in bulk liquid of the three sbrs were examined in steady state the cycle behavior of po4 3 p was not determined since the sbrs in this experiment did not involve enhanced biological phosphorus removal and different degradation profiles of these components in sbrs were observed figs s2 and s3 since polypeptides and polysaccharides with lesser than six or seven monomeric units approximately 1000 da can transport across bacterial cell wall and be assimilated directly by bacteria law 1980 confer and logan 1997a aspartic acid as a mono pros with mw of 133 da could be taken up directly by bacteria therefore the degradation of aspartic acid was relatively fast compared to the other two polymeric pros and the cod concentration in bulk liquid of sbrmono pros sharply decreased from 200 mg l 1 to lower than 50 mg l 1 within 5 min of cycle time fig s2 soya peptone was a mixture of soluble low polymeric polypeptides formed by partial hydrolysis of soya proteins taking up of soya peptone requires an additional hydrolysis process by bacteria therefore it took 30 min for sbrlop pros to decrease bulk liquid cod from 200 mg l 1 to lower than 50 mg l 1 fig s2 as for sbrhip pros the profile of cod in bulk liquid was lower than 50 mg l 1 throughout the cycle time fig s2 this is because the fragmentized bew were in particulate form and their hydrolysis should be much more difficult than soluble soya peptone dimock and morgenroth 2006 they could be trapped by activated sludge once they were fed into the reactor and their hydrolysis mainly occurred within the activated sludge flocs since hydrolysis is widely considered as the rate limiting step hydrolytic products monomers or oligomers were consumed at a higher rate than they were produced which likely caused no introduction of soluble hydrolytic products into the bulk liquid martins et al 2011 this explains the stable low level cod in bulk liquid of sbrhip pros the cycle behaviors of nitrogen demonstrated that the degradation of pros was accompanied by typical ammonification and nitrification processes fig s3 it is noteworthy that the increase of polymerization degree of pros reduced the rate of ammonification as well as the release of ammonia fig s3 a and thereby weakened the nitrification activity in sbrs fig s3 b and c 3 2 compositions of eps the compositions of epsmono pros epslop pros and epship pros are shown in fig 2 the doc of eps was obtained to quantify the total bound eps within each activated sludge while the proteins polysaccharides and humic compounds were determined for composition comparison among three eps as an indicator of total organic matters the doc content of eps corresponded well to the sum of eps components for all three eps suggesting that proteins polysaccharides and humic compounds were the major components of eps in this experiment epship pros had the highest doc content 40 3 0 5 mg doc g vss 1 followed by epsmono pros 23 1 1 5 mg doc g vss 1 and then epslop pros 12 9 1 1 mg doc g vss 1 fig 2 indicating that the variation of polymerization degree of pros directly altered the production of eps in activated sludge we originally expected that the activated sludge in sbrmono pros would produce the lowest amount of eps because less extracellular hydrolysis enzymes were required during mono pros degradation the unexpected results indicated that hydrolysis process was not the single factor affecting the production of eps in activated sludge it was reported that the bacteria in microbial aggregates tend to produce more eps in uncomfortable situations for survival fang et al 2002 priester et al 2006 sheng et al 2010 mono pros although small in mw was difficult to be captured from bulk liquid by microbial cells in activated sludge therefore more eps would be produced for trapping such substrate from the environment hip pros could be easily enmeshed by activated sludge flocs from the bulk liquid but was difficult to be taken up more exoenzymes would be secreted and immobilized in eps for hydrolysis of those exogenous macromolecules lop pros with a moderate mw was neither difficult to be captured nor difficult to be hydrolyzed therefore lop pros may be the most comfortable substrate in this experiment and thereby causing the lowest eps content of activated sludge in sbrlop pros in addition to the total content of eps the eps composition was also found to be much different among epsmono pros epslop pros and epship pros fig 2 actually the proportion of eps components was more important in determining the characteristics of eps than the total amounts of eps liao et al 2001 table 2 lists the proportions of each component and the mass ratios of proteins polysaccharides pn ps in the three eps with the increase of polymerization degree of pros from mono pros to lop pros and to hip pros the proportion of proteins in eps increased from 0 43 to 0 49 and to 0 55 while the proportion of polysaccharides in eps decreased notably from 0 56 to 0 43 and to 0 20 this directly led to the ratio of pn ps in epsmono pros epslop pros and epship pros increased significantly from 0 77 to 1 1 and to 2 7 surprisingly the content of humic compounds in eps also increased with the polymerization degree of pros the proportion of humic compounds in eps increased from 0 015 in epsmono pros to 0 088 in epslop pros and to 0 24 in epship pros therefore the activated sludge tended to produced more proteins and humic compounds but less polysaccharides in eps with the increase of polymerization degree of pros the degradation of polymeric pros needs great amounts of exoenzymes which are proteins it well known that exoenzymes in activated sludge mainly originate from activated sludge itself by cell autolysis or active excretion since a lot of biomass in activated sludge system is present in the form of microbial aggregates the direct contact between cells and substrates becomes difficult the macromolecule substrates must be first retained in the eps layer and then to be hydrolyzed before becoming available therefore it was found that a significant part of hydrolytic activity was associated with the eps of activated sludge flocs and very little hydrolytic activity was detected in the bulk water surrounding activated sludge flocs frølund et al 1995 moreover the higher the mw of a substrate the more the hydrolytic activity was associated to the eps cadoret et al 2002 it means that large amount of exoenzymes would be immobilized in eps of activated sludge when high polymeric pros was fed the determination of protease activity in activated sludge showed that the protease activity increased from 8 27 0 19 μm l 1 h 1 with mono pros to 9 13 0 82 μm l 1 h 1 with lop pros 10 increase and to 9 34 0 92 μm l 1 h 1 with hip pros 13 increase within 6 days cultivation fig s4 it may be the reason that the content of proteins in epslop pros and epship pros was systematically prevalent over polysaccharides and there was higher proteins content in epship pros than that in epslop pros regarding to humic compounds in eps they have long been considered as a component of eps yet their detailed function in eps was not well understood flemming and wingender 2010 believed that humic compounds can possibly act as electron donor or acceptor to permit redox activity in microbial aggregates nevertheless some other researchers suggested that humic compounds in eps might be much related to the hydrolysis process burns 1989 found that the extracellular enzymes in biofilm can form stable complexes with humic compounds and these complexes were extremely resistant to thermal denaturation dehydration and proteolysis wetzel 1991 reported that humic compounds can immobilize exoenzymes in a chemically stable but reversible suppressed form it was proposed that in this complexes the exoenzymes were protected from environment and could be reactivated to full enzyme activity at same or displaced sites frølund et al 1995 also found that an increased esterase activity in activated sludge corresponded to an increased content of humic compounds in eps in this study the increase of humic compound content was accompanied with the increase of proteins in eps which was a result of enhanced hydrolysis activity caused by the increase of the polymerization degree of pros this again suggests the possible association of humic compounds with the hydrolysis process in microbial aggregates it is well known that proteins instead of polysaccharides were the largest eps fraction in most mixed culture such as activated sludge possibly due to the exoenzymes entrapped in eps matrix frølund et al 1996 thus the high content of polysaccharides in epsmono pros was unusual and noticeable polysaccharides in eps were generally considered to be used primarily for cell adhesion aggregation and cohesion but sorption and accumulation of organic or inorganic nutrients that difficult to be captured from the environment were also reported as an important function of some charged hydrophilic or hydrophobic polysaccharides flemming and wingender 2010 in this experiment the substrate used in sbrmono pros was aspartic acid which has two carboxyl groups and was a negatively charged hydrophilic amino acid as bacteria in microbial aggregates have negatively charged but hydrophobic cell surface it is difficult for them to capture aspartic acid from liquid bulk because of the electrostatic repulsion and hydrophobic effect it was reported that the presence of large amounts of primarily neutral and hydrophilic polysaccharides contributed to the more neutral and hydrophilic nature of activated sludge neyens and baeyens 2003 therefore the high content of polysaccharides in epsmono pros were likely a biological result to reduce electrostatic repulsion and hydrophobic effect to allow the accumulation of aspartic acids from bulk liquid to eps matrix as substrate source 3 3 mw distribution of eps the sec profiles of epsmono pros epslop pros and epship pros are shown in fig 3 which are consistent well with previous studies görner et al 2003 ras et al 2011 regardless of the types of pros used the eps had broad spectra of mw distribution from 10 kda to 600 kda indicating the heterogeneous macromolecular characteristics of eps ras et al 2011 believed that the different size clusters of eps were much associated with the different metabolism activities in microbial aggregates and had different functions in microbial aggregation formation the eps were also found to have bimodal distribution of mw fig 3 the bimodal mw distribution of microbial products was also reported by other researchers and was thought to have great significance for possible alleviating membrane fouling of mbr malamis and andreadakis 2009 fig 3 shows that two size clusters occurred in all three sec profiles of eps i a high mw fraction 670 kda with retention time of 5 3 min and ii a moderate mw fraction 13 7 kda with retention time of 11 6 min it indicates that these two fractions may be the intrinsic components of eps and were independent of the polymerization degree of pros on the other hand three additional size clusters located in 0 137 kda 13 7 kda and 0 137 kda with retention times of iii 10 7 min iv 11 2 min and v 13 9 min respectively were identified only in sec profile of epship pros implying the higher diversity of composition in epship pros than those in epsmono pros and epslop pros it suggests that some other moderate and low mw compounds were produced when hip pros was fed these additional size clusters in epship pros could be mainly attributed to additional exoenzymes as well as some subsidiary compounds produced and accumulated in the eps matrix during the hip pros hydrolysis process 3 4 uv vis spectra of eps since eps contain large quantities of aromatic structures and unsaturated fatty chains with various types of functional groups sheng et al 2010 uv vis absorption spectroscopy was used to evaluate those functional groups in the three eps as shown in fig 4 consistent with the previous study all three eps had significant absorbance in the uv region with two absorption bands at 210 220 nm and 255 265 nm meng et al 2016 the absorption band at 210 220 nm can be attributed to n π electron transitions of the amide bond in proteins as well as the carboxyl carbonyl or ester in eps molecules the absorption band at 255 265 nm could be assigned to π π electron transitions in aromatic and poly aromatic compounds of eps such as tryptophan tyrosine phenylalanine related amino acids or proteins as well as humic compounds chen et al 2013 meng et al 2016 no significant difference in profiles of uv vis spectra were observed between epsmono pros and epslop pros however in terms of epship pros the absorption peak wavelengths shifted significantly toward the longer wavelength region red shift absorption in the uv vis region is related to the transition of electrons the red shift of uv vis spectrum usually indicates that the energy required for electron transition was reduced and thereby implies the change of molecular structures unsaturated functional groups such as conjugated systems and double bond systems in molecules have large impacts on peak wavelengths and absorption intensities of uv vis spectrum chen et al 2013 the electrons in relatively large conjugated systems are more easily affected by low energy photons and thus the absorption peak wavelengths of uv vis spectrum tend to red shift chen et al 2013 in the current experiment the composition analysis of eps has showed that humic compounds greatly increased in epship pros compared to epsmono pros and epslop pros fig 2 humic compounds have long been considered to contain large amount of phenolic and polyaromatic moieties in their molecules flemming and wingender 2010 on the other hand aromatic compounds typically contain conjugated planar ring systems with delocalized π electron clouds instead of discrete alternating single and double bonds therefore the high content of humic compounds with large amount of conjugated systems in epship pros may be the reason for the red shift of epship pros uv vis spectrum 3 5 ftir spectra of eps it is generally believed that the 1800 600 cm 1 region of ftir spectra can provide main information about compositions and functionalities of eps components badireddy et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 yin et al 2015 the ftir of eps can be divided into six predominant regions associated with several characteristic functional groups 1700 1600 cm 1 amide i region associated with proteins 1600 1500 cm 1 amide ii region associated with proteins 1500 1300 cm 1 carboxylic group containing and hydrocarbon like compounds 1300 1200 cm 1 amide iii region associated with proteins 1200 900 cm 1 polysaccharides and nucleic acids and 900 600 cm 1 fingerprint region badireddy et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 yin et al 2015 therefore the related regions of ftir spectra in this experiment were extracted to compare the impacts of polymerization degree of pros fig 5 corresponded with the previous studies various bands appeared almost in all six regions of ftir implying the complex protein and polysaccharide associated functional groups and compositions of eps badireddy et al 2008 yuan et al 2011 yin et al 2015 in general the ftir profiles for epsmono pros epslop pros and epship pros were semblable indicating that the main functional groups were quite similar for the three eps however a closer inspection shows difference of the ftir profile of epship pros from those of epsmono pros and epslop pros the detailed band assignments for ftir spectral features of eps are given in table 3 based on literature screening badireddy et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 as shown in fig 5 the bands at 1635 1164 1075 957 and 860 cm 1 were appeared in all three eps being consistent with that eps contain proteins polysaccharides lipids dna and aromatic compounds with abundance of functional groups like co coo coh co coc conh cn nh nh2 opo etc a weak band at 1526 cm 1 was only detected in ftir of epship pros indicating the relatively higher amount of conh in epship pros than in epsmono pros and epslop pros the band at 1385 cm 1 appeared in both ftir of epsmono pros and epslop pros directly suggesting the presence of coo containing compounds such as amino acids and uronic acids in both eps however the corresponding position in ftir of epship pros was covered by wide bands from 1403 to 1358 cm 1 indicating that the coo containing compounds in epship pros were more associated with amino acids than in epsmono pros and epslop pros in addition the bands at 957 and 860 cm 1 in ftir of epsmono pros and epslop pros became stronger in ftir of epship pros revealing the relatively higher contents of aromatic compounds and nucleic acids in epship pros than in epsmono pros and epslop pros the distinguishable ftir spectral features of epship pros from epsmono pros and epslop pros are a result of their different compositions the higher contents of conh and amino acids associated coo in epship pros are mainly due to the higher content of proteins in epship pros the larger amount of humic compounds in epship pros might also increase the ring vibrations of aromatic compounds at band of 860 cm 1 due to slow hydrolysis of particulate substrate it was harder for bacteria in sbrhip pros to obtain sufficient substrates for growth comparing to sbrmono pros and sbrlop pros therefore the relatively higher opo stretches in epship pros likely originated from larger release of nucleic acids during endogenous decay of bacteria in sbrhip pros 3 6 xps of eps further information on atomic compositions of the three eps was determined by broad survey scan of xps over the energy range of 0 1200 ev as shown in fig 6 the core level peaks of c 1s 286 ev and o 1s 532 ev were detected in xps spectra indicating high elemental abundances of c and o in the eps as an indispensable element in proteins of eps n with low elemental abundance was also detected as n 1s peak at position of 400 ev the presence of a strong na signal at the position of 1072 ev was mainly attributed to the eps extraction method cer method in which na form cation exchange resin exchanged na with ca and mg in eps matrix to weaken the cross linkage between eps moieties and allow efficient eps extraction the mass fractions of c o and n in the three eps are provided in table 4 comparing with the previous studies the n c ratios of eps in this experiment were consistent with that in badireddy et al 2010 which studied the glucose fed activated sludge but lower than that in yin et al 2015 which studied the mixed culture dominated by ammonia oxidizing bacteria therefore the origins and microbial communities of sludge have significant impact on the element composition of eps in terms of three situation in this experiment the n c molar ratio increased in the order of epsmono pros 0 028 epslop pros 0 053 epship pros 0 128 indicating that n containing compounds were substantially increased with the increase of polymerization degree of pros on the other hand epslop pros had much higher o c molar ratio than epsmono pros and epship pros suggesting that epslop pros was rich in o containing compounds as each peak in xps spectra corresponds to electrons with a characteristic binding energy from a particular element the high resolution scans of c 1s o 1s and n 1s were performed and decomposed to obtain the detailed information on chemical functionalities of eps fig 7 because carbon c 1s was the main element of eps accounted for 60 of total atoms according to the element composition analysis of xps each functional group was quantified as molar ratio to total carbon c 1s to facilitate the comparison of functionalities among the three eps table 4 the c 1s peak could be resolved into four different bond peaks in all three eps fig 7 a1 b1 and c1 yuan et al 2011 yin et al 2015 hao et al 2016 however different peak areas of each bond indicate their different contents within eps the peak at 284 8 ev was attributed to c c h predominantly from hydrocarbon like compounds including polysaccharides or side chains of amino acids and lipids it was the most prevalent functional group in all three eps with the molar ratio of 60 to total carbon the peak at 286 3 ev was associated with c o n from amide alcohol or ether amine groups in proteins and polysaccharides which also represents a relatively large percentage about 20 30 to total carbon in all three eps the weak peak at 288 0 ev was due to groups of c o or o c o which are usually presented in carboxylate carbonyl amide acetal or hemiacetal another weak peak at 289 0 ev was contributed by o c oh or o c or as in groups of carboxyl or ester from carboxylate and uronic acids as can be seen in table 4 the contents of c c h and c o n in eps did not change significantly with the change of pros due to universality of these functional groups in organic matters of eps however the molar ratios of c o or o c o in epsmono pros epslop pros and epship pros increased from 2 7 to 8 6 and to 12 2 respectively while the molar ratio of o c oh or o c or decreased from 6 8 to 5 1 and to 2 6 respectively the composition analysis has shown that protein content in eps increased greatly with the increase of polymerization degree of pros hence the large quantities of proteins in eps could increase the amide content in eps and thereby the amount of c o groups in eps on the other hand the different contents of o c oh or o c or in epsmono pros epslop pros and epship pros are mainly attributed to different contents of carbonyl in fed pros for example as the mono pros aspartic acid has 2 carboxyl groups in each molecule in addition as the lop pros soya peptone will also get more carboxyl groups in partial proteolysis of soya proteins the cleavage of a peptide bond produces a carboxyl and an amino group as for hip pros the functionality of carboxyl groups is low because of the dehydration condensation reaction between carboxyl and amino group it might be the reason that the molar ratios of o c oh or o c or in epsmono pros and epslop pros were relatively higher than that in epship pros the o 1s peak of each eps was decomposed into two peaks fig 7 a2 b2 and c2 o c bond in carbonyl carboxylate amide or ester groups at a binding energy of 531 4 ev and c o c or c o h in alcohol hemiacetal or acetal groups at a binding energy of 532 7 ev yuan et al 2011 yin et al 2015 hao et al 2016 it was noteworthy that the molar ratio of c o c or c o h to total carbon decreased from 23 2 to 22 8 and to 12 4 in epsmono pros epslop pros and epship pros respectively table 4 as c o c or c o h is much associated with polysaccharides in eps badireddy et al 2008 yin et al 2015 this result is in good agreement with the composition analysis that the mass ratio of polysaccharides in eps were in the order of epsmono pros epslop pros epship pros in terms of o c bond epslop pros had the highest molar ratio of o c to total carbon among the three eps the reason was not well understood but could be related to the high amount of oxygen containing properties in epslop pros the n 1s peak could be decomposed into two peaks fig 7 a3 b3 and c3 the peak at 400 1 ev caused by nonprotonated nitrogen n nonpr in amides and amines and the peak at 401 6 ev originated from protonated amines n pr in basic amino acids or amino sugars yuan et al 2011 yin et al 2015 the molar ratio of n nonpr to total carbon was found to be increased from epsmono pros to epslop pros and then to epship pros corresponding to the increase of proteins in eps in lop pros and hip pros fed microbial aggregates on the other hand the n pr was only detected in epship pros to a certain extent indicating that more complex proteins were introduced into epship pros during the hydrolysis of hip pros 4 conclusions the current study explored the impact of polymerization degree of proteinaceous substrates i e mono lop and hip pros on chemical compositions and functional groups of eps in activated sludge systems the main findings of this study are summarized as follows 1 the change of polymerization degree of pros significantly altered the composition of eps in activated sludge compared to epsmono pros the proportion of proteins in epslop pros and epship pros increased by 12 8 and 27 7 respectively while the proportion of polysaccharides decreased by 22 9 and 63 6 respectively creating much higher protein polysaccharide ratio in epslop pros 1 1 and epship pros 2 7 than that in epsmono pros 0 77 moreover the proportion of humic compounds in epslop pros and epship pros were 6 and 16 fold higher than that in epsmono pros respectively 2 the increase of proteins and humic compounds in epship pros resulted in its more complex mw distribution than epsmono pros and epslop pros moreover the accumulation of humic compounds in epship pros increased the unsaturation degree of eps molecules and thereby reduced the energy requirement for electrons transition of amide bonds and aromatic groups in epship pros 3 the spectroscopic characterization revealed the dominance of hydrocarbon protein polysaccharide and aromatic associated bonds in all three eps nevertheless with the increase of polymerization degree of pros the protein associated bonds such as conh co nc nh increased while the polysaccharide associated bonds such as coc coh ocoh decreased the high cost of residual sludge treatment and membrane fouling are two major setbacks of activated sludge process or mbr system both issues are strongly influenced by the composition and properties of eps in activated sludge the results from this study provide better understanding on how pros in influent would impact residual sludge production and membrane fouling and may shed lights on how to alleviate both problems by manipulating the influent composition of wastewater acknowledgements the study was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51508511 natural science
