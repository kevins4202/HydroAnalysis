100 ml was adjusted to be 8 5 using 0 1 m naoh the n2 was sparged into eoms solutions for 30 min to obtain anaerobic condition then nabh4 was added into the eoms solution with three times weight of the eoms to obtain full reduction the reduction was considered to be accomplished when no further changes in the uv vis absorption were observed the reduced eoms solutions were sparged with air for 1 h to remove the residual bh4 2 5 photochemical reaction experiments all the irradiation experiments were conducted using a device equipped with xenon lamp 50 w cel hxf300 china emitting wavelength between 290 and 600 nm supplementary information fig s1 the average irradiation density was 30 2 mw cm2 which was stronger than the sun power i e 5 8 mw cm2 and the emitting wavelength of irradiation system was slightly richer in uv components than the sun light 295 nm 400nm 200 ml of 10 μm ctc solution 10 mm pb ph 6 8 was held in a cylindrical vessel reactor i d 80 mm v 300 ml effective path length l 3 8 cm the photolysis experiments were maintained at 25 0 5 c by water bath uv vis absorbance spectra of ctc were shown in fig s1 eoms toc 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 mgc l derived from microcystis aeruginosa scenedesmus meyen and chlorella vulgaris were added into the irradiation solutions respectively to investigate the photosensitive properties of eoms during the photolysis experiments aliquots of 1 0 ml filtrated samples were withdrawn from experimental solution then injected into brown vial for hplc analysis to selectively quench 3eoms excess sorbic acid 25 mg l was added into experimental mixture to measure the steady state concentrations of 3eoms 25 mg l tmp was added into experimental mixture mangalgiri and blaney 2017 all experiments were performed three times 2 6 analytical methods hplc dad agilent 1260 america was employed to detect the concentrations of ctc and tmp the mobile phase was run at a flow rate 1 ml min and consisted of hplc grade acetonitrile and 0 025 m kh2po4 v v 25 75 for ctc hplc grade methanol and 0 1 phosphoric acid v v 60 40 for tmp the separation of sample was conducted in the c18 reverse phase column 4 6 75 mm 5 μm agilent ctc and tmp were detected at wavelength of 355 nm and 275 nm respectively the photodegradation rate constants of ctc and tmp followed pseudo first order depletion were obtained by linear regression of ln c c0 at each sampling time 2 7 calculation of frontier molecular orbital and excitation energy the gaussian 09 is applied to optimize geometry of bp p meo ap ap and ctc with dft based on b3lyp 6 311 d p then the calculation of occupied molecular orbital homo lumo lu and chen 2012 and triplet excited states energy of bp p meo ap ap and ctc were calculated by gaussian 09 under consideration of solvent effect h2o 3 results and discussions 3 1 the photosensitizing efficiencies of different eoms to accelerate ctc photodegradation photosensitizing efficiency of eoms the photodegradations of ctc in neutral solutions ph 6 8 with and without eoms were compared in fig 1 a in the absence of eoms the direct photodegradation rate of ctc was 0 0152 min 1 in comparison the addition of eoms 4 mgc l significantly accelerated photodegradation of ctc with rate constants increasing by 1 6 2 1 times meanwhile a negligible loss of ctc was observed with addition of eoms in the dark conditions suggesting that both ctc hydrolysis and eoms adsorption played minimal roles in this process the accelerating photodegradation rates of ctc with presence of cv eoms 0 0317 min 1 and sm eoms 0 0290 min 1 were greater than that with presence of ma eoms 0 0246 min 1 notably the accelerating photodegradation rates of ctc with presence of eoms 0 0246 0 0317 min 1 were faster than that with presence of nom 0 0202 min 1 the obvious difference of the observed photosensitization efficiencies between eoms and nom may be attributed to the lower screening factor of eoms compared with nom the screening correction s of eoms nom was calculated with eqn s 3 the photodegradation rates of ctc with presence of eoms nom were corrected with s table s2 as showed in table s3 the corrected rates of ctc with presence of eoms 0 0268 0 0330 min 1 was still greater than that with presence of nom 0 0246 min 1 indicating that eoms exhibit higher photosensitization efficiencies than nom furthermore the effects of concentrations of eoms nom on ctc photodegradation were investigated as shown in fig 1 b photodegradation rate constants of ctc increased with eoms nom concentrations increasing therein when cv eoms concentration increased from 0 to 10 mgc l the enhancement of ctc photodegradation was most significant comparing with other eoms with cv eoms concentration increasing to 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 10 0 mgc l the photodegradation rate constants of ctc increased from 0 0157 min 1 in absence of cv eoms to 0 0249 min 1 2 mgc l 0 0317 min 1 4 mgc l 0 0372 min 1 6 mgc l 0 0481 min 1 8 mgc l and 0 0552 min 1 10 mgc l the increase of the corrected photodegradation rate constants with s table s3 was more significant it may be attributed to the increase of yield of reactive species with increasing concentration of eoms the role of oh 1 o 2 and 3 eom to investigate the role of reactive species rs such as oh 1o2 and 3eom et al in the process of ctc indirect photodegradation induced by eoms rs were selectively quenched by scavenger e g nan3 for oh and 1o2 isopropanol for oh and sorbic acid for 3eoms respectively ryan et al 2011 carlos et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 as shown in fig 2 in the presence of isopropanol and nan3 no obvious suppression of ctc photodegradation was observed indicating that the reaction of ctc with oh 1o2 contributed rarely to the total photodegradation notably the presence of sorbic acid significantly decreased the ctc photodegradation rate thus the enhancement impacts of eoms on ctc photodegradation were mainly attributed to the reaction between ctc and 3eoms 3nom with the contribution 90 formation of 3 eoms to quantify the formation of 3eoms the competition method was used where tmp was employed as a probe compound for 3eoms halladja et al 2007 minella et al 2013 romero maraccini et al 2013 bodhipaksha et al 2015 the observed rate constant of tmp photodegradation was calculated using eqn s 4 then the yield of 3eoms f tmp could be calculated using eq 1 zhou et al 2017 o connor et al 2019 1 f t m p k o b s t m p r a where k obs t m p is the observed rate constants for photodegradation of tmp ra is the light absorption rate of the experimental irradiation which could be calculated using eqn s5 s10 the calculated k o b s t m p and ra were illustrated in tables s5 s9 the calculated f tmp for eoms and nom were shown in fig 3 the f tmp for cv eoms sm eoms and ma eoms were 139 89 5 46 125 35 4 69 91 76 3 53 l mol photon which were higher than nom 72 84 4 45 l mol photon this difference in f tmp for eoms and nom may attribute to the different chemical compositions and structural properties of eoms and nom in addition the yield of 3eoms generated from cv eoms and sm eoms was significantly higher than that of 3eoms generated from ma eoms the difference in yield of 3eoms is supposed to depend on the specific chemical constituents and structure of eoms 3 2 relationship between photosensitization efficiencies of eoms and their chemical constituents and structures the chemical constitution of eoms to obtain the information of chemical constituents and structures all of eoms and nom samples were analyzed by ft icr ms as shown in table 1 the number of formulas isolated from eoms nom was in the range of 4000 6000 indicating that their constituents were very complex the o c ratios and h c ratios of formulas assigned in eoms mainly located in the range of 0 30 0 37 and 1 32 1 39 whereas in nom o c ratio and h c ratio were 0 26 and 0 92 those molecules shared similar signatures to carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules o c ratios 0 30 0 5 h c ratios 1 0 1 4 hertkorn et al 2008 notably the dbew double bond equivalency of eoms 9 73 12 36 was higher than that of nom 7 41 indicating a higher degree of unsaturation with eoms similarly dbe cw double bond equivalency to carbon ratio indicates the degree of aromaticity was higher in eoms wang et al 2017 in addition oxygen mass ratios of cv eoms sm eoms and ma eoms were calculated to be 24 6 23 1 and 20 5 respectively which were higher than that of nom 18 9 on basis of higher oxygen mass ratios and dbew higher content of oxygen containing unsaturated functional groups mainly carbonyl group might be contained in eoms the chemical functional groups of eoms all of eoms and nom samples were analyze by 13c nmr to further characterize their chemical functional groups the 13c nmr spectra fig s3 showed that all of eoms and nom contained carbonyl compounds 160 220 ppm and it was clear that all of three eoms showed markedly higher intensity signals of carbonyl groups than that of nom indicating that higher content of carbonyl compounds was contained in eoms the xps analysis core level spectra of oxygen o1s elements was subsequently conducted to quantitatively analyze the content of carbonyl compounds in eoms and nom the xps spectra scanning for eoms nom were shown in fig s4 the fitting results of o1s spectra fig 4 demonstrated that three of eoms and nom similarly contained two significant peaks including 531 73 ev for phenolic hydroxyl i e o c o h and 530 68 ev for carbonyl i e co after statistically fitting it was determined that the contents of carbonyl oxygen contributed 37 25 38 29 and 30 17 to oxygen containing structure of cv eoms sm eoms ma eoms respectively which were obviously richer than that of nom 28 89 table 2 the higher content of carbonyl in eoms indicates more carbonyl compounds contained in eoms those carbonyl compounds may result to higher photo reactivity of eoms which is consistent with previous report that ketone quinone compounds play an important role in photo reactivity of humic substance golanoski et al 2012 furthermore the percentage of carbonyl compounds content c ketones quinone were acquired from the eq 2 2 c ketones quinone r c o r oxygen 100 wherein r c o is carbonyl contribution obtained from xps fitting results and r oxygen is oxygen mass ratio obtained from fticr ms then the c ketones quinone of eoms nom were plotted against their f tmp to quantitatively access the relationship between carbonyl compounds content and obtained photosensitization efficiency of eoms nom as illustrated in fig 5 the positive linear correlation of c ketones quinone with f tmp was observed r2 0 9835 confirming that the higher photo reactivity of eoms was attributed to the higher content of carbonyl compounds in eoms 3 3 effect of nabh4 reduction on the photochemical properties of eoms nabh4 reduction was conducted to further confirm the role of carbonyl compounds in eoms photosensitizing given that nabh4 could reduce carbonyl groups to hydroxyl group aeschbacher et al 2010 zhou et al 2017 it was found that nabh4 reduction decreased the visible absorption of eoms and this absorption loss has been previously attributed to the removal of carbonyl ma et al 2010 effects of nabh4 reduction on photosensitization efficiency of eoms were further investigated after reduction k ctc 3eom was significantly decreased as shown in fig 6 among which k ctc 3eom of cv eom decreased greatly from 0 0172 min 1 to 0 0048 min 1 this further indicated that 3eoms dominantly generated from carbonyl compounds in eoms 3 4 photosensitizing mechanism of carbonyl compounds in eoms the photosensitizing mechanism of carbonyl compounds in eoms was proposed based previous reports and the dft calculation as reported in previous study the carbonyl compounds were motivated to the singlet excited states via electron transition when absorbed photons which then undergone intersystem crosses to a triplet excited state species mcneill and canonica 2016 parker et al 2013 wenk et al 2015 in this excitation process bp p meo ap and ap as the simple compounds with carbonyl group were selected as the proxies of carbonyl groups in eoms to provide evidence for the reason why the carbonyl groups in eoms are susceptible to be excited merkel et al 2008 canonica et al 2006 mcneill and canonica 2016 the frontier molecular orbitals were calculated via dft to determine the electron transition type of carbonyl compounds in eoms li et al 2012 the calculation results showed that the homo was a non bonding orbital n located on carbonyl oxygen atom and the lumo was an anti bonding orbital π as shown in fig 7 b therefore the homo lumo excitation of carbonyl group was assigned as n π electronic transition which required the lowest energy of all transition types e g n π n σ π π π σ σ σ σ π this calculation result was consistent with previous report that there was a small energy gap between lowest singlet state of bp and its excited triplet state shah et al 2004 reasonably carbonyl compounds in eoms are susceptible to be excited due to low energy required previous study of ctc photodegradation products in presence of eoms indicated that 3eoms could react with ctc via electron transfer tian et al 2019 meanwhile it was proposed that energy transfer from 3eoms to ctc was possible which would be confirmed by dft calculation in present study the results showed that the triplet excited state energy of bp p meo ap and ap were 284 92 288 85 and 265 50 kj mol table s11 which were all higher than that of ctc i e 217 46 kj mol clearly indicating that energy transfer from 3eoms to ctc was possible conclusions this study showed all eoms derived from three algae could effectively accelerate the photo transformation of ctc therefore the photodegradation of ctc is expected to be faster in surface waters enriched in algae three eoms could all accelerate ctc photodegradation in the order of cv eoms sm eoms ma eoms nom the triplet states of eoms were identified as dominant reactive species the yields of eom were calculated and the f tmp of cv eoms sm eoms ma eoms nom with ctc were 139 89 5 46 125 35 4 69 91 76 3 53 and 72 84 4 45 l mol photon respectively the positive correlation of f tmp with contents of carbonyl groups was observed accompanied with the apparent decline of photodegradation rate of ctc after eoms reduced suggesting the carbonyl compounds were dominant sensitizers in the photosensitizing process induced by eoms density functional theory calculation suggested the electronic transition from homo to lumo assigned as n π transition which requires the lowest energy of all transition types e g n π n σ π π π σ σ σ σ π resulting to susceptible excitation of carbonyl compounds in eoms under solar light the energy of excited triplet state benzophenone acetophenone and acetophenone the eoms model compounds was calculated to be 284 92 288 85 and 265 50 kj mol which was higher than that of ctc i e 217 46 kj mol indicating the energy transfer from excited triplet state to excited triplet state ctc was possible this result

prepared using freeze drying pretreatment hua et al 2017 2 4 sodium borohydride nabh4 reduction the previous reported method of nabh4 reduction was applied ma et al 2010 briefly ph of eoms solutions 100 ml was adjusted to be 8 5 using 0 1 m naoh the n2 was sparged into eoms solutions for 30 min to obtain anaerobic condition then nabh4 was added into the eoms solution with three times weight of the eoms to obtain full reduction the reduction was considered to be accomplished when no further changes in the uv vis absorption were observed the reduced eoms solutions were sparged with air for 1 h to remove the residual bh4 2 5 photochemical reaction experiments all the irradiation experiments were conducted using a device equipped with xenon lamp 50 w cel hxf300 china emitting wavelength between 290 and 600 nm supplementary information fig s1 the average irradiation density was 30 2 mw cm2 which was stronger than the sun power i e 5 8 mw cm2 and the emitting wavelength of irradiation system was slightly richer in uv components than the sun light 295 nm 400nm 200 ml of 10 μm ctc solution 10 mm pb ph 6 8 was held in a cylindrical vessel reactor i d 80 mm v 300 ml effective path length l 3 8 cm the photolysis experiments were maintained at 25 0 5 c by water bath uv vis absorbance spectra of ctc were shown in fig s1 eoms toc 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 mgc l derived from microcystis aeruginosa scenedesmus meyen and chlorella vulgaris were added into the irradiation solutions respectively to investigate the photosensitive properties of eoms during the photolysis experiments aliquots of 1 0 ml filtrated samples were withdrawn from experimental solution then injected into brown vial for hplc analysis to selectively quench 3eoms excess sorbic acid 25 mg l was added into experimental mixture to measure the steady state concentrations of 3eoms 25 mg l tmp was added into experimental mixture mangalgiri and blaney 2017 all experiments were performed three times 2 6 analytical methods hplc dad agilent 1260 america was employed to detect the concentrations of ctc and tmp the mobile phase was run at a flow rate 1 ml min and consisted of hplc grade acetonitrile and 0 025 m kh2po4 v v 25 75 for ctc hplc grade methanol and 0 1 phosphoric acid v v 60 40 for tmp the separation of sample was conducted in the c18 reverse phase column 4 6 75 mm 5 μm agilent ctc and tmp were detected at wavelength of 355 nm and 275 nm respectively the photodegradation rate constants of ctc and tmp followed pseudo first order depletion were obtained by linear regression of ln c c0 at each sampling time 2 7 calculation of frontier molecular orbital and excitation energy the gaussian 09 is applied to optimize geometry of bp p meo ap ap and ctc with dft based on b3lyp 6 311 d p then the calculation of occupied molecular orbital homo lumo lu and chen 2012 and triplet excited states energy of bp p meo ap ap and ctc were calculated by gaussian 09 under consideration of solvent effect h2o 3 results and discussions 3 1 the photosensitizing efficiencies of different eoms to accelerate ctc photodegradation photosensitizing efficiency of eoms the photodegradations of ctc in neutral solutions ph 6 8 with and without eoms were compared in fig 1 a in the absence of eoms the direct photodegradation rate of ctc was 0 0152 min 1 in comparison the addition of eoms 4 mgc l significantly accelerated photodegradation of ctc with rate constants increasing by 1 6 2 1 times meanwhile a negligible loss of ctc was observed with addition of eoms in the dark conditions suggesting that both ctc hydrolysis and eoms adsorption played minimal roles in this process the accelerating photodegradation rates of ctc with presence of cv eoms 0 0317 min 1 and sm eoms 0 0290 min 1 were greater than that with presence of ma eoms 0 0246 min 1 notably the accelerating photodegradation rates of ctc with presence of eoms 0 0246 0 0317 min 1 were faster than that with presence of nom 0 0202 min 1 the obvious difference of the observed photosensitization efficiencies between eoms and nom may be attributed to the lower screening factor of eoms compared with nom the screening correction s of eoms nom was calculated with eqn s 3 the photodegradation rates of ctc with presence of eoms nom were corrected with s table s2 as showed in table s3 the corrected rates of ctc with presence of eoms 0 0268 0 0330 min 1 was still greater than that with presence of nom 0 0246 min 1 indicating that eoms exhibit higher photosensitization efficiencies than nom furthermore the effects of concentrations of eoms nom on ctc photodegradation were investigated as shown in fig 1 b photodegradation rate constants of ctc increased with eoms nom concentrations increasing therein when cv eoms concentration increased from 0 to 10 mgc l the enhancement of ctc photodegradation was most significant comparing with other eoms with cv eoms concentration increasing to 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 10 0 mgc l the photodegradation rate constants of ctc increased from 0 0157 min 1 in absence of cv eoms to 0 0249 min 1 2 mgc l 0 0317 min 1 4 mgc l 0 0372 min 1 6 mgc l 0 0481 min 1 8 mgc l and 0 0552 min 1 10 mgc l the increase of the corrected photodegradation rate constants with s table s3 was more significant it may be attributed to the increase of yield of reactive species with increasing concentration of eoms the role of oh 1 o 2 and 3 eom to investigate the role of reactive species rs such as oh 1o2 and 3eom et al in the process of ctc indirect photodegradation induced by eoms rs were selectively quenched by scavenger e g nan3 for oh and 1o2 isopropanol for oh and sorbic acid for 3eoms respectively ryan et al 2011 carlos et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 as shown in fig 2 in the presence of isopropanol and nan3 no obvious suppression of ctc photodegradation was observed indicating that the reaction of ctc with oh 1o2 contributed rarely to the total photodegradation notably the presence of sorbic acid significantly decreased the ctc photodegradation rate thus the enhancement impacts of eoms on ctc photodegradation were mainly attributed to the reaction between ctc and 3eoms 3nom with the contribution 90 formation of 3 eoms to quantify the formation of 3eoms the competition method was used where tmp was employed as a probe compound for 3eoms halladja et al 2007 minella et al 2013 romero maraccini et al 2013 bodhipaksha et al 2015 the observed rate constant of tmp photodegradation was calculated using eqn s 4 then the yield of 3eoms f tmp could be calculated using eq 1 zhou et al 2017 o connor et al 2019 1 f t m p k o b s t m p r a where k obs t m p is the observed rate constants for photodegradation of tmp ra is the light absorption rate of the experimental irradiation which could be calculated using eqn s5 s10 the calculated k o b s t m p and ra were illustrated in tables s5 s9 the calculated f tmp for eoms and nom were shown in fig 3 the f tmp for cv eoms sm eoms and ma eoms were 139 89 5 46 125 35 4 69 91 76 3 53 l mol photon which were higher than nom 72 84 4 45 l mol photon this difference in f tmp for eoms and nom may attribute to the different chemical compositions and structural properties of eoms and nom in addition the yield of 3eoms generated from cv eoms and sm eoms was significantly higher than that of 3eoms generated from ma eoms the difference in yield of 3eoms is supposed to depend on the specific chemical constituents and structure of eoms 3 2 relationship between photosensitization efficiencies of eoms and their chemical constituents and structures the chemical constitution of eoms to obtain the information of chemical constituents and structures all of eoms and nom samples were analyzed by ft icr ms as shown in table 1 the number of formulas isolated from eoms nom was in the range of 4000 6000 indicating that their constituents were very complex the o c ratios and h c ratios of formulas assigned in eoms mainly located in the range of 0 30 0 37 and 1 32 1 39 whereas in nom o c ratio and h c ratio were 0 26 and 0 92 those molecules shared similar signatures to carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules o c ratios 0 30 0 5 h c ratios 1 0 1 4 hertkorn et al 2008 notably the dbew double bond equivalency of eoms 9 73 12 36 was higher than that of nom 7 41 indicating a higher degree of unsaturation with eoms similarly dbe cw double bond equivalency to carbon ratio indicates the degree of aromaticity was higher in eoms wang et al 2017 in addition oxygen mass ratios of cv eoms sm eoms and ma eoms were calculated to be 24 6 23 1 and 20 5 respectively which were higher than that of nom 18 9 on basis of higher oxygen mass ratios and dbew higher content of oxygen containing unsaturated functional groups mainly carbonyl group might be contained in eoms the chemical functional groups of eoms all of eoms and nom samples were analyze by 13c nmr to further characterize their chemical functional groups the 13c nmr spectra fig s3 showed that all of eoms and nom contained carbonyl compounds 160 220 ppm and it was clear that all of three eoms showed markedly higher intensity signals of carbonyl groups than that of nom indicating that higher content of carbonyl compounds was contained in eoms the xps analysis core level spectra of oxygen o1s elements was subsequently conducted to quantitatively analyze the content of carbonyl compounds in eoms and nom the xps spectra scanning for eoms nom were shown in fig s4 the fitting results of o1s spectra fig 4 demonstrated that three of eoms and nom similarly contained two significant peaks including 531 73 ev for phenolic hydroxyl i e o c o h and 530 68 ev for carbonyl i e co after statistically fitting it was determined that the contents of carbonyl oxygen contributed 37 25 38 29 and 30 17 to oxygen containing structure of cv eoms sm eoms ma eoms respectively which were obviously richer than that of nom 28 89 table 2 the higher content of carbonyl in eoms indicates more carbonyl compounds contained in eoms those carbonyl compounds may result to higher photo reactivity of eoms which is consistent with previous report that ketone quinone compounds play an important role in photo reactivity of humic substance golanoski et al 2012 furthermore the percentage of carbonyl compounds content c ketones quinone were acquired from the eq 2 2 c ketones quinone r c o r oxygen 100 wherein r c o is carbonyl contribution obtained from xps fitting results and r oxygen is oxygen mass ratio obtained from fticr ms then the c ketones quinone of eoms nom were plotted against their f tmp to quantitatively access the relationship between carbonyl compounds content and obtained photosensitization efficiency of eoms nom as illustrated in fig 5 the positive linear correlation of c ketones quinone with f tmp was observed r2 0 9835 confirming that the higher photo reactivity of eoms was attributed to the higher content of carbonyl compounds in eoms 3 3 effect of nabh4 reduction on the photochemical properties of eoms nabh4 reduction was conducted to further confirm the role of carbonyl compounds in eoms photosensitizing given that nabh4 could reduce carbonyl groups to hydroxyl group aeschbacher et al 2010 zhou et al 2017 it was found that nabh4 reduction decreased the visible absorption of eoms and this absorption loss has been previously attributed to the removal of carbonyl ma et al 2010 effects of nabh4 reduction on photosensitization efficiency of eoms were further investigated after reduction k ctc 3eom was significantly decreased as shown in fig 6 among which k ctc 3eom of cv eom decreased greatly from 0 0172 min 1 to 0 0048 min 1 this further indicated that 3eoms dominantly generated from carbonyl compounds in eoms 3 4 photosensitizing mechanism of carbonyl compounds in eoms the photosensitizing mechanism of carbonyl compounds in eoms was proposed based previous reports and the dft calculation as reported in previous study the carbonyl compounds were motivated to the singlet excited states via electron transition when absorbed photons which then undergone intersystem crosses to a triplet excited state species mcneill and canonica 2016 parker et al 2013 wenk et al 2015 in this excitation process bp p meo ap and ap as the simple compounds with carbonyl group were selected as the proxies of carbonyl groups in eoms to provide evidence for the reason why the carbonyl groups in eoms are susceptible to be excited merkel et al 2008 canonica et al 2006 mcneill and canonica 2016 the frontier molecular orbitals were calculated via dft to determine the electron transition type of carbonyl compounds in eoms li et al 2012 the calculation results showed that the homo was a non bonding orbital n located on carbonyl oxygen atom and the lumo was an anti bonding orbital π as shown in fig 7 b therefore the homo lumo excitation of carbonyl group was assigned as n π electronic transition which required the lowest energy of all transition types e g n π n σ π π π σ σ σ σ π this calculation result was consistent with previous report that there was a small energy gap between lowest singlet state of bp and its excited triplet state shah et al 2004 reasonably carbonyl compounds in eoms are susceptible to be excited due to low energy required previous study of ctc photodegradation products in presence of eoms indicated that 3eoms could react with ctc via electron transfer tian et al 2019 meanwhile it was proposed that energy transfer from 3eoms to ctc was possible which would be confirmed by dft calculation in present study the results showed that the triplet excited state energy of bp p meo ap and ap were 284 92 288 85 and 265 50 kj mol table s11 which were all higher than that of ctc i e 217 46 kj mol clearly indicating that energy transfer from 3eoms to ctc was possible conclusions this study showed all eoms derived from three algae could effectively accelerate the photo transformation of ctc therefore the photodegradation of ctc is expected to be faster in surface waters enriched in algae three eoms could all accelerate ctc photodegradation in the order of cv eoms sm eoms ma eoms nom the triplet states of eoms were identified as dominant reactive species the yields of eom were calculated and the f tmp of cv eoms sm eoms ma eoms nom with ctc were 139 89 5 46 125 35 4 69 91 76 3 53 and 72 84 4 45 l mol photon respectively the positive correlation of f tmp with contents of carbonyl groups was observed accompanied with the apparent decline of photodegradation rate of ctc after eoms reduced suggesting the carbonyl compounds were dominant sensitizers in the photosensitizing process induced by eoms density functional theory calculation suggested the electronic transition from homo to lumo assigned as n π transition which requires the lowest energy of all transition types e g n π n σ π π π σ σ σ σ π resulting to susceptible excitation of carbonyl compounds in eoms under solar light the energy of excited triplet state benzophenone acetophenone and acetophenone the eoms model compounds was calculated to be 284 92 288 85 and 265 50 kj mol which was higher than that of ctc i e 217 46 kj mol indicating the energy transfer from excited triplet state to excited triplet state ctc was possible this result highlighted that the strong ability to enhance the photodegradation of ctc was attributed to the high content of carbonyl compounds in eoms and provided a descriptor to estimate the sensitizing

18561,limited understanding of wastewater streams produced from shale oil and gas wells impedes best practices of wastewater treatment and reuse this study provides a comprehensive and comparative analysis of flowback and produced water from three major and newly developed shale plays the bakken shale north dakota the barnett shale texas and the denver julesburg dj basin colorado in central and western united states geochemical features that included more than 10 water quality parameters dissolved organic matter as well as microbial community structures were characterized and compared results showed that wastewater from bakken and barnett shales has extremely high salinity 295 g l total dissolved solids tds and low organic concentration 80 252 mg l dissolved organic carbon doc in contrast dj basin showed an opposite trend with low tds 30 g l and high organic content 644 mg l doc excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectra demonstrated that more humic acid and fluvic acid like organics with higher aromaticity existed in bakken wastewater than that in barnett and dj basin microbial communities of bakken samples were dominated by fe iii reducing bacteria geobacter lactic acid bacteria lactococcus and enterococcus and bradyrhizobium while dj basin water showed higher abundance of rhodococcus thermovirga and sulfate reducing bacteria thermotoga and petrotoga all these bacteria are capable of hydrocarbon degradation hydrogenotrophic methanogens dominated the archaeal communities in all samples graphical abstract image 1 keywords flowback water produced water shale oil shale gas fluorescence spectroscopy wastewater treatment 1 introduction the exploration of unconventional shale oil and gas has been greatly advanced by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing but the accompanied wastewater problem also became a major environmental concern from 2004 to 2018 the dry natural gas production from u s shale and tight plays increased by more than 30 fold from less than 2 billion cubic feet per day bcf d to more than 65 bcf d the u s has become the world s largest producer of natural gas since 2009 and the largest crude oil producer since 2018 eia 2018 popova et al 2018 traditional hydraulic fracturing consumes large volume water with each well injecting 2 7 million gallons fracking fluid during hydraulic fracturing operation after that approximately 10 40 of the injected fluid flows back to the surface in the next 7 10 days which is called flowback water in addition stable but much lower volume of contaminated water is produced during the lifespan of a well which is referred as produced water the disposal of these wastewater streams has been a major challenge for the industry and neighbouring communities generated wastewater was estimated 11 41 31 41 and 55 27 billion gallons per year for the shale plays of marcellus bakken and barnett respectively from 2012 to 2014 kondash and vengosh 2015 these waste streams contain a high concentration of dissolved solids uncharacteristic chemicals and sometimes heavy metals and naturally occurring radioactive materials norm that raised concerns on public health and the environment in addition microbial growth in the water may lead to biofouling and corrosion of equipment and pipelines booker et al 2017 cluff et al 2014 mohan et al 2013b wang et al 2012c deep well injection without treatment has largely been restricted due to increased seismic activities and to effectively treat and reuse this complex wastewater comprehensive understanding of the water geochemical and microbiological characteristics is very much needed in the u s almost all expansion of oil and natural gas production between 2011 and 2014 attributed to seven regions including marcellus and utica in the eastern u s and bakken niobrara permian haynesville and eagle ford in the central and western u s many studies on flowback produced water focused on marcellus shale which greatly improved our understanding on the water s chemical composition and microbial community structures chapman et al 2012 daly et al 2016 mohan et al 2013a vikram et al 2016 recently there was a shift on studying the oil rich plays in central and western u s due to their unique geological formations and high volume production fallgren et al 2013 kondash et al 2018 oetjen et al 2018 shrestha et al 2017 bakken and three forks formations are estimated to have the largest domestic oil reserve gaswirth et al 2013 and by 2019 bakken oil production is projected to reach 1 3 million barrels per day surpassing eagle ford to become the largest tight oil producing formation in the u s popova et al 2018 previous studies on newly explored bakken shale mainly focused on the environmental impacts water reuse and geochemical characterizations scanlon et al 2014 shrestha et al 2017 and there is limited information so far on organic constituents and microbial populations in flowback and produced waters for example there was one study explained the distribution of organic compounds including aliphatics cycloaliphatics aromatics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in produced water and fracturing fluids from bakken strong et al 2013 and two studies analyzed microbial communities in bakken but reported different results from different samples one study found that bacillales halanaerobiales and pseudomonadales were dominant in produced water lipus et al 2018 while another study showed that halanaerobium and marinobacter species were main species in flowback water samples strong et al 2013 it s not clear if the discrepancy of microbial community structure across the bakken region is related to the biocide composition of fracturing fluid geographic variation or other well parameters but so far no study provided a comprehensive analysis of flowback produced water in bakken and other central western shales in the united states in this study we investigated flowback and produced water samples from three major shale plays including bakken north dakota barnett texas and denver julesburg dj basin colorado in the central and western u s more than 10 water quality parameters were examined to characterize geochemical properties of the wastewater three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy was used to reveal the composition of dissolved organic matter in these fluids both bacterial and archaeal community structures were characterized using 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing the rich information provided here will greatly improve the understanding of wastewater characteristics from these formations and it will provide critical information for designing appropriate treatment and reuse processes for managing these wastewater streams 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sample collection samples were collected from three shale plays in central and western u s the bakken shale north dakota the barnett shale texas and the denver julesburg dj basin colorado in bakken shale three sampling sites located in williams county nd were used in which two of them were newly drilled shale oil wells that reached to bakken depth of around 8300 feet and three forks formations 100 feet deep below bakken formation respectively flowback water samples were collected from each site and labelled as bk f 1 and bk f 2 bakken formation at day 9 after hydraulic fracturing as well as tf f 1 and tf f 2 three forks formation at day 8 after hydraulic fracturing the third sampling site in bakken shale was a 400 barrel produced water storage tank which was labelled as bk p in barnett shale flowback water samples labeled as bn f were collected at day 6 after hydraulic fracturing from a well at a depth of 7860 feet at permian basin tarrant county tx and produced water samples bn p at day 128 were collected produced water samples labelled as dj p were collected at day 140 after fracking from a well of niobrara formation at a depth of around 7000 ft located in weld county co this well was employing gel based hydraulic fracturing fluid which mainly included acetic acid polyethylene glycol guar gum hydrochloric acid methanol ethylene glycol proprietary surfactants and clay etc all samples were collected with sterile plastic bottles and transported to the lab overnight before being stored at 4 c best practice was used in preparing shipping storing and analyzing the water samples to minimize composition change microbial analyses and organic characterizations were performed right after sample arrival which were followed by other

spectra were obtained by scanning the sample over excitation wavelengths from 240 to 400 nm with 10 nm steps and emission wavelengths from 300 to 550 nm with 2 nm steps using a spectrofluorometer fluoromax 4 horiba jobin yvon inc nj the spectrum of milli q water at a wavelength of 350 nm was recorded as a blank and the equipment was auto zeroed prior to analysis the eem spectra were divided by

quantitative fluorescence analysis korak et al 2014 all spectra were corrected to 1 mg l doc with a scale range of 0 0 6 dahm et al 2012 since the contour plot of eem spectra only demonstrates the qualitative distribution of organics fluorescence regional integration fri was used for quantitative analysis of 3d eem based on integration of the area beneath eem spectra over fluorescence intensity to obtain area volume chen et al 2003 each area volume beneath region i of the eem spectra was normalized to relative regional areas φ i n using a multiplication factor the percent fluorescence response p i n of each spectra region was calculated as p i n φ i n φ t n 100 where the φ t n was a cumulative φ i n for the entire region 2 4 bacterial and archaeal community analyses water samples

exhibits a wide salinity range of 680 345 000 mg l barbot et al 2013 strong et al 2013 in this study flowback water from different formations the three forks formations tf f and the bakken formation bk f of the bakken shale demonstrated a similar tds which was consistent with the finding by lipus et al lipus et al 2018 where no significant difference in tds for samples collected from these two formations wells age 270 1241 days this could be attributed to the adjacent location of three forks and bakken formations for samples from bakken and barnett shales flowback water showed higher tph tcod dcod and toc doc concentration than produced water which can be attributed to residual chemicals derived from initial injection fluids vengosh et al 2014 the ph of all samples in these two shales were acidic with a range between 4 0 and 5 3 while the water in dj basin showed a relatively neutral ph of 7 6 the doc of water samples in the bakken and barnett shales had an average number of 198 mg l flowback water and 106 mg l produced water respectively which were lower than that of 644 mg l produced water in dj basin previous studies have also reported the doc of 41 132 and 758 mg l in bakken shale lipus et al 2018 and dj basin respectively rosenblum et al 2016 in this study differences of doc in three shale plays may because of different types of fracking fluids used in the operation dj basin generally uses a water based viscous polymeric hydraulic fracturing fluid and the gel forming agent e g guar gum which was considered responsible for a significant portion of the doc rosenblum et al 2017 diversely water based no viscous slick water fracturing fluids are generally used in the barnett marcellus and bakken plays gandossi 2013 the concentrations of major ions and elements in flowback and produced water were analyzed as well table 2 the distribution of metal contents was largely dependent on the shale reservoir geology and chemicals added to the fracturing fluid in the bakken shale the concentration of major metals ca mg sr from flowback and produced water were positively correlated with tds ca r2 0 97 mg r2 0 99 sr r2 0 98 compared with bakken water samples from barnett shale showed lower k ca na sr and total iron concentrations but higher levels of br and mg si only existed in the produced water from dj basin the chloride concentration of water samples from three shale plays ranged from low saline in the dj basin 19 084 mg l to hypersaline in the barnett shale 123 646 mg l and bakken shale 200 568 mg l chloride as the major anion 62 72 weight of tds was strongly correlated with tds r2 0 98 regardless of geographical location and sample sources the produced water contained 10 5 13 6 more chloride than flowback water bromide also showed a positive correlation with tds r2 0 95 but it only accounted for 0 3 0 5 of tds the major cations na and ca2 accounted for 8 1 10 2 of the total tds produced water from bakken and barnett shales were highly saline and dominated by na ca cl compositions 3 2 dissolved organic matter in flowback and produced water characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy the flowback produced water containing artificial and natural contaminants is more chemically complex compared to common domestic wastewater because the number of organic contaminants that can be measured in a lab are finite using chemical analyses it is difficult to depict a whole profile of organic contaminants in these wastewaters and their spatial variations instrumental analyses such as gas liquid chromatography mass spectrometry gc lc ms and magnetic resonance imaging mri are powerful approaches but are expensive and non real time on the basis of the phenomenon that most organic molecules including proteins pigments and bacterial metabolites e g amino fulvic and humic substances have a characteristic of fluorescent emission three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy can provide relatively comprehensive information on these organics from complex mixtures by changing excitation and emission wavelength simultaneously in a real time way compared with conventional fluorescence and uv vis eem fluorescence spectroscopy has advantages of higher selectivity wider range and fewer interactions and overlaps of the different spectra lu et al 2012a in this study eem fluorescence spectroscopy was used to characterize the dissolved organic matter dom in flowback and produced water fig 1 the eem spectra of flowback and produced water samples in three forks and bakken formations tf f bk f and bk p demonstrated the same peaks peaks a b and c in the regions of iii iv and v respectively the distribution of fluorescence intensities from two flowback water locations tf f and bk f were similar as well peak a showed the maximum fluorescence intensity corresponding to the eem of fulvic acid like substances baker 2002 compared with flowback water the produced water bk p showed an increase of fluorescence intensity of peak b corresponding to the eem of tyrosine substances that are generally microbial byproducts coble 1996 indicating the enhancement of microbial metabolism in wastewater with time of exploitation in the meantime intensity of peak c representing humic acid like substances decreased moreover all peaks of produced water located in region v showed a 10 nm blue shift compared with flowback water previous study showed that such blue shift was associated with the break up of the large molecules into smaller fragments and a decomposition of condensed aromatic moieties wang et al 2015 samples from barnett shale bn f and bn p were rarely fluorophores detected in peak a and c except a low intensity of peak b indicating few fulvic acid like and humic acid like organics were present samples collected from dj basin dj p only exhibited strong fluorescence intensity of peak b which agreed with the observation by rosenblum et al for produced water 400 days age in dj basin rosenblum et al 2017 specific ultraviolet absorbance suva can provide an insight into the aromatic character of organics compared with a suva of 0 51 0 62 l mg m in the bakken shale the suva found in the barnett shale and dj basin was far lower 0 08 0 13 l mg m table 1 indicating a lower aromaticity in these waters this result is in agreement with their eem spectra with few fluorophores of humic acid and fluvic acid like organics eem spectra were also employed for semiquantitative analysis using fluorescence regional integration fri fri is not used for identification of discrete sepcific molecules but it can be a fast and effective method for quantitative comparison of compounds with multilayer peaks and fluorescing regions we divided the eem into five regions and the distribution of the fluorescence response p i n in flowback and produced water was shown in fig 2 the fri method assigned regions of an eem to specific organic fractions aromatic proteins region i and ii fulvic acid like region iii soluble microbial byproducts region iv and humic acid like region v rosario ortiz and korak 2016 for the bakken shale flowback water tf f and bk f exhibited the highest p i n in region iii while produced water bk p p i n showed a decrease in region iii and a slight increase in region i and region ii indicating a different distribution of dissolved organics between flowback and produced water for water samples from the barnett and dj basin bn f bn p and dj p p i n showed a similar distribution with the highest p i n in region iv where the soluble microbial byproducts were dominant substances previous studies have demonstrated a strongly positive correlation between eem fluorescence intensity and the real concentration of microbial byproducts and aromatic proteins in produced water dahm et al 2012 stoll et al 2015 moreover an acquisition of eem spectra can be real time by using a device in the form of sensor li et al 2016 all these indicated a possibility to in situ obtain the organic composition of flowback produced water 3 3 bacterial and archaeal community structures of flowback and produced water from bakken shale and dj basin bacterial community structures in flowback and produced water samples from bakken shale and dj basin were analyzed using 16s rrna marker gene based surveys samples from bakken shale tf f and bk f showed a similar biodiversity with a shannon biodiversity index ranging between 3 08 and 3 4 which is higher than that of 2 49 observed for sample from dj basin table 3 however to put this number in the context of soil waste sludge or wastewater samples that contain easily biodegradable organics and have a shannon index of 5 8 the microbial diversity of the shale gas water were far lower lu et al 2012b 2014 2015b this may be due to a selective enrichment of specific microbial consortia in flowback and produced water with recalcitrant pollutants many studies also found that a temporal increase high salinity and biocide addition led to the decrease of biodiversity in produced water davis et al 2012 mohan et al 2013b struchtemeyer and elshahed 2012 tf f and bk f in the bakken shale showed a similar bacterial community structure the majority of sequences were classified to the phyla proteobacteria 39 3 60 8 firmicute 21 7 37 1 and bacteroidetes 8 9 13 6 fig 3 a the deltaproteobacteria 29 1 75 6 and alphaproteobacteria 14 9 60 8 were the most abundant classes within proteobacteria fig 3d the 17 1 28 2 of deltaproteobacteria were geobacter a known species of iron reducing bacteria fig 3c previous studies rarely found geobacter sp in produced water a recent study reported a high abundance of geobacter 4 2 6 5 observed in produced water from high temperature 70 90 c oil reservoirs near segno texas kim et al 2018 geobacter sp are dissimilatory fe iii reducing bacteria they are able to utilize soluble insoluble fe iii humic and anthraquinone substances as electron acceptors lin et al 2004 voordeckers et al 2010 which can be coupled with a wide range of electron donors such as acetate hydrogen and aromatic compounds wang et al 2012b yang et al 2015 the roles of geobacter sp in here need to be further investigated alphaproteobacteria were mostly related to the genus bradyrhizobium 4 3 29 8 fig 3c which has been reported as the symbiotic nitrogen fixing nodule bacteria that can utilize hydrocarbons as the sole carbon and energy source this is consistent with the presence of abundant petroleum hydrocarbons in the flowback water from bakken shale firmicute and bacteroidetes are generally associated with anaerobic and fermentative bacteria which could utilize a wide range of organic compounds including sugars organic acids alcohols or amino acids wuchter et al 2013 most identified firmicute belonged to the class bacilli 17 6 30 1 and the majority of these sequences were affiliated with lactic acid bacteria lactococcus and enterococcus e g lactococcus chungangensis and enterococcus lemanii which were generally detected in oil production water with the ability of degrading petroleum hydrocarbons including n hexadecane and phenanthrene cho et al 2008 bacterial community structure of dj basin water was drastically different from that in the other two locations actinobacteria 49 4 was the predominant phylum while firmicute 7 9 bacteroidetes 1 6 and proteobacteria 2 3 were at low abundance the majority of actinobacteria are affiliated with the genus rhodococcus 43 8 which has been reported to exhibit a high metabolic diversity and used in bioremediation of hydrocarbons kuyukina et al 2005 larkin et al 2005 other three phyla deferribacteres 14 thermotogae 10 and synergistetes 9 5 were found to be dominant only in the dj p sample thermotogae are mostly related to thermophilic anaerobe thermotoga and petrotoga these genera are frequently observed in oil producing fields and are capable of reducing sulfur thiosulfate and sulfite to hydrogen sulfide miranda tello et al 2004 takahata et al 2001 thermovirga is a dominant genus from synergistetes and was isolated from hot oil well production water dahle and birkeland 2006 the overall diversity of archaeal communities shannon index 0 06 0 31 was far lower than that of bacteria table 3 unlike bacterial communities water samples from dj basin had the highest archaeal biodiversity all the archaeal sequences belonged to the phylum euryarchaeota with the majority of them affiliated with the hydrogenotrophic methanogen order methanobacteriales which accounted for more than 99 99 and 94 of the total population in tf f bk f and dj p respectively the bakken shale and dj basin exhibited a distinct distribution of archaeal genus with the predominant genus of methanobrevibacter 99 3 99 9 and methanothermobacter 94 2 respectively fig 4 these methanogens were likely responsible for hydrogenotrophic methane production the remaining sequences in dj p were mainly affiliated with the genus thermococcus 3 5 distinct clusters of bacterial community structures were presented by weighted fast unifrac principal coordinates analysis pcoa in fig 5 in the microbial community structures flowback water from bakken shale tf f and bk f and produced water from dj basin dj p formed two distinct clusters based on the geographical location the first and second components of pcoa explained a total 100 of structure diversities of bacterial communities 3 4 implications for flowback and produced water treatment this study provided comprehensive characterizations of flowback and produced water samples generated from shale plays in the central and western u s such information is valuable as obtaining related water samples is challenging due to the confidential nature of related operations and with such information appropriate wastewater management strategies can be developed although deep well injection is still a cheaper disposal solution in many places such as the bakken and barnett shales horner et al 2016 nicot et al 2014 wastewater treatment and reuse become increasingly popular due to limited disposal wells environmental concerns and regulations and limited availability of fresh water for example marcellus shale reuses up to 90 of the flowback and produced water for hydraulic fracturing after softening vidic et al 2013 warner et al 2013 in barnett shale evaporative technologies that utilize waste heat from gas compressors are used to reduce the water volume before being injected into disposal wells mccurdy 2011 the choice of treatment technology for oil gas wastewater reuse depends on water properties treatment goals associated cost and many other factors tds removal is the primary goal for produced water treatment and reuse under the federal safe drinking water act tds as a secondary maximum contaminant level smcl has a recommended maximum level of 500 mg l by the us epa epa 2017 depending on the salinity level different desalination processes can be deployed such as reverse osmosis ro 30 000 45 000 mg l tds chang et al 2019 and microbial electrochemical processes 16 000 mg l tds stoll et al 2015 for produced water with low salinity thermal distillation crystallization mechanical vapor compression mvc membrane distillation md forward osmosis fo and high pressure reverse osmosis hpro can be used to treat produced water with high salinity 35 000 300 000 mg l tds estrada and bhamidimarri 2016 schantz et al 2018 shaffer et al 2013 dissolved air flotation daf and coagulation can serve as the pretreatment to remove suspended solids oil and grease before desalination a recent study reported that half of produced water treatment systems utilized a combination of either chemical precipitation and daf or electrocoagulation and media filtration for basic separation in marcellus barnett fayetteville eagle ford haynesville shale plays during 2014 2017 mohammad pajooh et al 2018 another goal for produced water treatment is the removal of organic matters includig dissolved and undissolved substances such as biocides and corrosion inhibiters used in fracturing fluid kahrilas et al 2014 aliphatic hydrocarbon polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons alkyl phenols aromatic amines and alkyl aromatics etc butkovskyi et al 2017 orem et al 2014 organics can cause equipment and pipeline fouling advanced treatment processes such as biological treatment and advanced oxidation process aop are generally designed for organics removal estrada and bhamidimarri 2016 lobo et al 2016 biological treatment is sustainable and inexpensive but is challenged by high salinity water 45 000 mg l tds due to the inhibition to biological activities and resulting in microbial cell lysing kargi and dincer 1996 for example the cod removal of a flowback water using an activated sludge treatment declined from 90 to 60 when tds concentration increased from 1500 mg l to 45 000 mg l lester et al 2013 recent studies reported that hybrid biological processes containing both free and fixed biomass may be feasible in actual produced water treatment with moderate salinity grandclement et al 2017 lusinier et al 2019 for example under a condition of 10 460 18 170 mg l tds biological active filtration baf achieved up to 90 doc and 80 cod removal freedman et al 2017 however flowback and produced water in bakken and barnett shales with extreme high tds 300 g l tds may not be suitable for conventional biological treatment such as activated sludge membrane bioreactor mbr or baf which is in contrast with dj basin with relative low tds and high doc concentrations aop e g uv h2o2 and photo fenton degradation of organics is also highly efficient through generation of the reactive hydroxyl radical ho however the existence of abundant ho scavengers of chlorides and bromides in shale gas wastewater may cause the low organics removal lester et al 2015 therefore aop processes have generally been placed following the desalination unit aop has another benefit in microorganism inactivation although few sulfate reducing bacteria were detected in wastewater from bakken and barnett shales abundant sulfate reducing bacteria affiliated with thermotogae 10 such as thermotoga and petrotoga were found in the produced water of dj basin this indictates that these microorganisms were not completely killed by biocide in fracturing fluid and they could potentially lead to the corrosion of equipment and pipeline aop can be considered as a last guardian process for disinfection and elimination of residual organics before water reuse other new treatment technologies such as microbial desalination cell mdc and microbial capacitive deionization cell mcdc or microbial electrolytic carbon capture mecc can simultaneously remove salinity and organics without the energy input chen et al 2019 forrestal et al 2016 lu et al 2015a shrestha et al 2018 they can be a cost effective alternative for dj basin wastewater treatment for example stoll et al has demonstrated a 100 mg l reactor volume h of doc removal and a desalination rate of 36 mg tds g carbon h electrode for produced water treatment using mcdc stoll et al 2015 because there is no one size fits all solution the characterizations of the waste streams from specific sites are important to help identify the most optimized treatment processes due to various constraints ranging from business secret concerns to limited accessibility to wells the samples obtained in this study may not represent the overall characteristics of the whole play further studies are needed to collect more samples across each entire play with temporal and spatial distributions for more comprehensive characterizations 4 conclusions this study provided a detailed investigation on the geochemical and microbial characteristics of flowback and produced water from three shale oil gas plays in the central and western u s where limited information is available to date the wastewater from the bakken and barnett shales contained extremely high salinity na ca cl compositions and low organics while samples from the denver julesburg dj basin showed opposite trends organics compositions as well as microbial community structure in wastewater were found highly dependent on the shale location hydrocarbon degrading bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens dominated the bacterial and archaeal communities respectively in all samples unexpected fe iii reducing bacteria geobacter showed high abundance in bakken shale communities which has not been reported in previous studies the results obtained here provide guidance and support for wastewater treatment and reuse in these fields declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

18561,limited understanding of wastewater streams produced from shale oil and gas wells impedes best practices of wastewater treatment and reuse this study provides a comprehensive and comparative analysis of flowback and produced water from three major and newly developed shale plays the bakken shale north dakota the barnett shale texas and the denver julesburg dj basin colorado in central and western united states geochemical features that included more than 10 water quality parameters dissolved organic matter as well as microbial community structures were characterized and compared results showed that wastewater from bakken and barnett shales has extremely high salinity 295 g l total dissolved solids tds and low organic concentration 80 252 mg l dissolved organic carbon doc in contrast dj basin showed an opposite trend with low tds 30 g l and high organic content 644 mg l doc excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectra demonstrated that more humic acid and fluvic acid like organics with higher aromaticity existed in bakken wastewater than that in barnett and dj basin microbial communities of bakken samples were dominated by fe iii reducing bacteria geobacter lactic acid bacteria lactococcus and enterococcus and bradyrhizobium while dj basin water showed higher abundance of rhodococcus thermovirga and sulfate reducing bacteria thermotoga and petrotoga all these bacteria are capable of hydrocarbon degradation hydrogenotrophic methanogens dominated the archaeal communities in all samples graphical abstract image 1 keywords flowback water produced water shale oil shale gas fluorescence spectroscopy wastewater treatment 1 introduction the exploration of unconventional shale oil and gas has been greatly advanced by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing but the accompanied wastewater problem also became a major environmental concern from 2004 to 2018 the dry natural gas production from u s shale and tight plays increased by more than 30 fold from less than 2 billion cubic feet per day bcf d to more than 65 bcf d the u s has become the world s largest producer of natural gas since 2009 and the largest crude oil producer since 2018 eia 2018 popova et al 2018 traditional hydraulic fracturing consumes large volume water with each well injecting 2 7 million gallons fracking fluid during hydraulic fracturing operation after that approximately 10 40 of the injected fluid flows back to the surface in the next 7 10 days which is called flowback water in addition stable but much lower volume of contaminated water is produced during the lifespan of a well which is referred as produced water the disposal of these wastewater streams has been a major challenge for the industry and neighbouring communities generated wastewater was estimated 11 41 31 41 and 55 27 billion gallons per year for the shale plays of marcellus bakken and barnett respectively from 2012 to 2014 kondash and vengosh 2015 these waste streams contain a high concentration of dissolved solids uncharacteristic chemicals and sometimes heavy metals and naturally occurring radioactive materials norm that raised concerns on public health and the environment in addition microbial growth in the water may lead to biofouling and corrosion of equipment and pipelines booker et al 2017 cluff et al 2014 mohan et al 2013b wang et al 2012c deep well injection without treatment has largely been restricted due to increased seismic activities and to effectively treat and reuse this complex wastewater comprehensive understanding of the water geochemical and microbiological characteristics is very much needed in the u s almost all expansion of oil and natural gas production between 2011 and 2014 attributed to seven regions including marcellus and utica in the eastern u s and bakken niobrara permian haynesville and eagle ford in the central and western u s many studies on flowback produced water focused on marcellus shale which greatly improved our understanding on the water s chemical composition and microbial community structures chapman et al 2012 daly et al 2016 mohan et al 2013a vikram et al 2016 recently there was a shift on studying the oil rich plays in central and western u s due to their unique geological formations and high volume production fallgren et al 2013 kondash et al 2018 oetjen et al 2018 shrestha et al 2017 bakken and three forks formations are estimated to have the largest domestic oil reserve gaswirth et al 2013 and by 2019 bakken oil production is projected to reach 1 3 million barrels per day surpassing eagle ford to become the largest tight oil producing formation in the u s popova et al 2018 previous studies on newly explored bakken shale mainly focused on the environmental impacts water reuse and geochemical characterizations scanlon et al 2014 shrestha et al 2017 and there is limited information so far on organic constituents and microbial populations in flowback and produced waters for example there was one study explained the distribution of organic compounds including aliphatics cycloaliphatics aromatics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in produced water and fracturing fluids from bakken strong et al 2013 and two studies analyzed microbial communities in bakken but reported different results from different samples one study found that bacillales halanaerobiales and pseudomonadales were dominant in produced water lipus et al 2018 while another study showed that halanaerobium and marinobacter species were main species in flowback water samples strong et al 2013 it s not clear if the discrepancy of microbial community structure across the bakken region is related to the biocide composition of fracturing fluid geographic variation or other well parameters but so far no study provided a comprehensive analysis of flowback produced water in bakken and other central western shales in the united states in this study we investigated flowback and produced water samples from three major shale plays including bakken north dakota barnett texas and denver julesburg dj basin colorado in the central and western u s more than 10 water quality parameters were examined to characterize geochemical properties of the wastewater three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy was used to reveal the composition of dissolved organic matter in these fluids both bacterial and archaeal community structures were characterized using 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing the rich information provided here will greatly improve the understanding of wastewater characteristics from these formations and it will provide critical information for designing appropriate treatment and reuse processes for managing these wastewater streams 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sample collection samples were collected from three shale plays in central and western u s the bakken shale north dakota the barnett shale texas and the denver julesburg dj basin colorado in bakken shale three sampling sites located in williams county nd were used in which two of them were newly drilled shale oil wells that reached to bakken depth of around 8300 feet and three forks formations 100 feet deep below bakken formation respectively flowback water samples were collected from each site and labelled as bk f 1 and bk f 2 bakken formation at day 9 after hydraulic fracturing as well as tf f 1 and tf f 2 three forks formation at day 8 after hydraulic fracturing the third sampling site in bakken shale was a 400 barrel produced water storage tank which was labelled as bk p in barnett shale flowback water samples labeled as bn f were collected at day 6 after hydraulic fracturing from a well at a depth of 7860 feet at permian basin tarrant county tx and produced water samples bn p at day 128 were collected produced water samples labelled as dj p were collected at day 140 after fracking from a well of niobrara formation at a depth of around 7000 ft located in weld county co this well was employing gel based hydraulic fracturing fluid which mainly included acetic acid polyethylene glycol guar gum hydrochloric acid methanol ethylene glycol proprietary surfactants and clay etc all samples were collected with sterile plastic bottles and transported to the lab overnight before being stored at 4 c best practice was used in preparing shipping storing and analyzing the water samples to minimize composition change microbial analyses and organic characterizations were performed right after sample arrival which were followed by other parameters 2 2 chemical analyses total dissolved solids tds and total suspended solids tss were determined using standard methods 2540c and 2540d respectively apha 2005 total organic carbon toc and

absorbance suva was calculated as uv254 doc 100 2 3 three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy and fluorescence regional integration fri analysis the eem fluorescence spectra were obtained by scanning the sample over excitation wavelengths from 240 to 400 nm with 10 nm steps and emission wavelengths from 300 to 550 nm with 2 nm steps using a spectrofluorometer fluoromax 4 horiba jobin yvon inc nj the spectrum of milli q water at a wavelength of 350 nm was recorded as a blank and the equipment was auto zeroed prior to analysis the eem spectra were divided by five excitation emission regions forrestal et al 2015 region i aromatic proteins i ex em 240 250 300 330 region ii aromatic proteins ii ex em 240 250 330 380 region iii fulvic acid like ex em 240 250

quantitative fluorescence analysis korak et al 2014 all spectra were corrected to 1 mg l doc with a scale range of 0 0 6 dahm et al 2012 since the contour plot of eem spectra only demonstrates the qualitative distribution of organics fluorescence regional integration fri was used for quantitative analysis of 3d eem based on integration of the area beneath eem spectra over fluorescence intensity to obtain area volume chen et al 2003 each area volume beneath region i of the eem spectra was normalized to relative regional areas φ i n using a multiplication factor the percent fluorescence response p i n of each spectra region was calculated as p i n φ i n φ t n 100 where the φ t n was a cumulative φ i n for the entire region 2 4 bacterial and archaeal community analyses water samples were filtered using sterilized 0 22 μm filters microbial cell containing filters were then cut into small pieces for genomic dna extraction using a powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc ca according to the manufacturer s instructions the genomic dna of most samples were successfully extracted except samples bk p from bakken shale and the samples bn f and bn p from barnett shale which has too little liquid volume to collect the enough microorganisms for extraction the isolated genomic dna was purified by a powerclean pro dna clean up kit mo bio laboratories inc ca to remove

using pcr grade h2o instead of water samples and dna template respectively to exclude the potential contaminations during operation amplicons were sequenced on a roche 454 gs flx platform according to standard protocols quality control was conducted by removing low quality reads bioinformatics analysis was carried out according to previously described methods lu et al 2014 2015b briefly muscle

dj basin showed a low average salinity of 30 600 mg l tds table 1 these data agree with previous studies which reported the tds range of 3550 340 750 mg l for bakken lipus et al 2018 strong et al 2013 21 581 300 155 mg l for barnett torres et al 2016 and 22 500 24 700 mg l for dj basin lester et al 2015 rosario ortiz and korak 2016 for comparison the marcellus play located in the eastern u s exhibits a wide salinity range of 680 345 000 mg l barbot et al 2013 strong et al 2013 in this study flowback water from different formations the three forks formations tf f and the bakken formation bk f of the bakken shale demonstrated a similar tds which was consistent with the finding by lipus et al lipus et al 2018 where no significant difference in tds for samples collected from these two formations wells age 270 1241 days this could be attributed to the adjacent location of three forks and bakken formations for samples from bakken and barnett shales flowback water showed higher tph tcod dcod and toc doc concentration than produced water which can be attributed to residual chemicals derived from initial injection fluids vengosh et al 2014 the ph of all samples in these two shales were acidic with a range between 4 0 and 5 3 while the water in dj basin showed a relatively neutral ph of 7 6 the doc of water samples in the bakken and barnett shales had an average number of 198 mg l flowback water and 106 mg l produced water respectively which were lower than that of 644 mg l produced water in dj basin previous studies have also reported the doc of 41 132 and 758 mg l in bakken shale lipus et al 2018 and dj basin respectively rosenblum et al 2016 in this study differences of doc in three shale plays may because of different types of fracking fluids used in the operation dj basin generally uses a water based viscous polymeric hydraulic fracturing fluid and the gel forming agent e g guar gum which was considered responsible for a significant portion of the doc rosenblum et al 2017 diversely water based no viscous slick water fracturing fluids are generally used in the barnett marcellus and bakken plays gandossi 2013 the concentrations of major ions and elements in flowback and produced water were analyzed as well table 2 the distribution of metal contents was largely dependent on the shale reservoir geology and chemicals added to the fracturing fluid in the bakken shale the concentration of major metals ca mg sr from flowback and produced water were positively correlated with tds ca r2 0 97 mg r2 0 99 sr r2 0 98 compared with bakken water samples from barnett shale showed lower k ca na sr and total iron concentrations but higher levels of br and mg si only existed in the produced water from dj basin the chloride concentration of water samples from three shale plays ranged from low saline in the dj basin 19 084 mg l to hypersaline in the barnett shale 123 646 mg l and bakken shale 200 568 mg l chloride as the major anion 62 72 weight of tds was strongly correlated with tds r2 0 98 regardless of geographical location and sample sources the produced water contained 10 5 13 6 more chloride than flowback water bromide also showed a positive correlation with tds r2 0 95 but it only accounted for 0 3 0 5 of tds the major cations na and ca2 accounted for 8 1 10 2 of the total tds produced water from bakken and barnett shales were highly saline and dominated by na ca cl compositions 3 2 dissolved organic matter in flowback and produced water characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy the flowback produced water containing artificial and natural contaminants is more chemically complex compared to common domestic wastewater because the number of organic contaminants that can be measured in a lab are finite using chemical analyses it is difficult to depict a whole profile of organic contaminants in these wastewaters and their spatial variations instrumental analyses such as gas liquid chromatography mass spectrometry gc lc ms and magnetic resonance imaging mri are powerful approaches but are expensive and non real time on the basis of the phenomenon that most organic molecules including proteins pigments and bacterial metabolites e g amino fulvic and humic substances have a characteristic of fluorescent emission three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy can provide relatively comprehensive information on these organics from complex mixtures by changing excitation and emission wavelength simultaneously in a real time way compared with conventional fluorescence and uv vis eem fluorescence spectroscopy has advantages of higher selectivity wider range and fewer interactions and overlaps of the different spectra lu et al 2012a in this study eem fluorescence spectroscopy was used to characterize the dissolved organic matter dom in flowback and produced water fig 1 the eem spectra of flowback and produced water samples in three forks and bakken formations tf f bk f and bk p demonstrated the same peaks peaks a b and c in the regions of iii iv and v respectively the distribution of fluorescence intensities from two flowback water locations tf f and bk f were similar as well peak a showed the maximum fluorescence intensity corresponding to the eem of fulvic acid like substances baker 2002 compared with flowback water the produced water bk p showed an increase of fluorescence intensity of peak b corresponding to the eem of tyrosine substances that are generally microbial byproducts coble 1996 indicating the enhancement of microbial metabolism in wastewater with time of exploitation in the meantime intensity of peak c representing humic acid like substances decreased moreover all peaks of produced water located in region v showed a 10 nm blue shift compared with flowback water previous study showed that such blue shift was associated with the break up of the large molecules into smaller fragments and a decomposition of condensed aromatic moieties wang et al 2015 samples from barnett shale bn f and bn p were rarely fluorophores detected in peak a and c except a low intensity of peak b indicating few fulvic acid like and humic acid like organics were present samples collected from dj basin dj p only exhibited strong fluorescence intensity of peak b which agreed with the observation by rosenblum et al for produced water 400 days age in dj basin rosenblum et al 2017 specific ultraviolet absorbance suva can provide an insight into the aromatic character of organics compared with a suva of 0 51 0 62 l mg m in the bakken shale the suva found in the barnett shale and dj basin was far lower 0 08 0 13 l mg m table 1 indicating a lower aromaticity in these waters this result is in agreement with their eem spectra with few fluorophores of humic acid and fluvic acid like organics eem spectra were also employed for semiquantitative analysis using fluorescence regional integration fri fri is not used for identification of discrete sepcific molecules but it can be a fast and effective method for quantitative comparison of compounds with multilayer peaks and fluorescing regions we divided the eem into five regions and the distribution of the fluorescence response p i n in flowback and produced water was shown in fig 2 the fri method assigned regions of an eem to specific organic fractions aromatic proteins region i and ii fulvic acid like region iii soluble microbial byproducts region iv and humic acid like region v rosario ortiz and korak 2016 for the bakken shale flowback water tf f and bk f exhibited the highest p i n in region iii while produced water bk p p i n showed a decrease in region iii and a slight increase in region i and region ii indicating a different distribution of dissolved organics between flowback and produced water for water samples from the barnett and dj basin bn f bn p and dj p p i n showed a similar distribution with the highest p i n in region iv where the soluble microbial byproducts were dominant substances previous studies have demonstrated a strongly positive correlation between eem fluorescence intensity and the real concentration of microbial byproducts and aromatic proteins in produced water dahm et al 2012 stoll et al 2015 moreover an acquisition of eem spectra can be real time by using a device in the form of sensor li et al 2016 all these indicated a possibility to in situ obtain the organic composition of flowback produced water 3 3 bacterial and archaeal community structures of flowback and produced water from bakken shale and dj basin bacterial community structures in flowback and produced water samples from bakken shale and dj basin were analyzed using 16s rrna marker gene based surveys samples from bakken shale tf f and bk f showed a similar biodiversity with a shannon biodiversity index ranging between 3 08 and 3 4 which is higher than that of 2 49 observed for sample from dj basin table 3 however to put this number in the context of soil waste sludge or wastewater samples that contain easily biodegradable organics and have a shannon index of 5 8 the microbial diversity of the shale gas water were far lower lu et al 2012b 2014 2015b this may be due to a selective enrichment of specific microbial consortia in flowback and produced water with recalcitrant pollutants many studies also found that a temporal increase high salinity and biocide addition led to the decrease of biodiversity in produced water davis et al 2012 mohan et al 2013b struchtemeyer and elshahed 2012 tf f and bk f in the bakken shale showed a similar bacterial community structure the majority of sequences were classified to the phyla proteobacteria 39 3 60 8 firmicute 21 7 37 1 and bacteroidetes 8 9 13 6 fig 3 a the deltaproteobacteria 29 1 75 6 and alphaproteobacteria 14 9 60 8 were the most abundant classes within proteobacteria fig 3d the 17 1 28 2 of deltaproteobacteria were geobacter a known species of iron reducing bacteria fig 3c previous studies rarely found geobacter sp in produced water a recent study reported a high abundance of geobacter 4 2 6 5 observed in produced water from high temperature 70 90 c oil reservoirs near segno texas kim et al 2018 geobacter sp are dissimilatory fe iii reducing bacteria they are able to utilize soluble insoluble fe iii humic and anthraquinone substances as electron acceptors lin et al 2004 voordeckers et al 2010 which can be coupled with a wide range of electron donors such as acetate hydrogen and aromatic compounds wang et al 2012b yang et al 2015 the roles of geobacter sp in here need to be further investigated alphaproteobacteria were mostly related to the genus bradyrhizobium 4 3 29 8 fig 3c which has been reported as the symbiotic nitrogen fixing nodule bacteria that can utilize hydrocarbons as the sole carbon and energy source this is consistent with the presence of abundant petroleum hydrocarbons in the flowback water from bakken shale firmicute and bacteroidetes are generally associated with anaerobic and fermentative bacteria which could utilize a wide range of organic compounds including sugars organic acids alcohols or amino acids wuchter et al 2013 most identified firmicute belonged to the class bacilli 17 6 30 1 and the majority of these sequences were affiliated with lactic acid bacteria lactococcus and enterococcus e g lactococcus chungangensis and enterococcus lemanii which were generally detected in oil production water with the ability of degrading petroleum hydrocarbons including n hexadecane and phenanthrene cho et al 2008 bacterial community structure of dj basin water was drastically different from that in the other two locations actinobacteria 49 4 was the predominant phylum while firmicute 7 9 bacteroidetes 1 6 and proteobacteria 2 3 were at low abundance the majority of actinobacteria are affiliated with the genus rhodococcus 43 8 which has been reported to exhibit a high metabolic diversity and used in bioremediation of hydrocarbons kuyukina et al 2005 larkin et al 2005 other three phyla deferribacteres 14 thermotogae 10 and synergistetes 9 5 were found to be dominant only in the dj p sample thermotogae are mostly related to thermophilic anaerobe thermotoga and petrotoga these genera are frequently observed in oil producing fields and are capable of reducing sulfur thiosulfate and sulfite to hydrogen sulfide miranda tello et al 2004 takahata et al 2001 thermovirga is a dominant genus from synergistetes and was isolated from hot oil well production water dahle and birkeland 2006 the overall diversity of archaeal communities shannon index 0 06 0 31 was far lower than that of bacteria table 3 unlike bacterial communities water samples from dj basin had the highest archaeal biodiversity all the archaeal sequences belonged to the phylum euryarchaeota with the majority of them affiliated with the hydrogenotrophic methanogen order methanobacteriales which accounted for more than 99 99 and 94 of the total population in tf f bk f and dj p respectively the bakken shale and dj basin exhibited a distinct distribution of archaeal genus with the predominant genus of methanobrevibacter 99 3 99 9 and methanothermobacter 94 2 respectively fig 4 these methanogens were likely responsible for hydrogenotrophic methane production the remaining sequences in dj p were mainly affiliated with the genus thermococcus 3 5 distinct clusters of bacterial community structures were presented by weighted fast unifrac principal coordinates analysis pcoa in fig 5 in the microbial community structures flowback water from bakken shale tf f and bk f and produced water from dj basin dj p formed two distinct clusters based on the geographical location the first and second components of pcoa explained a total 100 of structure diversities of bacterial communities 3 4 implications for flowback and produced water treatment this study provided comprehensive characterizations of flowback and produced water samples generated from shale plays in the central and western u s such information is valuable as obtaining related water samples is challenging due to the confidential nature of related operations and with such information appropriate wastewater management strategies can be developed although deep well injection is still a cheaper disposal solution in many places such as the bakken and barnett shales horner et al 2016 nicot et al 2014 wastewater treatment and reuse become increasingly popular due to limited disposal wells environmental concerns and regulations and limited availability of fresh water for example marcellus shale reuses up to 90 of the flowback and produced water for hydraulic fracturing after softening vidic et al 2013 warner et al 2013 in barnett shale evaporative technologies that utilize waste heat from gas compressors are used to reduce the water volume before being injected into disposal wells mccurdy 2011 the choice of treatment technology for oil gas wastewater reuse depends on water properties treatment goals associated cost and many other factors tds removal is the primary goal for produced water treatment and reuse under the federal safe drinking water act tds as a secondary maximum contaminant level smcl has a recommended maximum level of 500 mg l by the us epa epa 2017 depending on the salinity level different desalination processes can be deployed such as reverse osmosis ro 30 000 45 000 mg l tds chang et al 2019 and microbial electrochemical processes 16 000 mg l tds stoll et al 2015 for produced water with low salinity thermal distillation crystallization mechanical vapor compression mvc membrane distillation md forward osmosis fo and high pressure reverse osmosis hpro can be used to treat produced water with high salinity 35 000 300 000 mg l tds estrada and bhamidimarri 2016 schantz et al 2018 shaffer et al 2013 dissolved air flotation daf and coagulation can serve as the pretreatment to remove suspended solids oil and grease before desalination a recent study reported that half of produced water treatment systems utilized a combination of either chemical precipitation and daf or electrocoagulation and media filtration for basic separation in marcellus barnett fayetteville eagle ford haynesville shale plays during 2014 2017 mohammad pajooh et al 2018 another goal for produced water treatment is the removal of organic matters includig dissolved and undissolved substances such as biocides and corrosion inhibiters used in fracturing fluid kahrilas et al 2014 aliphatic hydrocarbon polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons alkyl phenols aromatic amines and alkyl aromatics etc butkovskyi et al 2017 orem et al 2014 organics can cause equipment and pipeline fouling advanced treatment processes such as biological treatment and advanced oxidation process aop are generally designed for organics removal estrada and bhamidimarri 2016 lobo et al 2016 biological treatment is sustainable and inexpensive but is challenged by high salinity water 45 000 mg l tds due to the inhibition to biological activities and resulting in microbial cell lysing kargi and dincer 1996 for example the cod removal of a flowback water using an activated sludge treatment declined from 90 to 60 when tds concentration increased from 1500 mg l to 45 000 mg l lester et al 2013 recent studies reported that hybrid biological processes containing both free and fixed biomass may be feasible in actual produced water treatment with moderate salinity grandclement et al 2017 lusinier et al 2019 for example under a condition of 10 460 18 170 mg l tds biological active filtration baf achieved up to 90 doc and 80 cod removal freedman et al 2017 however flowback and produced water in bakken and barnett shales with extreme high tds 300 g l tds may not be suitable for conventional biological treatment such as activated sludge membrane bioreactor mbr or baf which is in contrast with dj basin with relative low tds and high doc concentrations aop e g uv h2o2 and photo fenton degradation of organics is also highly efficient through generation of the reactive hydroxyl radical ho however the existence of abundant ho scavengers of chlorides and bromides in shale gas wastewater may cause the low organics removal lester et al 2015 therefore aop processes have generally been placed following the desalination unit aop has another benefit in microorganism inactivation although few sulfate reducing bacteria were detected in wastewater from bakken and barnett shales abundant sulfate reducing bacteria affiliated with thermotogae 10 such as thermotoga and petrotoga were found in the produced water of dj basin this indictates that these microorganisms were not completely killed by biocide in fracturing fluid and they could potentially lead to the corrosion of equipment and pipeline aop can be considered as a last guardian process for disinfection and elimination of residual organics before water reuse other new treatment technologies such as microbial desalination cell mdc and microbial capacitive deionization cell mcdc or microbial electrolytic carbon capture mecc can simultaneously remove salinity and organics without the energy input chen et al 2019 forrestal et al 2016 lu et al 2015a shrestha et al 2018 they can be a cost effective alternative for dj basin wastewater treatment for example stoll et al has demonstrated a 100 mg l reactor volume h of doc removal and a desalination rate of 36 mg tds g carbon h electrode for produced water treatment using mcdc stoll et al 2015 because there is no one size fits all solution the characterizations of the waste streams from specific sites are important to help identify the most optimized treatment processes due to various constraints ranging from business secret concerns to limited accessibility to wells the samples obtained in this study may not represent the overall characteristics of the whole play further studies are needed to collect more samples across each entire play with temporal and spatial distributions for more comprehensive characterizations 4 conclusions this study provided a detailed investigation on the geochemical and microbial characteristics of flowback and produced water from three shale oil gas plays in the central and western u s where limited information is available to date the wastewater from the bakken and barnett shales contained extremely high salinity na ca cl compositions and low organics while samples from the denver julesburg dj basin showed opposite trends organics compositions as well as microbial community structure in wastewater were found highly dependent on the shale location hydrocarbon degrading bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens dominated the bacterial and archaeal communities respectively in all samples unexpected fe iii reducing bacteria geobacter showed high abundance in bakken shale communities which has not been reported in previous studies the results obtained here provide guidance and support for wastewater treatment and reuse in these fields declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

18562,anticancer drugs are among the most toxic chemicals which are commercially produced therefore their release in aquatic ecosystems raised concerns in regard to potential adverse effects this article describes the results of risk assessments concerning their environmental safety which are based on data generated in the frame of a coordinated eu project cytothreat eight research institutions participated in the project and four widely used anticancer drugs with different mechanisms of therapeutic action 5 fluorouracil 5fu cisplatin cddp imatinib mesylate im and etoposide et were tested in a variety of indicator organisms cyanobacteria algae higher plants rotifers crustacea fish and also in human and fish derived cell lines in acute subacute chronic toxicity assays furthermore genotoxic effects in micronucleus assays single cell gel electrophoresis experiments and γh2ax tests were studied in plants crustacea fish and in various cell lines we used the results to calculate the predicted no effect concentrations pnec and risk quotients rq by comparing pnec with predicted environmental concentrations pec values and measured concentrations mec in wastewaters the most sensitive species in experiments concerning acute toxic and long term effects were in general crustacea daphnids after chronic treatment the most pronounced effects were detected with im followed by cddp and 5fu comparisons between pnec and pec values indicate that it is unlikely that the release of these drugs in the aquatic environments leads to adverse effects rq values 1 however when the assessments were performed with mec found in highly contaminated municipal wastewaters and hospital effluents rq values were obtained which are indicative for moderate adverse effects of im calculations with data from genotoxicity experiments and pec values are indicative for increased rq values for all compounds except et the most sensitive species were fish danio rerio which were highly responsive towards 5fu and daphnids which were sensitive towards cddp and im when environmental data from waste waters were used for the calculations high rq values 100 were obtained for cddp and im these overall conclusions were not substantially altered when the effects of other frequently used cytostatic drugs and combined effects of mixtures of anticancer drugs were taken into consideration the results of these assessments underline the importance of efficient removal of these chemicals by improved sewage treatment strategies and the need for further investigations of adverse the long term effects of cytostatics in aquatic biota as a consequence of damage of the genetic material in highly sensitive species graphical abstract image 1 keywords 5 fluorouracil etoposide cisplatin imatinib mesilate risk assessment toxicity 1 introduction anticancer cytostatic drugs were developed to kill cancer cells in humans these chemicals are among the most toxic chemicals which are commercially produced and are the only pharmaceutical products explicitly classified as hazardous under the waste framework directive of the european commission ec directive 2008 their release in waste waters raised concerns about potential adverse effects in aquatic ecosystems johnson et al 2008 kümmerer 2001 as a consequence efforts were made to develop efficient removal strategies zhang et al 2013 to understand their fate in the environment besse et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 and to evaluate their toxic effects in a variety of organisms kümmer et al 2009b zounkova et al 2007 the findings of these studies were used to assess their potential environmental risks the results depended strongly on the approaches that were used it was concluded in most publications that the no observed effect concentrations noecs of certain cytostatics are higher than their environmental concentrations and that it is therefore unlikely that their release causes adverse effects in ecosystems booker et al 2014 xie 2012 zhang et al 2013 the results of these earlier environmental risk assessments ras of widely used anticancer drugs are based on relatively limited data concerning their acute subacute and sometimes chronic toxic effects and do not include data on the genotoxic properties of these compounds furthermore ra calculations of anticancer drugs are often difficult since reliable information on their fate in the environment and their biological degradation is scare therefore a coordinated project cytothreat was supported by the european union http www cytothreat eu eight institutions participated in this initiative which focused on four important widely used anticancer drugs namely 5 fluorouracil 5fu cisplatin cddp etoposide et and imatinib mesylate im the ecotoxicological properties of the compounds were studied in eleven indicator organisms including bacteria phytoplankton higher plants crustacea rotifers mussels and fish and also in human and fish derived cell lines in regard to their acute and or long term effects table 1 furthermore genotoxicity assays including micronucleus mn assays single cell gel electrophoresis scge γh2ax and gene mutation tests were conducted with several indicator organisms and with cell lines in vitro the findings were published recently in a number of papers for details see table 1 the present article focuses mainly on environmental ras on the basis of results which were obtained in the frame of this project the subsequent chapters describe the rationale for the selection of the compounds chapter 2 their use and mechanisms of their therapeutic action chapter 3 the indicator organisms and methods chapter 4 the selection of data that were used for the ras chapter 5 and the calculations which are based on a guideline for medicinal products for human use which was published by the european medicines agency 2006 chapter 6 apart from calculations for individual compounds we included also assessments of combined effects chapter 6 3 chapter 7 describes calculations on the basis of environmental concentrations of the drugs chapter 8 summarizes results of studies concerning acute and genotoxic effects of hospital and municipal wastewaters in different organisms the last chapter 9 contains conclusions and discusses the possible impact of long term contamination of ecosystems with genotoxins 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection of the drugs the drugs were selected on the basis of two criteria namely a their use in the european union and b their modes of therapeutic action for the calculation of the predicted environmental concentration pec values information concerning their consumption is required table 2 lists data for european countries which were recently published their corresponding pecs as well as their chemical properties and the concentrations which were found in environmental samples strong regional differences exist in regard to the use of the different drugs at present im is by far more expensive as 5fu or cddp therefore its regional use varies over a broad range for example substantially lower amounts were given to patients in slovenia compared to france or germany table 2 this however may change in the future also for other drugs differences exist which have to be taken into consideration in environmental risk estimates for details concerning their consumption see franquet griell et al 2015 in the present study we used pecs which were published by besse et al 2012 for france as these values reflect the consumption of a large population notably they are higher as in other european countries such as spain and slovenia see table 2 2 2 use and mechanisms of therapeutic action of the studied compounds the compounds which were studied are representatives of different important groups of cytostatics their chemical structures are shown in fig 1 5fu fig 1a is a pyrimidine analogue which acts as an antimetabolite and was developed in the 1950s fischer and ganellin 2006 5fu and several structurally related derivatives are currently used for local and systemic cancer treatment straub 2010 et fig 1b is a topoisomerase inhibitor and causes single and double strand breaks it is on the market since the 1960s and prescribed predominantly for treatment of breast ovarian gastric cancers and leukemia iarc 2000 cddp fig 1c and other platinum compounds are dna crosslinking agents jackson et al 1996 these drugs are used for the treatment of different forms of cancer for example for testicular ovarian bladder and lung tumours dasari and tchounwou 2014 im fig 1d is representative of protein kinase inhibitors used for targeted chemotherapy it was developed in the 1990 s for specific cancers in particular for myeloid leukemia its therapeutic mode of action is based on selective inhibition of aberrantly expressed thymidine kinases in cancer cells for details see waller 2010 2 3 indicator organisms and methods the different anticancer drugs were studied in acute subacute and chronic toxicity experiments with aquatic organisms representing different trophic levels phytoplankton cyanobacteria and algae and plants represent primary producers invertebrates rotifers crustacea and mussels are primary consumers while vertebrates fish are secondary consumers the tests were performed according to standardised guidelines for details see table 1 the indicator species are specified in table 1 genotoxic effects were studied in higher plants crustacea and also zebrafish furthermore cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were monitored in experiments with human cells hepg2 and isolated human peripheral lymphocytes and in a fish derived cell line zfl which was used in earlier investigations with waste waters pomati et al 2007 genotoxicity tests included the scge assay which is based on the detection migration of damaged dna in an electric field tice et al 2000 and was performed with crustacea fishes and different cell lines furthermore mn assays which reflect chromosomal damage clastogenicity and aneuploidy norppa and falck 2003 stopper and muller 1997 were performed in higher plants fish and cell lines with human cells also γh2ax experiments which detect histone acetylation that is induced by repair of double strand breaks mah et al 2010 were carried out furthermore also bacterial tests were realized namely the sos chromotest with coliform bacteria escherichia coli which reflects induction of dna repair as a consequence of damage of the genetic material quillardet and hofnung 1993 as well as salmonella microsome tests which detect gene mutations maron and ames 1984 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of acute and subchronic toxicity and genotoxicity tests with the different cytostatics the results that were obtained in the frame of the project are summarized in tables 3 4 more details can be found in supplementary tables 1 8 findings which are relevant for ras are summarized in the following subchapters results of relevant experiments with selected species are shown in table 5 3 1 1 5 fluorouracil it can be seen in table 5 that the most sensitive chronic test was the reproduction inhibition assay with daphnia magna the no observed effect concentration noec after 21 days was 2 0 μg l parrella et al 2014b in algae and cyanobacteria the noec values were higher 10 0 and 120 0 μg l respectively brezovšek et al 2014 in the sub chronic toxicity assay 33 day early life stage toxicity test with zebrafish the noec value was 1 0 mg l kovacs et al 2016 the noec found in genotoxicity scge assays after 24 h was 50 0 ng l in d magna and in ceriodaphnia dubia 6 0 ng l respectively parrella et al 2015 5fu did not affect reproduction in the chronic two generation test with zebrafish however histopathological changes in the liver and kidney and genotoxic effects formation of mn in blood table 4 were detected in this species already with the lowest tested concentration 10 0 ng l kovacs et al 2015 3 1 2 cis platinum the reproduction inhibition assay 21 days exposure with d magna was for cddp the most sensitive test noec 1 0 μg l parrella et al 2014b in experiments with algae and cyanobacteria positive findings were obtained with concentrations which were two orders of magnitude higher noec 100 and 500 0 μg l d magna was also the most sensitive organism in regard to induction of dna damage by cddp noec 1 0 ng l parrella et al 2015 3 1 3 etoposide acute and chronic toxicity data are available from experiments with bacteria zounkova et al 2007 algae brezovsek et al 2014 rotifers parrella et al 2014b crustacea parrella et al 2014b and fish kovacs et al 2016 the lowest noec 97 6 μg l was found in chronic 7 days toxicity tests with c dubia in genotoxicity experiments the lowest value was obtained with c dubia noec 10 0 ng l parrella et al 2015 3 1 4 imatinib mesylate most data which are currently available concerning im were created in the frame of the cytothreat project the lowest noec was observed in reproduction inhibition experiments with c dubia 0 27 μg l parrella et al 2014b in the 33 day early life stage toxicity test with zebrafish the corresponding value was 1 0 μg l kovacs et al 2016 c dubia was again the most sensitive organism in genotoxicity experiments noec 30 0 ng l parrella et al 2015 4 determination of risk quotients rq as a measure of environmental risks the environmental risks of 5fu cddp et and im were assessed by calculation of the risk quotients rq this value is the ratio between the predicted environmental concentrations pec and the predicted no effect concentration pnec as mentioned above the pec and refined pec rpec values which take the metabolism of the parent substance in humans into account which were used are representative for france besse et al 2012 the pnec values were calculated on the basis of results of ecotoxicity tests obtained in the frame of cytothreat project according to a guideline published by the european medical agency emea 2006 for the interpretation of the ra for ecological effects in contaminated waters a scheme of marcus et al 2010 was used rq 1 0 indicates no significant risk 1 0 rq 10 a small potential for adverse effects 10 rq 100 significant potential for adverse effects values 100 indicate that potential adverse effects can be expected 4 1 assessment of risks on the basis of the chronic toxicity of individual compounds for the calculation of pnec we used noec values from the most sensitive species and an assessment factor af of 10 which accounts for interspecies sensitivity differences emea 2006 as requested by the ec 2003 two or more chronic toxicity noec values for species representing different trophic levels algae crustacea fish were available for each drug for these calculations see supplementary tables 1 3 5 7 table 5 depicts selected results of toxicity experiments with different species it can be seen that 5fu cddp and im caused the most pronounced effects in crustacea cyanobacteria and algae the highest values were found in all species with et the results of the ras based on rq calculations with toxicity data noec created in the frame of the project are listed in table 3 it can be seen that the highest rq pec pnec and the highest refined rrq rpec pnec values were obtained with im followed by 5fu cddp and et all values are below 1 0 indicating that none of these compounds represents a significant environmental risk 4 2 risk assessment on the basis of genotoxicity data the findings of selected genotoxicity experiments are summarized in table 5 the most sensitive species which was used for the calculations of pnec were daphnids higher plants a cepa tradescantia 4430 were less sensitive 5fu was also tested in a two generation study in zebrafish danio rerio in which induction of mn was observed with the lowest tested concentration 10 ng l for details see kovacs et al 2015 when rqgenotox calculations were conducted with the lowest noec values substantially higher values were obtained as in ra using results of acute long term toxicity studies table 4 notably a different ranking order of the rqgenotox values was found compared to that for chronic toxicity rq values i e the highest value was obtained with 5fu followed by cddp im and et table 3 the rrqgenotox value for 5fu is between 10 and 100 indicating significant potential for adverse effects the rrqgenotox values obtained with im and cddp are between 1 and 10 indicating a small potential for adverse effects while et represents no significant risk it is notable that the scge assay with crustacea was also in experiments with other cytostatics consistently the most sensitive test system parrella et al 2015 4 3 combined risk assessments for 5fu cddp im and et assuming additive effects to find out if mixtures of cytostatic drugs lead to adverse effects we conducted further calculations which are described in the subsequent sections the calculations were conducted according to escher et al 2011 by summarizing the pec pnec ratios of the four compounds rq mix i 1 n r q i i 1 n p e c i p n e c i the calculations of the effects of the different drugs based on data from experiments with d magna and c dubia are listed in table 3 the overall rqmix for combined exposure to 5 fu et cddp and im is 0 236 rq5fu rqet rqcddp rqim 0 04 0 005 0 19 0 00009 table 4 lists noec values from genotoxicity experiments in this case the rqmixgenotox for a mix of all drugs is 20 94 13 2 5 2 1 67 0 87 it is apparent that the rq for the long term toxic action of a mix of the four drugs is below the critical threshold 1 0 while this is not the case when the calculations are conducted with genotoxicity data 4 4 results of genotoxicity acute and subchronic toxicity studies with wastewater samples the induction of acute and subacute toxic effects and of dna damage by wastewaters from hospitals is described in a number of publications several studies found genotoxic effects in bacteria giuliani et al 1996 gupta et al 2014 jolibois and guerbet 2006 fish olvera nestor et al 2016 human liver cells gupta et al 2014 zegura et al 2009 and plants bagatini et al 2009 however the concentrations of individual anticancer drugs were determined only in few studies and it can be not excluded that chemicals other than cytostatics caused the effects positive findings were obtained for example with primary rat hepatocytes with samples containing high levels of platinum drugs 5fu as well as anthracyclines from an oncological ward of a hospital in vienna ferk et al 2009 results of other studies can be found in a review of vlkova et al 2016 however no firm conclusions can be drawn from these investigations as the samples were chemically not characterised in our experiments with wastewaters from hospitals in spain and slovenia in which the residues of 22 anticancer drugs and or their transformation products including 5fu et and cddp were detected genotoxic effects were found in plants induction of mn in tradescantia and dna damage in scge experiments with zfl cells isidori et al 2016 only few studies concerning acute and subacute toxicity effects of hospital wastewaters have been published acute toxicity was detected for example also in higher and lower plants with chemically uncharacterised hospital waters magdaleno et al 2014 and in fish carps olvera nestor et al 2016 with the aforementioned samples from spain and slovenia clear acute and chronic toxicity were observed in crustacea c dubia while no effect no growth inhibition was detected in roots of a cepa isidori et al 2016 5 assessment of environmental risks on the basis of measured environmental concentrations to find out if the four cytostatics cause adverse effects in aquatic organisms in the environment under realistic conditions additional calculations were performed on the basis of measured environmental concentrations mec of the individual drugs a comprehensive data set of calculations for various of cytostatics can be found in a review of zhan et al 2013 data concerning im were published recently by a spanish group olalla et al 2018 relevant information concerning the levels of the four cytostatics in hospital municipal and surface water is listed in table 6 it can be seen that the concentrations varied over a broad range the levels in wastewaters from hospitals were in general substantially higher than those found in municipal wastewaters after sewage treatment for surface waters only information concerning 5fu is available lin et al 2014 interestingly also household effluents contain substantial amounts of the drugs due to excretion by cancer patients zhang et al 2013 it is notable that ra based on concentrations of cytostatics found in hospital effluents may lead to an overestimation as the individual drugs may be at least partly removed by sewage treatment and may undergo degradation im is quite stable in the aquatic environment and resistant to hydro and photolysis secretan et al 2019 while et is partly destroyed by uv light franquet griell et al 2017b platinum compounds are highly unstable and lose their acute toxic properties in wastewaters rapidly within a few hours negreira et al 2014 for 5fu it was shown that it is removed efficiently by photolysis from environmental water samples lin et al 2013 however it is largely unknown at present which degradation products are formed from the different drugs and if they possess acute toxic and or genotoxic properties only for 5fu results from several analytical measurements of surface waters are available at present for details see lin et al 2014 the concentrations varied over a broad range the maximal value was 160 ng l 5 1 assessments based on chronic toxicity data the highest concentrations presented in table 7 were used to calculate rq as described in chapter 5 1 in hospital water the highest values rqs 100 were obtained with 5fu and cddp whereas for et the corresponding value was 1 in municipal water the rqs for 5fu cddp and et were 1 while for im the corresponding value was 21 3 when the highest 5fu level that was detected in a chinese surface water is used for the calculation of an rq based on biological data obtained in the cytothreat project see table 3 the value is below 1 i e 0 77 5 2 assessment on the basis of genotoxicity data a different ranking order was obtained with pnecs calculated on the basis of genotoxicity tests for hospital wastewaters the highest rqgenotox were obtained with 5fu and cddp notably also the rqgenotox for et was 100 which is indicative for high risk for municipal wastewaters rqsgenotox 100 were obtained with cddp and im for calculation with cddp it has to be taken into account that its concentrations were calculated on the basis of the concentrations of platinum ions which may originate in municipal waters also from sources other than release of platinum containing anticancer drugs 5fu cddp and et are mainly administered to patients in hospitals and the major amounts are excreted in hospitals while im is often prescribed to out patients i e the drug is consumed at home which casuses to contamination of domestic wastewaters this leads to pronounced differences of the concentrations of the four drugs in hospital and municipal wastewaters 6 possible consequences of the release of cytostatics in aquatic ecosystems present state of knowledge and future research directions the results of the present ra indicate that it is unlikely that the release of the different cytostatics 5fu cddp et and im leads to acute subacute chronic effects in aquatic ecosystems however the high rq values which were found on the basis of data from genotoxicity assays indicate potential adverse long term effects due to damage of the genetic material in certain sensitive environmental organisms these conclusions were reached on the basis of calculations with pec values from an european country france with relatively high consumption levels this statement are also valid when additional data from other widely used cytostatics are taken into consideration the pec pnec ratio values for cyclophosphamide methotrexate tamoxifen gemcitabin erlotinib and ifosfamide are listed in supplementary table 9 the rq value for toxic effects including the four main compounds is 0 389 indicating no significant environmental risk an r value for genotoxic effects cannot be calculated due to lack of data only few data are currently available which concern potential synergistic and antagonistic effects in mixtures of the different anticancer drugs for details see supplementary table 10 there is some evidence for interactions in algae and cyanobacteria brezovsek et al 2014 elersek et al 2016 and also in higher plants e g in tradescantia misik et al 2016 however all these effects were moderate therefore it is likely that the assumption of additive effects on which the calculations of r values are based in the present study is relevant for the assessment of environmental risks in this context it is notable that interactions between the individual cytostatics and benzalkonium chloride an important cationic surfactant that is widely used as a disinfectant were found in experiments with crustacea russo et al 2018 and also in algae elersek et al 2018 the overall conclusion that the contamination of the surface waters with the four cytostatics does not cause acute chronic toxic effects is in agreement with earlier findings for example zhang et al 2013 booker et al 2014 and xie 2012 stated that the noec of selected cytostatics for example tamoxifen bleomycin mitomycin c erlotinib are higher than their environmental concentrations a similar conclusion was reached for 5fu and its prodrug capecitabine in the frame of comprehensive ras with acute and chronic toxicity data straub 2010 in a calculation concerning the effects of et by environment canada 2015 and in a dutch report moermond et al 2018 concerning several cytostatics including 5fu cddp and et lin et al 2014 performed an ra concerning acute subacute toxic effects of 5fu and they stated that values rq 1 were found with waste waters from austria and taiwan genotoxicity data were not taken into consideration in these assessments the authors of the dutch report stressed such data have only to be taken into account when reproduction is affected within the frame of testing this statement is incorrect and misleading as it was shown that exposures to chemicals which cause dna damage for example to polyaromatic hydrocarbons radionuclides and other environmental contaminants lead to increased mortality rates and induction of cancer in sensitive species which are not detected in currently used toxicity tests beresford et al 2016 oziolor et al 2016 pollo et al 2016 furthermore multi generation exposures can lead to accumulation of mutations changes of the genetic diversity and gene flow and finally to reduced abundance of sensitive organisms in ecosystems for more details see beresford et al 2016 bickham 2011 mussali galante et al 2014 theodorakis 2001 such effects were detected for example in aquatic and terrestric ecosystems as a consequence of pollution with metals mussali galante et al 2014 and radionuclides beresford et al 2016 the latter effects can be not detected in the simple test systems concerning reproductive success that are currently used and evidence for possible environmental risks due to genotoxic effects should be not neglected but lead to further focused investigations at present no standardised validated protocols for the detection of dna damage in germ cells which may affect the vitality fertility of future generations of aquatic organisms are available the most frequently used approaches are dominant lethal tests with rodents chromosomal analyses and scge experiments with sperm cells of mice and rats the detection of gene mutations in transgenic animals and analyses of gene mutations in microsatellite regions for review see yauk et al 2015 glen and dubrova 2012 at present only few results are available which indicate that the cytostatics which were studied in the frame of the cytothreat project cause damage in germ cells for example it was shown that 5fu causes chromosomal damage in male paternal germ cells in rats morris 1993 furthermore there is evidence that et induces genetic damage in early spermatids sjoblom et al 1994 of rats and it was also shown that cddp exposure leads to germ cell loss in an in vitro model smart et al 2018 positive results were also obtained with the latter drug in dominant lethal assays with mice and induction of chromosomal aberrations was detected in zygotes of the treated animals katoh et al 1990 in another study with mice chromosome and chromatid type breaks were found in spermatocytes and spermatogonia after treatment of the animals with cddp adler and el tarras 1989 adler and el tarras 1990 these findings indicate that the different anticancer drugs reach germ cells and cause damage of the genetic material which may accumulate in the offspring and lead to adverse trans generational effects only for the youngest cytostatic im no data from germ cell studies are currently available due to the lack of adequate methods which can be used to study such effects in aquatic organisms genotoxicity experiments with somatic cells of environmental organisms can be used to provide valuable information which enables to identify compounds which are highly active 7 conclusions taken together the results of the present ras show that acute subacute and chronic toxic effects of cytostatics in the aquatic environment are unlikely but may take place when the compounds are not removed by efficient treatment from hospital wastewaters furthermore they indicate that certain species e g crustacea are highly sensitive in regard to induction of genotoxic effects which were found with environmentally relevant concentrations of 5fu cddp and im potential transgeneration effects and their consequences should be therefore investigated with the most potent genotoxic anticancer drugs in sensitive species declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18562,anticancer drugs are among the most toxic chemicals which are commercially produced therefore their release in aquatic ecosystems raised concerns in regard to potential adverse effects this article describes the results of risk assessments concerning their environmental safety which are based on data generated in the frame of a coordinated eu project cytothreat eight research institutions participated in the project and four widely used anticancer drugs with different mechanisms of therapeutic action 5 fluorouracil 5fu cisplatin cddp imatinib mesylate im and etoposide et were tested in a variety of indicator organisms cyanobacteria algae higher plants rotifers crustacea fish and also in human and fish derived cell lines in acute subacute chronic toxicity assays furthermore genotoxic effects in micronucleus assays single cell gel electrophoresis experiments and γh2ax tests were studied in plants crustacea fish and in various cell lines we used the results to calculate the predicted no effect concentrations pnec and risk quotients rq by comparing pnec with predicted environmental concentrations pec values and measured concentrations mec in wastewaters the most sensitive species in experiments concerning acute toxic and long term effects were in general crustacea daphnids after chronic treatment the most pronounced effects were detected with im followed by cddp and 5fu comparisons between pnec and pec values indicate that it is unlikely that the release of these drugs in the aquatic environments leads to adverse effects rq values 1 however when the assessments were performed with mec found in highly contaminated municipal wastewaters and hospital effluents rq values were obtained which are indicative for moderate adverse effects of im calculations with data from genotoxicity experiments and pec values are indicative for increased rq values for all compounds except et the most sensitive species were fish danio rerio which were highly responsive towards 5fu and daphnids which were sensitive towards cddp and im when environmental data from waste waters were used for the calculations high rq values 100 were obtained for cddp and im these overall conclusions were not substantially altered when the effects of other frequently used cytostatic drugs and combined effects of mixtures of anticancer drugs were taken into consideration the results of these assessments underline the importance of efficient removal of these chemicals by improved sewage treatment strategies and the need for further investigations of adverse the long term effects of cytostatics in aquatic biota as a consequence of damage of the genetic material in highly sensitive species graphical abstract image 1 keywords 5 fluorouracil etoposide cisplatin imatinib mesilate risk assessment toxicity 1 introduction anticancer cytostatic drugs were developed to kill cancer cells in humans these chemicals are among the most toxic chemicals which are commercially produced and are the only pharmaceutical products explicitly classified as hazardous under the waste framework directive of the european commission ec directive 2008 their release in waste waters raised concerns about potential adverse effects in aquatic ecosystems johnson et al 2008 kümmerer 2001 as a consequence efforts were made to develop efficient removal strategies zhang et al 2013 to understand their fate in the environment besse et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 and to evaluate their toxic effects in a variety of organisms kümmer et al 2009b zounkova et al 2007 the findings of these studies were used to assess their potential environmental risks the results depended strongly on the approaches that were used it was concluded in most publications that the no observed effect concentrations noecs of certain cytostatics are higher than their environmental concentrations and that it is therefore unlikely that their release causes adverse effects in ecosystems booker et al 2014 xie 2012 zhang et al 2013 the results of these earlier environmental risk assessments ras of widely used anticancer drugs are based on relatively limited data concerning their acute subacute and sometimes chronic toxic effects and do not include data on the genotoxic properties of these compounds furthermore ra calculations of anticancer drugs are often difficult since reliable information on their fate in the environment and their biological degradation is scare therefore a coordinated project cytothreat was supported by the european union http www cytothreat eu eight institutions participated in this initiative which focused on four important widely used anticancer drugs namely 5 fluorouracil 5fu cisplatin cddp etoposide et and imatinib mesylate im the ecotoxicological properties of the compounds were studied in eleven indicator organisms including bacteria phytoplankton higher plants crustacea rotifers mussels and fish and also in human and fish derived cell lines in regard to their acute and or long term effects table 1 furthermore genotoxicity assays including micronucleus mn assays single cell gel electrophoresis scge γh2ax and gene mutation tests were conducted with several indicator organisms and with cell lines in vitro the findings were published recently in a number of papers for details see table 1 the present article focuses mainly on environmental ras on the basis of results which were obtained in the frame of this project the subsequent chapters describe the rationale for the selection of the compounds chapter 2 their use and mechanisms of their therapeutic action chapter 3 the indicator organisms and methods chapter 4 the selection of data that were used for the ras chapter 5 and the calculations which are based on a guideline for medicinal products for human use which was published by the european medicines agency 2006 chapter 6 apart from calculations for individual compounds we included also assessments of combined effects chapter 6 3 chapter 7 describes calculations on the basis of environmental concentrations of the drugs chapter 8 summarizes results of studies concerning acute and genotoxic effects of hospital and municipal wastewaters in different organisms the last chapter 9 contains conclusions and discusses the possible impact of long term contamination of ecosystems with genotoxins 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection of the drugs the drugs were selected on the basis of two criteria namely a their use in the european union and b their modes of therapeutic action for the calculation of the predicted environmental concentration pec values information concerning their consumption is required table 2 lists data for european countries which were recently published their corresponding pecs as well as their chemical properties and the concentrations which were found in environmental samples strong regional differences exist in regard to the use of the different drugs at present im is by far more expensive as 5fu or cddp therefore its regional use varies over a broad range for example substantially lower amounts were given to patients in slovenia compared to france or germany table 2 this however may change in the future also for other drugs differences exist which have to be taken into consideration in environmental risk estimates for details concerning their consumption see franquet griell et al 2015 in the present study we used pecs which were published by besse et al 2012 for france as these values reflect the consumption of a large population notably they are higher as in other european countries such as spain and slovenia see table 2 2 2 use and mechanisms of therapeutic action of the studied compounds the compounds which were studied are representatives of different important groups of cytostatics their chemical structures are shown in fig 1 5fu fig 1a is a pyrimidine analogue which acts as an antimetabolite and was developed in the 1950s fischer and ganellin 2006 5fu and several structurally related derivatives are currently used for local and systemic cancer treatment straub 2010 et fig 1b is a topoisomerase inhibitor and causes single and double strand breaks it is on the market since the 1960s and prescribed predominantly for treatment of breast ovarian gastric cancers and leukemia iarc 2000 cddp fig 1c and other platinum compounds are dna crosslinking agents jackson et al 1996 these drugs are used for the treatment of different forms of cancer for example for testicular ovarian bladder and lung tumours dasari and tchounwou 2014 im fig 1d is representative of protein kinase inhibitors used for targeted chemotherapy it was developed in the 1990 s for specific cancers in particular for myeloid leukemia its therapeutic mode of action is based on selective inhibition of aberrantly expressed thymidine kinases in cancer cells for details see waller 2010 2 3 indicator organisms and methods the different anticancer drugs were studied in acute subacute and chronic toxicity experiments with aquatic organisms representing different trophic levels phytoplankton cyanobacteria and algae and plants represent primary producers invertebrates rotifers crustacea and mussels are primary consumers while vertebrates fish are secondary consumers the tests were performed according to standardised guidelines for details see table 1 the indicator species are specified in table 1 genotoxic effects were studied in higher plants crustacea and also zebrafish furthermore cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were monitored in experiments with human cells hepg2 and isolated human peripheral lymphocytes and in a fish derived cell line zfl which was used in earlier investigations with waste waters pomati et al 2007 genotoxicity tests included the scge assay which is based on the detection migration of damaged dna in an electric field tice et al 2000 and was performed with crustacea fishes and different cell lines furthermore mn assays which reflect chromosomal damage clastogenicity and aneuploidy norppa and falck 2003 stopper and muller 1997 were performed in higher plants fish and cell lines with human cells also γh2ax experiments which detect histone acetylation that is induced by repair of double strand breaks mah et al 2010 were carried out furthermore also bacterial tests were realized namely the sos chromotest with coliform bacteria escherichia coli which reflects induction of dna repair as a consequence of damage of the genetic material quillardet and hofnung 1993 as well as salmonella microsome tests which detect gene mutations maron and ames 1984 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of acute and subchronic toxicity and genotoxicity tests with the different cytostatics the results that were obtained in the frame of the project are summarized in tables 3 4 more details can be found in supplementary tables 1 8 findings which are relevant for ras are summarized in the following subchapters results of relevant experiments with selected species are shown in table 5 3 1 1 5 fluorouracil it can be seen in table 5 that the most sensitive chronic test was the reproduction inhibition assay with daphnia magna the no observed effect concentration noec after 21 days was 2 0 μg l parrella et al 2014b in algae and cyanobacteria the noec values were higher 10 0 and 120 0 μg l respectively brezovšek et al 2014 in the sub chronic toxicity assay 33 day early life stage toxicity test with zebrafish the noec value was 1 0 mg l kovacs et al 2016 the noec found in genotoxicity scge assays after 24 h was 50 0 ng l in d magna and in ceriodaphnia dubia 6 0 ng l respectively parrella et al 2015 5fu did not affect reproduction in the chronic two generation test with zebrafish however histopathological changes in the liver and kidney and genotoxic effects formation of mn in blood table 4 were detected in this species already with the lowest tested concentration 10 0 ng l kovacs et al 2015 3 1 2 cis platinum the reproduction inhibition assay 21 days exposure with d magna was for cddp the most sensitive test noec 1 0 μg l parrella et al 2014b in experiments with algae and cyanobacteria positive findings were obtained with concentrations which were two orders of magnitude higher noec 100 and 500 0 μg l d magna was also the most sensitive organism in regard to induction of dna damage by cddp noec 1 0 ng l parrella et al 2015 3 1 3 etoposide acute and chronic toxicity data are available from experiments with bacteria zounkova et al 2007 algae brezovsek et al 2014 rotifers parrella et al 2014b crustacea parrella et al 2014b and fish kovacs et al 2016 the lowest noec 97 6 μg l was found in chronic 7 days toxicity tests with c dubia in genotoxicity experiments the lowest value was obtained with c dubia noec 10 0 ng l parrella et al 2015 3 1 4 imatinib mesylate most data which are currently available concerning im were created in the frame of the cytothreat project the lowest noec was observed in reproduction inhibition experiments with c dubia 0 27 μg l parrella et al 2014b in the 33 day early life stage toxicity test with zebrafish the corresponding value was 1 0 μg l kovacs et al 2016 c dubia was again the most sensitive organism in genotoxicity experiments noec 30 0 ng l parrella et al 2015 4 determination of risk quotients rq as a measure of environmental risks the environmental risks of 5fu cddp et and im were assessed by calculation of the risk quotients rq this value is the ratio between the predicted environmental concentrations pec and the predicted no effect concentration pnec as mentioned above the pec and refined pec rpec values which take the metabolism of the parent substance in humans into account which were used are representative for france besse et al 2012 the pnec values were calculated on the basis of results of ecotoxicity tests obtained in the frame of cytothreat project according to a guideline published by the european medical agency emea 2006 for the interpretation of the ra for ecological effects in contaminated waters a scheme of marcus et al 2010 was used rq 1 0 indicates no significant risk 1 0 rq 10 a small potential for adverse effects 10 rq 100 significant potential for adverse effects values 100 indicate that potential adverse effects can be expected 4 1 assessment of risks on the basis of the chronic toxicity of individual compounds for the calculation of pnec we used noec values from the most sensitive species and an assessment factor af of 10 which accounts for interspecies sensitivity differences emea 2006 as requested by the ec 2003 two or more chronic toxicity noec values for species representing different trophic levels algae crustacea fish were available for each drug for these calculations see supplementary tables 1 3 5 7 table 5 depicts selected results of toxicity experiments with different species it can be seen that 5fu cddp and im caused the most pronounced effects in crustacea cyanobacteria and algae the highest values were found in all species with et the results of the ras based on rq calculations with toxicity data noec created in the frame of the project are listed in table 3 it can be seen that the highest rq pec pnec and the highest refined rrq rpec pnec values were obtained with im followed by 5fu cddp and et all values are below 1 0 indicating that none of these compounds represents a significant environmental risk 4 2 risk assessment on the basis of genotoxicity data the findings of selected genotoxicity experiments are summarized in table 5 the most sensitive species which was used for the calculations of pnec were daphnids higher plants a cepa tradescantia 4430 were less sensitive 5fu was also tested in a two generation study in zebrafish danio rerio in which induction of mn was observed with the lowest tested concentration 10 ng l for details see kovacs et al 2015 when rqgenotox calculations were conducted with the lowest noec values substantially higher values were obtained as in ra using results of acute long term toxicity studies table 4 notably a different ranking order of the rqgenotox values was found compared to that for chronic toxicity rq values i e the highest value was obtained with 5fu followed by cddp im and et table 3 the rrqgenotox value for 5fu is between 10 and 100 indicating significant potential for adverse effects the rrqgenotox values obtained with im and cddp are between 1 and 10 indicating a small potential for adverse effects while et represents no significant risk it is notable that the scge assay with crustacea was also in experiments with other cytostatics consistently the most sensitive test system parrella et al 2015 4 3 combined risk assessments for 5fu cddp im and et assuming additive effects to find out if mixtures of cytostatic drugs lead to adverse effects we conducted further calculations which are described in the subsequent sections the calculations were conducted according to escher et al 2011 by summarizing the pec pnec ratios of the four compounds rq mix i 1 n r q i i 1 n p e c i p n e c i the calculations of the effects of the different drugs based on data from experiments with d magna and c dubia are listed in table 3 the overall rqmix for combined exposure to 5 fu et cddp and im is 0 236 rq5fu rqet rqcddp rqim 0 04 0 005 0 19 0 00009 table 4 lists noec values from genotoxicity experiments in this case the rqmixgenotox for a mix of all drugs is 20 94 13 2 5 2 1 67 0 87 it is apparent that the rq for the long term toxic action of a mix of the four drugs is below the critical threshold 1 0 while this is not the case when the calculations are conducted with genotoxicity data 4 4 results of genotoxicity acute and subchronic toxicity studies with wastewater samples the induction of acute and subacute toxic effects and of dna damage by wastewaters from hospitals is described in a number of publications several studies found genotoxic effects in bacteria giuliani et al 1996 gupta et al 2014 jolibois and guerbet 2006 fish olvera nestor et al 2016 human liver cells gupta et al 2014 zegura et al 2009 and plants bagatini et al 2009 however the concentrations of individual anticancer drugs were determined only in few studies and it can be not excluded that chemicals other than cytostatics caused the effects positive findings were obtained for example with primary rat hepatocytes with samples containing high levels of platinum drugs 5fu as well as anthracyclines from an oncological ward of a hospital in vienna ferk et al 2009 results of other studies can be found in a review of vlkova et al 2016 however no firm conclusions can be drawn from these investigations as the samples were chemically not characterised in our experiments with wastewaters from hospitals in spain and slovenia in which the residues of 22 anticancer drugs and or their transformation products including 5fu et and cddp were detected genotoxic effects were found in plants induction of mn in tradescantia and dna damage in scge experiments with zfl cells isidori et al 2016 only few studies concerning acute and subacute toxicity effects of hospital wastewaters have been published acute toxicity was detected for example also in higher and lower plants with chemically uncharacterised hospital waters magdaleno et al 2014 and in fish carps olvera nestor et al 2016 with the aforementioned samples from spain and slovenia clear acute and chronic toxicity were observed in crustacea c dubia while no effect no growth inhibition was detected in roots of a cepa isidori et al 2016 5 assessment of environmental risks on the basis of measured environmental concentrations to find out if the four cytostatics cause adverse effects in aquatic organisms in the environment under realistic conditions additional calculations were performed on the basis of measured environmental concentrations mec of the individual drugs a comprehensive data set of calculations for various of cytostatics can be found in a review of zhan et al 2013 data concerning im were published recently by a spanish group olalla et al 2018 relevant information concerning the levels of the four cytostatics in hospital municipal and surface water is listed in table 6 it can be seen that the concentrations varied over a broad range the levels in wastewaters from hospitals were in general substantially higher than those found in municipal wastewaters after sewage treatment for surface waters only information concerning 5fu is available lin et al 2014 interestingly also household effluents contain substantial amounts of the drugs due to excretion by cancer patients zhang et al 2013 it is notable that ra based on concentrations of cytostatics found in hospital effluents may lead to an overestimation as the individual drugs may be at least partly removed by sewage treatment and may undergo degradation im is quite stable in the aquatic environment and resistant to hydro and photolysis secretan et al 2019 while et is partly destroyed by uv light franquet griell et al 2017b platinum compounds are highly unstable and lose their acute toxic properties in wastewaters rapidly within a few hours negreira et al 2014 for 5fu it was shown that it is removed efficiently by photolysis from environmental water samples lin et al 2013 however it is largely unknown at present which degradation products are formed from the different drugs and if they possess acute toxic and or genotoxic properties only for 5fu results from several analytical measurements of surface waters are available at present for details see lin et al 2014 the concentrations varied over a broad range the maximal value was 160 ng l 5 1 assessments based on chronic toxicity data the highest concentrations presented in table 7 were used to calculate rq as described in chapter 5 1 in hospital water the highest values rqs 100 were obtained with 5fu and cddp whereas for et the corresponding value was 1 in municipal water the rqs for 5fu cddp and et were 1 while for im the corresponding value was 21 3 when the highest 5fu level that was detected in a chinese surface water is used for the calculation of an rq based on biological data obtained in the cytothreat project see table 3 the value is below 1 i e 0 77 5 2 assessment on the basis of genotoxicity data a different ranking order was obtained with pnecs calculated on the basis of genotoxicity tests for hospital wastewaters the highest rqgenotox were obtained with 5fu and cddp notably also the rqgenotox for et was 100 which is indicative for high risk for municipal wastewaters rqsgenotox 100 were obtained with cddp and im for calculation with cddp it has to be taken into account that its concentrations were calculated on the basis of the concentrations of platinum ions which may originate in municipal waters also from sources other than release of platinum containing anticancer drugs 5fu cddp and et are mainly administered to patients in hospitals and the major amounts are excreted in hospitals while im is often prescribed to out patients i e the drug is consumed at home which casuses to contamination of domestic wastewaters this leads to pronounced differences of the concentrations of the four drugs in hospital and municipal wastewaters 6 possible consequences of the release of cytostatics in aquatic ecosystems present state of knowledge and future research directions the results of the present ra indicate that it is unlikely that the release of the different cytostatics 5fu cddp et and im leads to acute subacute chronic effects in aquatic ecosystems however the high rq values which were found on the basis of data from genotoxicity assays indicate potential adverse long term effects due to damage of the genetic material in certain sensitive environmental organisms these conclusions were reached on the basis of calculations with pec values from an european country france with relatively high consumption levels this statement are also valid when additional data from other widely used cytostatics are taken into consideration the pec pnec ratio values for cyclophosphamide methotrexate tamoxifen gemcitabin erlotinib and ifosfamide are listed in supplementary table 9 the rq value for toxic effects including the four main compounds is 0 389 indicating no significant environmental risk an r value for genotoxic effects cannot be calculated due to lack of data only few data are currently available which concern potential synergistic and antagonistic effects in mixtures of the different anticancer drugs for details see supplementary table 10 there is some evidence for interactions in algae and cyanobacteria brezovsek et al 2014 elersek et al 2016 and also in higher plants e g in tradescantia misik et al 2016 however all these effects were moderate therefore it is likely that the assumption of additive effects on which the calculations of r values are based in the present study is relevant for the assessment of environmental risks in this context it is notable that interactions between the individual cytostatics and benzalkonium chloride an important cationic surfactant that is widely used as a disinfectant were found in experiments with crustacea russo et al 2018 and also in algae elersek et al 2018 the overall conclusion that the contamination of the surface waters with the four cytostatics does not cause acute chronic toxic effects is in agreement with earlier findings for example zhang et al 2013 booker et al 2014 and xie 2012 stated that the noec of selected cytostatics for example tamoxifen bleomycin mitomycin c erlotinib are higher than their environmental concentrations a similar conclusion was reached for 5fu and its prodrug capecitabine in the frame of comprehensive ras with acute and chronic toxicity data straub 2010 in a calculation concerning the effects of et by environment canada 2015 and in a dutch report moermond et al 2018 concerning several cytostatics including 5fu cddp and et lin et al 2014 performed an ra concerning acute subacute toxic effects of 5fu and they stated that values rq 1 were found with waste waters from austria and taiwan genotoxicity data were not taken into consideration in these assessments the authors of the dutch report stressed such data have only to be taken into account when reproduction is affected within the frame of testing this statement is incorrect and misleading as it was shown that exposures to chemicals which cause dna damage for example to polyaromatic hydrocarbons radionuclides and other environmental contaminants lead to increased mortality rates and induction of cancer in sensitive species which are not detected in currently used toxicity tests beresford et al 2016 oziolor et al 2016 pollo et al 2016 furthermore multi generation exposures can lead to accumulation of mutations changes of the genetic diversity and gene flow and finally to reduced abundance of sensitive organisms in ecosystems for more details see beresford et al 2016 bickham 2011 mussali galante et al 2014 theodorakis 2001 such effects were detected for example in aquatic and terrestric ecosystems as a consequence of pollution with metals mussali galante et al 2014 and radionuclides beresford et al 2016 the latter effects can be not detected in the simple test systems concerning reproductive success that are currently used and evidence for possible environmental risks due to genotoxic effects should be not neglected but lead to further focused investigations at present no standardised validated protocols for the detection of dna damage in germ cells which may affect the vitality fertility of future generations of aquatic organisms are available the most frequently used approaches are dominant lethal tests with rodents chromosomal analyses and scge experiments with sperm cells of mice and rats the detection of gene mutations in transgenic animals and analyses of gene mutations in microsatellite regions for review see yauk et al 2015 glen and dubrova 2012 at present only few results are available which indicate that the cytostatics which were studied in the frame of the cytothreat project cause damage in germ cells for example it was shown that 5fu causes chromosomal damage in male paternal germ cells in rats morris 1993 furthermore there is evidence that et induces genetic damage in early spermatids sjoblom et al 1994 of rats and it was also shown that cddp exposure leads to germ cell loss in an in vitro model smart et al 2018 positive results were also obtained with the latter drug in dominant lethal assays with mice and induction of chromosomal aberrations was detected in zygotes of the treated animals katoh et al 1990 in another study with mice chromosome and chromatid type breaks were found in spermatocytes and spermatogonia after treatment of the animals with cddp adler and el tarras 1989 adler and el tarras 1990 these findings indicate that the different anticancer drugs reach germ cells and cause damage of the genetic material which may accumulate in the offspring and lead to adverse trans generational effects only for the youngest cytostatic im no data from germ cell studies are currently available due to the lack of adequate methods which can be used to study such effects in aquatic organisms genotoxicity experiments with somatic cells of environmental organisms can be used to provide valuable information which enables to identify compounds which are highly active 7 conclusions taken together the results of the present ras show that acute subacute and chronic toxic effects of cytostatics in the aquatic environment are unlikely but may take place when the compounds are not removed by efficient treatment from hospital wastewaters furthermore they indicate that certain species e g crustacea are highly sensitive in regard to induction of genotoxic effects which were found with environmentally relevant concentrations of 5fu cddp and im potential transgeneration effects and their consequences should be therefore investigated with the most potent genotoxic anticancer drugs in sensitive species declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18563,photosynthetic microbial fuel cells pmfcs allow renewable energy production from wastewater however system scale up is still a major challenge hindering the use of pmfcs for practical applications herein a pmfc stack which consisted of multiple anodic chambers installed in an algal raceway pond arp was established to recovery energy from anaerobically digested effluent with the assistance of a prototypical capacitor circuit the highest voltage output of the stack reached 1 4 v with four pmfc units and four capacitors the system can produce stable voltages through controlling charging and discharging frequencies and the voltage output remained stable around 0 60 v when the time interval decreased to 2 s during long term operation the highest power density of the stack with capacitors reached 2 34 w m3 which was 77 higher than that without capacitors 1 32 w m3 about 98 of the ammonium in the anolyte was removed resulting from the ammonium migration effect the dynamics of bacterial community compositions were not greatly influenced by the capacitor circuit and the stack with capacitors had a more stable bacterial community compared to the stack without capacitors the variations in bacterial community composition following power density changes indicated that members of the clostridia and betaproteobacteria were related to power generation bacteria affiliated to bacteroidetes were inhibited when power density was high though their numbers were enriched at the end of the process this study promotes a practical method for developing the pmfc technology into real world applications and furthermore reveals the main bacteria that play vital roles in power generation by analysing the anodic bacterial community during the whole process graphical abstract image 1 keywords photosynthetic microbial fuel cell stack capacitors power density pollutant removal bacterial community 1 introduction photosynthetic microbial fuel cells pmfcs which consist of a combination of algal cultivation and microbial fuel cell mfc technology are considered to be an environmentally friendly approach for bioenergy recovery ma et al 2017 yang et al 2019 wang et al 2019 pmfcs are capable of generating electricity from organic matter with the aid of bacteria in the anodic chamber sun et al 2016 the processes of algal cultivation in the cathodic chamber are able to produce photosynthetic o2 which can be used as an electron acceptor for the cathode reaction thereby saving on energy by omitting aeration wang et al 2019 in addition algal cultivation has been identified as an effective way to assimilate nutrients and it can also generate valuable by products such as lipids ma et al 2017 therefore pmfcs represent a promising technology for simultaneous bioenergy production and removal of organics and nutrients however voltages generated from pmfcs are generally small with a maximal open circuit voltage ocv of about 0 8 v aelterman et al 2006 the low voltage is an obstacle for the development of the pmfc technology as the voltage is too low to be used directly for practical applications chemical fuel cell stacks have been developed successfully to increase the voltage output steele and heinzel 2001 practical applications of pmfcs or mfcs such as recovering energy from wastewater will likely require the use of multiple units but for mfc stacks issues such as voltage reversal and ionic short circuiting may occur when the mfcs are connected in series li et al 2014 voltage reversal which results from substrate depletion or high current conditions may lead to a low or nearly zero voltage of the stack aelterman et al 2006 ionic short circuiting was encountered in mfc stacks that shared one catholyte or anolyte zhuang and zhou 2009 those challenges observed in mfc stacks are also the main obstacles that limit the development of pmfc stacks which might be one of the explanations as to why there has been no study on pmfc stacks reported until now parallel connection is a more feasible way to establish a stable pmfc stack current from a pmfc stack will increase by parallel connection but voltage output can not be enhanced significantly liang et al 2018 the low voltage output would limit the stack application for powering electronic devices thus it is necessary to integrate devices that can boost the voltage output of a parallel pmfc stack so far research on power management systems for mfcs is in its infancy sun et al 2016 several energy harvesting technologies have been used to boost voltage output from mfcs such as the ones based on capacitors dc dc converters and battery energy storage sun et al 2016 ge et al 2015 a power management system with a dc dc voltage boost converter can successfully increase voltage output but it will result in a power loss of 40 60 donovan et al 2011 battery energy storage systems are not an ideal technology to directly harvest energy from a parallel pmfc stack because the ocv of a parallel stack is not high enough capacitors are capable of quickly storing or releasing large amounts of energy with negligible energy loss kim et al 2011 in addition the voltage output can be enhanced several times through charging in parallel and discharging in series multiple capacitors alternately in a previous study a capacitor circuit successfully improved the voltage output of a mfc stack during one day of operation but this study mainly focused on the feasibility of this method kim et al 2011 it is worth investigating the system stability and the influence of capacitor circuit on the stack in a long term operation considering these inherent conditions a pmfc stack is developed that consists of multiple anodic chambers pmfc units installed in an algal raceway pond arp the arp also functions as the cathodic chamber in this system to avoid issues like voltage reversal the pmfc units are connected in parallel two arrays of capacitors are charged and discharged alternately via a capacitor circuit to boost the voltage output of the stack theoretically the voltage is adequate to power electronic devices or charge batteries when enough units and capacitors are used furthermore the proposed pmfc stack has an advantage in ammonium rich wastewater treatment large amounts of ammonium in the anodic chambers can diffuse into the raceway pond through cation exchange membranes and then be assimilated by algae or removed at the cathode after being oxidized by photosynthetic o2 yang et al 2019 in this study an example pmfc stack with 4 pmfc units and 4 capacitors 2 sets of 2 capacitors was established to treat anaerobically digested effluent from kitchen waste ade kw first the charging and discharging abilities were investigated for different numbers of pmfc units the performance of the pmfc stack was then evaluated in a long term experiment the evolution of microbial community in the pmfc stack was also analysed during the experiment 2 materials and methods 2 1 pmfc stack set up the pmfc stack consisted of a cathodic chamber and four anodic chambers as illustrated in fig 1 the cathodic chamber was a rectangular arp with a working volume of 16 l length 650 mm height 250 mm width 110 mm the anodic chambers were tubular vessels height 200 mm diameter 60 mm with a working volume of 0 36 l which were established according to a previous study yang et al 2019 carbon brushes height 150 mm diameter 30 mm were used as the anodes in the anodic chambers ten rectangular holes height 160 mm width 5 mm were set into the wall of the anodic chamber for ion exchange the anodic chamber was wrapped by a cation exchange membrane cem and then a carbon cloth functioning as the cathode was wrapped around the cem raw ade kw collected from a local anaerobic digester was provided as substrate in the anodic chamber the ade kw contained 6015 280 mg l cod 2365 160 mg l nh4 n 180 5 mg l no3 n 26 1 mg l no2 n and 95 3 mg l tp the cathodic chamber was used to cultivate the green alga golenkinia sp sdec 16 accession no kt180320 with 4 v v ade kw before being diluted with deionized water the ade kw was centrifuged to reduce its dark colouration so that the light is more accessible to algae during the experiment the catholyte was inoculated with an initial algal biomass concentration of about 0 1 mg l the room temperature was controlled to be around 25 c continuous mixing 300 rpm was provided for the catholyte using magnetic stirrers a row of fluorescent lamps provided a continuous illumination of 100 μmol m s for the system 2 2 operating conditions to avoid voltage reversal the pmfc stack was connected in parallel first the polarization and power curves of the stack were measured by varying the external resistance the volumetric power density w m3 was normalized to the volume of anolyte m3 thereafter a demonstration capacitor circuit was connected with the stack to boost the voltage output fig s2 the charging and discharging ability of the system was investigated two capacitors 2 7 v 4 7 f were charged in parallel by the stack with different numbers of pmfc units and then discharged in series to an external resistance 100 ω in the long term operation the stack was configured with four units and a capacitor circuit to treat the ade kw in a batch experiment lasting 40 days the charging and discharging of the capacitor circuit were alternated every 2 s the prototype capacitor circuit was controlled by a relay s8fs c qingjun electronics co china and a microcontroller plc qingjun electronics co china so that a stable voltage output was achieved a pmfc stack without a capacitor circuit was operated as a control 2 3 measurement and analysis voltage output from the pmfc stack was monitored using a data acquisition system model 2700 keithley instruments usa cod and nutrient concentrations were measured according to a previous study yang et al 2019 the algal biomass concentration was determined with a 20 ml sample of algal suspension the algal suspension was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min by a centrifuge tdl 8 m luxiangyi china and then dried using a lyophilizer eyela fdu 1200 tokyo rikakikai co japan mass fractions of n and p in the algal biomass were evaluated with about 0 1 g of dry powdered algae after digestion with h2so4 and h2o2 the lipid contents of the algae were measured using a chloroform methanol mixture 2 1 v v pei et al 2017 the anode bacterial community was characterized using illumina high throughput sequencing all experiments were conducted in biological triplicate the significance of the results was assessed and p 0 05 was recognized as being statistically significant the quantity of charge q stored in a capacitor was calculated as q c f u where c f is the capacitance of the capacitor and u is the voltage across the capacitor the average current i from the capacitor can be estimated with equation i q t where t is the charging or discharging time the capacitances of two parallel capacitors cp and two series capacitors cs were calculated with the equations c p 2 c f and c s c f 2 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 boosting the voltage of the pmfc stack by use of a capacitor circuit a pmfc stack was established consisting of four pmfc units installed in an arp first the polarization and power density curves of the stack were investigated with different numbers of pmfc units fig 2 the maximal power density of the stack with four pmfc units was about 16 6 w m3 which was approximately twice as much as the system with single unit the ocv of the pmfc stack with four units was about 0 69 v which was similar to that of an individual unit polarization curves generally included three zones logan et al 2006 first voltage dropped steeply at low currents second voltage decreased slowly with increasing current then the voltage dropped rapidly again at high currents the voltage output decreased much more slowly with the increase of current when more pmfc units were used in the stack especially in the second zone this result indicates that more units contributed to a low internal resistance of the stack current reversal was observed in a parallel mfc stack with low ocv at a high external resistance wu et al 2016 however this phenomenon did not occur in the pmfc stack either in the short term operation or in the long term operation next capacitors were used to boost the voltage output of the parallel pmfc stack as illustrated in fig 2 two capacitors were charged in parallel by the stack with different numbers of units and then discharged in series to the external resistance during the charging period the highest voltages were about 0 40 v 0 55 v 0 65 v and 0 69 v when the number of units was one two three and four respectively the stack with four units charged the two capacitors at the fastest rate the average charging current of the circuit with four units was about 2 6 ma corresponding to a total charge quantity q of 6 5 c the q value in the two capacitors charged by the single unit was about 3 8 c with an average charging current of less than 1 6 ma it is notable that the capacitor voltage increased rapidly in the beginning but increased very slowly in the later period in the pmfc stack system with four units the average charging current was about 18 ma in the first 240 s but the current dropped to less than 1 ma after 240 s when the two capacitors were discharged in series to the external resistance the voltage output reached nearly 1 4 v for the system with four pmfc units this result indicates that negligible energy was lost during the charging and discharging process on the basis of the charge stored in the capacitors q however the capacitors discharged at a relatively fast rate especially when the voltage was high hence the charging current should be high enough to yield a stable voltage output the pmfc stack was able to charge two capacitors with a relatively high current of 18 ma in the first 240 s leading to the maximal discharging voltage of about 0 90 v according to fig 2c the voltages of the two series capacitors would decrease from 0 90 v to about 0 23 v when they discharged for 240s corresponding to an average discharging current close to 5 6 ma however the average discharging current would be about 6 6 ma if it were calculated from the variation of q the different results may be due to the actual capacitance of the capacitor being lower than the nominal value stated by the manufacture to obtain a stable voltage output the capacitors were charged in parallel and discharged in series frequently via a demonstration circuit fig s2 the voltage output of the system is shown in fig 2d for different time intervals t i the highest voltage output reached nearly 0 90 v when the t i was 240 s but the lowest voltage of about 0 23 v was also observed as t i decreased from 240 s to 60 s a minor voltage oscillation was observed ranging from 0 49 v to 0 69 v when the t i decreased to 2 s the voltage output remained stable around 0 60 v without obvious oscillation these results demonstrate that the pmfc stack system can produce stable voltages through controlling charging and discharging frequencies the current in the circuit with 2 s intervals was calculated to be about 7 2 ma based on the variation in q but the actual current of in the circuit was about 6 ma this discrepancy confirmed that the actual capacitances of the capacitors were lower than their stated nominal values when there was no capacitor applied in the system the respective voltages of the systems with one unit and four units were about 0 31 v and 0 45 v fig 2d thus the parallel stack also enhanced the voltage outputs in addition to the current and power after four capacitors two pairs were added to the system the voltage output increased to 0 6 v which is about double the voltage produced by an individual pmfc and 33 higher than for the stack without capacitors thus a stable and boosted voltage output can be obtained from the parallel pmfc stack using capacitors 3 2 energy generation and pollutant removal in the pmfc stack to investigate the performance of the pmfc stack the system was operated with four units and a capacitor circuit to treat ade kw for 40 days fig 3 the highest power density of the pmfc stack with capacitors was 2 34 0 11 w m3 which was about 77 higher than the stack operated without capacitors 1 32 0 03 w m3 an energy harvesting device was used to extract energy from a mfc stack in a previous study and it obtained a power density of about 1 7 w m3 in long term operation ge et al 2015 the power density of the stack with capacitors began to decrease on the 12th day and reached a stable value of about 1 35 0 06 w m3 on the 19th day after that the power density dropped rapidly to a low level of about 0 41 0 03 w m3 for the stack without capacitors the power density decreased slowly from 1 4 0 02 w m3 to 0 9 0 01 w m3 in the first 30 days the total electricity produced from the stack with capacitors was 1 25 0 01 kw h m3 which was 29 higher than the stack without capacitors 0 97 0 01 kw h m3 considering the high cod concentration in the ade kw the power densities generated from the pmfc stacks were relatively low pmfcs are particularly suitable for treating low strength soluble organics while the ade kw contained large amount of refractory substances li et al 2013 thus the refractory substances were first degraded by hydrolytic bacteria before being used for power generation which may decrease the electricity generated from the pmfc stacks besides high concentrations of substrate can inhibit the activity of exoelectrogens which may reduce voltage output of the pmfc stack luo et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 reported that the pretreated cathodes generated high power densities over time with power losses of only around 15 after 17 months of operation thus pretreatment of the electrodes such as heat treatment may increase the power generation and prolong the lifetime of the pmfc stack in the long term operation algal growth in the catholyte could provide o2 for the cathode reaction and also produce biomass nitrogen is the most frequent macronutrient that limits algal growth solovchenko et al 2016 in this study a nitrogen source could be supplied for algal growth continuously by ammonium migration from anolyte to catholyte the growth curves for the algae cultivated in the catholyte are shown in fig 3b algal concentration increased rapidly during the first 8 days and reached a plateau on the 20th day the highest biomass concentrations in stacks with and without capacitors were about 1 06 0 12 g l and 1 15 0 07 g l respectively the algal lipid contents of the two stacks were 32 2 2 5 with capacitors and 30 7 3 4 without capacitors after preliminary estimation the energy produced in the form of lipid was both about 0 10 kw h m3 for each stack therefore the total energy produced from the pmfc stack with capacitors was about 1 35 0 02 kw h m3 with electricity contributing the majority of the energy produced the removal of organic matter is shown in fig 3c the respective cod removal efficiencies in stacks with and without capacitors were 88 6 and 84 0 corresponding to average cod removal rates of 92 5 6 0 mg l d and 87 7 6 3 mg l d the removal rates were relatively low compared to the previously reported value of about 150 mg l d in a pmfc operating on synthetic wastewater campo et al 2013 large amounts of refractory organics contained in the ade kw may lead to the low cod removal rates in the stacks the coulombic efficiency ce of the stack increased slightly from 14 7 to 15 3 after the capacitor circuit was introduced into the system the ce values were similar to those obtained in an individual pmfc or mfc yang et al 2019 teng et al 2010 the results indicate that the oxidation reaction at the anode may not be perceptibly affected by the presence of capacitors nitrogen removal in the pmfc stacks is shown in fig 3 about 98 of the ammonium was removed in the anolyte of the stack with capacitors previous studies indicated that the ammonium losses in the anolyte of mfcs were primarily due to ammonium migrating into the catholyte through the cem kim et al 2008 ammonium migration was mainly attributed to two mechanisms feng et al 2017 1 passive diffusion of the ammonium from the anode to the cathode chambers due to concentration difference 2 ammonium migration driven by the maintenance of charge balance the average ammonium migration rates in the stacks with and without capacitors were about 2 6 0 2 g m2 d and 2 5 0 2 g m2 d respectively more electricity generated from the stack with capacitors may result in a relatively high ammonium migration rate since charge neutrality was one of the reasons driving the ammonium migration feng et al 2017 however the gap in average migration rates between the two stacks was small considering the large difference in electricity generation large gaps were only observed in the initial 10 days when the ammonium concentrations and power densities were high fig s3 after that the differences in ammonium migration rates were narrowed due to the decreasing ammonium concentrations in the anolyte and migration competition of other cations such as na k ammonium concentration in the catholyte increased in the initial days and then dropped rapidly to about 10 mg l fig 3 nitrate and nitrite concentrations maintained a low level during the first 24 days but they both increased in the later period of the experiment in terms of the whole system including anodic chamber and cathodic chamber about 88 6 of the nitrogen was removed in the stack with capacitors corresponding to a nitrogen removal rate of 5 3 0 4 mg l d ammonium in the catholyte was able to be removed by algal uptake it is estimated that about 32 9 1 8 of the removed nitrogen was assimilated by algae in the stack with capacitors according to the nitrogen content in the algal biomass ammonium in the catholyte could also be removed through being oxidized to nitrogen oxides by photosynthetic o2 virdis et al 2010 the nitrate and nitrite concentrations decreased to undetectable levels in the stack with capacitors when the power densities were high and then the concentration increased when the power density dropped power generation benefits nitrogen removal since denitrifiers are able to respire with the cathode as the electron donor feng et al 2015 this is one of the explanations as to why more nitrates remained in the pmfc stack without capacitor the pmfc stack system performed well during the 40 day operation with real wastewater as the substrate indicating the system may have a good stability in the large scale application based on the results a compact and easily stackable module is proposed that combines four anodic chambers and four capacitors the modules can be connected in series for large scale applications to enhance voltage output of the pmfc stack fig s4 preliminary estimation indicates that the voltage across the external resistance would reach 220 v using about 370 modules installed in a 6 m3 algal raceway pond thus the modules can be coupled with most of the existing arps high rate algal ponds or even wastewater treatment plants to recovery energy from wastewater the design of the pmfc stack can not only reduce the capital cost but also benefit the algal growth power generation and pollutant removal in addition the structure of a pmfc stack can be optimized by changing the number of units and the number of capacitors according to equation 1 1 u k f n m where u is the voltage output of the pmfc stack k is the number of modules f n m is the voltage output of an individual module n and m respectively represent the number of units and capacitors in each module herein we analysed the correlation between number of units and voltage output of a module under the condition m 4 fig s5 in that case the voltage output of a pmfc stack can be estimated by equation 2 2 u 1 39 k 1 32 k e 0 14 n 3 3 dynamics of bacterial community compositions the bacterial community is one of the most important factors that affects the power generation and pollutant removal of the pmfc stack in the present study the evolution of bacterial compositions at the anodes was analysed to investigate the influence of the capacitor circuit on the bacterial community and also to reveal the main bacteria related to the power generation and the organic degradation overall a total of 677964 sequences were recovered from all samples and these sequences were further clustered into 1030 otus at a 97 similarity threshold chao indices of uto level for the two systems both increased during the experiment fig 4 b for the stack without capacitors the value of the chao index reached 838 31 on the 35th day which was significantly higher p 0 001 than the value for the raw ade kw day 0 the chao index of the stack without capacitors was also higher than that with capacitors on the 35th day p 0 017 these results indicate that the species richness in both stacks improved during the experiment and the system without capacitors obtained a higher species richness the shannon index can be used to characterize species diversity according to fig 4b species diversity in both systems decreased slightly on the 10th day and then increased again indicating that the bacteria acclimatised well in the two stacks compared to the stack without capacitor there was no dramatic change in species richness and diversity in the stack with capacitors p 0 05 thus the stack with capacitors had a more stable bacterial community during the experiment a total of 34 phyla were identified in the two systems and the major phyla for each sample are shown in fig 4a firmicutes are the primary microorganisms in anaerobic digesters that are capable of disintegrating high molecular compounds such as proteins and carbohydrates zhao et al 2017 and they accounted for about 40 3 3 0 of the total microbial sequences in the raw ade kw fig 4d the content of firmicutes increased over the first 10 days in both stacks and then decreased to about 22 0 on the 35th day clostridia were the most abundant class within the firmicutes phylum and similar trends were observed in the changes undergone by clostridia and firmicutes fig s7 thus the abundance of firmicutes was mainly determined by the class of clostridia the variations in the percentage of proteobacteria were similar to that of firmicutes which increased during the first 10 days and then declined in the following days gammaproteobacteria accounted for about 7 1 3 1 of the total microbial sequences in the raw ade kw but they continuously decreased in number in the stacks during the experiment the percentage of betaproteobacteria in the population increased dramatically from below 0 1 to over 12 0 during the first 10 days but the percentage declined after that fig s7 according to fig 3c the organic matter was removed rapidly in the first 10 days thus the increases in clostridia and betaproteobacteria may greatly contribute to the organics removal during this period bacteroidetes which are proteolytic bacteria were probably involved in the degradation of meat residues during anaerobic digestion garcia pena et al 2011 and they accounted for about 23 7 6 0 of the total microbial sequences in the ade kw the content of bacteroidetes in the two stacks dropped rapidly to around 10 in the first 10 days and then the content rose again in the following days thus bacteroidetes members mainly contributed to the organics removal in the later days rather than the initial few days members of the synergistetes phylum have been detected in anaerobic digesters wastewater treatment plants and bioelectrochemical reactors but they were not present in a high percentage lesnik and liu 2014 in this study the proportion of synergistetes in the two stacks increased rapidly from 2 3 to over 18 0 and they became the most abundant phyla in the stack with capacitors on the 35th day the variations in the bacterial compositions in the two systems showed similar tendencies during the experiment indicating that the dynamics of bacterial community compositions were not greatly affected by the capacitor circuit the bacterial community in the stack without capacitors changed more substantially compared to that of the system with capacitors a lda effect size lefse algorithm was used to elucidate the evolution of bacterial communities in the pmfc stacks fig 5 a and a total of 55 biomarkers were found in this study at a threshold of 4 0 there were 12 biomarkers belonging to the raw ade kw day 0 tenericutes p5 was one of the major phyla 12 0 1 5 in the raw ade kw and acholeplasma g13 11 9 1 5 was the major genus within this phylum however the content of acholeplasma decreased to a low level on the 10 days in the two stacks members of tenericutes are acidogenic bacteria which produce organic acids at high substrate concentrations wirth et al 2012 li et al 2016 proved that the high organic loading rate benefited the growth of acholeplasma in a mesophilic anaerobic digester in the pmfc stacks the substrate was consumed rapidly in the first few days which may result in the decline of the genus acholeplasma such results suggest that the genus acholeplasma offered little contribution to electricity generation in the stacks though they were capable of degrading food waste in anaerobic digesters a total of 17 biomarkers were found on the 10th day in the stacks with more biomarkers being observed in the stack without capacitors firmicutes p1 as the dominant phylum in the two stacks was found to be significantly enriched in the stack without capacitors on the 10th day according to previous studies firmicutes was the major phylum present at the anodes of mfcs and it played a vital role in the process of degrading complex substances yan et al 2018 the percentage of firmicutes in the community showed a positive correlation with the power density fig s8 suggesting that the firmicutes members may be related to power generation in the stacks erysipelotrichia c3 and clostridia c1 were the two classes within the firmicutes phylum that were present the erysipelotrichia class accounted for 13 3 4 2 of the total microbial sequences in the raw ade kw but they decreased steadily to about 4 on the 35th day fig s7 unlike erysipelotrichia the clostridia content showed a positive correlation with power density fig 5 these results indicate that bacteria in clostridia class may play a more important role in power generation than do erysipelotrichia members clostridia affiliated bacteria are capable of degrading complex carbohydrates to produce a wide range of simple metabolites gu et al 2014 a previous study reported that the peak voltages from mfcs were tightly associated with the abundances of clostridia members jiang et al 2016 sedimentibacter fastidiosipila syntrophomonas and syntrophaceticus were four major genera within clostridia three of which sedimentibacter syntrophomonas and syntrophaceticus attained relatively large proportions under the condition of high power density fig s7 sedimentibacter have the ability to degrade a wide range of hydrocarbons tischer et al 2013 and it was detected as the main genus in many previous mfc studies lesnik and liu 2014 chen et al 2016 syntrophomonas and syntrophaceticus are common fermenting bacteria detected in anaerobic digesters shen et al 2016 westerholm et al 2010 syntrophomonas was also found to be enriched in carbon electrode reactors for promoting fatty acid degradation and methane production zhao et al 2016 but their capability in power generation applications need further investigation betaproteobacteria c6 was the predominant class within the proteobacteria and it was found to be significantly enriched in the stack with capacitors on the 10th day betaproteobacteria members were also a dominant species reported in other mfcs such as the mfcs inoculated with glucose river sediment and anaerobic sludge quan et al 2012 the changes in betaproteobacteria content showed a similar tendency to those of the power density indicating that betaproteobacteria members may be related to the power generation fig 5 advenella g9 was a predominant genus belonging to the class of betaproteobacteria and the content of advenella in the stack with capacitors on the 10th day 12 8 4 5 manifested a remarkable difference from this genus in other samples advenella as a type of mesophilic bacterium was also found to be enriched 37 8 in a stillage fed mfc ma et al 2018 kumar et al 2017 reported that a species of advenella accounted for 55 7 of the anodic microbial community in a mfc in the present study the variations in the percentage of advenella showed a positive correlation with changes in power density fig s8 therefore advenella as a member of the betaproteobacteria may play an important role in power generation the lowest number of biomarkers to be found was 8 which occurred on the 25th day whereas a total of 18 biomarkers were found on the 35th day these observations indicate that the microbial community changed greatly after the power density dropped to a low level the percentage of bacteroidetes p4 decreased to less than 13 in the two stacks on the 10th day and then rose again to be the primary microorganism on the 35th day the predominance of bacteroidetes in the anodic microbial communities was also reported in previous studies yusoff et al 2013 shimoyama et al 2009 ha et al 2012 however most of those published results were determined at a single experimental time and consequently ignored variation in the bacterial communities herein the changes in bacteroidetes and actinobacteria contents were analysed throughout the experimental period and they showed a negative correlation with the power density fig 5 our results indicate that the growth of the major bacteroidetes and actinobacteria members was inhibited when power density was high although they were present in high proportions during the experiment this conclusion differs from those of some previous studies in which bacteroidetes members played a vital role in power generation yusoff et al 2013 shimoyama et al 2009 the different types of substrates among other things may be responsible for inconsistent conclusions regarding the effect of bacteria in power generation zhang et al 2011 4 conclusion in this study a pmfc stack which consisted of multiple anodic chambers installed in an arp was developed to recover energy from the ade kw the highest voltage output of the stack reached 1 4 v with the assistance of a capacitor circuit during the long term operation the highest power density of the stack with four units was enhanced by 77 to about 2 34 w m3 through the use of the capacitor circuit the nitrogen removal rate reached 88 6 overall in the system with capacitors attributable to an ammonium migration effect bacterial community analysis indicates that members of clostridia and betaproteobacteria were related to power generation while bacteroidetes bacteria were inhibited when power density was high the pmfc stack system established in this study is a concrete step to promote the use of these technologies in real world applications acknowledgements this research was funded by the national science fund for excellent young scholars of china 51322811 appendix a supplementary data the following is the

18563,photosynthetic microbial fuel cells pmfcs allow renewable energy production from wastewater however system scale up is still a major challenge hindering the use of pmfcs for practical applications herein a pmfc stack which consisted of multiple anodic chambers installed in an algal raceway pond arp was established to recovery energy from anaerobically digested effluent with the assistance of a prototypical capacitor circuit the highest voltage output of the stack reached 1 4 v with four pmfc units and four capacitors the system can produce stable voltages through controlling charging and discharging frequencies and the voltage output remained stable around 0 60 v when the time interval decreased to 2 s during long term operation the highest power density of the stack with capacitors reached 2 34 w m3 which was 77 higher than that without capacitors 1 32 w m3 about 98 of the ammonium in the anolyte was removed resulting from the ammonium migration effect the dynamics of bacterial community compositions were not greatly influenced by the capacitor circuit and the stack with capacitors had a more stable bacterial community compared to the stack without capacitors the variations in bacterial community composition following power density changes indicated that members of the clostridia and betaproteobacteria were related to power generation bacteria affiliated to bacteroidetes were inhibited when power density was high though their numbers were enriched at the end of the process this study promotes a practical method for developing the pmfc technology into real world applications and furthermore reveals the main bacteria that play vital roles in power generation by analysing the anodic bacterial community during the whole process graphical abstract image 1 keywords photosynthetic microbial fuel cell stack capacitors power density pollutant removal bacterial community 1 introduction photosynthetic microbial fuel cells pmfcs which consist of a combination of algal cultivation and microbial fuel cell mfc technology are considered to be an environmentally friendly approach for bioenergy recovery ma et al 2017 yang et al 2019 wang et al 2019 pmfcs are capable of generating electricity from organic matter with the aid of bacteria in the anodic chamber sun et al 2016 the processes of algal cultivation in the cathodic chamber are able to produce photosynthetic o2 which can be used as an electron acceptor for the cathode reaction thereby saving on energy by omitting aeration wang et al 2019 in addition algal cultivation has been identified as an effective way to assimilate nutrients and it can also generate valuable by products such as lipids ma et al 2017 therefore pmfcs represent a promising technology for simultaneous bioenergy production and removal of organics and nutrients however voltages generated from pmfcs are generally small with a maximal open circuit voltage ocv of about 0 8 v aelterman et al 2006 the low voltage is an obstacle for the development of the pmfc technology as the voltage is too low to be used directly for practical applications chemical fuel cell stacks have been developed successfully to increase the voltage output steele and heinzel 2001 practical applications of pmfcs or mfcs such as recovering energy from wastewater will likely require the use of multiple units but for mfc stacks issues such as voltage reversal and ionic short circuiting may occur when the mfcs are connected in series li et al 2014 voltage reversal which results from substrate depletion or high current conditions may lead to a low or nearly zero voltage of the stack aelterman et al 2006 ionic short circuiting was encountered in mfc stacks that shared one catholyte or anolyte zhuang and zhou 2009 those challenges observed in mfc stacks are also the main obstacles that limit the development of pmfc stacks which might be one of the explanations as to why there has been no study on pmfc stacks reported until now parallel connection is a more feasible way to establish a stable pmfc stack current from a pmfc stack will increase by parallel connection but voltage output can not be enhanced significantly liang et al 2018 the low voltage output would limit the stack application for powering electronic devices thus it is necessary to integrate devices that can boost the voltage output of a parallel pmfc stack so far research on power management systems for mfcs is in its infancy sun et al 2016 several energy harvesting technologies have been used to boost voltage output from mfcs such as the ones based on capacitors dc dc converters and battery energy storage sun et al 2016 ge et al 2015 a power management system with a dc dc voltage boost converter can successfully increase voltage output but it will result in a power loss of 40 60 donovan et al 2011 battery energy storage systems are not an ideal technology to directly harvest energy from a parallel pmfc stack because the ocv of a parallel stack is not high enough capacitors are capable of quickly storing or releasing large amounts of energy with negligible energy loss kim et al 2011 in addition the voltage output can be enhanced several times through charging in parallel and discharging in series multiple capacitors alternately in a previous study a capacitor circuit successfully improved the voltage output of a mfc stack during one day of operation but this study mainly focused on the feasibility of this method kim et al 2011 it is worth investigating the system stability and the influence of capacitor circuit on the stack in a long term operation considering these inherent conditions a pmfc stack is developed that consists of multiple anodic chambers pmfc units installed in an algal raceway pond arp the arp also functions as the cathodic chamber in this system to avoid issues like voltage reversal the pmfc units are connected in parallel two arrays of capacitors are charged and discharged alternately via a capacitor circuit to boost the voltage output of the stack theoretically the voltage is adequate to power electronic devices or charge batteries when enough units and capacitors are used furthermore the proposed pmfc stack has an advantage in ammonium rich wastewater treatment large amounts of ammonium in the anodic chambers can diffuse into the raceway pond through cation exchange membranes and then be assimilated by algae or removed at the cathode after being oxidized by photosynthetic o2 yang et al 2019 in this study an example pmfc stack with 4 pmfc units and 4 capacitors 2 sets of 2 capacitors was established to treat anaerobically digested effluent from kitchen waste ade kw first the charging and discharging abilities were investigated for different numbers of pmfc units the performance of the pmfc stack was then evaluated in a long term experiment the evolution of microbial community in the pmfc stack was also analysed during the experiment 2 materials and methods 2 1 pmfc stack set up the pmfc stack consisted of a cathodic chamber and four anodic chambers as illustrated in fig 1 the cathodic chamber was a rectangular arp with a working volume of 16 l length 650 mm height 250 mm width 110 mm the anodic chambers were tubular vessels height 200 mm diameter 60 mm with a working volume of 0 36 l which were established according to a previous study yang et al 2019 carbon brushes height 150 mm diameter 30 mm were used as the anodes in the anodic chambers ten rectangular holes height 160 mm width 5 mm were set into the wall of the anodic chamber for ion exchange the anodic chamber was wrapped by a cation exchange membrane cem and then a carbon cloth functioning as the cathode was wrapped around the cem raw ade kw collected from a local anaerobic digester was provided as substrate in the anodic chamber the ade kw contained 6015 280 mg l cod 2365 160 mg l nh4 n 180 5 mg l no3 n 26 1 mg l no2 n and 95 3 mg l tp the cathodic chamber was used to cultivate the green alga golenkinia sp sdec 16 accession no kt180320 with 4 v v ade kw before being diluted with deionized water the ade kw was centrifuged to reduce its dark colouration so that the light is more accessible to algae during the experiment the catholyte was inoculated with an initial algal biomass concentration of about 0 1 mg l the room temperature was controlled to be around 25 c continuous mixing 300 rpm was provided for the catholyte using magnetic stirrers a row of fluorescent lamps provided a continuous illumination of 100 μmol m s for the system 2 2 operating conditions to avoid voltage reversal the pmfc stack was connected in parallel first the polarization and power curves of the stack were measured by varying the external resistance the volumetric power density w m3 was normalized to the volume of anolyte m3 thereafter a demonstration capacitor circuit was connected with the stack to boost the voltage output fig s2 the charging and discharging ability of the system was investigated two capacitors 2 7 v 4 7 f were charged in parallel by the stack with different numbers of pmfc units and then discharged in series to an external resistance 100 ω in the long term operation the stack was configured with four units and a capacitor circuit to treat the ade kw in a batch experiment lasting 40 days the charging and discharging of the capacitor circuit were alternated every 2 s the prototype capacitor circuit was controlled by a relay s8fs c qingjun electronics co china and a microcontroller plc qingjun electronics co china so that a stable voltage output was achieved a pmfc stack without a capacitor circuit was operated as a control 2 3 measurement and analysis voltage output from the pmfc stack was monitored using a data acquisition system model 2700 keithley instruments usa cod and nutrient concentrations were measured according to a previous study yang et al 2019 the algal biomass concentration was determined with a 20 ml sample of algal suspension the algal suspension was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min by a centrifuge tdl 8 m luxiangyi china and then dried using a lyophilizer eyela fdu 1200 tokyo rikakikai co japan mass fractions of n and p in the algal biomass were evaluated with about 0 1 g of dry powdered algae after digestion with h2so4 and h2o2 the lipid contents of the algae were measured using a chloroform methanol mixture 2 1 v v pei et al 2017 the anode bacterial community was characterized using illumina high throughput sequencing all experiments were conducted in biological triplicate the significance of the results was assessed and p 0 05 was recognized as being statistically significant the quantity of charge q stored in a capacitor was calculated as q c f u where c f is the capacitance of the capacitor and u is the voltage across the capacitor the average current i from the capacitor can be estimated with equation i q t where t is the charging or discharging time the capacitances of two parallel capacitors cp and two series capacitors cs were calculated with the equations c p 2 c f and c s c f 2 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 boosting the voltage of the pmfc stack by use of a capacitor circuit a pmfc stack was established consisting of four pmfc units installed in an arp first the polarization and power density curves of the stack were investigated with different numbers of pmfc units fig 2 the maximal power density of the stack with four pmfc units was about 16 6 w m3 which was approximately twice as much as the system with single unit the ocv of the pmfc stack with four units was about 0 69 v which was similar to that of an individual unit polarization curves generally included three zones logan et al 2006 first voltage dropped steeply at low currents second voltage decreased slowly with increasing current then the voltage dropped rapidly again at high currents the voltage output decreased much more slowly with the increase of current when more pmfc units were used in the stack especially in the second zone this result indicates that more units contributed to a low internal resistance of the stack current reversal was observed in a parallel mfc stack with low ocv at a high external resistance wu et al 2016 however this phenomenon did not occur in the pmfc stack either in the short term operation or in the long term operation next capacitors were used to boost the voltage output of the parallel pmfc stack as illustrated in fig 2 two capacitors were charged in parallel by the stack with different numbers of units and then discharged in series to the external resistance during the charging period the highest voltages were about 0 40 v 0 55 v 0 65 v and 0 69 v when the number of units was one two three and four respectively the stack with four units charged the two capacitors at the fastest rate the average charging current of the circuit with four units was about 2 6 ma corresponding to a total charge quantity q of 6 5 c the q value in the two capacitors charged by the single unit was about 3 8 c with an average charging current of less than 1 6 ma it is notable that the capacitor voltage increased rapidly in the beginning but increased very slowly in the later period in the pmfc stack system with four units the average charging current was about 18 ma in the first 240 s but the current dropped to less than 1 ma after 240 s when the two capacitors were discharged in series to the external resistance the voltage output reached nearly 1 4 v for the system with four pmfc units this result indicates that negligible energy was lost during the charging and discharging process on the basis of the charge stored in the capacitors q however the capacitors discharged at a relatively fast rate especially when the voltage was high hence the charging current should be high enough to yield a stable voltage output the pmfc stack was able to charge two capacitors with a relatively high current of 18 ma in the first 240 s leading to the maximal discharging voltage of about 0 90 v according to fig 2c the voltages of the two series capacitors would decrease from 0 90 v to about 0 23 v when they discharged for 240s corresponding to an average discharging current close to 5 6 ma however the average discharging current would be about 6 6 ma if it were calculated from the variation of q the different results may be due to the actual capacitance of the capacitor being lower than the nominal value stated by the manufacture to obtain a stable voltage output the capacitors were charged in parallel and discharged in series frequently via a demonstration circuit fig s2 the voltage output of the system is shown in fig 2d for different time intervals t i the highest voltage output reached nearly 0 90 v when the t i was 240 s but the lowest voltage of about 0 23 v was also observed as t i decreased from 240 s to 60 s a minor voltage oscillation was observed ranging from 0 49 v to 0 69 v when the t i decreased to 2 s the voltage output remained stable around 0 60 v without obvious oscillation these results demonstrate that the pmfc stack system can produce stable voltages through controlling charging and discharging frequencies the current in the circuit with 2 s intervals was calculated to be about 7 2 ma based on the variation in q but the actual current of in the circuit was about 6 ma this discrepancy confirmed that the actual capacitances of the capacitors were lower than their stated nominal values when there was no capacitor applied in the system the respective voltages of the systems with one unit and four units were about 0 31 v and 0 45 v fig 2d thus the parallel stack also enhanced the voltage outputs in addition to the current and power after four capacitors two pairs were added to the system the voltage output increased to 0 6 v which is about double the voltage produced by an individual pmfc and 33 higher than for the stack without capacitors thus a stable and boosted voltage output can be obtained from the parallel pmfc stack using capacitors 3 2 energy generation and pollutant removal in the pmfc stack to investigate the performance of the pmfc stack the system was operated with four units and a capacitor circuit to treat ade kw for 40 days fig 3 the highest power density of the pmfc stack with capacitors was 2 34 0 11 w m3 which was about 77 higher than the stack operated without capacitors 1 32 0 03 w m3 an energy harvesting device was used to extract energy from a mfc stack in a previous study and it obtained a power density of about 1 7 w m3 in long term operation ge et al 2015 the power density of the stack with capacitors began to decrease on the 12th day and reached a stable value of about 1 35 0 06 w m3 on the 19th day after that the power density dropped rapidly to a low level of about 0 41 0 03 w m3 for the stack without capacitors the power density decreased slowly from 1 4 0 02 w m3 to 0 9 0 01 w m3 in the first 30 days the total electricity produced from the stack with capacitors was 1 25 0 01 kw h m3 which was 29 higher than the stack without capacitors 0 97 0 01 kw h m3 considering the high cod concentration in the ade kw the power densities generated from the pmfc stacks were relatively low pmfcs are particularly suitable for treating low strength soluble organics while the ade kw contained large amount of refractory substances li et al 2013 thus the refractory substances were first degraded by hydrolytic bacteria before being used for power generation which may decrease the electricity generated from the pmfc stacks besides high concentrations of substrate can inhibit the activity of exoelectrogens which may reduce voltage output of the pmfc stack luo et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 reported that the pretreated cathodes generated high power densities over time with power losses of only around 15 after 17 months of operation thus pretreatment of the electrodes such as heat treatment may increase the power generation and prolong the lifetime of the pmfc stack in the long term operation algal growth in the catholyte could provide o2 for the cathode reaction and also produce biomass nitrogen is the most frequent macronutrient that limits algal growth solovchenko et al 2016 in this study a nitrogen source could be supplied for algal growth continuously by ammonium migration from anolyte to catholyte the growth curves for the algae cultivated in the catholyte are shown in fig 3b algal concentration increased rapidly during the first 8 days and reached a plateau on the 20th day the highest biomass concentrations in stacks with and without capacitors were about 1 06 0 12 g l and 1 15 0 07 g l respectively the algal lipid contents of the two stacks were 32 2 2 5 with capacitors and 30 7 3 4 without capacitors after preliminary estimation the energy produced in the form of lipid was both about 0 10 kw h m3 for each stack therefore the total energy produced from the pmfc stack with capacitors was about 1 35 0 02 kw h m3 with electricity contributing the majority of the energy produced the removal of organic matter is shown in fig 3c the respective cod removal efficiencies in stacks with and without capacitors were 88 6 and 84 0 corresponding to average cod removal rates of 92 5 6 0 mg l d and 87 7 6 3 mg l d the removal rates were relatively low compared to the previously reported value of about 150 mg l d in a pmfc operating on synthetic wastewater campo et al 2013 large amounts of refractory organics contained in the ade kw may lead to the low cod removal rates in the stacks the coulombic efficiency ce of the stack increased slightly from 14 7 to 15 3 after the capacitor circuit was introduced into the system the ce values were similar to those obtained in an individual pmfc or mfc yang et al 2019 teng et al 2010 the results indicate that the oxidation reaction at the anode may not be perceptibly affected by the presence of capacitors nitrogen removal in the pmfc stacks is shown in fig 3 about 98 of the ammonium was removed in the anolyte of the stack with capacitors previous studies indicated that the ammonium losses in the anolyte of mfcs were primarily due to ammonium migrating into the catholyte through the cem kim et al 2008 ammonium migration was mainly attributed to two mechanisms feng et al 2017 1 passive diffusion of the ammonium from the anode to the cathode chambers due to concentration difference 2 ammonium migration driven by the maintenance of charge balance the average ammonium migration rates in the stacks with and without capacitors were about 2 6 0 2 g m2 d and 2 5 0 2 g m2 d respectively more electricity generated from the stack with capacitors may result in a relatively high ammonium migration rate since charge neutrality was one of the reasons driving the ammonium migration feng et al 2017 however the gap in average migration rates between the two stacks was small considering the large difference in electricity generation large gaps were only observed in the initial 10 days when the ammonium concentrations and power densities were high fig s3 after that the differences in ammonium migration rates were narrowed due to the decreasing ammonium concentrations in the anolyte and migration competition of other cations such as na k ammonium concentration in the catholyte increased in the initial days and then dropped rapidly to about 10 mg l fig 3 nitrate and nitrite concentrations maintained a low level during the first 24 days but they both increased in the later period of the experiment in terms of the whole system including anodic chamber and cathodic chamber about 88 6 of the nitrogen was removed in the stack with capacitors corresponding to a nitrogen removal rate of 5 3 0 4 mg l d ammonium in the catholyte was able to be removed by algal uptake it is estimated that about 32 9 1 8 of the removed nitrogen was assimilated by algae in the stack with capacitors according to the nitrogen content in the algal biomass ammonium in the catholyte could also be removed through being oxidized to nitrogen oxides by photosynthetic o2 virdis et al 2010 the nitrate and nitrite concentrations decreased to undetectable levels in the stack with capacitors when the power densities were high and then the concentration increased when the power density dropped power generation benefits nitrogen removal since denitrifiers are able to respire with the cathode as the electron donor feng et al 2015 this is one of the explanations as to why more nitrates remained in the pmfc stack without capacitor the pmfc stack system performed well during the 40 day operation with real wastewater as the substrate indicating the system may have a good stability in the large scale application based on the results a compact and easily stackable module is proposed that combines four anodic chambers and four capacitors the modules can be connected in series for large scale applications to enhance voltage output of the pmfc stack fig s4 preliminary estimation indicates that the voltage across the external resistance would reach 220 v using about 370 modules installed in a 6 m3 algal raceway pond thus the modules can be coupled with most of the existing arps high rate algal ponds or even wastewater treatment plants to recovery energy from wastewater the design of the pmfc stack can not only reduce the capital cost but also benefit the algal growth power generation and pollutant removal in addition the structure of a pmfc stack can be optimized by changing the number of units and the number of capacitors according to equation 1 1 u k f n m where u is the voltage output of the pmfc stack k is the number of modules f n m is the voltage output of an individual module n and m respectively represent the number of units and capacitors in each module herein we analysed the correlation between number of units and voltage output of a module under the condition m 4 fig s5 in that case the voltage output of a pmfc stack can be estimated by equation 2 2 u 1 39 k 1 32 k e 0 14 n 3 3 dynamics of bacterial community compositions the bacterial community is one of the most important factors that affects the power generation and pollutant removal of the pmfc stack in the present study the evolution of bacterial compositions at the anodes was analysed to investigate the influence of the capacitor circuit on the bacterial community and also to reveal the main bacteria related to the power generation and the organic degradation overall a total of 677964 sequences were recovered from all samples and these sequences were further clustered into 1030 otus at a 97 similarity threshold chao indices of uto level for the two systems both increased during the experiment fig 4 b for the stack without capacitors the value of the chao index reached 838 31 on the 35th day which was significantly higher p 0 001 than the value for the raw ade kw day 0 the chao index of the stack without capacitors was also higher than that with capacitors on the 35th day p 0 017 these results indicate that the species richness in both stacks improved during the experiment and the system without capacitors obtained a higher species richness the shannon index can be used to characterize species diversity according to fig 4b species diversity in both systems decreased slightly on the 10th day and then increased again indicating that the bacteria acclimatised well in the two stacks compared to the stack without capacitor there was no dramatic change in species richness and diversity in the stack with capacitors p 0 05 thus the stack with capacitors had a more stable bacterial community during the experiment a total of 34 phyla were identified in the two systems and the major phyla for each sample are shown in fig 4a firmicutes are the primary microorganisms in anaerobic digesters that are capable of disintegrating high molecular compounds such as proteins and carbohydrates zhao et al 2017 and they accounted for about 40 3 3 0 of the total microbial sequences in the raw ade kw fig 4d the content of firmicutes increased over the first 10 days in both stacks and then decreased to about 22 0 on the 35th day clostridia were the most abundant class within the firmicutes phylum and similar trends were observed in the changes undergone by clostridia and firmicutes fig s7 thus the abundance of firmicutes was mainly determined by the class of clostridia the variations in the percentage of proteobacteria were similar to that of firmicutes which increased during the first 10 days and then declined in the following days gammaproteobacteria accounted for about 7 1 3 1 of the total microbial sequences in the raw ade kw but they continuously decreased in number in the stacks during the experiment the percentage of betaproteobacteria in the population increased dramatically from below 0 1 to over 12 0 during the first 10 days but the percentage declined after that fig s7 according to fig 3c the organic matter was removed rapidly in the first 10 days thus the increases in clostridia and betaproteobacteria may greatly contribute to the organics removal during this period bacteroidetes which are proteolytic bacteria were probably involved in the degradation of meat residues during anaerobic digestion garcia pena et al 2011 and they accounted for about 23 7 6 0 of the total microbial sequences in the ade kw the content of bacteroidetes in the two stacks dropped rapidly to around 10 in the first 10 days and then the content rose again in the following days thus bacteroidetes members mainly contributed to the organics removal in the later days rather than the initial few days members of the synergistetes phylum have been detected in anaerobic digesters wastewater treatment plants and bioelectrochemical reactors but they were not present in a high percentage lesnik and liu 2014 in this study the proportion of synergistetes in the two stacks increased rapidly from 2 3 to over 18 0 and they became the most abundant phyla in the stack with capacitors on the 35th day the variations in the bacterial compositions in the two systems showed similar tendencies during the experiment indicating that the dynamics of bacterial community compositions were not greatly affected by the capacitor circuit the bacterial community in the stack without capacitors changed more substantially compared to that of the system with capacitors a lda effect size lefse algorithm was used to elucidate the evolution of bacterial communities in the pmfc stacks fig 5 a and a total of 55 biomarkers were found in this study at a threshold of 4 0 there were 12 biomarkers belonging to the raw ade kw day 0 tenericutes p5 was one of the major phyla 12 0 1 5 in the raw ade kw and acholeplasma g13 11 9 1 5 was the major genus within this phylum however the content of acholeplasma decreased to a low level on the 10 days in the two stacks members of tenericutes are acidogenic bacteria which produce organic acids at high substrate concentrations wirth et al 2012 li et al 2016 proved that the high organic loading rate benefited the growth of acholeplasma in a mesophilic anaerobic digester in the pmfc stacks the substrate was consumed rapidly in the first few days which may result in the decline of the genus acholeplasma such results suggest that the genus acholeplasma offered little contribution to electricity generation in the stacks though they were capable of degrading food waste in anaerobic digesters a total of 17 biomarkers were found on the 10th day in the stacks with more biomarkers being observed in the stack without capacitors firmicutes p1 as the dominant phylum in the two stacks was found to be significantly enriched in the stack without capacitors on the 10th day according to previous studies firmicutes was the major phylum present at the anodes of mfcs and it played a vital role in the process of degrading complex substances yan et al 2018 the percentage of firmicutes in the community showed a positive correlation with the power density fig s8 suggesting that the firmicutes members may be related to power generation in the stacks erysipelotrichia c3 and clostridia c1 were the two classes within the firmicutes phylum that were present the erysipelotrichia class accounted for 13 3 4 2 of the total microbial sequences in the raw ade kw but they decreased steadily to about 4 on the 35th day fig s7 unlike erysipelotrichia the clostridia content showed a positive correlation with power density fig 5 these results indicate that bacteria in clostridia class may play a more important role in power generation than do erysipelotrichia members clostridia affiliated bacteria are capable of degrading complex carbohydrates to produce a wide range of simple metabolites gu et al 2014 a previous study reported that the peak voltages from mfcs were tightly associated with the abundances of clostridia members jiang et al 2016 sedimentibacter fastidiosipila syntrophomonas and syntrophaceticus were four major genera within clostridia three of which sedimentibacter syntrophomonas and syntrophaceticus attained relatively large proportions under the condition of high power density fig s7 sedimentibacter have the ability to degrade a wide range of hydrocarbons tischer et al 2013 and it was detected as the main genus in many previous mfc studies lesnik and liu 2014 chen et al 2016 syntrophomonas and syntrophaceticus are common fermenting bacteria detected in anaerobic digesters shen et al 2016 westerholm et al 2010 syntrophomonas was also found to be enriched in carbon electrode reactors for promoting fatty acid degradation and methane production zhao et al 2016 but their capability in power generation applications need further investigation betaproteobacteria c6 was the predominant class within the proteobacteria and it was found to be significantly enriched in the stack with capacitors on the 10th day betaproteobacteria members were also a dominant species reported in other mfcs such as the mfcs inoculated with glucose river sediment and anaerobic sludge quan et al 2012 the changes in betaproteobacteria content showed a similar tendency to those of the power density indicating that betaproteobacteria members may be related to the power generation fig 5 advenella g9 was a predominant genus belonging to the class of betaproteobacteria and the content of advenella in the stack with capacitors on the 10th day 12 8 4 5 manifested a remarkable difference from this genus in other samples advenella as a type of mesophilic bacterium was also found to be enriched 37 8 in a stillage fed mfc ma et al 2018 kumar et al 2017 reported that a species of advenella accounted for 55 7 of the anodic microbial community in a mfc in the present study the variations in the percentage of advenella showed a positive correlation with changes in power density fig s8 therefore advenella as a member of the betaproteobacteria may play an important role in power generation the lowest number of biomarkers to be found was 8 which occurred on the 25th day whereas a total of 18 biomarkers were found on the 35th day these observations indicate that the microbial community changed greatly after the power density dropped to a low level the percentage of bacteroidetes p4 decreased to less than 13 in the two stacks on the 10th day and then rose again to be the primary microorganism on the 35th day the predominance of bacteroidetes in the anodic microbial communities was also reported in previous studies yusoff et al 2013 shimoyama et al 2009 ha et al 2012 however most of those published results were determined at a single experimental time and consequently ignored variation in the bacterial communities herein the changes in bacteroidetes and actinobacteria contents were analysed throughout the experimental period and they showed a negative correlation with the power density fig 5 our results indicate that the growth of the major bacteroidetes and actinobacteria members was inhibited when power density was high although they were present in high proportions during the experiment this conclusion differs from those of some previous studies in which bacteroidetes members played a vital role in power generation yusoff et al 2013 shimoyama et al 2009 the different types of substrates among other things may be responsible for inconsistent conclusions regarding the effect of bacteria in power generation zhang et al 2011 4 conclusion in this study a pmfc stack which consisted of multiple anodic chambers installed in an arp was developed to recover energy from the ade kw the highest voltage output of the stack reached 1 4 v with the assistance of a capacitor circuit during the long term operation the highest power density of the stack with four units was enhanced by 77 to about 2 34 w m3 through the use of the capacitor circuit the nitrogen removal rate reached 88 6 overall in the system with capacitors attributable to an ammonium migration effect bacterial community analysis indicates that members of clostridia and betaproteobacteria were related to power generation while bacteroidetes bacteria were inhibited when power density was high the pmfc stack system established in this study is a concrete step to promote the use of these technologies in real world applications acknowledgements this research was funded by the national science fund for excellent young scholars of china 51322811 appendix a supplementary data the following is the

18564,advanced oxidation using uv free chlorine and uv chloramines are being considered as alternatives to uv h2o2 for treatment of reverse osmosis ro permeate in treatment trains for the potable reuse of municipal wastewater this pilot scale comparison of the three advanced oxidation processes aops evaluated three factors important for selecting among these alternatives first the study characterized the speciation of oxidants serving as the source of radicals within the aops to facilitate process modeling kinetic modeling that included consideration of the chloramines occurring in ro permeate accurately predicted oxidant speciation modeling of the uv free chlorine aop indicated that free chlorine is scavenged by reactions with ammonia and monochloramine in ro permeate such that oxidant speciation can shift in favor of dichloramine over the short 30 s timescale of aop treatment second the order of efficacy for degrading the target contaminant 1 4 dioxane in terms of minimizing uv fluence was uv free chlorine uv h2o2 uv chloramines however estimates indicated that the uv chloramines and uv h2o2 aops could be similar on a cost effectiveness basis due to savings in reagent costs by the uv chloramines aop provided the ro permeate featured 3 mg l as cl2 chloramines third the study evaluated whether the use of chlorine based oxidants within the uv free chlorine and uv chloramines aops enhanced disinfection byproduct dbp formation even after aop treatment and chloramination total halogenated dbp formation remained low at 15 μg l for all three aops dbp formation was similar between the aops except that the uv free chlorine aop promoted haloacetaldehyde formation while the uv h2o2 and uv chloramines aops followed by chloramination increased chloropicrin formation however total dbp formation on a toxic potency weighted basis was similar among the aops since haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides were the dominant contributors and did not differ significantly among the aops graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv free chlorine aop uv chloramines aop 1 4 dioxane disinfection byproduct potable reuse 1 introduction microfiltration mf reverse osmosis ro and the uv hydrogen peroxide advanced oxidation process uv h2o2 aop is a common advanced treatment train for the purification of municipal wastewater for potable reuse gerrity et al 2013 mf and ro provide physical barriers to the passage of contaminants marron et al 2019 in addition to providing disinfection via uv light the uv h2o2 aop serves as a broad screen chemical barrier by generating hydroxyl radicals oh equation 1 which react with a wide array of contaminants with nearly diffusion controlled rate constants buxton et al 1988 the chloramines typically applied upstream of mf to control biofouling are carried over to the aop process because they pass readily through mf and ro membranes while monochloramine nh2cl is the predominant chloramine species upstream of ro the conversion of monochloramine to dichloramine nhcl2 is promoted in ro permeate due to its low ph 5 7 and effective rejection of nh4 by ro membranes equation 2 mccurry et al 2017 accordingly the uv h2o2 aops in these trains operate in practice as mixed uv h2o2 uv nh2cl and uv nhcl2 aop systems 1 h2o2 hν 2 oh 2 nh2cl nh2cl h nhcl2 nh4 the uv h2o2 aop features two drawbacks first hydroxyl radical production is inefficient during uv photolysis of h2o2 using the 254 nm photons emitted by low pressure mercury lamps when uv254 0 02 cm 1 indicating negligible competition for photon absorption by other solution components the production of radicals r during photolysis of an oxidant coxid at 254 nm can be described by equation 3 3 d r d t 2 303 φ r ε i 0 c o x i d where φ r is the quantum yield for radical production in mol einstein ε is the molar absorption coefficient of the oxidant m 1 cm 1 and i0 is the incident light intensity mein cm 2 s 1 this equation is typically valid for ro permeate including the ro permeate samples employed in this study uv254 0 02 cm 1 table s1 accordingly the radical production efficiency from different oxidants is determined by the product of the molar absorption coefficient and quantum yield φ r ε this product is relatively low for h2o2 ε 18 6 m 1 cm 1 morgan et al 1988 and φr 1 crittenden et al 1999 as a result 20 of the h2o2 is photolyzed to produce radicals during aop treatment second for aop product waters requiring chlorine or chloramine disinfectant residuals for distribution the h2o2 residual exerts a substantial chlorine demand equation 4 that must be exhausted in order to provide the residual requiring quenching of h2o2 4 hocl h2o2 o2 h2o cl h there is growing interest in the uv free chlorine and uv chloramines aops as alternative aops the uv free chlorine aop produces oh and cl by uv photolysis of hocl or ocl equations 5 7 jin et al 2011 fang et al 2014 the uv photolysis of nh2cl produces cl and nh2 equation 8 while nhcl2 photolysis produces cl and nhcl equation 9 chuang et al 2017 patton et al 2017 2018 cl can degrade contaminants directly or form oh via equations 10 12 mcelroy 1990 nowell and hoigne 1992 remucal and manley 2016 compared to h2o2 radical production rates can be higher by factors of 4 from hocl ε 62 m 1 cm 1 and φr 1 24 since the quantum yield for hocl photolysis is 0 62 and photolysis generates 2 radicals chuang et al 2017 7 from nh2cl ε 371 m 1 cm 1 and φr 0 35 zhang et al 2019 and 5 5 from nhcl2 ε 136 m 1 cm 1 and φr 0 75 zhang et al 2019 however net radical exposure from the uv free chlorine and uv chloramines aops is moderated by the higher radical scavenging efficiency of chloramines koh nh2cl 1 02 109 m 1 s 1 koh nhcl2 6 21 108 m 1 s 1 zhang et al 2019 and ocl koh ocl 1 85 109 m 1 s 1 chuang et al 2017 compared to h2o2 koh h2o2 2 70 107 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 an additional benefit is that the residual chlorine or chloramines after treatment by these aops contribute directly to the chlorine or chloramine residuals that may be needed for distribution while avoiding the chlorine demand required to quench residual h2o2 the uv chloramines aop can also utilize chloramines already present in the ro permeate thereby reducing the cost of oxidant addition 5 hocl hν oh cl 6 ocl hν o cl 7 o h oh 8 nh2cl hν nh2 cl 9 nhcl2 hν nhcl cl 10 cl oh cloh 11 cl h2o cloh h 12 cloh oh cl however three important concerns must be addressed before using these alternative aops to treat ro permeate first modeling aop process performance requires an accurate characterization of the oxidant species occurring within the aops since these species serve as the source of the radicals recently we developed improved kinetic models for the uv free chlorine chuang et al 2017 and the uv chloramines aops zhang et al 2019 encompassing more accurate estimates of oxidant quantum yields for photolysis and the subsequent reactions of radicals these models were able to simultaneously predict the oxidant decay and the degradation of contaminants observed in laboratory experiments however most previous research has focused on the pure uv h2o2 uv free chlorine and uv chloramines aops without accounting for the role of chloramines occurring in ro permeate interactions between the oxidants could alter the oxidant speciation thereby impacting aop performance second further evaluation of the performance of the different aops with respect to contaminant degradation is needed in ro permeate a typical performance metric for aop systems employed in potable reuse trains is 0 5 log removal of 1 4 dioxane california state water resources control board 2018 an ingredient in chlorinated solvents and personal care products kwon et al 2008 steinemann et al 2013 laboratory scale research in deionized water buffered at ph 5 5 has suggested that the uv free chlorine aop can be more efficient for achieving this performance target chuang et al 2017 limited laboratory scale research has compared 1 4 dioxane degradation by these aops in ro permeate where the chloramines can reduce the performance of the uv h2o2 aop with respect to 1 4 dioxane degradation by scavenging oh patton et al 2018 pilot scale treatment of 1 4 dioxane using the chloramines already present in ro permeate alone or supplemented with monochloramine indicated 0 2 log removal at 900 mj cm2 uv fluence but 0 5 log removal at 2500 mj cm2 fluence mangalgiri et al 2018 1 4 dioxane degradation by the uv h2o2 chloramines aop was nearly 50 lower compared to the pure uv h2o2 aop where the chloramines had been quenched prior to the aop but 30 50 higher than for the pure uv chloramines aop zhang et al 2019 a third critical research need is to characterize the potential of these alternative reactive chlorine based aops to produce halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps dbps are a key concern for potable reuse because their concentrations in potable reuse waters are closer to those of potential human health concern compared with other contaminant classes e g pharmaceuticals national research council 2012 dbps form from the reaction of precursor compounds with free chlorine and chloramines in addition to these dark reactions of precursors with free chlorine and chloramines it is possible that dbp formation may be promoted during uv free chlorine or uv chloramines via addition of cl to the precursors by transformation of the precursors by cl or oh to forms that are more reactive with residual disinfectants dotson et al 2010 liu et al 2012 wang et al 2015 or by reactions of free chlorine or chloramines with photo excited precursors most previous studies on dbp formation from these aops have focused on the application of the uv free chlorine aop to conventional drinking water these drinking water studies indicated that the uv free chlorine aop enhanced the formation of haloacetic acids haloketones haloacetonitriles and halonitromethanes wang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 particularly at the lower ph conditions where the uv free chlorine aop is most effective wang et al 2012 chuang et al 2017 and cl is more stable i e the reverse of equation 11 to address these data gaps this work compared the application of the uv h2o2 uv free chlorine and uv chloramines aops to ro permeate at pilot scale for a potable reuse application the objectives were to 1 validate the ability of kinetic models to predict the mixture of oxidants occurring in these aops 2 compare the performance of these aops with respect to 1 4 dioxane degradation and 3 to characterize the formation of 35 regulated and unregulated halogenated dbps during the aop treatment and after application of chloramines to the aop product water to simulate chloramine contact relevant to distributing this water pilot testing is particularly important for understanding these effects for two reasons first pilot testing incorporates the background chloramines and dbp precursors in authentic ro permeate the dbp precursors can differ significantly from those in the drinking waters evaluated in previous research watts and linden 2007 sichel et al 2011 yang et al 2016 second rapid reactions are possible between the oxidants changing the oxidant speciation and between the oxidants and dbp precursors leading to dbp formation pilot scale aop systems can deliver the 700 1000 mj cm2 uv fluence range typically used for potable reuse applications within 1 min timescales while 30 min may be needed for the lower intensity illumination systems used in laboratory scale systems thus the oxidant speciation and dbp formation may differ between pilot and laboratory scale aop treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and sodium hypochlorite naocl working stock solutions were prepared by diluting 5 6 6 5 naocl and 30 h2o2 solutions with deionized di water monochloramine stock solutions were prepared fresh daily by slowly adding a 100 mm naocl solution into a 120 mm ammonium chloride solution while mixing with a magnetic stir bar the concentrations of h2o2 and naocl stock solutions were standardized spectrophotometrically at 254 nm ε 254 nm 18 6 m 1 cm 1 morgan et al 1988 and 292 nm ε 292 nm 365 m 1 cm 1 feng et al 2007 respectively the concentrations of nh2cl solutions were determined by measuring the absorbance at 245 nm and 295 nm as described previously schreiber and mitch 2005 mccurry et al 2017 chemical sources are provided in the supporting information text s1 2 2 experimental procedures pilot scale experiments were carried out at the orange county water district using a 9 7 l reactor equipped with a 257 w low pressure high output lpho mercury lamp trojan technologies ontario canada at a full scale potable reuse facility fig s1 additional description of the pilot may be found in mangalgiri et al 2018 the reactor was fed permeate from the full scale ro membranes at 6 gpm resulting in a 26 s hydraulic residence time based on the comparison of the degradation of chloramines and h2o2 in the ro permeate between a laboratory scale collimated beam apparatus and the pilot scale system the uv fluence was estimated to be 1000 mj cm2 text s2 the stock solutions of oxidants i e h2o2 free chlorine and nh2cl and 1 4 dioxane were injected into the influent through separate static mixers by peristaltic pumps upstream of the uv reactor the contact time between the oxidants and ro permeate before uv treatment was 3 s two pilot testing events were conducted separated by 2 months table s1 provides basic water quality parameters for the ro permeate samples for these events during event 1 the experiments were conducted over three days with each day evaluating one aop under four different conditions 1 an ambient condition using only the background chloramines present in the ro permeate at ph 5 7 2 low oxidant dosages involving 2 7 mg l as cl2 for free chlorine 1 3 mg l as cl2 for nh2cl or 3 1 mg l for h2o2 at ph 5 7 3 high oxidant dosages involving 6 8 mg l as cl2 for free chlorine 4 6 mg l as cl2 for nh2cl or 6 2 mg l for h2o2 at ph 5 7 and 4 the same high oxidant dosages but with pre adjustment of the ph from the ambient 5 7 to 7 0 using 1 m naoh the oxidant doses were selected to match typical conditions employed in practice the adjustment of ph to 7 0 was evaluated based on previous research suggesting that this adjustment directly after ro treatment could mitigate ndma formation mccurry et al 2017 these four conditions were repeated in the morning and in the afternoon to capture the daily water quality variation during event 2 the ambient condition the uv h2o2 aop 3 mg l the uv free chlorine aop 2 mg l as cl2 and the uv chloramines aop 2 mg l as cl2 were tested to compare different aops using ro permeate from the same day the applied oxidant doses were calculated based upon the oxidant stock concentrations and relative flowrates of the influent to the uv reactor and the oxidant dosing pumps in addition samples collected from the feed water just after oxidant addition uvf and the product water uvp of the uv reactor were analyzed on site for ammonia monochloramine free chlorine total chlorine and h2o2 ammonia and monochloramine were measured by hach method 10200 free chlorine and total chlorine residual were measured by hach methods 10069 and 10070 respectively hydrogen peroxide was measured by the titanium oxalate method sellers 1980 gordon et al 1988 the time intervals between sample collection and measurement were 3 min for the feed water and 6 min for the product water reflecting the timescales required for sample preparation the total chlorine residual in one set of samples was quenched using 33 mg l ascorbic acid upon sample collection to measure dbp concentrations before uvf and after uvp aop treatment another set of samples was not treated with ascorbic acid but was chloraminated under uniform formation conditions ufc conditions mimicking typical chloramination conditions for distribution shah et al 2012 the purpose of ufc testing was to evaluate the potential for continued dbp formation within the distribution system these samples were adjusted to ph 8 with 4 mm borate buffer ammonium chloride and sodium hypochlorite were then added to the samples at dosages calculated using equations 13 and 14 to achieve an initial monochloramine concentration of 5 mg l as cl2 with a 20 molar excess of ammonia 13 nh4 added mm 5 tcr background mg l as cl2 71 1 2 nh4 background mm 14 naocl added mm 5 tcr background mg l as cl2 71 where tcr is the total chlorine residual the samples were stored in the dark at room temperature 20 21 c after 3 days the total chlorine residual was quenched by ascorbic acid and the samples were extracted for dbp analysis 2 3 analysis of dbps and 1 4 dioxane and toxicity weighting for dbps a total of 35 halogenated dbps in eight classes were analyzed including the four regulated trihalomethanes thm4 six iodinated trihalomethanes i thms ten haloacetic acids haas including iodoacetic acid iaa four haloacetonitriles hans four haloacetaldehydes hals four haloacetamides hams two haloketones hks and one halonitromethane hnm trichloronitromethane chloropicrin tcnm the dbps were extracted by modified usepa methods 551 1 and 552 3 and analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms with 0 05 0 2 μg l reporting limits as described previously zeng and mitch 2016 chuang and mitch 2017 1 4 dioxane samples 40 ml were spiked with deuterated d6 1 4 dioxane as an internal standard and extracted into methyl tert butyl ether mtbe the mtbe extracts were analyzed by gc ms with a 0 9 μg l reporting limit additional methods details are provided in text s1 the contribution of a dbp to the toxicity of a disinfected water is a function of its concentration and its toxic potency to obtain initial estimates of the relative importance of different dbp classes for the dbp associated toxicity of disinfected waters measured dbp concentrations were weighted by metrics of toxic potency li and mitch 2018 except for bromodiiodomethane and the two haloketones the concentrations of each dbp associated with a 50 reduction in the growth of chinese hamster ovary cho cells relative to untreated controls lc50 values a measure of cytotoxicity have been determined by the same research group table s3 wagner and plewa 2017 for a subset of the regulated thms and haas concentrations associated with a 50 lifetime excess cancer risk lecr50 were available table s3 low lc50 or lecr50 values correspond to higher toxic potencies measured dbp concentrations were divided by the lower of their lc50 or lecr50 values to obtain their toxicity weighted concentrations as described in our previous studies zeng et al 2016 chuang and mitch 2017 szczuka et al 2017 using the lower of the lc50 and lecr50 values enhanced the potential importance of the regulated dbps since lecr50 values were not available for the other dbps these values were summed to estimate the total toxicity weighted dbp concentrations assuming that toxicity is additive while this assumption needs validation in future toxicology studies it enables an initial comparison of the dbp associated toxicity of the product waters of the different aops 2 4 kinetic modeling a chemical kinetics model combining 125 elementary reactions table s4 was implemented using kintecus 4 55 ianni 2012 this model combined our previous aop models chuang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 with reactions associated with breakpoint chlorination jafvert and valentine 1992 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidant speciation reactions of applied oxidants with the chloramines in ro permeate can alter oxidant speciation affecting radical production within the aops the first set of pilot tests event 1 evaluated oxidation speciation within the uv free chlorine uv chloramines and uv h2o2 aops each with a low or a high oxidant dose at ph 5 7 a high oxidant dose at ph 7 or an ambient condition i e no oxidant addition at ph 5 7 representing uv treatment with only the chloramines present in the ro permeate as a result of upstream application in the full scale facility for membrane biofouling control each condition was tested twice once in the morning and once in the afternoon table s5 provides the averages and ranges of the nh3 n free chlorine monochloramine total chlorine residual and hydrogen peroxide measured in the uv feed and product waters 3 min and 6 min after oxidant addition respectively the shortest time periods over which it was feasible to conduct the measurements dichloramine nhcl2 concentrations were calculated assuming dichloramine represents the difference between the total chlorine residual and the sum of the free chlorine and monochloramine concentrations the ambient condition representing uv treatment with only the residual chloramines in the ro permeate was repeated 6 times over 3 days i e in duplicate for each aop the oxidant speciation was remarkably consistent with the monochloramine and total chlorine residual concentrations varying by 0 3 mg l as cl2 from their average values in both the uv feed and product waters uv treatment reduced the average monochloramine concentration 64 from 2 2 mg l as cl2 to 0 8 mg l as cl2 and the average total chlorine residual concentration 59 from 3 4 mg l as cl2 to 1 4 mg l as cl2 the calculated average dichloramine concentration decreased 50 from 1 2 mg l as cl2 to 0 6 mg l as cl2 thus dichloramine constituted 32 of the total chloramines in the ro permeate higher than expected since free chlorine typically is added upstream of ro at molar ratios 1 relative to ammonia previous research has demonstrated that injection of concentrated sodium hypochlorite stock solutions into ammonia containing wastewater e g upstream of ro can promote dichloramine formation due to the locally high chlorine to ammonia ratio at the site of chlorine addition furst et al 2018 other research has indicated that ro treatment can promote the disproportionation of monochloramine into dichloramine by decreasing the ph and preferentially rejecting free ammonium mccurry et al 2017 after uv treatment dichloramine constituted 40 of the total chloramines similar to the percentage prior to uv treatment these results concur with research indicating that the uv photolysis rates of monochloramine and dichloramine at 254 nm are similar li and blatchley 2009 zhang et al 2019 the low dose uv free chlorine aop condition illustrates the complex oxidant speciation resulting from the rapid reactions that can occur between oxidants the total ammonia concentration 44 4 μm associated with free ammonia 4 3 μm or 0 06 mg n l monochloramine 32 μm and dichloramine 8 μm in the ro permeate would necessitate 4 7 mg l as cl2 67 μm total chlorine to exceed the breakpoint when 2 7 mg l as cl2 free chlorine the low dose condition was added to the 3 4 mg l as cl2 total chlorine residual in the ro permeate the breakpoint would have been exceeded eventually resulting in inorganic chloramine destruction however breakpoint chlorination reactions under these conditions occur over 0 5 hr timescales jafvert and valentine 1992 considerably longer than even the 3 6 min timescale over which the measurements were conducted accordingly the measured oxidant speciation reflects the concentrations of oxidants in the midst of these breakpoint reactions at 3 min after free chlorine addition the total chlorine residual measured in the feed water was 5 6 mg l as cl2 this value reflects a loss of 0 5 mg l as cl2 from breakpoint reactions relative to the 6 1 mg l as cl2 expected after free chlorine addition table s5 the 2 7 mg l as cl2 free chlorine concentration added to the feed water had decreased to 1 1 mg l as cl2 while the monochloramine concentration had decreased from 2 3 mg l as cl2 to 0 9 mg l as cl2 in contrast the calculated dichloramine concentration had increased from 1 1 mg l as cl2 to 3 6 mg l as cl2 becoming the dominant constituent of the total chlorine residual measured in the uv feed water however the oxidation speciation entering the aop may differ even from that measured 3 min after oxidant addition in the aop pilot facility the added oxidants mixed with the ro permeate for 3 s prior to exposure to uv light in the reactor and the residence time within the aop unit was 26 s this 30 s total timescale was shorter than the 3 min and 6 min needed to measure oxidant speciation in the uv feed and product waters respectively to characterize the oxidant speciation within the aops a kinetic model was used to predict the oxidant speciation in the uv feed and product waters this model combined a model for breakpoint chlorination reactions jafvert and valentine 1992 with models for the uv h2o2 crittenden et al 1999 uv free chlorine chuang et al 2017 and uv chloramines zhang et al 2019 aops table s4 the model used the combination of the residual oxidant concentrations measured in the ro permeate prior to oxidant addition and the doses of oxidants applied to the uv feed water as input to validate the model we compared the oxidant speciation measured in samples of uv feed water 3 min after oxidant addition and in samples of uv product water 6 min after oxidant addition to those predicted by the kinetic model for the low oxidant dose conditions at ph 5 7 for the uv chloramines and uv h2o2 aops and for the low and high oxidant dose conditions at ph 5 7 for the uv free chlorine aop fig 1 the oxidant speciation predicted by the kinetic model agreed well with the measured speciation except for the total residual chlorine concentrations during the uv h2o2 aop pilot runs here the measured total chlorine residual concentration was higher than that predicted by the model because hydrogen peroxide partially contributes to the measured total chlorine residual by reacting with the dpd reagent these results indicate that the model can accurately predict the oxidant speciation entering and leaving the aop for the uv chloramines and uv h2o2 aops oxidant speciation remained relatively constant over the 3 6 min timescales over which measurements were taken due to the low reactivity between different oxidant species i e h2o2 and chloramines as a result the oxidant speciations entering and leaving the aop would be similar to those measured in the uv feed and product waters fig 1 the monochloramine or hydrogen peroxide added to the background levels of monochloramine or dichloramine table 1 uv treatment decreased the concentrations of monochloramine and dichloramine by 60 and 50 respectively confirming their similar photodegradation rates li and blatchley 2009 zhang et al 2019 the degradation of hydrogen peroxide was much lower at 10 table 1 however for the uv free chlorine aop modeling indicates that the oxidant speciation can change significantly even over the 6 min timescale needed to measure the oxidant species on site for example for addition of 2 7 mg l as cl2 free chlorine the model indicated that the free chlorine and monochloramine concentrations measured in the uv feed water 3 min after free chlorine addition were 50 lower than those that would have entered the uv reactor fig 1 accordingly modeling is of critical importance for understanding the oxidant speciation within the aop for this condition modeling indicated that 0 3 mg l as cl2 of the 2 7 mg l as cl2 free chlorine added reacted within 1 s consuming all of the 0 06 mg n l free ammonia and increasing the concentrations of monochloramine and dichloramine by 0 2 mg l as cl2 and 0 1 mg l as cl2 respectively table 1 and s5 on an average basis for the morning and afternoon pilot runs for the low dose free chlorine condition uv treatment reduced the free chlorine concentration by 38 0 9 mg l as cl2 the monochloramine concentration by 68 1 7 mg l as cl2 the total chlorine residual by 46 2 6 mg l as cl2 but the dichloramine concentration by only 17 0 2 mg l as cl2 table 1 as a result the dichloramine concentration in the uv product water exceeded that of monochloramine and was only 30 lower than the concentration of free chlorine since the uv photodegradation rates of monochloramine and dichloramine are similar li and blatchley 2009 zhang et al 2019 these results suggest that the reaction of free chlorine with monochloramine during aop treatment was predominantly responsible for the change in speciation in favor of dichloramine this alteration in chloramine speciation in favor of dichloramine could have implications for the treatment of ndma since its formation is associated with reactions of precursors with dichloramine schreiber and mitch 2006 in a parallel study ndma destruction was also measured in this experiment results showing decreased ndma destruction in the uv free chlorine aop are presented elsewhere roback et al 2019 3 2 1 4 dioxane degradation during both events 1 and 2 the degradation of 15 μg l 1 4 dioxane spiked into the ro permeate was evaluated to validate the relevance of the treatment conditions to potable reuse scenarios where 0 5 log removal 68 is targeted california state water resources control board 2018 fig 2 provides the 1 4 dioxane removal during event 1 for the same experimental runs previously discussed with respect to oxidant speciation table 1 the ambient condition that only employed chloramines already present in the ro permeate 3 4 mg l as cl2 total chloramines table 1 was conducted in duplicate during each of the 3 days of testing one day for each aop the removal of 1 4 dioxane was fairly consistent at 35 0 19 log for this ambient condition at ph 5 7 ambient ph of ro permeate the order of 1 4 dioxane removal efficiency for both low and high dose oxidant conditions was uv free chlorine uv h2o2 uv chloramines this higher performance of the uv free chlorine aop at ph 5 7 in authentic ro permeate containing chloramines concurs with a previous laboratory scale comparison of these aops in deionized water without background chloramines chuang et al 2017 the higher oxidant dose exhibited slightly higher 1 4 dioxane degradation for the uv free chlorine and uv h2o2 aops but these aops achieved 0 5 log removal of 1 4 dioxane under both oxidant dosing conditions adding chloramines above the background chloramines did not improve the performance of the uv chloramines aop the lack of improved performance agrees with our recent laboratory scale results using ro permeate where for chloramine concentrations 3 mg l as cl2 the background concentration in this ro permeate the increase in radical scavenging by additional chloramines offset the increase in radical production zhang et al 2019 the uv chloramines aop did not achieve the 0 5 log 1 4 dioxane removal target at the 1000 mj cm2 uv fluence used for this pilot test for the high oxidant dose at ph 7 the most significant difference was that the performance of the uv free chlorine aop was reduced and was approximately 20 lower than that of the uv h2o2 aop fig 2 the reduced performance of the uv free chlorine aop at higher ph concurs with previous laboratory scale results for treatment of 1 4 dioxane in deionized water and is attributable to the higher efficiency of oh scavenging by ocl 1 85 109 m 1 s 1 than hocl 5 0 108 m 1 s 1 chuang et al 2017 additionally cl conversion to oh is enhanced at higher ph equations 11 and 12 fig s2 provides the removal of 1 4 dioxane during event 2 where an ambient condition 2 3 mg l as cl2 background chloramines and 2 mg l as cl2 free chlorine or chloramines and 3 mg l hydrogen peroxide at ph 5 7 were tested during the same day the results for the uv free chlorine and uv h2o2 aops were similar to those during event 1 however only 25 0 12 log of 1 4 dioxane was removed during the ambient condition compared to the 35 0 19 log removal during event 1 which featured 3 4 mg l as cl2 background chloramines the lower removal concurs with our previous laboratory scale results indicating that for chloramine concentrations 3 mg l as cl2 reducing the chloramine concentration decreases performance zhang et al 2019 although reducing chloramine concentrations decreases radical production and scavenging by chloramines overall radical scavenging remains constant as scavenging by doc and carbonates begin to dominate in event 2 the addition of 2 mg l as cl2 chloramines to the feed water increased the 1 4 dioxane removal to 40 our model was able to accurately predict oxidant speciation for all three aops table 1 fig 1 however the prediction of 1 4 dioxane degradation was only accurate for the uv h2o2 aop which is a de facto uv h2o2 chloramines aop fig 2 the model overpredicted 1 4 dioxane degradation for the uv chloramines aop and underpredicted 1 4 dioxane degradation for the uv free chlorine aop both of these aops produce cl whose reactions with doc were not included in the model since rate constants were not available in our previous work the model was able to predict 1 4 dioxane degradation during laboratory scale treatment by the uv chloramines and uv h2o2 chloramines aops in deionized water and in ro permeate from another facility but underpredicted 1 4 dioxane degradation in ro permeate from the same facility at which pilot testing was conducted for this study zhang et al 2019 the reaction rate constant for cl reaction with 1 4 dioxane has been reported to be low at 4 4 106 m 1 s 1 patton et al 2017 accordingly cl first converts to oh prior to reacting with 1 4 dioxane our results suggest that components of doc at this facility are highly reactive with cl such that scavenging of cl prevents its conversion to oh and reaction with 1 4 dioxane because this effect was not observed with ro permeate from the other facility zhang et al 2019 the importance of cl scavenging by doc in ro permeate is unclear research is needed to develop techniques for distinguishing cl and oh reactions with doc to enable the measurement of cl reaction rate constants with doc in the case of the uv free chlorine aop previous research has indicated that certain components of doc such as alcohols and acetate can promote the chain decomposition of hocl chuang et al 2017 the enhanced production of radicals during this chain decomposition may account for the increased degradation of 1 4 dioxane relative to that predicted by the model but additional research is needed to understand this phenomenon we developed initial cost estimates to compare the application of the three aops to achieve 0 5 log removal of 1 4 dioxane in ro permeate from this facility text s5 these calculations considered the electrical cost associated with the uv fluence needed to achieve 0 5 log removal estimated at 1000 mj cm2 770 mj cm2 and 2000 mj cm2 for the uv h2o2 uv free chlorine and uv chloramines aops respectively for the uv h2o2 aop the 23 34 million liter ml total cost estimate also considered the cost of h2o2 the sodium hypochlorite needed to quench residual h2o2 not required at this study s facility but may be required at some facilities and the sodium hypochlorite and ammonium sulfate needed to leave a 2 5 mg l as cl2 chloramine residual however if no residual is needed the uv h2o2 aop cost estimate is 10 86 ml no quenching and no final chloramine addition for the uv free chlorine aop the 12 41 ml total cost also considered the costs of the sodium hypochlorite addition for the aop and the reagents needed to provide the chloramine residual this cost was roughly half of that for uv h2o2 aop treatment for the case in which a chloramine residual is required driven by savings in chemical reagent costs for uv chloramines aop treatment of ro permeate containing 3 4 mg l as cl2 e g event 1 the 23 63 ml total cost included the much higher fluence needed to overcome the relative inefficiency of 1 4 dioxane destruction and also considered the costs for the chloramine reagents needed to maintain a sufficient residual during treatment and to provide a residual in transmission pipelines while this total cost was comparable to that for the uv h2o2 aop treatment the average total cost would likely be higher because additional chloramines would need to be added upstream of the aop when the chloramine concentration in the ro permeate is below 3 mg l as cl2 e g event 2 estimates based on previous laboratory scale research found that the cost for uv chloramines and uv h2o2 aop treatments could be comparable for ro permeate from this facility but that the uv chloramines aop could be more cost effective for treating ro permeate from another facility likely due to lower concentrations of cl scavengers zhang et al 2019 3 3 dbp formation concentrations of different classes of dbps were measured in the feed uvf and product waters uvp of the pilot uv aop reactor during events 1 fig 3 and tables s6 s11 and 2 fig s4 and tables s12 and s13 for one set of samples the total chlorine residual was immediately quenched to evaluate the dbp concentrations already present in the uvf i e plant ro permeate or formed during aop treatment uvp sample another set of uvf uvp samples was chloraminated under uniform formation conditions ufc to evaluate the potential for dbp formation in the distribution system the ufc test result is an indirect measure of total dbp precursors in the sample plus any background dbps already present over the 3 days of event 1 that included six pilot runs under ambient conditions the dbp concentrations differed slightly fig 3a c with an average total dbp concentration in the uvf of 6 8 μg l consisting of 4 7 0 8 μg l average standard deviation n 6 thm4 1 2 0 2 μg l haloacetonitriles 0 6 0 2 μg l haloacetamides and 0 3 0 0 μg l haa9 iodinated thms iodoacetic acid haloacetaldehydes and chloropicrin were not detected after chloramine ufc treatment the average total dbp concentration in the feed water samples for the ambient conditions increased moderately to 10 6 μg l and was also similar overall between the six different pilot runs consisting of 7 3 1 1 μg l thm4 1 6 0 3 μg l haloacetonitriles 0 9 0 3 μg l haloacetamides 0 6 0 1 μg l haa9 0 14 0 07 μg l haloacetaldehydes and 0 09 0 02 μg l chloropicrin these relatively small increases after 3 days of chloramine contact indicated low concentrations of residual dbp precursors in the ro permeate i e uvf application of oxidants to the feed water typically increased dbp concentrations 15 relative to the ambient condition due to the short contact time 3 min prior to quenching the chlorine or chloramine residuals however application of 6 8 mg l as cl2 free chlorine to the feed water increased haloacetaldehydes from 0 05 μg l to 0 13 μg l dbp concentrations in the feed water were similar during event 2 although the thm4 6 7 1 2 μg l and haloacetamide 1 0 0 3 μg l concentrations were higher compared to event 1 while haas were not detected the total concentrations of dbps were consistent with those observed in other ro permeates zeng et al 2016 chuang et al 2019a and low relative to those observed in conventional drinking waters chuang et al 2019b the aop treatments preferentially reduced the concentrations of the brominated dbp species for example the aop treatments removed 50 of dibromochloromethane and 70 of tribromomethane but 20 of bromodichloromethane or trichloromethane during event 1 tables s6 s11 the preferential removal of brominated dbp species reflects their higher degradation rates by uv direct photolysis and higher reaction rate constants with oh chuang et al 2016 however since the chlorinated species dominated the preferential removal of brominated dbps typically resulted in only minor changes in the total dbp concentrations measured in both quenched 1 μg l and chloramine ufc treated 1 5 μg l uv product water samples fig 3 there were two notable exceptions to the above observation of limited changes in the concentrations of dbps and their precursors ufc by the aop treatments the uv free chlorine aop tended to increase haloacetaldehyde formation both during aop treatment and after ufc chloramination during both events fig 4 and tables s12 and s13 an increase in haloacetaldehyde formation was observed previously at a different facility for pilot scale uv free chlorine aop treatment followed by chloramination but not uv h2o2 aop treatment followed by chloramination chuang et al 2019b similarly pre treatment of a drinking water with uv light from a medium pressure mercury lamp followed by chloramination increased the formation of trichloroacetaldehyde shah et al 2012 the other notable exception was that treatment by the uv chloramines and the uv h2o2 aops increased the formation of chloropicrin after ufc chloramination i e increased the formation of chloropicrin precursors during both events fig 5 and tables s12 and s13 previous work observed enhanced chloropicrin formation during uv treatment of nitrate or nitrite containing drinking waters with medium pressure mercury lamps followed by chlorination or chloramination the formation was attributed to the production of nitrated organic precursors via reactions of the reactive nitrogen species e g no2 produced by uv photolysis of nitrite or nitrate shah et al 2011 during uv chloramine and uv h2o2 aop treatment of ro permeate uv photolysis of chloramines can also produce reactive nitrogen species zhang et al 2019 when dbp concentrations were weighted by metrics of toxic potency haloacetamides and haloacetonitriles accounted for 90 of the calculated toxic potency weighted dbp concentrations in both the uv feed and product waters before and after chloramine ufc treatment with approximately equal contributions from these two classes figs s3 and s4 aop treatments altered the calculated toxicity weighted dbp concentrations typically by 25 although haloacetaldehydes and chloropicrin formation were altered by certain aops they were minor contributors to the calculated total toxicity weighted dbp concentrations 4 conclusions this pilot scale study evaluated uv free chlorine and uv chloramines aops as alternatives to the uv h2o2 aop for treatment of ro permeate in potable reuse trains focusing on three critical considerations first we characterized the speciation of the oxidants that serve as the source for the production and scavenging of radicals during aop treatment our results demonstrated the ability of recently developed kinetic models to accurately predict oxidant speciation even within authentic ro permeate containing chloramines these chloramines are important since they produce radicals yet also serve as radical scavengers and can react with the applied oxidants for the uv free chlorine aop the results demonstrated that free chlorine reactions with ammonia and chloramines in ro permeate result in significant alterations in oxidant speciation with the concentrations of free chlorine and monochloramine declining relative to dichloramine the results indicate the need for kinetic modeling to characterize the oxidant speciation that occurs within the reactor because oxidant speciation can change rapidly even over the short timescales of treatment and oxidant analysis second we evaluated the ability of the different aops to degrade important target contaminants such as 1 4 dioxane at ph 5 7 relevant to ro permeate the order of 1 4 dioxane removal efficiency of the aops was uv free chlorine uv h2o2 uv chloramines noting that the uv h2o2 in potable reuse facilities is a de facto uv h2o2 chloramine aop at ph 7 the performance of the uv free chlorine aop declined relative to the uv h2o2 aop due to radical scavenging by ocl initial cost estimates indicate that uv free chlorine aop treatment to achieve 0 5 log 1 4 dioxane removal would be nearly half the cost for uv h2o2 aop treatment driven by savings in reagent costs provided a chloramine disinfectant residual is needed in transmission pipelines the cost for uv chloramines aop treatment could be comparable to uv h2o2 aop treatment despite the higher fluence required but only if the ro permeate already included a sufficient chloramine concentration for aop treatment e g 3 4 mg l as cl2 while kinetic modeling was able to predict oxidant speciation for all three aops and 1 4 dioxane degradation during uv h2o2 aop treatment research is needed to quantify cl reaction rate constants with the doc in ro permeate to improve the predictive ability of kinetic models for the uv free chlorine and uv chloramines aops third we assessed whether switching from the uv h2o2 aop to uv free chlorine or uv chloramines aops would significantly promote halogenated dbp formation including for currently unregulated dbps that may be considered more toxic than regulated dbps consistent with the observed low concentrations of dbp precursors in ro permeate total halogenated dbp concentrations remained 15 μg l in pilot feed and product water even after aop treatment and chloramination that mimicked transmission pipeline conditions aop treatments preferentially degraded brominated dbps however total dbp concentrations were similar before and after treatment for all of the aops because dbp speciation was dominated by chlorinated dbp species that are poorly removed by the aops and the short aop treatment time 30 s minimized dbp formation from dark reactions with the oxidants the formation of two dbp classes were promoted by aop treatment uv free chlorine aop treatment promoted the formation of haloacetaldehydes while uv h2o2 aop and uv chloramines aop treatment followed by chloramination promoted the formation of chloropicrin however weighting measured dbp concentrations by metrics of toxic potency indicated that haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides were the dominant contributors to the dbp associated toxicity and concentrations of these dbp classes were similar in aop treated product waters among the different aops total dbp concentrations on a mass or toxic potency weighted basis were comparable or lower than those measured previously in conventional drinking waters chuang et al 2019b considering both 1 4 dioxane removal and dbp formation this pilot study indicated that the uv free chlorine aop and to a lesser degree the uv chloramines aop could be cost effective alternatives to the uv h2o2 aop for treating target contaminants such as 1 4 dioxane in ro permeate without exacerbating halogenated dbp formation this is advantageous since it suggests facilities are free to select an aop treatment suited to their site specific preferences and cost drivers without halogenated dbp related water quality concerns the short timescale of pilot scale aop treatment was important for this evaluation to be representative in order to avoid the significant shifts in oxidant speciation and dbp formation by dark reactions involving the oxidants that would occur over the longer treatment times needed for laboratory scale aop systems declaration of

18564,advanced oxidation using uv free chlorine and uv chloramines are being considered as alternatives to uv h2o2 for treatment of reverse osmosis ro permeate in treatment trains for the potable reuse of municipal wastewater this pilot scale comparison of the three advanced oxidation processes aops evaluated three factors important for selecting among these alternatives first the study characterized the speciation of oxidants serving as the source of radicals within the aops to facilitate process modeling kinetic modeling that included consideration of the chloramines occurring in ro permeate accurately predicted oxidant speciation modeling of the uv free chlorine aop indicated that free chlorine is scavenged by reactions with ammonia and monochloramine in ro permeate such that oxidant speciation can shift in favor of dichloramine over the short 30 s timescale of aop treatment second the order of efficacy for degrading the target contaminant 1 4 dioxane in terms of minimizing uv fluence was uv free chlorine uv h2o2 uv chloramines however estimates indicated that the uv chloramines and uv h2o2 aops could be similar on a cost effectiveness basis due to savings in reagent costs by the uv chloramines aop provided the ro permeate featured 3 mg l as cl2 chloramines third the study evaluated whether the use of chlorine based oxidants within the uv free chlorine and uv chloramines aops enhanced disinfection byproduct dbp formation even after aop treatment and chloramination total halogenated dbp formation remained low at 15 μg l for all three aops dbp formation was similar between the aops except that the uv free chlorine aop promoted haloacetaldehyde formation while the uv h2o2 and uv chloramines aops followed by chloramination increased chloropicrin formation however total dbp formation on a toxic potency weighted basis was similar among the aops since haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides were the dominant contributors and did not differ significantly among the aops graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv free chlorine aop uv chloramines aop 1 4 dioxane disinfection byproduct potable reuse 1 introduction microfiltration mf reverse osmosis ro and the uv hydrogen peroxide advanced oxidation process uv h2o2 aop is a common advanced treatment train for the purification of municipal wastewater for potable reuse gerrity et al 2013 mf and ro provide physical barriers to the passage of contaminants marron et al 2019 in addition to providing disinfection via uv light the uv h2o2 aop serves as a broad screen chemical barrier by generating hydroxyl radicals oh equation 1 which react with a wide array of contaminants with nearly diffusion controlled rate constants buxton et al 1988 the chloramines typically applied upstream of mf to control biofouling are carried over to the aop process because they pass readily through mf and ro membranes while monochloramine nh2cl is the predominant chloramine species upstream of ro the conversion of monochloramine to dichloramine nhcl2 is promoted in ro permeate due to its low ph 5 7 and effective rejection of nh4 by ro membranes equation 2 mccurry et al 2017 accordingly the uv h2o2 aops in these trains operate in practice as mixed uv h2o2 uv nh2cl and uv nhcl2 aop systems 1 h2o2 hν 2 oh 2 nh2cl nh2cl h nhcl2 nh4 the uv h2o2 aop features two drawbacks first hydroxyl radical production is inefficient during uv photolysis of h2o2 using the 254 nm photons emitted by low pressure mercury lamps when uv254 0 02 cm 1 indicating negligible competition for photon absorption by other solution components the production of radicals r during photolysis of an oxidant coxid at 254 nm can be described by equation 3 3 d r d t 2 303 φ r ε i 0 c o x i d where φ r is the quantum yield for radical production in mol einstein ε is the molar absorption coefficient of the oxidant m 1 cm 1 and i0 is the incident light intensity mein cm 2 s 1 this equation is typically valid for ro permeate including the ro permeate samples employed in this study uv254 0 02 cm 1 table s1 accordingly the radical production efficiency from different oxidants is determined by the product of the molar absorption coefficient and quantum yield φ r ε this product is relatively low for h2o2 ε 18 6 m 1 cm 1 morgan et al 1988 and φr 1 crittenden et al 1999 as a result 20 of the h2o2 is photolyzed to produce radicals during aop treatment second for aop product waters requiring chlorine or chloramine disinfectant residuals for distribution the h2o2 residual exerts a substantial chlorine demand equation 4 that must be exhausted in order to provide the residual requiring quenching of h2o2 4 hocl h2o2 o2 h2o cl h there is growing interest in the uv free chlorine and uv chloramines aops as alternative aops the uv free chlorine aop produces oh and cl by uv photolysis of hocl or ocl equations 5 7 jin et al 2011 fang et al 2014 the uv photolysis of nh2cl produces cl and nh2 equation 8 while nhcl2 photolysis produces cl and nhcl equation 9 chuang et al 2017 patton et al 2017 2018 cl can degrade contaminants directly or form oh via equations 10 12 mcelroy 1990 nowell and hoigne 1992 remucal and manley 2016 compared to h2o2 radical production rates can be higher by factors of 4 from hocl ε 62 m 1 cm 1 and φr 1 24 since the quantum yield for hocl photolysis is 0 62 and photolysis generates 2 radicals chuang et al 2017 7 from nh2cl ε 371 m 1 cm 1 and φr 0 35 zhang et al 2019 and 5 5 from nhcl2 ε 136 m 1 cm 1 and φr 0 75 zhang et al 2019 however net radical exposure from the uv free chlorine and uv chloramines aops is moderated by the higher radical scavenging efficiency of chloramines koh nh2cl 1 02 109 m 1 s 1 koh nhcl2 6 21 108 m 1 s 1 zhang et al 2019 and ocl koh ocl 1 85 109 m 1 s 1 chuang et al 2017 compared to h2o2 koh h2o2 2 70 107 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 an additional benefit is that the residual chlorine or chloramines after treatment by these aops contribute directly to the chlorine or chloramine residuals that may be needed for distribution while avoiding the chlorine demand required to quench residual h2o2 the uv chloramines aop can also utilize chloramines already present in the ro permeate thereby reducing the cost of oxidant addition 5 hocl hν oh cl 6 ocl hν o cl 7 o h oh 8 nh2cl hν nh2 cl 9 nhcl2 hν nhcl cl 10 cl oh cloh 11 cl h2o cloh h 12 cloh oh cl however three important concerns must be addressed before using these alternative aops to treat ro permeate first modeling aop process performance requires an accurate characterization of the oxidant species occurring within the aops since these species serve as the source of the radicals recently we developed improved kinetic models for the uv free chlorine chuang et al 2017 and the uv chloramines aops zhang et al 2019 encompassing more accurate estimates of oxidant quantum yields for photolysis and the subsequent reactions of radicals these models were able to simultaneously predict the oxidant decay and the degradation of contaminants observed in laboratory experiments however most previous research has focused on the pure uv h2o2 uv free chlorine and uv chloramines aops without accounting for the role of chloramines occurring in ro permeate interactions between the oxidants could alter the oxidant speciation thereby impacting aop performance second further evaluation of the performance of the different aops with respect to contaminant degradation is needed in ro permeate a typical performance metric for aop systems employed in potable reuse trains is 0 5 log removal of 1 4 dioxane california state water resources control board 2018 an ingredient in chlorinated solvents and personal care products kwon et al 2008 steinemann et al 2013 laboratory scale research in deionized water buffered at ph 5 5 has suggested that the uv free chlorine aop can be more efficient for achieving this performance target chuang et al 2017 limited laboratory scale research has compared 1 4 dioxane degradation by these aops in ro permeate where the chloramines can reduce the performance of the uv h2o2 aop with respect to 1 4 dioxane degradation by scavenging oh patton et al 2018 pilot scale treatment of 1 4 dioxane using the chloramines already present in ro permeate alone or supplemented with monochloramine indicated 0 2 log removal at 900 mj cm2 uv fluence but 0 5 log removal at 2500 mj cm2 fluence mangalgiri et al 2018 1 4 dioxane degradation by the uv h2o2 chloramines aop was nearly 50 lower compared to the pure uv h2o2 aop where the chloramines had been quenched prior to the aop but 30 50 higher than for the pure uv chloramines aop zhang et al 2019 a third critical research need is to characterize the potential of these alternative reactive chlorine based aops to produce halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps dbps are a key concern for potable reuse because their concentrations in potable reuse waters are closer to those of potential human health concern compared with other contaminant classes e g pharmaceuticals national research council 2012 dbps form from the reaction of precursor compounds with free chlorine and chloramines in addition to these dark reactions of precursors with free chlorine and chloramines it is possible that dbp formation may be promoted during uv free chlorine or uv chloramines via addition of cl to the precursors by transformation of the precursors by cl or oh to forms that are more reactive with residual disinfectants dotson et al 2010 liu et al 2012 wang et al 2015 or by reactions of free chlorine or chloramines with photo excited precursors most previous studies on dbp formation from these aops have focused on the application of the uv free chlorine aop to conventional drinking water these drinking water studies indicated that the uv free chlorine aop enhanced the formation of haloacetic acids haloketones haloacetonitriles and halonitromethanes wang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 particularly at the lower ph conditions where the uv free chlorine aop is most effective wang et al 2012 chuang et al 2017 and cl is more stable i e the reverse of equation 11 to address these data gaps this work compared the application of the uv h2o2 uv free chlorine and uv chloramines aops to ro permeate at pilot scale for a potable reuse application the objectives were to 1 validate the ability of kinetic models to predict the mixture of oxidants occurring in these aops 2 compare the performance of these aops with respect to 1 4 dioxane degradation and 3 to characterize the formation of 35 regulated and unregulated halogenated dbps during the aop treatment and after application of chloramines to the aop product water to simulate chloramine contact relevant to distributing this water pilot testing is particularly important for understanding these effects for two reasons first pilot testing incorporates the background chloramines and dbp precursors in authentic ro permeate the dbp precursors can differ significantly from those in the drinking waters evaluated in previous research watts and linden 2007 sichel et al 2011 yang et al 2016 second rapid reactions are possible between the oxidants changing the oxidant speciation and between the oxidants and dbp precursors leading to dbp formation pilot scale aop systems can deliver the 700 1000 mj cm2 uv fluence range typically used for potable reuse applications within 1 min timescales while 30 min may be needed for the lower intensity illumination systems used in laboratory scale systems thus the oxidant speciation and dbp formation may differ between pilot and laboratory scale aop treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and sodium hypochlorite naocl working stock solutions were prepared by diluting 5 6 6 5 naocl and 30 h2o2 solutions with deionized di water monochloramine stock solutions were prepared fresh daily by slowly adding a 100 mm naocl solution into a 120 mm ammonium chloride solution while mixing with a magnetic stir bar the concentrations of h2o2 and naocl stock solutions were standardized spectrophotometrically at 254 nm ε

carried out at the orange county water district using a 9 7 l reactor equipped with a 257 w low pressure high output lpho mercury lamp trojan technologies ontario canada at a full scale potable reuse facility fig s1 additional description of the pilot may be found in mangalgiri et al 2018 the reactor was fed permeate from the full scale ro membranes at 6 gpm resulting in a 26 s hydraulic residence time based on the comparison of the degradation of chloramines and h2o2 in the ro permeate between a laboratory scale collimated beam apparatus and the pilot scale system the uv fluence was estimated to be 1000 mj cm2 text s2 the stock solutions of oxidants i e h2o2 free chlorine and nh2cl and 1 4 dioxane were injected into the influent through separate static mixers by peristaltic pumps upstream of the uv reactor the contact time between the oxidants and ro permeate before uv treatment was 3 s two pilot testing events were conducted separated by 2 months table s1 provides basic water quality parameters for the ro permeate samples for these events during event 1 the experiments were conducted over three days with each day evaluating one aop under four different conditions 1 an ambient condition using only the background chloramines present in the ro permeate at ph 5 7 2 low oxidant dosages involving 2 7 mg l as cl2 for free chlorine 1 3 mg l as cl2 for nh2cl or 3 1 mg l for h2o2 at ph 5 7 3 high oxidant dosages involving 6 8 mg l as cl2 for free chlorine 4 6 mg l as cl2 for nh2cl or 6 2 mg l for h2o2 at ph 5 7 and 4 the same high oxidant dosages but with pre adjustment of the ph from the ambient 5 7 to 7 0 using 1 m naoh the oxidant doses were selected to match typical conditions employed in practice the adjustment of ph to 7 0 was evaluated based on previous research suggesting that this adjustment directly after ro treatment could mitigate ndma formation mccurry et al 2017 these four conditions were repeated in the morning and in the afternoon to capture the daily water quality variation during event 2 the ambient condition the uv h2o2 aop 3 mg l the uv free chlorine aop 2 mg l as cl2 and the uv chloramines aop 2 mg l as cl2 were tested to compare different aops using ro permeate from the same day the applied oxidant doses were calculated based upon the oxidant stock concentrations and relative flowrates of the influent to the uv reactor and the oxidant dosing pumps in addition samples collected from the feed water just after oxidant addition uvf and the product water uvp of the uv reactor were analyzed on site for ammonia monochloramine free chlorine total chlorine and h2o2 ammonia and monochloramine were measured by hach method 10200 free chlorine and total chlorine residual were measured by hach methods 10069 and 10070 respectively hydrogen peroxide was measured by the titanium oxalate method sellers 1980 gordon et al 1988 the time intervals between sample collection and measurement were 3 min for the feed water and 6 min for the product water reflecting the timescales required for sample preparation the total chlorine residual in one set of samples was quenched using 33 mg l ascorbic acid upon sample collection to measure dbp concentrations before uvf and after uvp aop treatment another set of samples was not treated with ascorbic acid but was chloraminated under uniform formation conditions ufc conditions mimicking typical chloramination conditions for distribution shah et al 2012 the purpose of ufc testing was to evaluate the potential for continued dbp formation within the distribution system these samples were adjusted to ph 8 with 4 mm borate buffer ammonium chloride and sodium hypochlorite were then added to the samples at dosages calculated using equations 13 and 14 to achieve an initial monochloramine concentration of 5 mg l as cl2 with a 20 molar excess of ammonia 13 nh4 added mm 5 tcr background mg l as cl2 71 1 2 nh4 background mm 14 naocl added mm 5 tcr background mg l as cl2 71 where tcr is the total chlorine residual the samples were stored in the dark at room temperature 20 21 c after 3 days the total chlorine residual was quenched by ascorbic acid and the samples were extracted for dbp analysis 2 3 analysis of dbps and 1 4 dioxane and toxicity weighting for dbps a total of 35 halogenated dbps in eight classes were analyzed including the four regulated trihalomethanes thm4 six iodinated trihalomethanes i thms ten haloacetic acids haas including iodoacetic acid iaa four haloacetonitriles hans four haloacetaldehydes hals four haloacetamides hams two haloketones hks and one halonitromethane hnm trichloronitromethane chloropicrin tcnm the dbps were extracted by modified usepa methods 551 1 and 552 3 and analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms with 0 05 0 2 μg l reporting limits as described previously zeng and mitch 2016 chuang and mitch 2017 1 4 dioxane samples 40 ml were spiked with deuterated d6 1 4 dioxane as an internal standard and extracted into methyl tert butyl ether mtbe the mtbe extracts were analyzed by gc ms with a 0 9 μg l reporting limit additional methods details are provided in text s1 the contribution of a dbp to the toxicity of a disinfected water is a function of its concentration and its toxic potency to obtain initial estimates of the relative importance of different dbp classes for the dbp associated toxicity of disinfected waters measured dbp concentrations were weighted by metrics of toxic potency li and mitch 2018 except for bromodiiodomethane and the two haloketones the concentrations of each dbp associated with a 50 reduction in the growth of chinese hamster ovary cho cells relative to untreated controls lc50 values a measure of cytotoxicity have been determined by the same research group table s3 wagner and plewa 2017 for a subset of the regulated thms and haas concentrations associated with a 50 lifetime excess cancer risk lecr50 were available table s3 low lc50 or lecr50 values correspond to higher toxic potencies measured dbp concentrations were divided by the lower of their lc50 or lecr50 values to obtain their toxicity weighted concentrations as described in our previous studies zeng et al 2016 chuang and mitch 2017 szczuka et al 2017 using the lower of the lc50 and lecr50 values enhanced the potential importance of the regulated dbps since lecr50 values were not available for the other dbps these values were summed to estimate the total toxicity weighted dbp concentrations assuming that toxicity is additive while this assumption needs validation in future toxicology studies it enables an initial comparison of the dbp associated toxicity of the product waters of the different aops 2 4 kinetic modeling a chemical kinetics model combining 125 elementary reactions table s4 was implemented using kintecus 4 55 ianni 2012 this model combined our previous aop models chuang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 with reactions associated with breakpoint chlorination jafvert and valentine 1992 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidant speciation reactions of applied oxidants with the chloramines in ro permeate can alter oxidant speciation affecting radical production within the aops the first set of pilot tests event 1 evaluated oxidation speciation within the uv free chlorine uv chloramines and uv h2o2 aops each with a low or a high oxidant dose at ph 5 7 a high oxidant dose at ph 7 or an ambient condition i e no oxidant addition at ph 5 7 representing uv treatment with only the chloramines present in the ro permeate as a result of upstream application in the full scale facility for membrane biofouling control each condition was tested twice once in the morning and once in the afternoon table s5 provides the averages and ranges of the nh3 n free chlorine monochloramine total chlorine residual and hydrogen peroxide measured in the uv feed and product waters 3 min and 6 min after oxidant addition respectively the shortest time periods over which it was feasible to conduct the measurements dichloramine nhcl2 concentrations were calculated assuming dichloramine represents the difference between the total chlorine residual and the sum of the free chlorine and monochloramine concentrations the ambient condition representing uv treatment with only the residual chloramines in the ro permeate was repeated 6 times over 3 days i e in duplicate for each aop the oxidant speciation was remarkably consistent with the monochloramine and total chlorine residual concentrations varying by 0 3 mg l as cl2 from their average values in both the uv feed and product waters uv treatment reduced the average monochloramine concentration 64 from 2 2 mg l as cl2 to 0 8 mg l as cl2 and the average total chlorine residual concentration 59 from 3 4 mg l as cl2 to 1 4 mg l as cl2 the calculated average dichloramine concentration decreased 50 from 1 2 mg l as cl2 to 0 6 mg l as cl2 thus dichloramine constituted 32 of the total chloramines in the ro permeate higher than expected since free chlorine typically is added upstream of ro at molar ratios 1 relative to ammonia previous research has demonstrated that injection of concentrated sodium hypochlorite stock solutions into ammonia containing wastewater e g upstream of ro can promote dichloramine formation due to the locally high chlorine to ammonia ratio at the site of chlorine addition furst et al 2018 other research has indicated that ro treatment can promote the disproportionation of monochloramine into dichloramine by decreasing the ph and preferentially rejecting free ammonium mccurry et al 2017 after uv treatment dichloramine constituted 40 of the total chloramines similar to the percentage prior to uv treatment these results concur with research indicating that the uv photolysis rates of monochloramine and dichloramine at 254 nm are similar li and blatchley 2009 zhang et al 2019 the low dose uv free chlorine aop condition illustrates the complex oxidant speciation resulting from the rapid reactions that can occur between oxidants the total ammonia concentration 44 4 μm associated with free ammonia 4 3 μm or 0 06 mg n l monochloramine 32 μm and dichloramine 8 μm in the ro permeate would necessitate 4 7 mg l as cl2 67 μm total chlorine to exceed the breakpoint when 2 7 mg l as cl2 free chlorine the low dose condition was added to the 3 4 mg l as cl2 total chlorine residual in the ro permeate the breakpoint would have been exceeded eventually resulting in inorganic chloramine destruction however breakpoint chlorination reactions under these conditions occur over 0 5 hr timescales jafvert and valentine 1992 considerably longer than even the 3 6 min timescale over which the measurements were conducted accordingly the measured oxidant speciation reflects the concentrations of oxidants in the midst of these breakpoint reactions at 3 min after free chlorine addition the total chlorine residual measured in the feed water was 5 6 mg l as cl2 this value reflects a loss of 0 5 mg l as cl2 from breakpoint reactions relative to the 6 1 mg l as cl2 expected after free chlorine addition table s5 the 2 7 mg l as cl2 free chlorine concentration added to the feed water had decreased to 1 1 mg l as cl2 while the monochloramine concentration had decreased from 2 3 mg l as cl2 to 0 9 mg l as cl2 in contrast the calculated dichloramine concentration had increased from 1 1 mg l as cl2 to 3 6 mg l as cl2 becoming the dominant constituent of the total chlorine residual measured in the uv feed water however the oxidation speciation entering the aop may differ even from that measured 3 min after oxidant addition in the aop pilot facility the added oxidants mixed with the ro permeate for 3 s prior to exposure to uv light in the reactor and the residence time within the aop unit was 26 s this 30 s total timescale was shorter than the 3 min and 6 min needed to measure oxidant speciation in the uv feed and product waters respectively to characterize the oxidant speciation within the aops a kinetic model was used to predict the oxidant speciation in the uv feed and product waters this model combined a model for breakpoint chlorination reactions jafvert and valentine 1992 with models for the uv h2o2 crittenden et al 1999 uv free chlorine chuang et al 2017 and uv chloramines zhang et al 2019 aops table s4 the model used the combination of the residual oxidant concentrations measured in the ro permeate prior to oxidant addition and the doses of oxidants applied to the uv feed water as input to validate the model we compared the oxidant speciation measured in samples of uv feed water 3 min after oxidant addition and in samples of uv product water 6 min after oxidant addition to those predicted by the kinetic model for the low oxidant dose conditions at ph 5 7 for the uv chloramines and uv h2o2 aops and for the low and high oxidant dose conditions at ph 5 7 for the uv free chlorine aop fig 1 the oxidant speciation predicted by the kinetic model agreed well with the measured speciation except for the total residual chlorine concentrations during the uv h2o2 aop pilot runs here the measured total chlorine residual concentration was higher than that predicted by the model because hydrogen peroxide partially contributes to the measured total chlorine residual by reacting with the dpd reagent these results indicate that the model can accurately predict the oxidant speciation entering and leaving the aop for the uv chloramines and uv h2o2 aops oxidant speciation remained relatively constant over the 3 6 min timescales over which measurements were taken due to the low reactivity between different oxidant species i e h2o2 and chloramines as a result the oxidant speciations entering and leaving the aop would be similar to those measured in the uv feed and product waters fig 1 the monochloramine or hydrogen peroxide added to the background levels of monochloramine or dichloramine table 1 uv treatment decreased the concentrations of monochloramine and dichloramine by 60 and 50 respectively confirming their similar photodegradation rates li and blatchley 2009 zhang et al 2019 the degradation of hydrogen peroxide was much lower at 10 table 1 however for the uv free chlorine aop modeling indicates that the oxidant speciation can change significantly even over the 6 min timescale needed to measure the oxidant species on site for example for addition of 2 7 mg l as cl2 free chlorine the model indicated that the free chlorine and monochloramine concentrations measured in the uv feed water 3 min after free chlorine addition were 50 lower than those that would have entered the uv reactor fig 1 accordingly modeling is of critical importance for understanding the oxidant speciation within the aop for this condition modeling indicated that 0 3 mg l as cl2 of the 2 7 mg l as cl2 free chlorine added reacted within 1 s consuming all of the 0 06 mg n l free ammonia and increasing the concentrations of monochloramine and dichloramine by 0 2 mg l as cl2 and 0 1 mg l as cl2 respectively table 1 and s5 on an average basis for the morning and afternoon pilot runs for the low dose free chlorine condition uv treatment reduced the free chlorine concentration by 38 0 9 mg l as cl2 the monochloramine concentration by 68 1 7 mg l as cl2 the total chlorine residual by 46 2 6 mg l as cl2 but the dichloramine concentration by only 17 0 2 mg l as cl2 table 1 as a result the dichloramine concentration in the uv product water exceeded that of monochloramine and was only 30 lower than the concentration of free chlorine since the uv photodegradation rates of monochloramine and dichloramine are similar li and blatchley 2009 zhang et al 2019 these results suggest that the reaction of free chlorine with monochloramine during aop treatment was predominantly responsible for the change in speciation in favor of dichloramine this alteration in chloramine speciation in favor of dichloramine could have implications for the treatment of ndma since its formation is associated with reactions of precursors with dichloramine schreiber and mitch 2006 in a parallel study ndma destruction was also measured in this experiment results showing decreased ndma destruction in the uv free chlorine aop are presented elsewhere roback et al 2019 3 2 1 4 dioxane degradation during both events 1 and 2 the degradation of 15 μg l 1 4 dioxane spiked into the ro permeate was evaluated to validate the relevance of the treatment conditions to potable reuse scenarios where 0 5 log removal 68 is targeted california state water resources control board 2018 fig 2 provides the 1 4 dioxane removal during event 1 for the same experimental runs previously discussed with respect to oxidant speciation table 1 the ambient condition that only employed chloramines already present in the ro permeate 3 4 mg l as cl2 total chloramines table 1 was conducted in duplicate during each of the 3 days of testing one day for each aop the removal of 1 4 dioxane was fairly consistent at 35 0 19 log for this ambient condition at ph 5 7 ambient ph of ro permeate the order of 1 4 dioxane removal efficiency for both low and high dose oxidant conditions was uv free chlorine uv h2o2 uv chloramines this higher performance of the uv free chlorine aop at ph 5 7 in authentic ro permeate containing chloramines concurs with a previous laboratory scale comparison of these aops in deionized water without background chloramines chuang et al 2017 the higher oxidant dose exhibited slightly higher 1 4 dioxane degradation for the uv free chlorine and uv h2o2 aops but these aops achieved 0 5 log removal of 1 4 dioxane under both oxidant dosing conditions adding chloramines above the background chloramines did not improve the performance of the uv chloramines aop the lack of improved performance agrees with our recent laboratory scale results using ro permeate where for chloramine concentrations 3 mg l as cl2 the background concentration in this ro permeate the increase in radical scavenging by additional chloramines offset the increase in radical production zhang et al 2019 the uv chloramines aop did not achieve the 0 5 log 1 4 dioxane removal target at the 1000 mj cm2 uv fluence used for this pilot test for the high oxidant dose at ph 7 the most significant difference was that the performance of the uv free chlorine aop was reduced and was approximately 20 lower than that of the uv h2o2 aop fig 2 the reduced performance of the uv free chlorine aop at higher ph concurs with previous laboratory scale results for treatment of 1 4 dioxane in deionized water and is attributable to the higher efficiency of oh scavenging by ocl 1 85 109 m 1 s 1 than hocl 5 0 108 m 1 s 1 chuang et al 2017 additionally cl conversion to oh is enhanced at higher ph equations 11 and 12 fig s2 provides the removal of 1 4 dioxane during event 2 where an ambient condition 2 3 mg l as cl2 background chloramines and 2 mg l as cl2 free chlorine or chloramines and 3 mg l hydrogen peroxide at ph 5 7 were tested during the same day the results for the uv free chlorine and uv h2o2 aops were similar to those during event 1 however only 25 0 12 log of 1 4 dioxane was removed during the ambient condition compared to the 35 0 19 log removal during event 1 which featured 3 4 mg l as cl2 background chloramines the lower removal concurs with our previous laboratory scale results indicating that for chloramine concentrations 3 mg l as cl2 reducing the chloramine concentration decreases performance zhang et al 2019 although reducing chloramine concentrations decreases radical production and scavenging by chloramines overall radical scavenging remains constant as scavenging by doc and carbonates begin to dominate in event 2 the addition of 2 mg l as cl2 chloramines to the feed water increased the 1 4 dioxane removal to 40 our model was able to accurately predict oxidant speciation for all three aops table 1 fig 1 however the prediction of 1 4 dioxane degradation was only accurate for the uv h2o2 aop which is a de facto uv h2o2 chloramines aop fig 2 the model overpredicted 1 4 dioxane degradation for the uv chloramines aop and underpredicted 1 4 dioxane degradation for the uv free chlorine aop both of these aops produce cl whose reactions with doc were not included in the model since rate constants were not available in our previous work the model was able to predict 1 4 dioxane degradation during laboratory scale treatment by the uv chloramines and uv h2o2 chloramines aops in deionized water and in ro permeate from another facility but underpredicted 1 4 dioxane degradation in ro permeate from the same facility at which pilot testing was conducted for this study zhang et al 2019 the reaction rate constant for cl reaction with 1 4 dioxane has been reported to be low at 4 4 106 m 1 s 1 patton et al 2017 accordingly cl first converts to oh prior to reacting with 1 4 dioxane our results suggest that components of doc at this facility are highly reactive with cl such that scavenging of cl prevents its conversion to oh and reaction with 1 4 dioxane because this effect was not observed with ro permeate from the other facility zhang et al 2019 the importance of cl scavenging by doc in ro permeate is unclear research is needed to develop techniques for distinguishing cl and oh reactions with doc to enable the measurement of cl reaction rate constants with doc in the case of the uv free chlorine aop previous research has indicated that certain components of doc such as alcohols and acetate can promote the chain decomposition of hocl chuang et al 2017 the enhanced production of radicals during this chain decomposition may account for the increased degradation of 1 4 dioxane relative to that predicted by the model but additional research is needed to understand this phenomenon we developed initial cost estimates to compare the application of the three aops to achieve 0 5 log removal of 1 4 dioxane in ro permeate from this facility text s5 these calculations considered the electrical cost associated with the uv fluence needed to achieve 0 5 log removal estimated at 1000 mj cm2 770 mj cm2 and 2000 mj cm2 for the uv h2o2 uv free chlorine and uv chloramines aops respectively for the uv h2o2 aop the 23 34 million liter ml total cost estimate also considered the cost of h2o2 the sodium hypochlorite needed to quench residual h2o2 not required at this study s facility but may be required at some facilities and the sodium hypochlorite and ammonium sulfate needed to leave a 2 5 mg l as cl2 chloramine residual however if no residual is needed the uv h2o2 aop cost estimate is 10 86 ml no quenching and no final chloramine addition for the uv free chlorine aop the 12 41 ml total cost also considered the costs of the sodium hypochlorite addition for the aop and the reagents needed to provide the chloramine residual this cost was roughly half of that for uv h2o2 aop treatment for the case in which a chloramine residual is required driven by savings in chemical reagent costs for uv chloramines aop treatment of ro permeate containing 3 4 mg l as cl2 e g event 1 the 23 63 ml total cost included the much higher fluence needed to overcome the relative inefficiency of 1 4 dioxane destruction and also considered the costs for the chloramine reagents needed to maintain a sufficient residual during treatment and to provide a residual in transmission pipelines while this total cost was comparable to that for the uv h2o2 aop treatment the average total cost would likely be higher because additional chloramines would need to be added upstream of the aop when the chloramine concentration in the ro permeate is below 3 mg l as cl2 e g event 2 estimates based on previous laboratory scale research found that the cost for uv chloramines and uv h2o2 aop treatments could be comparable for ro permeate from this facility but that the uv chloramines aop could be more cost effective for treating ro permeate from another facility likely due to lower concentrations of cl scavengers zhang et al 2019 3 3 dbp formation concentrations of different classes of dbps were measured in the feed uvf and product waters uvp of the pilot uv aop reactor during events 1 fig 3 and tables s6 s11 and 2 fig s4 and tables s12 and s13 for one set of samples the total chlorine residual was immediately quenched to evaluate the dbp concentrations already present in the uvf i e plant ro permeate or formed during aop treatment uvp sample another set of uvf uvp samples was chloraminated under uniform formation conditions ufc to evaluate the potential for dbp formation in the distribution system the ufc test result is an indirect measure of total dbp precursors in the sample plus any background dbps already present over the 3 days of event 1 that included six pilot runs under ambient conditions the dbp concentrations differed slightly fig 3a c with an average total dbp concentration in the uvf of 6 8 μg l consisting of 4 7 0 8 μg l average standard deviation n 6 thm4 1 2 0 2 μg l haloacetonitriles 0 6 0 2 μg l haloacetamides and 0 3 0 0 μg l haa9 iodinated thms iodoacetic acid haloacetaldehydes and chloropicrin were not detected after chloramine ufc treatment the average total dbp concentration in the feed water samples for the ambient conditions increased moderately to 10 6 μg l and was also similar overall between the six different pilot runs consisting of 7 3 1 1 μg l thm4 1 6 0 3 μg l haloacetonitriles 0 9 0 3 μg l haloacetamides 0 6 0 1 μg l haa9 0 14 0 07 μg l haloacetaldehydes and 0 09 0 02 μg l chloropicrin these relatively small increases after 3 days of chloramine contact indicated low concentrations of residual dbp precursors in the ro permeate i e uvf application of oxidants to the feed water typically increased dbp concentrations 15 relative to the ambient condition due to the short contact time 3 min prior to quenching the chlorine or chloramine residuals however application of 6 8 mg l as cl2 free chlorine to the feed water increased haloacetaldehydes from 0 05 μg l to 0 13 μg l dbp concentrations in the feed water were similar during event 2 although the thm4 6 7 1 2 μg l and haloacetamide 1 0 0 3 μg l concentrations were higher compared to event 1 while haas were not detected the total concentrations of dbps were consistent with those observed in other ro permeates zeng et al 2016 chuang et al 2019a and low relative to those observed in conventional drinking waters chuang et al 2019b the aop treatments preferentially reduced the concentrations of the brominated dbp species for example the aop treatments removed 50 of dibromochloromethane and 70 of tribromomethane but 20 of bromodichloromethane or trichloromethane during event 1 tables s6 s11 the preferential removal of brominated dbp species reflects their higher degradation rates by uv direct photolysis and higher reaction rate constants with oh chuang et al 2016 however since the chlorinated species dominated the preferential removal of brominated dbps typically resulted in only minor changes in the total dbp concentrations measured in both quenched 1 μg l and chloramine ufc treated 1 5 μg l uv product water samples fig 3 there were two notable exceptions to the above observation of limited changes in the concentrations of dbps and their precursors ufc by the aop treatments the uv free chlorine aop tended to increase haloacetaldehyde formation both during aop treatment and after ufc chloramination during both events fig 4 and tables s12 and s13 an increase in haloacetaldehyde formation was observed previously at a different facility for pilot scale uv free chlorine aop treatment followed by chloramination but not uv h2o2 aop treatment followed by chloramination chuang et al 2019b similarly pre treatment of a drinking water with uv light from a medium pressure mercury lamp followed by chloramination increased the formation of trichloroacetaldehyde shah et al 2012 the other notable exception was that treatment by the uv chloramines and the uv h2o2 aops increased the formation of chloropicrin after ufc chloramination i e increased the formation of chloropicrin precursors during both events fig 5 and tables s12 and s13 previous work observed enhanced chloropicrin formation during uv treatment of nitrate or nitrite containing drinking waters with medium pressure mercury lamps followed by chlorination or chloramination the formation was attributed to the production of nitrated organic precursors via reactions of the reactive nitrogen species e g no2 produced by uv photolysis of nitrite or nitrate shah et al 2011 during uv chloramine and uv h2o2 aop treatment of ro permeate uv photolysis of chloramines can also produce reactive nitrogen species zhang et al 2019 when dbp concentrations were weighted by metrics of toxic potency haloacetamides and haloacetonitriles accounted for 90 of the calculated toxic potency weighted dbp concentrations in both the uv feed and product waters before and after chloramine ufc treatment with approximately equal contributions from these two classes figs s3 and s4 aop treatments altered the calculated toxicity weighted dbp concentrations typically by 25 although haloacetaldehydes and chloropicrin formation were altered by certain aops they were minor contributors to the calculated total toxicity weighted dbp concentrations 4 conclusions this pilot scale study evaluated uv free chlorine and uv chloramines aops as alternatives to the uv h2o2 aop for treatment of ro permeate in potable reuse trains focusing on three critical considerations first we characterized the speciation of the oxidants that serve as the source for the production and scavenging of radicals during aop treatment our results demonstrated the ability of recently developed kinetic models to accurately predict oxidant speciation even within authentic ro permeate containing chloramines these chloramines are important since they produce radicals yet also serve as radical scavengers and can react with the applied oxidants for the uv free chlorine aop the results demonstrated that free chlorine reactions with ammonia and chloramines in ro permeate result in significant alterations in oxidant speciation with the concentrations of free chlorine and monochloramine declining relative to dichloramine the results indicate the need for kinetic modeling to characterize the oxidant speciation that occurs within the reactor because oxidant speciation can change rapidly even over the short timescales of treatment and oxidant analysis second we evaluated the ability of the different aops to degrade important target contaminants such as 1 4 dioxane at ph 5 7 relevant to ro permeate the order of 1 4 dioxane removal efficiency of the aops was uv free chlorine uv h2o2 uv chloramines noting that the uv h2o2 in potable reuse facilities is a de facto uv h2o2 chloramine aop at ph 7 the performance of the uv free chlorine aop declined relative to the uv h2o2 aop due to radical scavenging by ocl initial cost estimates indicate that uv free chlorine aop treatment to achieve 0 5 log 1 4 dioxane removal would be nearly half the cost for uv h2o2 aop treatment driven by savings in reagent costs provided a chloramine disinfectant residual is needed in transmission pipelines the cost for uv chloramines aop treatment could be comparable to uv h2o2 aop treatment despite the higher fluence required but only if the ro permeate already included a sufficient chloramine concentration for aop treatment e g 3 4 mg l as cl2 while kinetic modeling was able to predict oxidant speciation for all three aops and 1 4 dioxane degradation during uv h2o2 aop treatment research is needed to quantify cl reaction rate constants with the doc in ro permeate to improve the predictive ability of kinetic models for the uv free chlorine and uv chloramines aops third we assessed whether switching from the uv h2o2 aop to uv free chlorine or uv chloramines aops would significantly promote halogenated dbp formation including for currently unregulated dbps that may be considered more toxic than regulated dbps consistent with the observed low concentrations of dbp precursors in ro permeate total halogenated dbp concentrations remained 15 μg l in pilot feed and product water even after aop treatment and chloramination that mimicked transmission pipeline conditions aop treatments preferentially degraded brominated dbps however total dbp concentrations were similar before and after treatment for all of the aops because dbp speciation was dominated by chlorinated dbp species that are poorly removed by the aops and the short aop treatment time 30 s minimized dbp formation from dark reactions with the oxidants the formation of two dbp classes were promoted by aop treatment uv free chlorine aop treatment promoted the formation of haloacetaldehydes while uv h2o2 aop and uv chloramines aop treatment followed by chloramination promoted the formation of chloropicrin however weighting measured dbp concentrations by metrics of toxic potency indicated that haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides were the dominant contributors to the dbp associated toxicity and concentrations of these dbp classes were similar in aop treated product waters among the different aops total dbp concentrations on a mass or toxic potency weighted basis were comparable or lower than those measured previously in conventional drinking waters chuang et al 2019b considering both 1 4 dioxane removal and dbp formation this pilot study indicated that the uv free chlorine aop and to a lesser degree the uv chloramines aop could be cost effective alternatives to the uv h2o2 aop for treating target contaminants such as 1 4 dioxane in ro permeate without exacerbating halogenated dbp formation this is advantageous since it suggests facilities are free to select an aop treatment suited to their site specific preferences and cost drivers without halogenated dbp related water quality concerns the short timescale of pilot scale aop treatment was important for this evaluation to be representative in order to avoid the significant shifts in oxidant speciation and dbp formation by dark reactions involving the oxidants that would occur over the longer treatment times needed for laboratory scale aop systems declaration of
