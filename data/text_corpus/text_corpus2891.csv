14455,landfill leachate contains a high concentration of organic and inorganic compounds toxic heavy metals thms ammonia and bio refractory compounds hence the remediation of landfill leachate is a challenge for environmental scientists and practitioners present work aims to study the application of phycoremediation process as tertiary treatment for pre treated landfill leachate combined with carbon biosequestration in laboratory scale photobioreactor pbr which can be easily scaled up for on site application real leachate collected from solid waste dumpsite was initially treated with coagulation and air stripping process the pre treated leachate was innoculated with chlorella pyrenoidosa and subsequently exposed different co2 concentration to determine the optimum co2 concentration for maximum biomass productivity the results of the optimisation study were applied to a laboratory scale pbr the pre treatment process effectively reduced the biologically inhibitive compounds and colour present in the raw landfill leachate which made it suitable for microalgae cultivation maximum biomass productivity of c pyrenoidosa cultivated in pre treated landfill leachate was observed when exposed to 10 co2 the phycoremediation process in pbr effectively consumed 91 of doc 86 of tn 90 of nh4 n and 96 of phosphates from pre treated landfill leachate and also 0 26 g l

landfill leachate phycoremediation chlorella pyrenoidosa carbon fixation microalgae 1 introduction landfilling remains the ultimate municipal solid waste msw disposal method in the most developing nations due to low expenditure and simple operation 1 degradation of the msw in landfills generates a substantial amount of leachate contaminants from the landfilled waste enter into liquid phase during degradation and precipitation ultimately seeping out in the form of leachate 2 landfill leachate generally comprises high concentration of dissolved organic and inorganic compounds toxic heavy metals thms ammonia and xenobiotic organic compounds xoc which are highly toxic to living organisms and environment 3 leachate generated from the landfill sites pose a serious challenge to the landfill operators and local governing bodies as it percolates through the disposed waste and contaminates the soil and both surface and groundwater 3 several physicochemical and biological process have been extensively studied for the treatment of landfill leachate 4 however these methods autonomously cannot treat the leachate completely and hence a blend of physicochemical and biological processes is always applied for effective treatment of complex inorganic and high strength landfill leachate 1 5 though these conventional treatment systems have fairly good efficiency they may not be sustainable as it involves substantial costs in terms of materials equipment chemical and electrical consumption without any remarkable energy recovery 4 recently phycoremediation process has gained significant attention as one of the sustainable bioremediation technique for high strength wastewater treatment due to its efficient removal of nutrients organic and inorganic compounds from wastewater 6 7 during phycoremediation process carbon nitrogen phosphorus and trace elements present in the wastewater are assimilated by microalgae for its metabolism and cell growth thus producing superior quality effluent 8 furthermore the microalgae in the presence of sunlight can transform co2 from the point source into carbohydrates proteins and fatty acids 9 10 recent studies have exhibited successful application of the phycoremediation process to treat municipal wastewater 11 tannery wastewater 6 textile wastewater 12 coal gasification effluent 13 aquaculture effluent 14 dairy effluent 15 agricultural wastewater 16 distillery wastewater 17 18 effluent from bioethanol plant 19 reverse osmosis concentrate 20 biodiesel wastewater 21 and crude oil 22 previous studies have explored the viability of using phycoremediation for treatment of landfill leachate however phycoremediation process has not been successful in treating concentrated landfill leachate independently due to toxicity induced by high concentration of organic and inorganic compounds nh4 n and thms 23 24 hence landfill leachates were diluted 10 20 times to reduce its inhibitory effects 25 26 however for full scale leachate treatment dilution to such an extent would require a large quantity of water and land restricting its full scale application 25 the primary and secondary treatment of landfill leachate by conventional physicochemical process can reduce the concentration of toxic inhibitory compound and colour to a great extent with less land requirement 1 24 27 also tertiary effluent can provide sufficient macro and micro nutrients for biomass production 28 using microalgae for tertiary treatment can be sustainable option as it can improve the effluent quality with minimal environmental hazards along with production of beneficial microalgal biomass further microalgae cultivated in wastewater can be used for co2 reduction from point sources considering these factors can improve the efficiency of pbrs in regards to contaminant removal efficiency biomass productivity and biotic co2 uptake this study focussed on utilization of microalgae chlorella pyrenoidosa for nutrient removal from pre treated landfill leachate integrated with carbon sequestration using a column photobioreactor pbr initially for microalgae cultivated in pre treated landfill leachate influence of different co2 concentrations on biomass productivity was measured later microalgae was cultivated in pre treated landfill leachate using column pbr aerated with optimum co2 concentration 2 materials and methods 2 1 leachate collection and physicochemical characterisation landfill leachate was collected from one of the dumpsites in chennai india and transported to the laboratory immediately the sample was screened through a coarse filter pore size 2 mm to remove any large size solids and allowed to settle overnight at 4 c to remove maximum solids present in it the supernatant liquid was syphoned off and was used for further study all parameters were analysed conferring to standard methods published by american public health association 29 the samples were filtered through 0 45 μm nylon syringe filter and diluted adequately with distilled water before analysing its quality indicators dissolved organic carbon doc and total nitrogen tn were analysed in toc tn integrated

chlorella pyrenoidosa the microalgae chlorella pyrenoidosa ncim 2738 procured from national collection of industrial microorganisms national chemical laboratory pune india was used in this study c pyrenoidosa one of the most popular freshwater microalgae is capable of growing autotrophically heterotrophically or mixotrophically and has been successfully applied for wastewater treatment and bio fuel production 30 31 previous studies have shown that c pyrenoidosa can survive in landfill leachate with nh4 h concentration up to 134 mg l 32 in ambient condition c pyrenoidosa showed faster growth and is tolerant to high co2 concentration 13 33 c pyrenoidosa was cultivated in bold s basal medium bbm comprising nano3 25 g mgso4 7h2o 7 5 g cacl2 2h2o 2 5 g nacl 2 5 g k2hpo4 17 5 g kh2po4 7 5 g h3bo3 11 4 g feso4 7h2o 4 98 g in 1 ml concentrated h2so4 and trace metals added to 1000 ml distilled water bbm after preparation was autoclaved at 121 c for 20 min and c pyrenoidosa cells were inoculated into bbm under sterile conditions in multiple 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 120 ml bbm the culture was maintained at room temperature 26 3 c provided with a continuous artificial light source of intensity 8 000 lux work zone lx 101 proper mixing of the culture was ensured by agitation at 100 rpm by an orbital shaker the algal cultivation was maintained in the ph range 7 8 the morphological features and cell dimensions of the c pyrenoidosa were observed using a light microscope nikon eclipse lv100 japan equipped with a camera and imaging software nis element version 4 0 the morphological features of c pyrenoidosa used for this study is presented in fig 1 the dry cell mass of c pyrenoidosa was calculated by filtering 20 ml aliquots through pre weighed glass fibre filter paper whatman usa 0 45 μm pore size the filter papers were dried in hot air oven at 105 c overnight and the difference between initial and final weight was determined by the gravimetric method the difference in the final and initial weight of the filter papers was used to calculate the dry cell mass of the c pyrenoidosa as shown below 1 dry cell weight g l w 2 w 1 ml of sample filtered where w1 and w2 are the initial and final weight of the filter paper specific growth rate μ day 1 and maximum biomass productivity pb g l day were determined using eqs 2 and 3 respectively 18 2 μ l n w f w i δ t 3 p b w f w i δ t where wi and wf are the initial and final dry cell weight g l while δt is the difference in time the carbon fixation rate cf g l d was estimated by the equation given below 4 cf pb cc mco2 mc where cc is the percentage of carbon in dry cell weight measured by chns analyzer mc and mco2 are the molecular weight of carbon 12 g mol and carbon dioxide 44 g mol respectively 2 3 acclimatisation of c pyrenoidosa to landfill leachate and carbon dioxide after one subculturing c pyrenoidosa was acclimatised to toxic landfill leachate by adding 5 sterilised leachate to bbm v v which was further cultivated in 5 l transparent glass jar containing 2 l bbm aerated with 2 co2 enriched air at the rate of 1 0 lpm 11 34 the microalgae culture was incubated in an enclosed chamber provided with artificial luminescence of intensity 8 000 lux for 20 days this process was repeated for one more subculture after which the c pyrenoidosa was acclimatised to landfill leachate and co2 the algal solution was centrifuged at 4000xg for 10 min and the supernatant liquid was discarded the algal cells were washed with distilled water to remove the salts from the surface and the suspension was centrifuged again the centrifuged algal cells were used as seeds in the further phycoremediation studies 2 4 pre treatment of landfill leachate coagulation study was performed in a jar test apparatus fixed with six stirring rods at room temperature alum aluminium sulphate al2 so4 3 was added to 500 ml of settled landfill leachate filled in 1000 ml beakers under rapid stirring conditions floc formation by alum was supported by gentle mixing at 30 rpm for 20 min which was later allowed to settle to the bottom of the beaker by keeping it quiescent for 30 min samples were collected by syphoning from approximately 2 cm below the water surface filtered with 0 45 μm nylon syringe filters and diluted appropriately before analysis the ph of the leachate was not altered before adding coagulant during coagulation study landfill leachate after coagulation process was additionally exposed to air stripping process to reduce the concentration of nh4 n landfill leachate was aerated using an aquarium aerator at the rate of 2 lpm in a 1000 ml beaker samples were collected regularly at every 2 h interval and analysed to nh4 n and cod concentration the contaminant removal was estimated as 5 r c i c f c i 100 where ci and cf are concentrations of the pollutants in the original and treated effluent respectively 2 5 optimum carbon dioxide dose for maximum productivity of c pyrenoidosa even though the microalgae can consume co2 for its growth concentration above a threshold value can be toxic hence to optimise the concentration of co2 exposed to microalgae used for phycoremediation study a laboratory study was conducted by varying the co2 levels in aeration air 600 ml of the pre treated landfill leachate inoculated with 0 2 g l microalgae was placed in 1000 ml capacity transparent glass reagent bottles which were incubated in an enclosed chamber illuminated with artificial light the microalgae grown in pre treated leachate was aerated with 0 03 ambient air 5 10 and 15 co2 enriched air at the rate of 0 5 lpm through a porous stone at the bottom of the bottles pure co2 from a commercial cylinder was blended with air supplied by an aquarium aerator to obtain the desired co2 concentration the bottles were placed in a closed chamber illuminated by a cool white fluorescent light the biomass concentrations were measured every alternate day in triplicates and the threshold co2 concentration for maximum biomass concentration was determined the algal suspension was centrifuged at 4000xg for 10 min the algal pellets collected were washed with distilled water and oven dried at 60 c until they attained constant weight the air dried algal pellets were analysed for carbon hydrogen and nitrogen chn contents in chns analyser vario ei cube elementar analysensysteme gmbh germany 2 6 photobioreactor setup and phycoremediation study the results obtained from the optimisation studies were applied to a scaled up pbr phycoremediation study the pbr used to carry out the phycoremediation and co2 fixation experiments was fabricated with 4 mm thick transparent plexiglass tubes of 90 mm internal diameter and 600 mm height as detailed in fig 2 the pbr was placed inside a 250 mm cylindrical chamber continuously illuminated with artificial white florescent light of 8000 lux the mean ambient temperature was 26 2 2 4 c the pre treated leachate 3 l was poured into the reactor and inoculated with the seed microalgae culture prepared as discussed in the section 2 3 air with 10 co2 was purged to the bottom of the pbr through a tube extending into the bottommost end of pbr through sintered stones at the rate of 0 5 lpm the movement of the air bubbles within the reactor ensured proper mixing of the nutrients in solution uniform availability of light to algal cells and prevented accumulation of oxygen from photosynthesis process the total volume of liquid in the pbr was periodically monitored and evaporation losses were rectified samples were withdrawn from the pbr every alternate day to analyse the concentration of nutrient and microalgae cells in triplicates 3 results and discussions 3 1 characteristics of landfill leachate the landfill leachate was characterised by an unpleasant odour dark brown colour and high concentration of doc phosphate nitrogen and thms table 1 the high concentration of humic substances present in the leachate imparted a dark brown colour to the leachate 35 the bod5 cod ratio of 0 2 indicated the presence of more inorganic content low bod5 cod ratio with high nh4 n concentration implied a reduced amount of biochemical activity as the organic matter in the waste was nearly stabilised a large amount of refractory organic molecules released from the solid wastes were responsible for low bod5 cod ratio 36 the concentration of mn ni zn fe as and hg were very high and hence the biological treatment of the leachate was unviable without pre treatment the presence of the thms can be attributed to the composition of solid waste for example the existence of zn in leachate indicates waste from battery and incandescent lamp while a high concentration of fe indicates scrap steel disposal in the landfill 37 the corrosion of ferrous to form ferric hydroxide colloidal particles and complexes with humic substances contributes to the dark brown colour of leachate 37 the dark brown colour of the leachate can significantly reduce light penetration into the solution which can hinder the microalgal photosynthesis and biomass production also a high concentration of nh4 n present in the leachate can impart a toxic effect on the microalgae growth of microalgae in leachate 38 hence it was inevitable to reduce the concentration of the toxic compounds present in the leachate before phycoremediation which was achieved by coagulation and air stripping process 3 2 effect of pre treatment process on characteristics of landfill leachate the removal ratios of leachate parameters i e colour cod doc tn and nh4 n by coagulation process are presented in fig 3 the results showed that the contaminant removal improved significantly with coagulant dose from 1 to 4 g l with maximum removal efficiency for all the parameters observed at 4 g l of alum dose at 4 mg l alum removed about 72 59 53 45 35 and 66 of colour cod doc tn nh4 n and phosphate respectively from the leachate the general mechanisms involved in the alum coagulation process are hydrolysis charge neutralisation precipitation adsorption and enmeshment 39 40 most of the colloidal particles in leachate are negatively charged which results in electrical repulsion between the particles and prevent them from settling down alum once added to the leachate hydrolyses to from al3 ions in the solution these al3 ions interact precisely with negatively charged colloids and neutralise their charge as shown in eq 6 41 43 further al3 ions also polymerise to form amorphous gel like aluminium hydroxide al oh 3 which further enmeshes or adsorbs the soluble organic matter colour and colloidal particles and separates them from solution through the sweep floc mechanism eq 7 fig 3c 39 41 42 additional dose of alum can cause destabilisation of flocs due to repulsion caused by the presence of excess positively charged ions reducing the treatment efficiency 41 6 al2 so4 3 18h2o 2al3 3so4 2 18 h2o 7 2al3 3so4 2 18h2o 2al oh 3 6h 3so4 2 12h2o previous studies have also reported high contaminant reduction by coagulation process using alum ghafari et al 27 obtained 88 turbidity 86 colour and 90 tss removal at ph 7 and 9 5 g l of alum dose similarly jun et al 44 reported 70 6 cod 84 tss and 80 colour removal by coagulation of biologically pre treated landfill leachate at an optimum alum dose of 5 g l and ph 7 the minor difference in the coagulant dose and contaminant removal efficiency between the studies can be attributed to variation in the chemical characteristics of leachate alum also reduced the concentrations of thms present in the leachate fig 3b the thms like hg and as were almost completely removed by coagulation process while 97 removal was observed for mn and fe co ni cr ba and zn was removed by 92 88 75 72 and 32 respectively thms interchange or obstruct the prosthetic metal atoms in some enzymes related to photosynthesis and thus inhibit the microalgal growth and the overall remediation effectiveness 45 removal of thms and colour from the landfill leachate reduced its toxicity and allowed more light penetration making it suitable for bioremediation process the coagulation process could not significantly reduce the concentration of nh4 n from the leachate hence to reduce the nh4 n concentration coagulated leachate was further subjected to air stripping process the effect of aeration on the nh4 n and cod removal is presented in fig 4 the results indicated that nh4 n removal from leachate increased up to 44 in 8 h and 45 in 10 h the nh4 n removal attained in the this study was considerably lower than the previous research conducted by abood et al 1 which reported 90 nh4 n with 6 h of agitation at ph 11 5 this is because in the previous study higher ph favoured nh4 n conversion into ammonia gas which was easily volatilised and removed during aeration 1 in this study the ph of the leachate was not increased to 11 5 as ph above 8 0 was not favourable for the growth of microalgae which might be the reason for the lower efficiency of the air stripping process however 8 h of air stripping process reduced the concentration of nh4 n to 77 mg l which can be readily assimilated by the microalgae within the cells for its growth and metabolism 3 3 effect of co2 concentrations on growth of c pyrenoidosa in pre treated landfill leachate the co2 tolerance and biomass production are the significant factors considered when applying microalgae for co2 mitigation process hence the microalgae suspension in pre treated landfill leachate was aerated with air enriched with 0 03 5 10 and 15 v v co2 the growth curves of c pyrenoidosa exposed to air enriched with increasing co2 concentration are displayed in fig 5 a the growth curve indicated that c pyrenoidosa experienced a lag phase of 2 days followed by log phase of 14 days the dry cell weight of the microalgae cultivated in pre treated landfill leachate aerated with 0 03 5 and 10 co2 increased from initial cell weight of 0 24 g l to final cell weight of 1 76 2 37 and 2 61 g l respectively during 18 days of cultivation thus increased in co2 levels available to microalgal cells improved the photosynthetic activity and biomass productions of microalgae high co2 concentrations in presence of light might efficiently stimulate inter conversion of organic matter in microalgal cells and improve biomass production as shown in eq 8 9 8 c o 2 h 2 o 9 5 hν c 6 h 12 o 6 o 2 aeration with 5 and 10 co2 enriched air provided sufficient amount of dissolved inorganic carbon dic for biomass growth lower dic level can lead to the carbon deprived environment which restricted the synthesis of a range of vital enzymes vital for cellular carbon metabolism 46 aeration with optimum co2 enriched air can increase the gene expression associated with cell growth like chloroplast and mitochondria synthesis nitrogen metabolism carbon metabolism in microalgae 9 moreover excess carbon in the form of co2 can help in increasing biomass growth and lipid accumulation in the cells 47 conversely a very high level of dic concentration can reduce the ph and inhibit extracellular carbonic anhydrase activity thus reducing the biomass concentration 46 this may be reason that when co2 concentration increased to 15 microalgae initially grew but started dying off and the maximum dry cell weight obtained was only 0 96 g l on 10th day hence μ and pb for 15 co2 presented in table 2 was calculated for 10 days the specific growth rate and maximum biomass productivity and of c pyrenoidosa species exposed to different co2 concentration are presented in table 2 the biomass productivity and specific growth rates of c pyrenoidosa aerated with co2 enriched air showed that increasing co2 concentration up to 10 improved the biomass production rate the results indicated that biomass productivity and specific growth rate had a maximum value of 0 12 g l day and 0 14 day respectively when exposed to air enriched with 10 co2 in previous study tang et al 33 investigated the biomass production of c pyrenoidosa cultivated in modified bg11 medium and exposed to different co2 concentrations up to 50 the study found that c pyrenoidosa gave highest biomass production μ 0 144 d 1 and pb 0 155 mg l d at 10 co2 exposure fan et al 48 found that c pyrenoidosa gave highest biomass concentration of 4 3 g l when cultivated in bbm and exposed to 5 co2 concentration hence it can be inferred that although the microalgal strain is highly tolerant of co2 their survival and biomass production in co2 environment will be influenced by microalgae species cultivating media and culturing environment fig 5 b presents the effect of varying co2 concentration on carbon hydrogen and nitrogen content of dry microalgae cells the results indicated that c pyrenoidosa aerated with 10 co2 had highest carbon content 40 based on the carbon content and biomass productivity p from table 2 the co2 fixation rate estimated using eq 4 was 0 21 g l day it can be inferred from the results in table 2 and fig 5 b that maximum carbon dioxide sequestration efficiency was obtained when c pyrenoidosa cultivated in pre treated landfill leachate was exposed to 10 co2 this optimum conditions were used for phycoremediation study in pbr explained in subsequent section 3 4 phycoremediation of pre treated landfill leachate in the pbr the nutrient removals from pre treated landfill leachate and biomass growth observed during phycoremediation are presented in fig 6 at the end of the study phycoremediation process effectively removed 91 of doc 76 of tn 95 of nh4 n 96 of phosphates and 74 of cod during 18 days of retention time phycoremediation of the landfill leachate studied in the past involved diluting raw leachate with large amount of distilled water synthetic media or domestic sewage 25 26 49 el ouaer et al 49 reported 90 and 60 removal of nh4 n and cod by chlorella sp in 10 leachate spiked in bbm paskuliakova et al 25 obtained 90 of nh4 n removal by chlamydomonas sp strain from 10 raw leachate spiked in autoclaved deionised water after 30 days of cultivation zhao et al 26 diluted landfill leachate with municipal sewage in different proportion and observed 90 total nitrogen removal from the 10 landfill leachate spiked in wastewater also these studies were completed on a very small scale pbr 250 ml erlenmeyer flask used as pbr with low light harvesting efficiency where present study was conducted in larger column pbr hence our study obtained higher nutrient removal from pre treated landfill leachate however the contaminant removal obtained in this study followed a similar trend reported by earlier researchers with relatively lesser complex wastewater previous researchers have shown that chlorella pyrenoidosa used to treat soybean processing wastewater removed 77 88 89 and 70 of soluble cod tn nh4 n and phosphate respectively 30 similarly c pyrenoidosa has been reported to remove 80 85 of phosphorus and 60 80 of nitrogen from diluted dairy wastewater 15 in another study c pyrenoidosa removed 90 of toc 95 of nitrate and 90 of phosphate from synthetic wastewater 50 the photosynthesis process involving carbon nitrogen and phosphorus uptake by microalgae for biomass production is mentioned in eqs 9 and 10 51 9 92 c o 2 16 n h 4 92 h 2 o 14 h c o 3 h p o 4 2 c 106 h 263 o 110 n 16 p 138 o 2 18 h c o 3 10 124 c o 2 16 n o 3 140 h 2 o h p o 4 2 c 106 h 263 o 110 n 16 p 138 o 2 18 h c o 3 as the leachate used in the microalgae cultivation was unsterilized the bacteria present in the solution formed a synchronised consortium or syndicate with the inoculated c pyrenoidosa previous studies have also reported that the presence of bacteria along with chlorella pyrenoidosa enhanced the degradation efficiency of tn phosphorus and cod without significantly affecting the total biomass production 52 c pyrenoidosa grew mixotrophically as it effectively utilised both organic carbon from the leachate and inorganic carbon from co2 supplied bacteria co existing with microalgae can breakdown several nitrogen compounds into forms that can be easily assimilated by microalgae 26 37 furthermore bacteria provided vitamins and organic growth factors that improve the microalgae growth 53 siderophores in certain bacteria can help microalgal growth in iron deficient cultivating environments 45 in return microalgae produced o2 during photosynthesis which is consumed by bacteria as their electron acceptor to breakdown complex organic matter and the extracellular sheath of microalgae provides organic carbon and attachment sites for bacterial growth 37 45 consumption of inorganic carbon from co2 was not significantly affected by the presence of organic carbon in the leachate this was confirmed from the fact that the dry cell weight continued to increase even after doc removal attained a steady state indicating that for further algal growth inorganic carbon from co2 was utilised carbon in the leachate was assimilated by microalgae as it is the most vital constituent in microalgae cells which can make up to 50 of the dry cell weight 8 54 organic carbon boosts the nitrogen metabolism synthesis of the nitrate nitrogen into chlorophyll and proteins while inorganic carbon increased the chloroplast and mitochondria synthesis and carbon assimilation 9 nh4 n was the predominant nitrogen form present in the landfill leachate table 1 nh4 n removal from the pre treated leachate could be through microalgae assimilation nitrification and volatilisation at higher ph level however as ph of the solution in the present study was always maintained between 7 and 8 most nh4 n removed was due to assimilation by c pyrenoidosa microalgae consumed inorganic nitrogen such as ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 nitrite no2 for its growth by its assimilation into the cells and further biotransformation into amino acid nucleic acids proteins and pigments 8 55 the microalgae can contain 1 10 nitrogen subject to form and quantity of available nitrogen in solution 8 hence tn and nh4 n from the pre treated leachate solution were assimilated by microalgae bacteria consortium for its growth nh4 n removal surpassed tn removal which could be attributed to the easy metabolism of ammonia as the nitrogen source due to lesser energy requirements for its uptake assimilation of other nitrogenous compounds requires more energy as must be transformed to ammonium within the microalgal cell prior to assimilation into biomass 34 during the early stage of algal growth nh4 n is consumed quickly by microalgae for chlorophyll synthesis 56 however excess concentration of nh4 n can harm chlorophyll thus reducing the photosynthesis efficiency fig 6 indicates c pyrenoidosa consumed 96 of phosphate available in the pre treated landfill leachate during 18 days of the phycoremediation process phosphate plays a noteworthy role in initiating and sustaining biomass growth 25 it is crucial in many processes like metabolism biosynthesis of nucleic acids in algal cells photosynthesis dna formation and energy transfer 28 57 availability of phosphorus can increase the nitrogen demand by green algae 25 58 generally phosphorus content in the microalgae cell ranged from 0 41 to 3 16 26 the biomass productivity 0 15 g l d and specific growth 0 15 d 1 for microalgae in pbr were greater than biomass productivity 0 12 g l d and specific growth 0 14 d 1 observed in the initial experiment using reagent bottles table 2 the final biomass concentration in pbr was 2 8 g l also chn analysis revealed that the dry cell weight contained higher carbon content 47 47 in algal cells than carbon content 40 32 in the initial experiments fig 5b further the carbon fixation rate obtained in pbr was 0 26 g l d which was also higher than initial values of 0 21 g l d fig 5b this increased biomass productivity was attributed to increased dic availability to c pyrenoidosa in pbr column pbr used in this study had height more than twice the diameter which helped to have a high surface area to volume ratio 14 14 for superior light harvest also aeration produced bubbles which raised to the surface of the liquid ensured efficient mass transfer and effectively released out oxygen or any other accumulated gases all these features of the pbr had increased the efficiency of the carbon fixation rate and biomass productivity hence it can be concluded that laboratory scale column pbr was more efficient in biomass growth and carbon dioxide consumption from point source than small reagent bottles 3 5 practical implication of the results in most developing countries the landfill leachate runs into nearby surface water bodies or groundwater without any form of treatment posing severe hazards to the surrounding environment 1 although biological treatment seems to be cost effective the treatment methods but are highly inefficient due to the complex nature of landfill leachate its inconsistent concentration the presence of low organic content and high level of thms xocs and ammonia the anaerobic degradation of solid waste disposed of in landfill releases large amount landfill gases lfgs into the atmosphere lfg mostly constitute ch4 co2 h2s and a small quantity of volatile organic compounds vocs and other toxic gases as by products of the anaerobic decomposition 59 at some landfill sites lfgs are collected and flared to convert ch4 into co2 also some solid waste disposal sites have a waste to energy system as an integral part of solid waste management all these processes generate and release a large quantity of co2 in the ambient atmosphere near solid waste disposal sites 59 hence cultivating microalgae in msw disposal sites can serve multiple purposes of treating landfill leachate reducing co2 release in ambient air and large scale biomass production biomass produced can be later transformed to value added products like pigments biofuels animal feeds etc 60 the results of this preliminary study indicate that phycoremediation process can be a practically applied as low cost tertiary treatment for landfill leachate microalgae can grow landfill leachate supplemented with co2 to produce high biomass content cultivating microalgae in pre treated landfill leachate can compensate for the high amount of water and synthetic media consumption and thus reducing the stress on natural resources microalgae have high potential to become feedstock for several types of renewable fuels such as ethanol methane biodiesel and hydrogen 61 microalgae can accumulate about 50 70 of lipid content per dry cell weight when cultured under favourable conditions 62 the pbr used this study can be effortlessly scaled up for application on site by changing its dimensions according to the quantity of the leachate to be treated similarly as the coagulation process has been widely used across the world for water and wastewater treatment it can be easily installed in the landfill sites hence microalgae can be cultivated in high strength landfill leachate after employing conventional pretreatment techniques 4 conclusion the phycoremediation of pre treated landfill leachate was successfully performed in a column pbr aerated with 10 co2 the pre treatment of landfill leachate with coagulation and air stripping process reduced the concentration of the inorganic compound thms colour and nh4 n which improved the light penetration and reduced the toxicity of the landfill leachate and rendered it suitable for microalgae cultivation microalgae utilised the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus present in the pre treated landfill leachate for its cell growth chlorophyll synthesis carbon metabolism and other process involved in biomass productivity the microalgae also assimilated inorganic carbon in the form of co2 provided from a point source as the carbon source for biomass productivity the results indicated that chlorella pyrenoidosa cultivated with pre treated landfill leachate exhibited maximum growth when aerated with 10 co2 enriched air the phycoremediation of landfill leachate produced final microalgae biomass concentration of 2 9 g l and also consumed carbon dioxide at the rate of 0 26 g l d present work successfully demonstrated that phycoremediation can be practically applied to pre treated landfill leachate for further deep treatment and carbon dioxide emission reduction acknowledgements the authors wish to

14455,landfill leachate contains a high concentration of organic and inorganic compounds toxic heavy metals thms ammonia and bio refractory compounds hence the remediation of landfill leachate is a challenge for environmental scientists and practitioners present work aims to study the application of phycoremediation process as tertiary treatment for pre treated landfill leachate combined with carbon biosequestration in laboratory scale photobioreactor pbr which can be easily scaled up for on site application real leachate collected from solid waste dumpsite was initially treated with coagulation and air stripping process the pre treated leachate was innoculated with chlorella pyrenoidosa and subsequently exposed different co2 concentration to determine the optimum co2

landfill leachate phycoremediation chlorella pyrenoidosa carbon fixation microalgae 1 introduction landfilling remains the ultimate municipal solid waste msw disposal method in the most developing nations due to low expenditure and simple operation 1 degradation of the msw in landfills generates a substantial amount of leachate contaminants from the landfilled waste enter into liquid phase during degradation and precipitation ultimately seeping out in the form of leachate 2 landfill leachate generally comprises high concentration of dissolved organic and inorganic compounds toxic heavy metals thms ammonia and xenobiotic organic compounds xoc which are highly toxic to living organisms and environment 3 leachate generated from the landfill sites pose a serious challenge to the landfill operators and local governing bodies as it percolates through the disposed waste and contaminates the soil and both surface and groundwater 3 several physicochemical and biological process have been extensively studied for the treatment of landfill leachate 4 however these methods autonomously cannot treat the leachate completely and hence a blend of physicochemical and biological processes is always applied for effective treatment of complex inorganic and high strength landfill leachate 1 5 though these conventional treatment systems have fairly good efficiency they may not be sustainable as it involves substantial costs in terms of materials equipment chemical and electrical consumption without any remarkable energy recovery 4 recently phycoremediation process has gained significant attention as one of the sustainable bioremediation technique for high strength wastewater treatment due to its efficient removal of nutrients organic and inorganic compounds from wastewater 6 7 during phycoremediation process carbon nitrogen phosphorus and trace elements present in the wastewater are assimilated by microalgae for its metabolism and cell growth thus producing superior quality effluent 8 furthermore the microalgae in the presence of sunlight can transform co2 from the point source into carbohydrates proteins and fatty acids 9 10 recent studies have exhibited successful application of the phycoremediation process to treat municipal wastewater 11 tannery wastewater 6 textile wastewater 12 coal gasification effluent 13 aquaculture effluent 14 dairy effluent 15 agricultural wastewater 16 distillery wastewater 17 18 effluent from bioethanol plant 19 reverse osmosis concentrate 20 biodiesel wastewater 21 and crude oil 22 previous studies have explored the viability of using phycoremediation for treatment of landfill leachate however phycoremediation process has not been successful in treating concentrated landfill leachate independently due to toxicity induced by high concentration of organic and inorganic compounds nh4 n and thms 23 24 hence landfill leachates were diluted 10 20 times to reduce its inhibitory effects 25 26 however for full scale leachate treatment dilution to such an extent would require a large quantity of water and land restricting its full scale application 25 the primary and secondary treatment of landfill leachate by conventional physicochemical process can reduce the concentration of toxic inhibitory compound and colour to a great extent with less land requirement 1 24 27 also tertiary effluent can provide sufficient macro and micro nutrients for biomass production 28 using microalgae for tertiary treatment can be sustainable option as it can improve the effluent quality with minimal environmental hazards along with production of beneficial microalgal biomass further microalgae cultivated in wastewater can be used for co2 reduction from point sources considering these factors can improve the efficiency of pbrs in regards to contaminant removal efficiency biomass productivity and biotic co2 uptake this study focussed on utilization of microalgae chlorella pyrenoidosa for nutrient removal from pre treated landfill leachate integrated with carbon sequestration using a column photobioreactor pbr initially for microalgae cultivated in pre treated landfill leachate influence of different co2 concentrations on biomass productivity was measured later microalgae was cultivated in pre treated landfill leachate using column pbr aerated with optimum co2 concentration 2 materials and methods 2 1 leachate collection and physicochemical characterisation landfill leachate was collected from one of the dumpsites in chennai india and transported to the laboratory immediately the sample was screened through a coarse filter pore size 2 mm to remove any large size solids and allowed to settle overnight at 4 c to remove maximum solids present in it the supernatant liquid was syphoned off and was used for further study all parameters were analysed conferring to standard methods published by american public health association 29 the samples were filtered through

chlorella pyrenoidosa the microalgae chlorella pyrenoidosa ncim 2738 procured from national collection of industrial microorganisms national chemical laboratory pune india was used in this study c pyrenoidosa one of the most popular freshwater microalgae is capable of growing autotrophically heterotrophically or mixotrophically and has been successfully applied for wastewater treatment and bio fuel production 30 31 previous studies have shown that c pyrenoidosa can survive in landfill leachate with nh4 h concentration up to 134 mg l 32 in ambient condition c pyrenoidosa showed faster growth and is tolerant to high co2 concentration 13 33 c pyrenoidosa was cultivated in bold s basal medium bbm comprising nano3 25 g mgso4 7h2o 7 5 g cacl2 2h2o 2 5 g nacl 2 5 g k2hpo4 17 5 g kh2po4 7 5 g h3bo3 11 4 g feso4 7h2o 4 98 g in 1 ml concentrated h2so4 and trace metals added to 1000 ml distilled water bbm after preparation was autoclaved at 121 c for 20 min and c pyrenoidosa cells were inoculated into bbm under sterile conditions in multiple 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 120 ml bbm the culture was maintained at room temperature 26 3 c provided with a continuous artificial light source of intensity 8 000 lux work zone lx 101 proper mixing of the culture was ensured by agitation at 100 rpm by an orbital shaker the algal cultivation was maintained in the ph range 7 8 the morphological features and cell dimensions of the c pyrenoidosa were observed using a light microscope nikon eclipse lv100 japan equipped with a camera and imaging software nis element version 4 0 the morphological features of c pyrenoidosa used for this study is presented in fig 1 the dry cell mass of c pyrenoidosa was calculated by filtering 20 ml aliquots through pre weighed glass fibre filter paper whatman usa 0 45 μm pore size the filter papers were dried in hot air oven at 105 c overnight and the difference between initial and final weight was determined by the gravimetric method the difference in the final and initial weight of the filter papers was used to calculate the dry cell mass of the c pyrenoidosa as shown below 1 dry cell weight g l w 2 w 1 ml of sample filtered where w1 and w2 are the initial and final weight of the filter paper specific growth rate μ day 1 and maximum biomass productivity pb g l day were determined using eqs 2 and 3 respectively 18 2 μ l n w f w i δ t 3 p b w f w i δ t where wi and wf are the initial and final dry cell weight g l while δt is the difference in time the carbon fixation rate cf g l d was estimated by the equation given below 4 cf pb cc mco2 mc where cc is the percentage of carbon in dry cell weight measured by chns analyzer mc and mco2 are the molecular weight of carbon 12 g mol and carbon dioxide 44 g mol respectively 2 3 acclimatisation of c pyrenoidosa to landfill leachate and carbon dioxide after one subculturing c pyrenoidosa was acclimatised to toxic landfill leachate by adding 5 sterilised leachate to bbm v v which was further cultivated in 5 l transparent glass jar containing 2 l bbm aerated with 2 co2 enriched air at the rate of 1 0 lpm 11 34 the microalgae culture was incubated in an enclosed chamber provided with artificial luminescence of intensity 8 000 lux for 20 days this process was repeated for one more subculture after which the c pyrenoidosa was acclimatised to landfill leachate and co2 the algal solution was centrifuged at 4000xg for 10 min and the supernatant liquid was discarded the algal cells were washed with distilled water to remove the salts from the surface and the suspension was centrifuged again the centrifuged algal cells were used as seeds in the further phycoremediation studies 2 4 pre treatment of landfill leachate coagulation study was performed in a jar test apparatus fixed with six stirring rods at room temperature alum aluminium sulphate al2 so4 3 was added to 500 ml of settled landfill leachate filled in 1000 ml beakers under rapid stirring conditions floc formation by alum was supported by gentle mixing at 30 rpm for 20 min which was later allowed to settle to the bottom of the beaker by keeping it quiescent for 30 min samples were collected by syphoning from approximately 2 cm below the water surface filtered with 0 45 μm nylon syringe filters and diluted appropriately before analysis the ph of the leachate was not altered before adding coagulant during coagulation study landfill leachate after coagulation process was additionally exposed to air stripping process to reduce the concentration of nh4 n landfill leachate was aerated using an aquarium aerator at the rate of 2 lpm in a 1000 ml beaker samples were collected regularly at every 2 h interval and analysed to nh4 n and cod concentration the contaminant removal was estimated as 5 r c i c f c i 100 where ci and cf are concentrations of the pollutants in the original and treated effluent respectively 2 5 optimum carbon dioxide dose for maximum productivity of c pyrenoidosa even though the microalgae can consume co2 for its growth concentration above a threshold value can be toxic hence to optimise the concentration of co2 exposed to microalgae used for phycoremediation study a laboratory study was conducted by varying the co2 levels in aeration air 600 ml of the pre treated landfill leachate inoculated with 0 2 g l microalgae was placed in 1000 ml capacity transparent glass reagent bottles which were incubated in an enclosed chamber illuminated with artificial light the microalgae grown in pre treated leachate was aerated with 0 03 ambient air 5 10 and 15 co2 enriched air at the rate of 0 5 lpm through a porous stone at the bottom of the bottles pure co2 from a commercial cylinder was blended with air supplied by an aquarium aerator to obtain the desired co2 concentration the bottles were placed in a closed chamber illuminated by a cool white fluorescent light the biomass concentrations were measured every alternate day in triplicates and the threshold co2 concentration for maximum biomass concentration was determined the algal suspension was centrifuged at 4000xg for 10 min the algal pellets collected were washed with distilled water and oven dried at 60 c until they attained constant weight the air dried algal pellets were analysed for carbon hydrogen and nitrogen chn contents in chns analyser vario ei cube elementar analysensysteme gmbh germany 2 6 photobioreactor setup and phycoremediation study the results obtained from the optimisation studies were applied to a scaled up pbr phycoremediation study the pbr used to carry out the phycoremediation and co2 fixation experiments was fabricated with 4 mm thick transparent plexiglass tubes of 90 mm internal diameter and 600 mm height as detailed in fig 2 the pbr was placed inside a 250 mm cylindrical chamber continuously illuminated with artificial white florescent light of 8000 lux the mean ambient temperature was 26 2 2 4 c the pre treated leachate 3 l was poured into the reactor and inoculated with the seed microalgae culture prepared as discussed in the section 2 3 air with 10 co2 was purged to the bottom of the pbr through a tube extending into the bottommost end of pbr through sintered stones at the rate of 0 5 lpm the movement of the air bubbles within the reactor ensured proper mixing of the nutrients in solution uniform availability of light to algal cells and prevented accumulation of oxygen from photosynthesis process the total volume of liquid in the pbr was periodically monitored and evaporation losses were rectified samples were withdrawn from the pbr every alternate day to analyse the concentration of nutrient and microalgae cells in triplicates 3 results and discussions 3 1 characteristics of landfill leachate the landfill leachate was characterised by an unpleasant odour dark brown colour and high concentration of doc phosphate nitrogen and thms table 1 the high concentration of humic substances present in the leachate imparted a dark brown colour to the leachate 35 the bod5 cod ratio of 0 2 indicated the presence of more inorganic content low bod5 cod ratio with high nh4 n concentration implied a reduced amount of biochemical activity as the organic matter in the waste was nearly stabilised a large amount of refractory organic molecules released from the solid wastes were responsible for low bod5 cod ratio 36 the concentration of mn ni zn fe as and hg were very high and hence the biological treatment of the leachate was unviable without pre treatment the presence of the thms can be attributed to the composition of solid waste for example the existence of zn in leachate indicates waste from battery and incandescent lamp while a high concentration of fe indicates scrap steel disposal in the landfill 37 the corrosion of ferrous to form ferric hydroxide colloidal particles and complexes with humic substances contributes to the dark brown colour of leachate 37 the dark brown colour of the leachate can significantly reduce light penetration into the solution which can hinder the microalgal photosynthesis and biomass production also a high concentration of nh4 n present in the leachate can impart a toxic effect on the microalgae growth of microalgae in leachate 38 hence it was inevitable to reduce the concentration of the toxic compounds present in the leachate before phycoremediation which was achieved by coagulation and air stripping process 3 2 effect of pre treatment process on characteristics of landfill leachate the removal ratios of leachate parameters i e colour cod doc tn and nh4 n by coagulation process are presented in fig 3 the results showed that the contaminant removal improved significantly with coagulant dose from 1 to 4 g l with maximum removal efficiency for all the parameters observed at 4 g l of alum dose at 4 mg l alum removed about 72 59 53 45 35 and 66 of colour cod doc tn nh4 n and phosphate respectively from the leachate the general mechanisms involved in the alum coagulation process are hydrolysis charge neutralisation precipitation adsorption and enmeshment 39 40 most of the colloidal particles in leachate are negatively charged which results in electrical repulsion between the particles and prevent them from settling down alum once added to the leachate hydrolyses to from al3 ions in the solution these al3 ions interact precisely with negatively charged colloids and neutralise their charge as shown in eq 6 41 43 further al3 ions also polymerise to form amorphous gel like aluminium hydroxide al oh 3 which further enmeshes or adsorbs the soluble organic matter colour and colloidal particles and separates them from solution through the sweep floc mechanism eq 7 fig 3c 39 41 42 additional dose of alum can cause destabilisation of flocs due to repulsion caused by the presence of excess positively charged ions reducing the treatment efficiency 41 6 al2 so4 3 18h2o 2al3 3so4 2 18 h2o 7 2al3 3so4 2 18h2o 2al oh 3 6h 3so4 2 12h2o previous studies have also reported high contaminant reduction by coagulation process using alum ghafari et al 27 obtained 88 turbidity 86 colour and 90 tss removal at ph 7 and 9 5 g l of alum dose similarly jun et al 44 reported 70 6 cod 84 tss and 80 colour removal by coagulation of biologically pre treated landfill leachate at an optimum alum dose of 5 g l and ph 7 the minor difference in the coagulant dose and contaminant removal efficiency between the studies can be attributed to variation in the chemical characteristics of leachate alum also reduced the concentrations of thms present in the leachate fig 3b the thms like hg and as were almost completely removed by coagulation process while 97 removal was observed for mn and fe co ni cr ba and zn was removed by 92 88 75 72 and 32 respectively thms interchange or obstruct the prosthetic metal atoms in some enzymes related to photosynthesis and thus inhibit the microalgal growth and the overall remediation effectiveness 45 removal of thms and colour from the landfill leachate reduced its toxicity and allowed more light penetration making it suitable for bioremediation process the coagulation process could not significantly reduce the concentration of nh4 n from the leachate hence to reduce the nh4 n concentration coagulated leachate was further subjected to air stripping process the effect of aeration on the nh4 n and cod removal is presented in fig 4 the results indicated that nh4 n removal from leachate increased up to 44 in 8 h and 45 in 10 h the nh4 n removal attained in the this study was considerably lower than the previous research conducted by abood et al 1 which reported 90 nh4 n with 6 h of agitation at ph 11 5 this is because in the previous study higher ph favoured nh4 n conversion into ammonia gas which was easily volatilised and removed during aeration 1 in this study the ph of the leachate was not increased to 11 5 as ph above 8 0 was not favourable for the growth of microalgae which might be the reason for the lower efficiency of the air stripping process however 8 h of air stripping process reduced the concentration of nh4 n to 77 mg l which can be readily assimilated by the microalgae within the cells for its growth and metabolism 3 3 effect of co2 concentrations on growth of c pyrenoidosa in pre treated landfill leachate the co2 tolerance and biomass production are the significant factors considered when applying microalgae for co2 mitigation process hence the microalgae suspension in pre treated landfill leachate was aerated with air enriched with 0 03 5 10 and 15 v v co2 the growth curves of c pyrenoidosa exposed to air enriched with increasing co2 concentration are displayed in fig 5 a the growth curve indicated that c pyrenoidosa experienced a lag phase of 2 days followed by log phase of 14 days the dry cell weight of the microalgae cultivated in pre treated landfill leachate aerated with 0 03 5 and 10 co2 increased from initial cell weight of 0 24 g l to final cell weight of 1 76 2 37 and 2 61 g l respectively during 18 days of cultivation thus increased in co2 levels available to microalgal cells improved the photosynthetic activity and biomass productions of microalgae high co2 concentrations in presence of light might efficiently stimulate inter conversion of organic matter in microalgal cells and improve biomass production as shown in eq 8 9 8 c o 2 h 2 o 9 5 hν c 6 h 12 o 6 o 2 aeration with 5 and 10 co2 enriched air provided sufficient amount of dissolved inorganic carbon dic for biomass growth lower dic level can lead to the carbon deprived environment which restricted the synthesis of a range of vital enzymes vital for cellular carbon metabolism 46 aeration with optimum co2 enriched air can increase the gene expression associated with cell growth like chloroplast and mitochondria synthesis nitrogen metabolism carbon metabolism in microalgae 9 moreover excess carbon in the form of co2 can help in increasing biomass growth and lipid accumulation in the cells 47 conversely a very high level of dic concentration can reduce the ph and inhibit extracellular carbonic anhydrase activity thus reducing the biomass concentration 46 this may be reason that when co2 concentration increased to 15 microalgae initially grew but started dying off and the maximum dry cell weight obtained was only 0 96 g l on 10th day hence μ and pb for 15 co2 presented in table 2 was calculated for 10 days the specific growth rate and maximum biomass productivity and of c pyrenoidosa species exposed to different co2 concentration are presented in table 2 the biomass productivity and specific growth rates of c pyrenoidosa aerated with co2 enriched air showed that increasing co2 concentration up to 10 improved the biomass production rate the results indicated that biomass productivity and specific growth rate had a maximum value of 0 12 g l day and 0 14 day respectively when exposed to air enriched with 10 co2 in previous study tang et al 33 investigated the biomass production of c pyrenoidosa cultivated in modified bg11 medium and exposed to different co2 concentrations up to 50 the study found that c pyrenoidosa gave highest biomass production μ 0 144 d 1 and pb 0 155 mg l d at 10 co2 exposure fan et al 48 found that c pyrenoidosa gave highest biomass concentration of 4 3 g l when cultivated in bbm and exposed to 5 co2 concentration hence it can be inferred that although the microalgal strain is highly tolerant of co2 their survival and biomass production in co2 environment will be influenced by microalgae species cultivating media and culturing environment fig 5 b presents the effect of varying co2 concentration on carbon hydrogen and nitrogen content of dry microalgae cells the results indicated that c pyrenoidosa aerated with 10 co2 had highest carbon content 40 based on the carbon content and biomass productivity p from table 2 the co2 fixation rate estimated using eq 4 was 0 21 g l day it can be inferred from the results in table 2 and fig 5 b that maximum carbon dioxide sequestration efficiency was obtained when c pyrenoidosa cultivated in pre treated landfill leachate was exposed to 10 co2 this optimum conditions were used for phycoremediation study in pbr explained in subsequent section 3 4 phycoremediation of pre treated landfill leachate in the pbr the nutrient removals from pre treated landfill leachate and biomass growth observed during phycoremediation are presented in fig 6 at the end of the study phycoremediation process effectively removed 91 of doc 76 of tn 95 of nh4 n 96 of phosphates and 74 of cod during 18 days of retention time phycoremediation of the landfill leachate studied in the past involved diluting raw leachate with large amount of distilled water synthetic media or domestic sewage 25 26 49 el ouaer et al 49 reported 90 and 60 removal of nh4 n and cod by chlorella sp in 10 leachate spiked in bbm paskuliakova et al 25 obtained 90 of nh4 n removal by chlamydomonas sp strain from 10 raw leachate spiked in autoclaved deionised water after 30 days of cultivation zhao et al 26 diluted landfill leachate with municipal sewage in different proportion and observed 90 total nitrogen removal from the 10 landfill leachate spiked in wastewater also these studies were completed on a very small scale pbr 250 ml erlenmeyer flask used as pbr with low light harvesting efficiency where present study was conducted in larger column pbr hence our study obtained higher nutrient removal from pre treated landfill leachate however the contaminant removal obtained in this study followed a similar trend reported by earlier researchers with relatively lesser complex wastewater previous researchers have shown that chlorella pyrenoidosa used to treat soybean processing wastewater removed 77 88 89 and 70 of soluble cod tn nh4 n and phosphate respectively 30 similarly c pyrenoidosa has been reported to remove 80 85 of phosphorus and 60 80 of nitrogen from diluted dairy wastewater 15 in another study c pyrenoidosa removed 90 of toc 95 of nitrate and 90 of phosphate from synthetic wastewater 50 the photosynthesis process involving carbon nitrogen and phosphorus uptake by microalgae for biomass production is mentioned in eqs 9 and 10 51 9 92 c o 2 16 n h 4 92 h 2 o 14 h c o 3 h p o 4 2 c 106 h 263 o 110 n 16 p 138 o 2 18 h c o 3 10 124 c o 2 16 n o 3 140 h 2 o h p o 4 2 c 106 h 263 o 110 n 16 p 138 o 2 18 h c o 3 as the leachate used in the microalgae cultivation was unsterilized the bacteria present in the solution formed a synchronised consortium or syndicate with the inoculated c pyrenoidosa previous studies have also reported that the presence of bacteria along with chlorella pyrenoidosa enhanced the degradation efficiency of tn phosphorus and cod without significantly affecting the total biomass production 52 c pyrenoidosa grew mixotrophically as it effectively utilised both organic carbon from the leachate and inorganic carbon from co2 supplied bacteria co existing with microalgae can breakdown several nitrogen compounds into forms that can be easily assimilated by microalgae 26 37 furthermore bacteria provided vitamins and organic growth factors that improve the microalgae growth 53 siderophores in certain bacteria can help microalgal growth in iron deficient cultivating environments 45 in return microalgae produced o2 during photosynthesis which is consumed by bacteria as their electron acceptor to breakdown complex organic matter and the extracellular sheath of microalgae provides organic carbon and attachment sites for bacterial growth 37 45 consumption of inorganic carbon from co2 was not significantly affected by the presence of organic carbon in the leachate this was confirmed from the fact that the dry cell weight continued to increase even after doc removal attained a steady state indicating that for further algal growth inorganic carbon from co2 was utilised carbon in the leachate was assimilated by microalgae as it is the most vital constituent in microalgae cells which can make up to 50 of the dry cell weight 8 54 organic carbon boosts the nitrogen metabolism synthesis of the nitrate nitrogen into chlorophyll and proteins while inorganic carbon increased the chloroplast and mitochondria synthesis and carbon assimilation 9 nh4 n was the predominant nitrogen form present in the landfill leachate table 1 nh4 n removal from the pre treated leachate could be through microalgae assimilation nitrification and volatilisation at higher ph level however as ph of the solution in the present study was always maintained between 7 and 8 most nh4 n removed was due to assimilation by c pyrenoidosa microalgae consumed inorganic nitrogen such as ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 nitrite no2 for its growth by its assimilation into the cells and further biotransformation into amino acid nucleic acids proteins and pigments 8 55 the microalgae can contain 1 10 nitrogen subject to form and quantity of available nitrogen in solution 8 hence tn and nh4 n from the pre treated leachate solution were assimilated by microalgae bacteria consortium for its growth nh4 n removal surpassed tn removal which could be attributed to the easy metabolism of ammonia as the nitrogen source due to lesser energy requirements for its uptake assimilation of other nitrogenous compounds requires more energy as must be transformed to ammonium within the microalgal cell prior to assimilation into biomass 34 during the early stage of algal growth nh4 n is consumed quickly by microalgae for chlorophyll synthesis 56 however excess concentration of nh4 n can harm chlorophyll thus reducing the photosynthesis efficiency fig 6 indicates c pyrenoidosa consumed 96 of phosphate available in the pre treated landfill leachate during 18 days of the phycoremediation process phosphate plays a noteworthy role in initiating and sustaining biomass growth 25 it is crucial in many processes like metabolism biosynthesis of nucleic acids in algal cells photosynthesis dna formation and energy transfer 28 57 availability of phosphorus can increase the nitrogen demand by green algae 25 58 generally phosphorus content in the microalgae cell ranged from 0 41 to 3 16 26 the biomass productivity 0 15 g l d and specific growth 0 15 d 1 for microalgae in pbr were greater than biomass productivity 0 12 g l d and specific growth 0 14 d 1 observed in the initial experiment using reagent bottles table 2 the final biomass concentration in pbr was 2 8 g l also chn analysis revealed that the dry cell weight contained higher carbon content 47 47 in algal cells than carbon content 40 32 in the initial experiments fig 5b further the carbon fixation rate obtained in pbr was 0 26 g l d which was also higher than initial values of 0 21 g l d fig 5b this increased biomass productivity was attributed to increased dic availability to c pyrenoidosa in pbr column pbr used in this study had height more than twice the diameter which helped to have a high surface area to volume ratio 14 14 for superior light harvest also aeration produced bubbles which raised to the surface of the liquid ensured efficient mass transfer and effectively released out oxygen or any other accumulated gases all these features of the pbr had increased the efficiency of the carbon fixation rate and biomass productivity hence it can be concluded that laboratory scale column pbr was more efficient in biomass growth and carbon dioxide consumption from point source than small reagent bottles 3 5 practical implication of the results in most developing countries the landfill leachate runs into nearby surface water bodies or groundwater without any form of treatment posing severe hazards to the surrounding environment 1 although biological treatment seems to be cost effective the treatment methods but are highly inefficient due to the complex nature of landfill leachate its inconsistent concentration the presence of low organic content and high level of thms xocs and ammonia the anaerobic degradation of solid waste disposed of in landfill releases large amount landfill gases lfgs into the atmosphere lfg mostly constitute ch4 co2 h2s and a small quantity of volatile organic compounds vocs and other toxic gases as by products of the anaerobic decomposition 59 at some landfill sites lfgs are collected and flared to convert ch4 into co2 also some solid waste disposal sites have a waste to energy system as an integral part of solid waste management all these processes generate and release a large quantity of co2 in the ambient atmosphere near solid waste disposal sites 59 hence cultivating microalgae in msw disposal sites can serve multiple purposes of treating landfill leachate reducing co2 release in ambient air and large scale biomass production biomass produced can be later transformed to value added products like pigments biofuels animal feeds etc 60 the results of this preliminary study indicate that phycoremediation process can be a practically applied as low cost tertiary treatment for landfill leachate microalgae can grow landfill leachate supplemented with co2 to produce high biomass content cultivating microalgae in pre treated landfill leachate can compensate for the high amount of water and synthetic media consumption and thus reducing the stress on natural resources microalgae have high potential to become feedstock for several types of renewable fuels such as ethanol methane biodiesel and hydrogen 61 microalgae can accumulate about 50 70 of lipid content per dry cell weight when cultured under favourable conditions 62 the pbr used this study can be effortlessly scaled up for application on site by changing its dimensions according to the quantity of the leachate to be treated similarly as the coagulation process has been widely used across the world for water and wastewater treatment it can be easily installed in the landfill sites hence microalgae can be cultivated in high strength landfill leachate after employing conventional pretreatment techniques 4 conclusion the phycoremediation of pre treated landfill leachate was successfully performed in a column pbr aerated with 10 co2 the pre treatment of landfill leachate with coagulation and air stripping process reduced the concentration of the inorganic compound thms colour and nh4 n which improved the light penetration and reduced the toxicity of the landfill leachate and rendered it suitable for microalgae cultivation microalgae utilised the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus present in the pre treated landfill leachate for its cell growth chlorophyll synthesis carbon metabolism and other process involved in biomass productivity the microalgae also assimilated inorganic carbon in the form of co2 provided from a point source as the carbon source for biomass productivity the results indicated that chlorella pyrenoidosa cultivated with pre treated landfill leachate exhibited maximum growth when aerated with 10 co2 enriched air the phycoremediation of landfill leachate produced final microalgae biomass concentration of 2 9 g l and also consumed carbon dioxide at the rate of 0 26 g l d present work successfully demonstrated that phycoremediation can be practically applied to pre treated landfill leachate for further deep treatment and carbon dioxide emission reduction acknowledgements the authors wish to

applications from electrochemical applications such as chemical sensing 1 energy storage and supercapacitance 2 to the adsorption of organics both in the gas phase 3 6 and as aqueous contaminants 7 10 for the latter activated carbon has seen the most success in real world applications due to its high surface area hydrophobic surface capable of further functionalization 11 and great adsorption capacities for organic compounds activated carbon has been formed by physical 12 and or chemical 13 processes however the use of nanoparticles to template the carbonization process to control its morphology has received less attention with only a handful of examples reported 7 8 the use of nanoparticles during pyrolysis and subsequent removal from the carbon material can produce unique porosities which are less likely to appear by other methods while carbon activation via physical and chemical means has been thoroughly explored templating with nanoparticles has seen less attention having nanoparticles of a certain size present during pyrolysis and subsequently removing them from the carbon material can leave behind micro and mesoporosities of a very uniform size in our study we employ zinc ii oxide zno nanoparticles for the templation of glucose zno nanoparticles are commercially available relatively inexpensive and can be edged selectively in the presence of tio2 titanium oxide with acid allowing us to remove zno without damaging the tio2 nanoparticles we chose zno over magnetic nanoparticles such as magnetic iron oxide to avoid agglomeration during the mixing and carbonization processes other zno templated carbon materials have been explored as biosensors 1 and to the best of our knowledge their potential use for water treatment applications have not been fully investigated nanoparticles are oftentimes used to enhance the ability of carbon adsorbents to remove organic contaminants from water the catalytic degradation of several organic pollutants has been previously explored resulting in the elucidation of intermediates and final degradation products methylene blue 14 and ofloxacin 15 for example are found to oxidize to mineralization products such as co2 and heteroatoms of nitrogen and sulfur while degradation products of tetracycline show a decrease in toxicity after photocatalysis 16 carbonized materials can provide an adequate anchor for catalytic nanoparticles and as such the carbonization process has been employed to generate materials with semiconductor 17 photocatalytic 18 and h2 evolution 19 20 properties titanium oxide nanoparticles in particular have been explored for their ability to generate reactive oxygen species in water when their electrons are excited from the valence band to the conductive band most commonly by activation using ultraviolet uv light 21 embedding tio2 nanoparticles to the surface of activated carbon has shown effective adsorption and degradation of organic pollutants such as phenol 22 23 tetracycline 24 methyl orange 25 and humic acids 26 amongst others in most cases the nanoparticles are embedded to the surface of activated carbon leaving them exposed to uv light irradiation but possibly resulting in leaching of the nanoparticles over time we propose embedding the nanoparticles inside the activated carbon providing a carbon matrix which will prevent or at least minimize possible leaching in this study we explore the carbonization of glucose at 500 c in the presence of zinc oxide and titanium oxide nanoparticles the zno nanoparticles are then removed by acid treatment leaving behind a nanotemplated activated carbon forming our ntc nanotemplated carbon and ntc tio2 nanotemplated carbon with tio2 nanoparticles materials these materials were characterized by xrd bet

were done under stirring over 24 h at stp at which point they were centrifuged and the supernatant analyzed by uv vis spectroscopy adsorption studies for ntc tio2 were carried out separately in the dark and under uv light to compare adsorption only dark versus adsorption and photodegradation uv experiments in the dark were covered with aluminum foil and experiments under uv light were carried out in a uv reactor under uv b light with an intensity of 21 500 lx as measured by a digital light meter lx1330b kinetic studies were performed using 10 mg of ntc ntc tio2 or commercially available

corporation the specific surface area and bjh adsorption measurements were taken using a micrometrics surface area analyzer tristar ii 3020 instrument samples were heated at 85 c and degassed overnight prior to analysis nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms were measured at 78 k in flowing nitrogen saxs measurements were carried out using a xeuss 2 0 h saxs waxs system with a cu source tuned to λ 0 1542 nm at two sample to detector distances 1209 mm and 156 mm which yielded a q range of 0 008 2 5 å 1 all powder samples were loaded into 1 mm pathlength polyimide tubes and sealed with epoxy prior to loading into saxs capillary sample tubes the samples were dried in a vacuum oven at 120 c and 1 mbar for approximately 24 h atmospheric water adsorbed in the materials were 0 06 g g and 0 12 g g of water per gram of porous material for ntc tio2 and ntc respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 x ray diffraction carbonized glucose nanoparticle mixtures as well as ntc and ntc tio2 were analyzed by x ray diffraction fig 1 the glc zno mixture after carbonization shows well defined peaks belonging to zincite 27 jcpds card number 36 1351 indicating the presence of zno nanoparticles within the carbon matrix after acid treatment of ntc trace amounts of zno nanoparticles can be seen with small broad peaks rising slightly above baseline xrd of glc zno tio2 shows the presence of both zno nanoparticles as well as characteristic peaks for micropowder tio2 in the anatase phase 28 jcpds card number 21 1272 notably ntc tio2 shows the presence of tio2 and the absence of zno demonstrating the ability of tio2 nanoparticles to survive acid treatment by aqua regia the xrd profile of carbonized glucose is shown as a control demonstrating an amorphous structure and the absence of well defined peaks 3 2 energy dispersive x ray spectrosopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy measurements were taken in order to corroborate xrd data and to estimate the atomic composition of our samples table 1 both glc zno and glc zno tio2 show a high weight percentage belonging to the nanoparticles 65 and 77 respectively with carbon and oxygen percentages at relatively low levels after acid treatment ntc and ntc tio2 both show the disappearance of zn with the carbon percent composition increasing for both while the oxygen content increased between glc zno tio2 and ntc tio2 it nearly quadrupled between glc zno and ntc this suggests that much of the oxygen content of ntc tio2 comes from titania nanoparticles present which remains largely unaltered during acid treatment while the removal of zno nanoparticles presents a clearer representation of the composition of our carbonaceous material alone the carbon to oxygen weight ratio of ntc c o 3 71 is much higher than that of commercial glucose 1 33 c o wt indicating the loss of large amounts of oxygen during the pyrolysis process with water and small cox molecules as the most likely byproducts the presence of chlorine in both ntc and ntc tio2 is postulated to be the result of hcl addition to alkenes formed during the pyrolysis process indicating the formation of sp2 carbons during the elimination of oxygen under anaerobic carbonization 3 3 scanning and transmission electron microscopy scanning electron microscopy images figure s1 show rough amorphous carbon particles containing crevices and macropores for both glc zno and glc zno tio2 after carbonization the porous nature of these materials is in stark contrast to the carbonized glucose control which contains very smooth carbon particles with no evident crevices or porosity removal of zno nanoparticles results in a more homogeneous material of smaller carbon particle size figure s1 b d transmission electron microscopy images of ntc and ntc tio2 fig 2 a b show porosities with an average diameter of approximately 15 nm for both materials which is in agreement with the 35 nm size of the zno nanoparticles used for nanotemplating elemental mapping for ntc figure s2 and ntc tio2 figure s3 can be seen in our supplemental material 3 4 small angle x ray scattering small angle x ray scattering measurements for ntc ntc tio2 and carbonized glucose control can be seen in fig 3 the control sample only shows surface scattering porod slope 4 off the large powder grains which levels out at high q to an amorphous carbon signal with no mesopores each porous material exhibits two gentle bends one at q 0 02 å 1 and the other at q 0 1 å 1 indicating the presence of two porosity length scales data from the wide angle region in the i 2θ representation can be seen in fig 3b the carbon structure is more disordered in the porous materials than the carbonized glucose which has a sharper amorphous carbon peak at 2θ 22 5 the interplanar spacing is also shorter for glucose noted by the shift to higher angle zno peaks in ntc and the anatase tio2 peak in ntc tio2 are similar to the xrd measurement comparison of the relative peak positions of anatase 101 and zno 100 in the glc zno tio2 sample in the xrd data with the scattering intensities of the corresponding peaks in the saxs measurement show a 28 fold decrease in the zno intensity in the ntc sample this shows most of the zno was removed with the acid treatment and the residual zno comprises 3 4 of the original zno amount before acid etching from a single measurement saxs does not differentiate between pores that are accessible and non accessible to the fluid in order to check how each nanostructure fills with fluid h2o immersion measurements were carried out fig 4 these measurements show a uniform shift to lower saxs intensity i q compared to the dry material reference curves for ntc water the intensity decrease is a factor of 4 5 consistent with complete filling of the porous carbon whereas for ntc tio2 water the decrease is approximately a factor of 3 consistent with a lower fraction of the porous matrix available for water adsorption compared to ntc polydisperse sphere ps distributions of the dry ntc and ntc tio2 materials show both materials contain a narrow distribution of spheres with diameters 5 nm and large sphere distribution with diameters of 20 30 nm fig 4b top the ntc tio2 is weighed toward larger sizes presumably due to tio2 nps that are slightly larger than the pores ps model of dry and h2o immersed ntc fig 4b middle show similar distributions near r 12 5 nm but the h2o immersed sample shows a slight increase at r 32 nm possibly due to the small fraction of zno particles that were not removed through the acid treatment the volume normalized pore size distribution for ntc shows there are pores with radius of 2 8 nm and 11 5 nm the larger pore size is more polydisperse than the small pore radius the ps model for ntc tio2 similarly has a small sphere distribution centered at 2 8 nm but the large sphere radius distribution though its peak is at the same position as for ntc is more heavily weighed at sphere radii greater than 12 nm this is likely due to the presence of tio2 nanoparticles which are likely larger than the large pore spaces of ntc 3 5 brunauer emmett teller and barrett joyner halenda measurements the bjh cumulative pore volume charts for ntc and ntc tio2 can be seen in fig 5 with a summary of brunauer emmet teller surface area analysis depicted in table 2 while the total surface area calculated for carbonized glucose was negligible ntc and ntc tio2 saw an increase to 302 and 230 m2 g respectively total pore volumes for ntc and ntc tio2 were 0 486 and 0 269 cm3 g respectively with 84 and 90 of the total pore volume belonging to pores in the range of 2 to 50 nm mesoporous as seen in table 2 it should be noted that ntc tio2 has lower bet surface area average pore diameter and total pore volume than ntc presumably due to the lower ratio of zno nanoparticles available for removal by acid which is directly responsible for the generation of porosity microporosities 2 nm are absent from these materials therefore adsorption capabilities for gases at stp would not be ideal however the average pore diameter of ntc 17 08 nm and ntc tio2 10 53 nm is ideal for the adsorption of small organic molecules in solution making them good candidates for water remediation of organics this can be seen in the kinetic profiles of our materials fig 7 3 6 adsorption measurements 3 6 1 adsorption capacities the adsorption capacity profiles for ntc ntc tio2 dark ntc tio2 uv and activated carbon against methylene blue ofloxacin and tetracycline at five different concentrations can be seen in fig 6 interestingly ntc tio2 dark had very similar adsorption capacities at most concentrations against methylene blue ofloxacin and tetracycline as ntc despite having a lower surface area this can be attributed to hydrogen bonding between these analytes and hydroxyls present in both the carbon material and tio2 nps as well as possible ionic interactions between the contaminants and these hydroxyls at ph 7 all three contaminants can interact with our carbonized materials through hydrophobic and π π interactions in much the same manner as they can with activated carbon of note is the higher adsorption photodegradation of these contaminants across most concentrations for ntc tio2 uv versus ntc tio2 dark this trend is directly attributed to ros generation by tio2 nps under uv light for ntc tio2 uv ultraviolet light can excite tio2 nps at or near the surface of our material thus generating highly reactive oxygen species which can degrade contaminants not only in the surrounding area but also those trapped in the material as well this liberates adsorption sites which can then adsorb more contaminant thus increasing the adsorption capacity over time it should also be noted that the adsorption capacities of ntc tio2 uv against these contaminants is comparatively similar to those of activated carbon at most concentrations 3 6 2 kinetic studies kinetic adsorption studies were performed for all four contaminants over seven time points 0 7 min 15 min 30 min 1 h 2 h and 4 h and can be seen in fig 7 ntc adsorbed all contaminants at a faster rate than a commercially available activated carbon control as can be seen from t 0 min across all contaminants ntc was capable of adsorbing 91 of a 50 ppm methylene blue solution within immediate contact 64 of ofloxacin and 43 tetracycline within the same time period this is in stark comparison to activated carbon which only adsorbed 70 methylene blue 17 ofloxacin and 40 tetracycline within the same time period within the first 7 min of contact ntc adsorption increased to 97 methylene blue 79 ofloxacin and 75 tetracycline adsorption of the contaminants onto ntc tio2 at 7 min is nearly equal under both dark and uv light conditions indicating that the decrease in contaminant concentration is initially due mostly to adsorption of the material not degradation by ros however as time progresses the percentage of each contaminant present in the solution decreases at a higher rate for ntc tio2 under uv light due to a combination of both adsorption by the material and photodegradation by reactive oxygen species this can be seen by the rapid increase in qe for ntc tio2 against all contaminants with adsorption values nearing or reaching those of our activated carbon control 4 conclusion in conclusion a new method to prepare nanocomposites of mesoporous carbon and tio2 nanoparticles with adsorption and photocatalytic function is reported the nanomaterial was prepared by the carbonization of glucose templated with zno tio2 nanoparticles and followed by the acid removal of zno leaving behind a mesoporous carbon matrix with tio2 the successful removal of zno nanoparticles after carbonization of glucose was proven by xrd edx and saxs bet surface area analysis and saxs experiments show the appearance of nanoscale porosities ranging from 2 8 nm ntc and 11 5 nm ntc tio2 according to saxs and 17 1 nm ntc and 10 5 nm ntc tio2 according to bjh analysis both ntc and ntc tio2 show fast adsorption profiles against methylene blue ofloxacin and tetracycline ph 7 50 ppm exposure of ntc tio2 to uv light results in a lower contaminant concentration in solution over 24 h than ntc despite ntc tio2 having lower porosity and surface area we believe this is the result of a combination of adsorption by ntc tio2 and photogeneration of ros which can degrade contaminants contained both in solution and adsorbed onto the material conflict of interest there are no financial personal conflicts of interest to report

ray scattering saxs studies indicate that ntc and ntc tio2 exhibit two types of porosities with average pore diameters of 2 8 and 11 5 nm while brunauer emmet teller bet surface area analysis revealed the surface area of 302 and 230 m2 g respectively these materials exhibit fast adsorption kinetics against methylene blue ofloxacin and tetracycline in water exposure of ntc tio2 to uv light results in higher contaminant adsorption due to the active photodegradation which prevents the saturation of the nanocomposite abbreviations ntc nanotemplated carbon ntc tio2 nanotemplated carbon with

applications from electrochemical applications such as chemical sensing 1 energy storage and supercapacitance 2 to the adsorption of organics both in the gas phase 3 6 and as aqueous contaminants 7 10 for the latter activated carbon has seen the most success in real world applications due to its high surface area hydrophobic surface capable of further functionalization 11 and great adsorption capacities for organic compounds activated carbon has been formed by physical 12 and or chemical 13 processes however the use of nanoparticles to template the carbonization process to control its morphology has received less attention with only a handful of examples reported 7 8 the use of nanoparticles during pyrolysis and subsequent removal from the carbon material can produce unique porosities which are less likely to appear by other methods while carbon activation via physical and chemical means has been thoroughly explored templating with nanoparticles has seen less attention having nanoparticles of a certain size present during pyrolysis and subsequently removing them from the carbon material can leave behind micro and mesoporosities of a very uniform size in our study we employ zinc ii oxide zno nanoparticles for the templation of glucose zno nanoparticles are commercially available relatively inexpensive and can be edged selectively in the presence of tio2 titanium

demonstrating the ability of tio2 nanoparticles to survive acid treatment by aqua regia the xrd profile of carbonized glucose is shown as a control demonstrating an amorphous structure and the absence of well defined peaks 3 2 energy dispersive x ray spectrosopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy measurements were taken in order to corroborate xrd data and to estimate the atomic composition of our samples table 1 both glc zno and glc zno tio2 show a high weight percentage belonging to the nanoparticles 65 and 77 respectively with carbon and oxygen percentages at relatively low levels after acid treatment ntc and ntc tio2 both show the disappearance of zn with the carbon percent composition increasing for both while the oxygen content increased between glc zno tio2 and ntc tio2 it nearly quadrupled between glc zno and ntc this suggests that much of the oxygen content of ntc tio2 comes from titania nanoparticles present which remains largely unaltered during acid treatment while the removal of zno nanoparticles presents a clearer representation of the composition of our carbonaceous material alone the carbon to oxygen weight ratio of ntc c o 3 71 is much higher than that of commercial glucose 1 33 c o wt indicating the loss of large amounts of oxygen during the pyrolysis process with water and small cox molecules as the most likely byproducts the presence of chlorine in both ntc and ntc tio2 is postulated to be the result of hcl addition to alkenes formed during the pyrolysis process indicating the formation of sp2 carbons during the elimination of oxygen under anaerobic carbonization 3 3 scanning and transmission electron microscopy scanning electron microscopy images figure s1 show rough amorphous carbon particles containing crevices and macropores for both glc zno and glc zno tio2 after carbonization the porous nature of these materials is in stark contrast to the carbonized glucose control which contains very smooth carbon particles with no evident crevices or porosity removal of zno nanoparticles results in a more homogeneous material of smaller carbon particle size figure s1 b d transmission electron microscopy images of ntc and ntc tio2 fig 2 a b show porosities with an average diameter of approximately 15 nm for both materials which is in agreement with the 35 nm size of the zno nanoparticles used for nanotemplating elemental mapping for ntc figure s2 and ntc tio2 figure s3 can be seen in our supplemental material 3 4 small angle x ray scattering small angle x ray scattering measurements for ntc ntc tio2 and carbonized glucose control can be seen in fig 3 the control sample only shows surface scattering porod slope 4 off the large powder grains which levels out at high q to an amorphous carbon signal with no

spacing is also shorter for glucose noted by the shift to higher angle zno peaks in ntc and the anatase tio2 peak in ntc tio2 are similar to the xrd measurement comparison of the relative peak positions of anatase 101 and zno 100 in the glc zno tio2 sample in the xrd data with the scattering intensities of the corresponding peaks in the saxs measurement show a 28 fold decrease in the zno intensity in the ntc sample this shows most of the zno was removed with the acid treatment and the residual zno comprises 3 4 of the original zno amount before acid etching from a single measurement saxs does not differentiate between pores that are accessible and non accessible to the fluid in order to check how each nanostructure fills with fluid h2o immersion measurements were carried out fig 4 these measurements show a uniform shift to lower saxs intensity i q compared to the dry material reference curves for ntc water the intensity decrease is a factor of 4 5 consistent with complete filling of the porous carbon whereas for ntc tio2 water the decrease is approximately a factor of 3 consistent with a lower fraction of the porous matrix available for water adsorption compared to ntc polydisperse sphere ps distributions of the dry ntc and ntc tio2 materials show both materials contain a narrow distribution of spheres with diameters 5 nm and large sphere distribution with diameters of 20 30 nm fig 4b top the ntc tio2 is weighed toward larger sizes presumably due to tio2 nps that are slightly larger than the pores ps model of dry and h2o immersed ntc fig 4b middle show similar distributions near r 12 5 nm but the h2o immersed sample shows a slight increase at r 32 nm possibly due to the small fraction of zno particles that were not removed through the acid treatment the volume normalized pore size distribution for ntc shows there are pores with radius of 2 8 nm and 11 5 nm the larger pore size is more polydisperse than the small pore radius the ps model for ntc tio2 similarly has a small sphere distribution centered at 2 8 nm but the large sphere radius distribution though its peak is at the same position as for ntc is more heavily weighed at sphere radii greater than 12 nm this is likely due to the presence of tio2 nanoparticles which are likely larger than the large pore spaces of ntc 3 5 brunauer emmett teller and barrett joyner halenda measurements the bjh cumulative pore volume charts for ntc and ntc tio2 can be seen in fig 5 with a summary of brunauer emmet teller surface area analysis depicted in table 2 while the total surface area calculated for carbonized glucose was negligible ntc and ntc tio2 saw an increase to 302 and 230 m2 g respectively total pore volumes for ntc and ntc tio2 were 0 486 and 0 269 cm3 g respectively with 84 and 90 of the total pore volume belonging to pores in the range of 2 to 50 nm mesoporous as seen in table 2 it should be noted that ntc tio2 has lower bet surface area average pore diameter and total pore volume than ntc presumably due to the lower ratio of zno nanoparticles available for removal by acid which is directly responsible for the generation of porosity microporosities 2 nm are absent from these materials therefore adsorption capabilities for gases at stp would not be ideal however the average pore diameter of ntc 17 08 nm and ntc tio2 10 53 nm is ideal for the adsorption of small organic molecules in solution making them good candidates for water remediation of organics this can be seen in the kinetic profiles of our materials fig 7 3 6 adsorption measurements 3 6 1 adsorption capacities the adsorption capacity profiles for ntc ntc tio2 dark ntc tio2 uv and activated carbon against methylene blue ofloxacin and tetracycline at five different concentrations can be seen in fig 6 interestingly ntc tio2 dark had very similar adsorption capacities at most concentrations against methylene blue ofloxacin and tetracycline as ntc despite having a lower surface area this can be attributed to hydrogen bonding between these analytes and hydroxyls present in both the carbon material and tio2 nps as well as possible ionic interactions between the contaminants and these hydroxyls at ph 7 all three contaminants can interact with our carbonized materials through hydrophobic and π π interactions in much the same manner as they can with activated carbon of note is the higher adsorption photodegradation of these contaminants across most concentrations for ntc tio2 uv versus ntc tio2 dark this trend is directly attributed to ros generation by tio2 nps under uv light for ntc tio2 uv ultraviolet light can excite tio2 nps at or near the surface of our material thus generating highly reactive oxygen species which can degrade contaminants not only in the surrounding area but also those trapped in the material as well this liberates adsorption sites which can then adsorb more contaminant thus increasing the adsorption capacity over time it should also be noted that the adsorption capacities of ntc tio2 uv against these contaminants is comparatively similar to those of activated carbon at most concentrations 3 6 2 kinetic studies kinetic adsorption studies were performed for all four contaminants over seven time points 0 7 min 15 min 30 min 1 h 2 h and 4 h and can be seen in fig 7 ntc adsorbed all contaminants at a faster rate than a commercially available activated carbon control as can be seen from t 0 min across all contaminants ntc was capable of adsorbing 91 of a 50 ppm methylene blue solution within immediate contact 64 of ofloxacin and 43 tetracycline within the same time period this is in stark comparison to activated carbon which only adsorbed 70 methylene blue 17 ofloxacin and 40 tetracycline within the same time period within the first 7 min of contact ntc adsorption increased to 97 methylene blue 79 ofloxacin and 75 tetracycline adsorption of the contaminants onto ntc tio2 at 7 min is nearly equal under both dark and uv light conditions indicating that the decrease in contaminant concentration is initially due mostly to adsorption of the material not degradation by ros however as time progresses the percentage of each contaminant present in the solution decreases at a higher rate for ntc tio2 under uv light due to a combination of both adsorption by the material and photodegradation by reactive oxygen species this can be seen by the rapid increase in qe for ntc tio2 against all contaminants with adsorption values nearing or reaching those of our activated carbon control 4 conclusion in conclusion a new method to prepare nanocomposites of mesoporous carbon and tio2 nanoparticles with adsorption and photocatalytic function is reported the nanomaterial was prepared by the carbonization of glucose templated with zno tio2 nanoparticles and followed by the acid removal of zno leaving behind a mesoporous carbon matrix with tio2 the successful removal of zno nanoparticles after carbonization of glucose was proven by xrd edx and saxs bet surface area analysis and saxs experiments show the appearance of nanoscale porosities ranging from 2 8 nm ntc and 11 5 nm ntc tio2 according to saxs and 17 1 nm ntc and 10 5 nm ntc tio2 according to bjh analysis both ntc and ntc tio2 show fast adsorption profiles against methylene blue ofloxacin and tetracycline ph 7 50 ppm exposure of ntc tio2 to uv light results in a lower contaminant concentration in solution over 24 h than ntc despite ntc tio2 having lower porosity and surface area we believe this is the result of a combination of adsorption by ntc tio2 and photogeneration of ros which can degrade contaminants contained both in solution and adsorbed onto the material conflict of interest there are no financial personal conflicts of interest to report

14457,filtration processes constitute the major solution among water treatments which appear always necessary nowadays to make water suitable for human consumption or domestic uses due to the gradual deterioration of its quality as a consequence of environmental pollution and industrial processes in this paper a new type of filtering cartridge is presented aimed at overcoming the main inconveniences shown by usual commercial cartridges these drawbacks have been highlighted in a previous experimental work conducted in the laboratory of environmental and maritime hydraulics lidam of university of salerno and aimed at evaluating the head losses produced by the most common filtration cartridges especially under progressive clog conditions head losses in fact are particularly undesirable for low pressure plants where they can inhibit the normal operation of the installed apparatus the analysis of the experimental results permitted to reveal several features of the filtration process in commercial cartridges and draw up different remarks which led after further laboratory tests here presented to the design of a new economic non toxic low resistance and long life cycle filtration cartridge proposed and described in this paper this cartridge is basically made of a central element in inert cotton wrapped in a cylindrical polypropylene support similar to the commercial one but with the core protected by elements such as white marble pebbles effective microorganism ceramic cylinders and granular active coal which while ensuring a good hydraulic permeability is capable of stopping much of the particles suspended in the fluid before they reach the cartridge causing its clogging the new design permits therefore to significantly reduce compared with the commercial cartridges average head losses even for high clogging degrees and to increase as a consequence the life cycle of the cartridges keywords wound filter cartridge pressure drops in filters water treatment filter cartridge life cycle filter clogging head losses 1 introduction progressive pollution and environment degradation with consequent deterioration of water quality make absolutely necessary nowadays water treatments before human and domestic consumption among these filtration still represents the major solution almost all the domestic apparatus which make use of water are equipped with internal or installed with proper filtration elements increasingly efficient and innovative filtration systems have been adopted in recent years this paper presents a new type of filtration cartridge which has been implemented in order to overcome the main disadvantages shown by commercial cartridges adopted in drinking water networks an experimental hydraulic study previously conducted in the laboratory of environmental and maritime hydraulics lidam of university of salerno 1 3 on the head losses produced by the most common filtration cartridges available on the market in fact highlighted some inconvenient in the use of commercial cartridges whose assessment was the starting point for the development of a new mechanical filter specifically the new cartridge here proposed was designed to reduce as much as possible the head losses caused by the filter clogging and to increase therefore the life cycle of the cartridge in fact this duration depends on the quantity of substances that the cartridge retains on its outer surface and inside before reducing its filtering capacity and producing higher head losses this occurs with a prolonged use over time since the clogging particles leave less flow space to the fluid thus generating the necessity to replace the cartridge in order to design the new cartridge an ad hoc experimental campaign was performed in the lidam laboratory of university of salerno taking as reference small circuits such as the domestic ones where flow rates are of the order of tenths of a liter or at most some liters per second the behavior of the commercial and proposed cartridges with an increasing clogging rate was tested at the aim of measuring head losses and accomplish a deeper comprehension of the physical phenomena see also 4 the mechanical filters developed and tested in this work all consist of a central element in inert cotton wrapped in a cylindrical polypropylene support similar to the one of the common commercial cartridges and with the same function to stop the suspended particles present in the fluid to be filtered in laboratory tests 1 4 it has been shown that filter clogging is the main cause of the head losses increase for this reason it was decided to properly protect this cotton core with elements which while ensuring a good hydraulic permeability are capable of stopping much of the particles suspended in the fluid before they reach the cartridge causing its clogging and a considerable increase in head losses white marble pebbles em ceramic cylinders and granular active coal were used to protect the wadding core first one at a time thus making three different filtering cartridges and then all of them properly mixed for the final filter cartridge proposed in this paper all these materials are generally used for water treatment and in contact with each other form a continuous grain skeleton which is capable of incorporating in their structure particles of smaller size without impairing the hydraulic permeability and thus avoiding the undesirable pressure drops increase all the tested filters exhibit different head loss trends in relation to the progressive clogging rate due to the different filtration mechanisms but all of them guarantee even for high clogging degree average head losses significantly lower than those shown by the analyzed commercial cartridges this also solves the problem of their substitution in a short time the latter will no longer be necessary as the filters so designed and manufactured are able to withstand a large amount of suspended substances before they absorb their filter capacity resulting in longer durability in conclusion the proposed solution covered by a patent recently filed represents a valid option to avoid the limitations of the commercial cartridges the analysis of the materials to be used for the cartridge construction is illustrated in section 2 together with technical features and laboratory equipment the mechanical filters here built as well as the experimental conditions with the modalities of the progressive filter clogging and of the head losses evaluations are further detailed then the obtained results are presented in section 3 while an attentive analysis of them and of the filtration mechanisms is reported in section 4 the advantages of using the system compared to a generic commercial wrapped wire cartridge are discussed in sections 4 and 5 where also remarks on the correct implementation of the mechanical filters proposed therein are reported a photographic report is also proposed as ref 5 with the aim of allowing the reader to concretely view and better understand the process of filter clogging 2 experimental investigation materials and methods 2 1 materials and components the materials used to build the proposed filters are essentially stone ceramic plastic and activated carbon all of them being non toxic and therefore incapable of contaminating the drinking water they come into contact with 6 9 fine laboratory sand was also used to clog the filters below they are described in detail 2 1 1 white marble pebbles pebbles are the largest granulometry material used to make the filters proposed here in particular marble cobblestones with a diameter of 10 20 mm fig 1 were chosen the material was selected in such a way as to avoid elongated and flattened shapes which could by compacting and disposing in a preferential direction reduce the basic hydraulic permeability of the filter by increasing initial head losses this type of pebbles being made by a crusher from a calcium carbonate metamorphic rock are not able to absorb or release any substance to the fluid they are immersed a matter of primary importance for drinking water filters 2 1 2 em ceramic cylinders another material used for the filters tested here is a special commercial ceramic shaped as small discs with diameter of 8 mm and height of 4 mm fig 2 then smaller in size than the marble pebbles above described the cylindrical shape with a ratio radius height almost equal to one has been chosen again to avoid elongated shapes prevent interlocking cohesion phenomena and provide a greater hydraulic permeability this particular type of ceramic is obtained by fermentation of effective microorganisms em on a clay substrate gray porous pasta ceramics and it is a material with excellent adsorption capacity unchanged performance over time and not polluting thanks to an antioxidant and regenerating effect it is capable of eliminating methanogens and toxic pollutants formed as a result of the chemical breakdown process and tends to break down the bacterial load due to em or to adsorb undesirable substances due to porous ceramic 10 today em technology is an all powerful tool for disinfection of all waters worldwide and has excellent uses in numerous fields 2 1 3 activated carbon grains another component of the new filters is granular active carbon whose particles have the smallest size among the used materials in particular grains with a rounded shape and of different size 2 4 mm diameter were used fig 3 in order to avoid cohesion and poor hydraulic permeability thus reducing the pressure losses resulting from the filtration process this material has long been used for the production of water treatment cartridges since it is able to remove halogenated organic substances such as thrihalomethane and other dbp disinfestation products pesticides herbicides triazines chlorine and other substances that cause water alterations it is mainly composed of amorphous carbon which has a highly microporous structure and a very wide specific area and therefore is able to retain molecules of other substances inside it and for its high adsorption capacities it is suitable for a wide variety of treatment processes 11 12 2 1 4 synthetic inert cotton inert synthetic cotton was used to make the actual filtering septum in lieu of wire wounded commercial cartridges specifically this cotton is polyethylene terephthalate pet in polymer grains fig 4 a suitably worked and reduced to wadding a biologically inert and insoluble material which does not release substances removes waste of all kinds in suspension and makes the water clear 13 the optimum wadding has a filtration degree of 10 μm which however is reduced considerably with stiffening of the fibers during the realization of the filters therefore special care is devoted not to compress the fibers so as not to alter the filtering capacity and not cause an undesirable head losses increase in the laboratory activities it was made use of rolls produced by askoll group soft to the touch and white with a height of 25 cm so as to be able to easily wrap the wadding around a rigid support and place it inside the filter element instead of any commercial cartridge fig 4b the wadding is capable of absorbing large amounts of water thus increasing its surface for expansion of the interstices between the fibers this guarantees a good hydraulic permeability and consequently modest head losses but also causes a worsening of the ability to retain the impurities present in the fluid during this experimental activity then several overlapping wadding layers were wound to the polypropylene support in order to return a cartridge with good hydraulic permeability but at the same time with excellent ability to retain suspended particles 2 1 5 polypropylene slashed cylinder a 100 pure polypropylene cylinder with rectangular windows similar to the one of the wrapped wire commercial cartridges from which it has been obtained was used as a support for the pet cartridge built here fig 5 forming the inner core of the synthetic wrap filter in all the filters proposed here this element in the commercial cartridges can not be removed so once the filter is replaced it can not be retrieved in the proposed filters instead the wool is only wound to such support and therefore when necessary it can be easily replaced thereby allowing the cylinder to be used several times 2 1 6 fine sand fine sand was used to artificially and progressively clog the filters both commercial and ad hoc made in particular crushed sand was used an homogeneous inorganic material consisting of calcium carbonate particles of 0 10 mm size fig 6 well weighed the sand was added inside the cartridge holder by using water that poured from the top pushed down the sand progressively for each achieved clogging degree the resulting head losses were measured 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 measuring operations before carrying out the experiments a storage tank feeding the circuit 1 is filled up to a certain level 1 50 m referred to the floor to be kept constant during the tests in order to fix the water head upstream of the circuit to this level refer all the measurements taken during the laboratory activity in different tests the upstream shut off valve is closed in order to disconnect the filter container and each time the different cartridges artificially clogged with quantities of sand established a priori were inserted once set in position the filter was gradually put under water pressure by slowly opening the upstream shut off valve by doing so sand was gently pushed toward the filter surface and at this point the test began setting off the pump for each cartridge commercial ones and proposed ones with the different clogging degrees tests were performed for the three different circuit flow velocities corresponding to the three fixed curve modes set in the electronic pump in each scenario the pressure drops produced by the cartridges were measured 2 2 2 measuring instruments an electronic differential manometer was used to measure the pressure losses at the filter with higher accuracy than with the liquid column gauges along the circuit 3 specifically the pressure gauge is the 0 7 bar digitron 2023 p fig 7 a with 0 15 absolute accuracy connected to the circuit by joining with plastic tubes its two inlets with two derivations located upstream and downstream of the filter element respectively fig 7b in this way the pressure difference between these points which corresponds to the head loss due to the filter operation can be evaluated more in detail the pressure values correspond to the ensemble average of three measures taken in steady flow conditions reductions at the derivations were necessary to allow the connection between the manometer inlets external diameter 8 mm and the stainless steel pipes diameter 25 mm piezometers were also placed upstream and downstream of the filters for independent measurements of the produced head losses below 0 2 bar a sf 400 balance was used to accurately measure the amount of sand to be progressively introduced into the filters to clog them the same quantity of sand i e 20 g in fact was added each time to guarantee an appreciable variation in head losses to be recorded at each increment 2 3 analyzed filtration elements laboratory tests started with the assessment of the head losses of commercial cartridges for several clogging rates in particular wire wound cartridges have been used as they represent the most common type used for mechanical filtration of drinking water see also 1 once evaluated the pressure losses in optimum conditions that is at zero degree of clogging then the cartridge has been progressively clogged adding 20 g of sand at a time up to 300 g and evaluating for each increment the corresponding head losses the recorded values refer to the amount of sand that actually remained trapped in the cartridge so it was not considered the residual although minimal left inside the styrene acrylonitrile san resin container the process of sedimentation and absorption of the particles suspended in the liquid by the cartridge has in fact very long times incompatible with the activities to be carried out for this reason to rapidly increase the degree of actual clogging of the cartridges a small amount of food glue was used this substance allowed the sand to adhere to the outer surface of the cartridge and not to deposit to the bottom of the container so as to simulate an effective clogging of the filter once the circuit was in operation the glue used only to fix the sand to the filtering septum was shortly washed away being it soluble in water thus leaving only the sand deposited on the outer surface at this point the head losses related to the specific clogging degree were measured through the differential pressure gauge the results confirmed previous investigations obtained by using honey instead of food glue 1 below a description of the filter elements object of the experiments is given indicating the construction characteristics the operating modes the way the water flows into them and the interior sedimentation process of the particles suspended in water 2 3 1 commercial wire wound filter cartridge commercial wire wound filter cartridges of the type shown in fig 8 with an efficiency of 80 and a filtration degree of 50 μm were used in the laboratory tests fig 8 also provides some information about dimensions and weights as well as water flow pattern in the cartridge this type of cartridge is produced by wrapping a 3 mm thick wire on a slashed cylinder support both in 100 pure polypropylene non toxic and therefore suitable for the treatment of drinking or domestic water the fluid inlet is carried out laterally from the outer edge towards the inside of the cartridge by depositing in the filter the still dirty water which is thus pushed by the flow into the central duct and moves away from the filter without impurity the honeycomb texture allows to retain most of the suspended particles larger than the interstices on the surface of the filtering septum with prolonged use over time the store of substances on the outer surface and inside the cartridge causes a decrease in the hydraulic properties of the same leaving less transitory space to the fluid until the filtering septum is completely clogged to this extent a considerable increase in head losses and a reduction in the filtration capacity occur 1 14 18 wire wound filter cartridges fall into the category of deep filtration cartridges and are therefore not washable so they need to be replaced in a short time resulting in increased service costs and waste production this coupled with the high level of head losses also in modest clogging conditions are the limits found in this filtering element 2 4 built cartridge and filters the wire wound commercial cartridge limits were the starting point for the development of new mechanical filters designed precisely to reduce head losses even for high clogging values and increase their life time all the filters tested in this work consist of a central septum in pet inert wadding wrapped around a polypropylene cylindrical core an element that as any commercial cartridge has to stop the suspended particles present in the fluid to be filtered to limit and delay clogging the wadding core was properly protected and the volume involved in the filtration process was expanded fig 9 occupying in the new built filters the entire interior space of the cartridge holder and not just the central septum as for commercial cartridges the materials described above in section 2 1 have been used namely white marble pebbles em ceramic cylinders and granular active carbon 2 4 1 cartridge in inert synthetic wadding after having measured head losses for the commercial cartridge a new filter was made by replacing in the cartridge the polypropylene wire by pet cotton or synthetic inert wadding and the head loss exhibited by different clogging degrees and for the different pump velocities were evaluated the wadding is wrapped around the polypropylene slashed supporting cylinder as several layers overlapped with each other to create a spiral system capable of retaining even smaller particles fig 10 shows a picture of the proposed pet cartridge compared with the classic commercial wire wound one also giving information on the new cartridge size and materials used to make it while fig 11 contains pictures that illustrate its building process once built the cartridge head losses corresponding to a zero clog were registered subsequently the filtering septum was progressively and artificially clogged placing the sand at a rate of 20 g at a time up to 120 g directly between the overlapping wadding layers and to a lesser extent on the outer surface with honey and or food glue to ensure effective clogging of the sand at each increment of added sand and thus with the progressive clogging the corresponding head losses for each pump velocity were detected the cartridge was proved to be reproducible crucial condition for the marketing of the filter cartridges proposed here since once recreated it using the same cylinder and the same quantity of synthetic wadding the head losses were re evaluated under initial conditions and the obtained values were identical to those recorded on the cartridge previously built 2 4 2 filter 1 inert synthetic cotton cartridge and white marble pebbles at the aim of retaining as much sand as possible out of the cartridge thus limiting and delaying clogging and the associated head losses in the first proposed filter referred to in the following as filter 1 an outer radial layer composed of white marble pebbles section 2 1 1 of various sizes was added to the synthetic wadding cartridge section 2 4 1 randomly occupying the space between the cartridge and the san glass in the positioning of pebbles it is important not to compress the wadding so the pebbles would not be forcefully constrained in the glass but just dropped little by little freely until they cover all the available space between the cartridge and the filter holder this precaution is crucial as it provides a good voids distribution and a proper settling down before putting the filter into service this must be internally stable i e the position of the grains must not change over time in order to ensure this stone elements of bigger granulometry and weight have been placed on the top thus when the circuit is started the incoming liquid flow does not cause any change in the initial state without this technical precaution pebbles could be compressed and constipated by the input water in the filter or washed away by the outflow the schematic section in fig 12 a helps to better understand the composition of the filter fig 12b also shows a photo of the filter made in the laboratory and fig 12c reports information about the constructive features with quantities of the used material once the filter was completed and put into operation again the head losses were first evaluated under zero clogging conditions then the filter was clogged progressively by adding 20 g of fine sand for each increment from the top of the container and pushing it down using a small amount of water at the end of the clogging process the polypropylene core was recovered from the filter and reused also this cartridge was reproduced again and the initial head losses checked 2 4 3 filter 2 cartridge in inert synthetic wadding and em ceramic cylinders the pet cartridge was reproduced and the initial head losses calculated but in this second case it was used the em ceramic as protection of the pet filter thus realizing the filter denoted in the following as filter 2 as in the previous case the em discs introduced in the space between the cartridge holder and the filter septum should not be compressed but set up to occupy spontaneously the free spaces in order to reduce interlocking cohesion phenomena guarantee an adequate hydraulic permeability and ensure as lower head losses as possible fig 13 shows a schematic representation of the filter with a indication of the constituent elements b photo of the filter made in the laboratory c information about components materials and quantities for the proposed filter once built the filter and evaluated the initial head losses as for the previous filters it was progressively clogged with fine sand in quantities of 20 g at a time and the correspondent pressure drops were measured 2 4 4 filter 3 cartridge in inert synthetic wadding and granular active carbon to build the third proposed filter again the cartridge in inert synthetic wadding was rebuilt and the initial head losses measured to prove the perfect reproduction in this case the filtering septum was protected by activated carbon in grains which thanks to its high specific area and a very porous structure is able to retain molecules of other substances inside it the filter referred in the following as filter 3 therefore allows as filter 2 both water treatment and mechanical filtration a condition very difficult to find in standard commercial cartridges during the fabrication of the filter again the activated carbon should not be constipated but introduced in small quantities and piecemeal in the space between the filter cartridge and the san glass fig 14 shows a a schematic representation of the filter element under consideration with its different components b a photo of the built filter and c some information about its constructive features the filter was again progressively clogged with addition of 20 g of sand at a time from the top with water permeated downwards inside the filter in this case the clogging process was much slower and much more water was used than in the previous case as the small size of the particles and then of the voids made the insertion of sand very difficult 2 4 5 sand clogging limit during the laboratory activities the maximum values of head losses to which the built filters should tend were sought in the condition that all the available voids between the grains were occupied by the added sand these values were obtained by recreating these condition by means of a specially designed filter a new pet cartridge identical to the previous ones was then built but in this case only fine sand was added in the space between the filter and the san glass fig 15 it would have been very difficult to achieve this condition of all voids completely occupied by sand in the filters described above because in them the sand is added with increasing difficulty as the clogging degree rises due to the progressive reduction of voids and hydraulic permeability of the medium additionally the reciprocal settling down of the grains to protect the cartridge creates areas where the sand could not penetrate anyway to recreate the clogging limit a total of 800 g of sand was added and subsequently the head losses corresponding to the three fixed speed values of the pump were evaluated 2 4 6 filter 4 inert synthetic wadding cartridge white marble pebbles em ceramic cylinders and granular active carbon the fourth and last filter referred to in the following as filter 4 was designed based on the results obtained in the previous cases it has been specifically sought to put in place a filter capable of displaying low head losses for both low and medium clogging values this result was obtained by combining all the materials used to make the filters described above in particular marble pebbles were used which have a greater granulometry and hence a larger voids size than the other elements and then they yield a greater hydraulic permeability with low head losses for a low clogging degree then em ceramic flakes and granular active carbon were also used which in addition to retaining the sand and preventing it from reaching the cartridge quickly by virtue of the porous structure and its adsorptive abilities purify the water and neutralize harmful molecules and smells also improving its appearance again in this case the first step was the realization of the cartridge in inert synthetic wadding all the materials used appropriately dosed were previously mixed together to ensure a distribution as homogeneous as possible to facilitate its ingrowth and maximize the ability to retain the sand to be filtered the three mixed components were subsequently poured into the cartridge holder box also in this case without being constipated but allowing them to fall freely in their dedicated space the assessment of the quantities of the various elements to be used for the filter construction was carried out in relation to the head losses that the latter would have to guarantee in particular the amount of marble pebbles has been increased until in zero clogging conditions the head losses were conveniently low estimated this amount the other elements were added later until completely filling the space between the san glass and the wadding cartridge fig 16 shows a the various parts of the filter b a photo of the filter made in laboratory and c the constructive features with the quantities of materials used to make it as in the previous cases after completing the construction and putting the filter into service it was progressively clogged by adding 20 g of sand each time from the top and measuring for each of these increments the corresponding head losses for the three different fixed speed curves of the pump 3 results of the experimental investigation in this section the results of the laboratory tests conducted on the filter elements above described are presented in particular graphs with the trends of the obtained head losses for the various filters in relation to the progressively added sand are reported for each of the three fixed curve speeds of the electronic pump 3 1 commercial wrapped wire cartridge and inert synthetic wadding cartridge first the results of the investigations carried out on the wrapped wire commercial cartridges are presented in terms of head losses δp in mbar respective to the measurements obtained both from previous experiences 1 4 in which honey was used to help clogging the filter and from the experiments conducted in this work making use of food glue the plot in fig 17 shows the trend of the results in terms of increase of head losses as the sand is progressively added i e as the clogging degree increases for the three velocities of the pump and the two experimental scenarios also in comparison with the results obtained with the simple inert synthetic wadding cartridge looking only at the results related to the commercial cartridge it can be noticed that for low and intermediate velocities in the circuit head losses are significantly less than those exhibited for maximum velocity in a first step up to the first 20 g of added sand the losses vary slightly then the slopes of the curves increase for all the three velocities the peak in terms of head losses is recorded at the maximum circulator velocity and for a clog degree of about 60 g of sand in addition the data obtained by using honey or food glue are very similar especially for low and intermediate velocities the only difference found in the use of these two substances is that honey started the water flow in the circuit washed away more quickly than food glue thus causing more detachment of sand from the cartridge and thus slightly less actual clogging with the same added sand this check was conducted to verify and assess whether the glue used to fix the sand on the filtering septum would affect the results and give rise to different head losses it is proved that the head losses trend in the cartridge does not depend on the material but only on the achieved degree of clogging and on the pump speed therefore for the comparisons of the head losses in the different filters reported in the following it was only referred to the values obtained by clogging the cartridges with honey comparing these results with the ones obtained with inert synthetic wadding for progressive clogging up to 120 g it can be noticed that the curves have a similar pattern however the cartridge made in the laboratory has in general lower head losses than a generic wound wire cartridge so it can be concluded that the built filtering septum is more efficient than the commercial ones the commercial cartridge for example reaches for 80 g of added fine sand and at the maximum circulating velocity a pressure loss of about 86 5 mbar whereas the cartridge proposed here reaches this value for a higher degree of clogging greater than 90 g the new cartridge therefore requires 10 g of sand more to exhibit the same head loss 3 2 new filters the results obtained with filters 1 2 3 and 4 are reported graphically in fig 18 in terms of head losses for the three pump velocities respectively and for progressive clogging of the filter with 20 g of sand each time up to 300 g in comparison against the ones obtained with the commercial cartridge for filter 1 the head loss trend with the increase of added sand is almost linear for the three pump velocities for filter 2 the trend can be tripartite for all three velocities as follows at an initial stage up to 120 g of added sand the curves grow linearly then there is an interval between 120 and 220 g of sand where the head losses trend is sub horizontal i e increasing the amount of sand head losses almost do not change in the final part between 220 and 300 g of introduced sand there is again a linear increase in the head losses with a greater slope than in the first segment as for the filter 3 trend of head losses in relation to the increasing clogging degree for the three different pump velocities at an initial stage approximately up to 200 g of inserted sand head losses are little affected by the presence of sand subsequently exceeding this value there is a noticeable increase of the head losses and hence a sharp increase in the curve slope in comparison with the head losses exhibited by the commercial filter the benefit in terms of pressure drops and then of durability is remarkable for the three filters it can be noticed for example how filter 1 shows the same 73 2 mbar head loss that the commercial filter manifests for maximum speed at 60 g of clogging only at 300 g of added sand this means that the commercial filter should be replaced much earlier since for low clogging values it shows great losses whereas the proposed filters are also efficient at high levels of clogging so they ensure a longer duration in time the comparison with the simple wadding cartridge fig 18 where the commercial filter is only wrapped with wadding shows the advantage of protecting the cartridge with marble ceramic or carbon material again proved by lower head losses and longer life time in fact for example at the maximum speed where head losses are higher filter 1 achieves the same head losses that the wadding cartridge reaches for 80 g at about 300 g of added sand summarizing the three filters are realized starting from the same cartridge in synthetic wadding and then protecting it with materials of different nature and size the filter made with pebbles filter 1 material with the biggest granulometry among the used ones guarantees minimal head losses at both initial and maximum clogging conditions but exhibits maximum head losses in the central zone of the chart so for an average clogging degree precisely for values between 120 and 260 g of added sand the filter made with activated carbon filter 3 i e with the material among those used with the smaller grain size returns inverted results minimum head losses in the central zone for added sand values between 120 and 240 g and maximum head losses at clogging degrees zero and maximum i e in the initial and final zones of the chart the filter made using the em ceramic filter filter 2 intermediate size component among the used materials both in the initial and final phase exhibits pressure losses higher than filter 1 and smaller than filter 3 whereas in the center of the graph it shows pressure losses higher than filter 3 and lower than filter 1 finally filter 4 made by combining the various granular elements for low clogging values produces very small head losses greater only to those related to filter 1 and for average clogging values it has head losses higher only respect to filter 3 but lower than those of filter 2 and much smaller respect to filter 1 filter 4 tends to the minimum values in terms of head losses both for a low and a medium degree of clogging finally the head losses found for 300 g of added sand are still very small and greater only respect to the filter made with marble pebbles this suggests the use of a greater amount of such elements for the realization of the final version of filter 4 the smaller the size of the material moving from filter 1 to filter 3 the higher the head losses for low values of added sand the advantage in using smaller grains becomes evident for high values of filter clogging particularly at about 80 100 g of sand introduced where filter 3 returns the lowest values of head losses with the progressive clogging up to a considerable degree of clogging corresponding to approximately 240 260 g of added sand however the results obtained by adding such amounts of sand are interesting for analyzing the various filtration mechanisms but represent little significant data since a filter would be cleaned or replaced before reaching such high clogging values manufacturers of drinking water filter cartridges in fact recommend replacing cartridges on average after three months of use filter 3 can be considered therefore advantageous since it causes low head losses for low and medium clogging values conditions which really occur in the life cycle of the cartridge table 1 shows the experimental data in terms of head losses for the three velocity values related to the filter made to simulate the condition of maximum clogging by sand section 2 4 5 i e in which the introduced sand occupies all the voids present between the interstices of the materials used to protect the cartridge it is noted how filter 3 is the filter which shows the head loss values closest to the ones reported in table 1 since it is the one among the proposed filters which gives the smaller void size finally the head losses trends for filter 4 show that in this case there are no stalemate areas for head losses but the trends are almost linear with a steady slope and the variations in head losses are well distributed from the lowest clogging values up to the highest ones filter 4 compared to a generic commercial wire wound cartridge once again allowed to obtain sparing pressure losses also with a high degree of clogging with a consequent benefit in terms of durability comparing the head losses trends of filter 4 with the ones of filter 3 it can be seen that the mix of materials selected for the realization of the final filter which contains a big amount of marble pebbles allowed to significantly lower the values of the head losses at the initial and final stage of the graph however this caused a slight rise still acceptable in the head losses in the central zone where instead filter 3 made only with activated carbon grains retains better the added sand so as to prevent it from reaching the cartridge and return therefore reduced head losses in comparison with filter 2 the trend of filter 4 does not deviate significantly only for the maximum velocity filter 4 exhibits for low clogging values less pressure drops the pressure drops are very similar because in filter 4 the mixing of the different elements creates a grain skeleton very similar to that of filter 2 made with material of intermediate granulometry between pebbles and active carbon grains however the general trend of the curves is not the same in fact filter 2 shows the tripartite pattern described above hence initial increase in head losses sub horizontal central phase and final stage with losses linear raise the pressure loss trend of filter 4 is instead rather linear finally the comparison of the head loss trends for filter 4 and filter 1 highlights that the curves are for both linear and increasing filter 4 however exhibits lower gradients and therefore lower increments in head losses as the clogging level increases in conclusion filter 4 appears very effective because for any clogging rate it exhibits overall pressure losses lower compared to the other proposed filters combining properly the various components in filter 4 led therefore to satisfactory results because the advantage of the more coarse fraction for low clogging degrees and the advantage of the finest elements for intermediate clogging degrees are merged 4 discussion of the results 4 1 analysis of the head losses trends the different behaviors of the filters can be explained by observing from the transparent walls of the filter container see the photographic documentation in ref 5 the evolution of the process in filter 1 for example the pebbles showed a poor ability to retain the sand and then to protect the filter in the clogging process they place themselves in the space between the cartridge and the filter holder with very low gear leaving many empty spaces that are immediately filled with sand the sand even adding the least amount of water immediately deposited on the glass bottom and quickly clogged the cartridge this phenomenon starting from the bottom where the sand deposited initially proceeded with parallel levels towards the top until all the interstices were occupied by the introduced grains as a consequence the introduced sand produces an increase in head losses however since the pebbles do not hold properly the sand they return a very permeable solid skeleton and then permit to keep head losses relatively low in filter 2 unlike filter 1 clogging does not proceed from the bottom up but horizontally by level the introduced sand has therefore a different preferential direction and is no longer able to reach the bottom but moves towards the edges particularly toward the outer edge or to the interface between the cartridge holder and the ceramic discs migrating later towards the filtering septum the outer edge of the filter appears to have a greater amount of voids than the wadding discs interface which is almost without voids in fact being the wadding soft it fits very well to the surface of the discs initial head losses can be attributed therefore to the minimum amount of sand that moving horizontally into the space between the cartridge and the holder pushed by the current instead of reaching the outer edge reaches the cartridge the stalemate phase on the other hand corresponds to the time when the introduced sand fills the voids between the discs i e the space between the cartridge and the holder finally in the third stage the interstices between the particles are saturated and therefore additional added sand creates pressures on the wadding cartridge that will be reached from other sand with a consequent increase in head losses the filter 3 trend can be explained by the fact that it shows from the first grams of added sand a greater resistance than the other filters previously proposed since the active carbon grains retain the sand very well and do not let it flow to the cartridge in the first phase therefore the head losses do not have large variations when sand is added because it does not reach the cartridge but it remains trapped between the grains and in part migrates towards the outer edge or towards the cartridge holder granular carbon interface thus as for filter 2 the outer area is the one with more voids due to the low adhesion between grains and the smooth surface of the cartridge holder it is therefore the region where water migrates more easily in the final part of the curve after the 260 g of added sand all the interstices are saturated and the migration of sand forced by the circulating water towards the cartridge begins resulting in increased head losses generated by the filter the comparison of filter 2 with filter 1 shows that as the size of the material used for the cartridge protection is smaller than in filter 1 the losses in filter 2 are initially larger because at 0 g of added sand smaller pieces leave less voids resulting in increased water resistance however in the interval between about 120 260 g filter 2 produces significantly lower head losses than filter 1 whereas in the final segment the head losses of filter 2 are again higher this behavior can be explained by the greater ability of the ceramic to retain the sand respect to the marble pebbles larger volumes of water were needed even to introduce the minimum amount of fine sand due to the smaller dimensions of the ceramic elements which guarantees a better distribution and a smaller size of the voids this in response to a slight increase in initial head losses due to the lower hydraulic permeability of the medium returns a filter capable of more effectively retaining the suspended particles em ceramic discs constitute a more effective protection for the central filtration septum since it is clogged with sand in times longer than those required for the previous filter with consequent lower head losses filter 2 has also the ability to combine mechanical filtration and water treatment two conditions that are typically carried out by different products during this experience it was noted as well that by compressing the wadding the head losses increased in comparison with filter 2 filter 3 manifests higher head losses initially in no clogging conditions in fact the small sized grains make water passage more difficult as they leave less voids however activated carbon grains recreate many overlapping radial layers in the interposed area between the cartridge and the san container thus blocking very well the permeation of the sand and preventing it from reaching the cartridge as a result in the middle part of the chart the filter has lower losses than those of the filter made with ceramic discs which retains less sand finally appreciable head losses for filter 3 are only reached at a high degree of clogging due to the smaller amount of voids compared to the other materials the differences in head losses with filter 1 are instead very marked specifically under zero clogging conditions without any sand addition filter 1 has very little head losses compared to filter 3 this gap is decreasing with higher losses for filter 1 until the first 80 100 g of added sand after this value in fact it is the activated carbon filter that shows lower head losses up to 240 260 g of added sand therefore the advantage of using larger cobs extends to about 80 g of sand introduced into the filter as the benefit derived from the higher water permeability is counteracted by the rapid clogging of the cartridge the advantage in using activated carbon is instead evident by average clogging values up to 260 g of added sand after this value the interstices are already saturated and therefore there are considerable increases in head losses i e filter 3 exhibits greater head losses than filter 1 due as before to the lower presence of voids i e to the lower hydraulic permeability of the medium 4 2 identified filtration mechanisms from the experimental evidences correlations were found between the head losses trends showed by the filters for the different clogging degrees and the constructive characteristics of the filters themselves which determines a different way of depositing sand inside the filter and thus a different clogging mechanisms for the filters first of all the water flow that reaches and passes through a filtering septum splits into smaller flows so that it can cross the fibers of which the septum is made the suspended particles therefore undergo a number of changes in direction until they are trapped depending on the type of filter fig 19 in the specific case to model the filtration process reference is made to the sieve mechanism 13 this type of mechanism occurs when the diameter of the suspended materials is greater than the distance between the fibers and therefore the particles fail to cross the septum the larger particles deposit on the first layers of the filter element while the minutest ones can pass to the innermost layers the spongy structure result of the building process of the wadding used for the pet cartridge allows the bulk of particles suspended in water to be retained on the filtering surface although the cartridge can only retain particles larger than the minimum size of its interstices with prolonged use over time accumulation of suspended particles will cause a decrease in the hydraulic properties of the cartridge leaving less transitory space to the fluid until the filtering septum is completely clogged by the solid particles extracted from the liquid at this point as shown by the experimental results there is a considerable increase in head losses besides the filtering mechanism it is important to define also the way in which the different filters reach the maximum clogging observing the manner in which the sand added from time to time is deposited inside fig 20 the identified mechanisms are mainly three fig 21 the first filtration mechanism 1 fm1 concerns the filter made using white marble pebbles the second filtration mechanism 2 fm2 with appropriate variations refers to the filter made with em ceramic and to the one with granular activated carbon the third filtration mechanism 3 fm3 occurs in the final filter made by combining all the granular elements in the first detected mechanism fm1 which interests filter 1 the filter clogging proceeds from the bottom upwards specifically given the high permeability of the skeleton formed by the marble grains for the large size of the voids the sand flowing from the top where it is introduced does not encounter any obstacle and proceeds undisturbed to the bottom of the glass the pictures show a progressive increase in the clogging degree for horizontal planes 5 thus the cartridge is poorly protected as sand comes to it from the first quantities introduced the described mechanism is associated with an almost linear and growing trend of the head losses as the clogging increases the use of a highly permeable material such as marble pebbles therefore gives poor protection against the filtering clogging and a consequent immediate increase in pressure drops however it is also able to guarantee at the initial stage the minimum detected head losses in the second mechanism fm2 occurring both in filter 2 and filter 3 fig 21b the clogging proceeds instead from the outer edge to the inside then starting from the cartridge glass until it reaches the pet filtration septum the sand added from time to time flowing through the interstices of the granular material pushed by the circulating water proceeds to the direction which has the least resistance to transit that is the one in which the presence of voids is higher in the specific case to the filter container outer walls which are smooth and regular and therefore unable to adapt to the shape of the granular elements the spongy texture of the filtering septum on the other hand perfectly adheres to the shapes of the material placed in the protection of the same returning a small amount of voids and creating a zone less permeable than the outer edge thus two distinct zones are created one interior at the interface between the spongy material and the grain skeleton characterized by a low presence of voids and one outside close to the pet glass and made of the granular elements characterized by a high hydraulic permeability the two zones are respectively separated from em ceramic cylinders in the case of filter 2 and from granular active carbon in the case of filter 3 the grain skeleton formed from filter 2 presents given the larger dimensions of the particles a greater presence of voids and therefore the sand proceeding from the outer edge towards the cartridge is only partly stopped depositing in the interstices of the solid skeleton of the granular material whereas the other part goes to the cartridge thus being responsible for the head losses detected at the initial stage of the clogging process by keeping adding sand there is a slight increase in pressure losses as in this second phase the sifted sand is saturating the voids between the grains and therefore can not reach the cartridge in the final part of the process there is a considerable increase in head losses corresponding to the progressive clog of the cartridge the mechanism just described is associated with the tripartite graph described in section 3 the activated carbon even smaller in size than the em ceramic stops almost totally the incoming sand not allowing it to reach the septum and it is able therefore to prevent the increase of pressure losses this second just described clogging mode is associated with a pressure trend distinguished by a low slope starting segment characterized by a modest increase in head losses and from a high slope end section where on the contrary there is a sudden increase of the drops the third identified mechanism fm3 affects filter 4 fig 21c it is completely analogous to the first presented with respect to filter 1 but the direction must be inverted because the sand introduced from time to time in this case saturates the voids between the interstices of the solid skeleton by proceeding from top to bottom this is due to the less permeability of the medium which retains the sand by preventing it from flowing deep into the filter the sand progressively added from the top of the san holder by the inlet water flow exerting pressure on the underlying layers pushes more and more deeper the sand already deposited between the interstices of the skeleton reaching the bottom of the glass condition corresponding to the maximum clogging of the filter 5 new cartridge design 5 1 technical precautions for the correct implementation of mechanical filters after the analysis of the experimental results some remarks can be pointed out regarding the technical implementation of the proposed cartridges in fact these filters are only effective if equipped with some specifications such as internal stability open porosity rounded shape of the materials placed as protection for the filters adequate hydraulic permeability non cementing components adequate grain settling and so on all the material used in combination with the inert synthetic pet wadding for the realization of the various filters as said before are able to incorporate in their granular structure smaller particles without impairing the hydraulic permeability a property that guided the search and the choice of such materials used to protect the filtering septum is the porosity fig 21 generally defined as the ratio between the volume of voids or pores and the total volume of the material depending on the size and distribution of pores the mechanism responsible for the diffusion of matter changes together with the characteristics and phenomena associated with it in fact in this case what affects the filtration process is not the porosity of the single element related to its adsorption capacity but the porosity of the solid skeleton formed by aggregation of various grains of different materials but considered as a whole medium 19 20 the suspended particles can move transported by the fluid in the adjacent pores if they are sufficiently small i e if the narrow gorges connecting two or more interstices of the main skeleton are larger than the embedded particles the re created skeleton must be permeable only to the fluid to be treated i e water in the specific case but not to the suspended particles which must be appropriately retained in order not to reach the filtering septum the different granular materials of different dimensions when combined return a solid skeleton having different sizes of the voids too fig 22 the permeability of the skeleton which unlike porosity is a vector represents its ability to be crossed by fluids is affected by factors related to the characteristics essentially to the microscopic structure for example curvature and pore size of the porous medium and appears as a constant of proportionality in the darcy s law between the pressure gradient and the discharge 14 21 porosity and permeability are therefore two properties that although correlated are distinct and not to be confused since a single carbon grain is for example porous and non permeable the solid skeleton formed by the aggregation of more grains of the same material is instead porous and permeable fig 23 19 22 the design and building of the filters is essential to ensure an adequate permeability of the solid grain skeleton a granular filter such as the one created in the proposed cartridges has to be also internally stable in order to be efficient i e its structure must not undergo variations in time settlements or reciprocal displacements between grains that may vary the distribution and size of the voids this condition has been guaranteed by the use of large scale stone material which placed in correspondence with the filter element ring inhibits by exercising a slight pressure on the underlying elements the reciprocal movements between the grains thus ensuring the stability required for the solid skeleton however it is also necessary to avoid the so called cohesion by interlocking a phenomenon linked to the elongated form of the particles preferring rounded grains in order to favor hydraulic permeability and to avoid the arrangement of grains in parallel filaments finally another required property is that the different used granular materials must be non cementing i e not soluble in water cementation is in fact one of the mechanisms occurring together with the sedimentation and consists in the precipitation of substances brought to solution from the circulating waters to the pores of the sediment the process of lithification that is of transformation of an inconsistent sediment into a coherent or high consistency one can occur with mechanical actions reduction of pores generally occupied by water or air by means of mechanical compression resulting in a reduction in volume and chemical reactions further reduction in volume as interstitial waters determines the precipitation of the substances contained in sediment pores each filter made using grain material and therefore also the proposed filters exhibits a clogging limit a condition analogous to that rebuilt in the laboratory in which the pores of the coarsest material are gradually occluded by the particles of the finer material to a level that prevents hydraulic efficiency to this extent it is necessary to clean it if possible or to replace it immediately the use of materials with the aforementioned properties and the steps to be taken in implementation described in this section are necessary conditions for making mechanical filters such as those proposed capable of yielding moderate head losses even at high degrees of clogging and much longer lasting than normal cartridges 5 2 advantages and properties of the new proposed filters in fig 24 an axonometric explosion of the proposed system and a detailed image of the container designed to accommodate granular elements are reported the main advantage of this new designed and built cartridge is that it is capable of ensuring low head losses this last aspect is not to be underestimated for example in the case of dwellings on the top of a building in which the input pressure may not be sufficient for the operation of the various water appliances if the filter element has a great impact on the plant the new filter here proposed can guarantee reduced pressure losses in all working conditions thus avoiding this inconvenience even in the presence of waters with many suspended elements or dissolved substances in fact it is demonstrated to provide average head losses significantly lower than those shown by the analyzed commercial cartridges even for high levels of clogging this also resolves the problem of a substitution in a short time the filter so designed and manufactured is able to withstand a large amount of suspended particles before annulling its filtering capacity so high clogging values are reached in longer operating times and as a result the filter lasts longer to this feature it has to be added the combined action of mechanical filtration and water treatment difficult to find on the market as the various currently available products act selectively by resolving the proposed issues individually another noteworthy factor is the advantage in economic terms which concerns both the individual materials used for the various filters and the management of the filter itself concerning the former 1 kg of white pebble actually sells for just 080 eur the activated carbon grains range from 6 to 10 eur per kg while em ceramic cylinders despite featuring the highest price 50 60eur per kg have the advantage to be reused for up to 10 years about the latter aspect the modified cartridge can be used for period up to one order of magnitude longer respect to the commercial products i e featuring a lifecycle of 5 6 years depending on the progressive clogging of the outer region of the filter the reduced cost of the various components with reference to this time horizon makes the filters very economical additionally the long lasting life and efficiency make the replacement not required in short periods with a further benefit in terms of labor and costs the proposed filters are also ecologically compatible in fact being composed of natural elements they are simple to dispose of in the case in which they have to be replaced lastly the new cartridge has an excellent chemical compatibility with foods drinks drinking water and chemical solvents and therefore it shows a great versatility and can be used extensively the proposed solution not only solves the before mentioned limitations of the commercial cartridges but also present additional properties and benefits which justify its selection all these advantages are summarized in table 2 the only disadvantage found is the implementation as this is more articulate and demanding than a simple replacement of a generic commercial cartridge however this problem may be easily solved by using a specially designed plastic slashed holder of the type similar to that used for the commercial cartridge support suitably shaped so as to fit perfectly inside the san glass and leave a special vacuum in the center useful for receiving any filter cartridge or septum by introducing the grain elements inside this container it would be possible to guarantee the internal stability required for the solid skeleton for optimum operation of the filter and at the same time a quicker and easier installation the container was not used during laboratory tests it was designed later and has as its sole purpose to simplify the process of making the filtering cartridge as reproducible as possible in this way the same simplicity and immediacy in the implementation of the commercially available cartridges would be reproduced since the realization of the filter would reduce to insert in the interior of this special container the various pre packaged and ready to use elements 6 conclusions and future perspectives the experimental activity carried out in this work permitted to draw up some useful remarks on the filtering cartridges aimed at proposing innovative long lasting in time and economic systems capable of ensuring low head losses significantly lower than those produced by commercial cartridges even in high clogging conditions the experiments in fact led to the design of a versatile cartridge and the selection of a proper combination of various granular materials for the proper protection of the filter from the clogging effects this benefit of inducing low pressure drops may be particularly relevant in low pressure plants and allows for longer operating times of the cartridge the proposed filtering cartridge also presents advantages in economic terms both for the reduced cost of the materials and various components and for the long lasting life and efficiency which make the replacement not required in short periods it is also ecologically compatible in fact it is composed of natural elements simple to dispose of when they have to be replaced to this feature it has to be added the combined action of mechanical filtration and water treatment difficult to find on the market in a single filter cartridge the new cartridge has also an excellent chemical compatibility with foods drinks drinking water and chemical solvents and therefore it has a great versatility and can be used extensively the proposed solution covered by a recently filed patent not only solves the limitations of the commercial cartridges but also present additional benefits which justify its use 
14457,filtration processes constitute the major solution among water treatments which appear always necessary nowadays to make water suitable for human consumption or domestic uses due to the gradual deterioration of its quality as a consequence of environmental pollution and industrial processes in this paper a new type of filtering cartridge is presented aimed at overcoming the main inconveniences shown by usual commercial cartridges these drawbacks have been highlighted in a previous experimental work conducted in the laboratory of environmental and maritime hydraulics lidam of university of salerno and aimed at evaluating the head losses produced by the most common filtration cartridges especially under progressive clog conditions head losses in fact are particularly undesirable for low pressure plants where they can inhibit the normal operation of the installed apparatus the analysis of the experimental results permitted to reveal several features of the filtration process in commercial cartridges and draw up different remarks which led after further laboratory tests here presented to the design of a new economic non toxic low resistance and long life cycle filtration cartridge proposed and described in this paper this cartridge is basically made of a central element in inert cotton wrapped in a cylindrical polypropylene support similar to the commercial one but with the core protected by elements such as white marble pebbles effective microorganism ceramic cylinders and granular active coal which while ensuring a good hydraulic permeability is capable of stopping much of the particles suspended in the fluid before they reach the cartridge causing its clogging the new design permits therefore to significantly reduce compared with the commercial cartridges average head losses even for high clogging degrees and to increase as a consequence the life cycle of the cartridges keywords wound filter cartridge pressure drops in filters water treatment filter cartridge life cycle filter clogging head losses 1 introduction progressive pollution and environment degradation with consequent deterioration of water quality make absolutely necessary nowadays water treatments before human and domestic consumption among these filtration still represents the major solution almost all the domestic apparatus which make use of water are equipped with internal or installed with proper filtration elements increasingly efficient and innovative filtration systems have been adopted in recent years this paper presents a new type of filtration cartridge which has been implemented in order to overcome the main disadvantages shown by commercial cartridges adopted in drinking water networks an experimental hydraulic study previously conducted in the laboratory of environmental and maritime hydraulics lidam of university of salerno 1 3 on the head losses produced by the most common filtration cartridges available on the market in fact highlighted some inconvenient in the use of commercial cartridges whose assessment was the starting point for the development of a new mechanical filter specifically the new cartridge here proposed was designed to reduce as much as possible the head losses caused by the filter clogging and to increase therefore the life cycle of the cartridge in fact this duration depends on the quantity of substances that the cartridge retains on its outer surface and inside before reducing its filtering capacity and producing higher head losses this occurs with a prolonged use over time since the clogging particles leave less flow space to the fluid thus generating the necessity to replace the cartridge in order to design the new cartridge an ad hoc experimental campaign was performed in the lidam laboratory of university of salerno taking as reference small circuits such as the domestic ones where flow rates are of the order of tenths of a liter or at most some liters per second the behavior of the commercial and proposed cartridges with an increasing clogging rate was tested at the aim of measuring head losses and accomplish a deeper comprehension of the physical phenomena see also 4 the mechanical filters developed and tested in this work all consist of a central element in inert cotton wrapped in a cylindrical polypropylene support similar to the one of the common commercial cartridges and with the same function to stop the suspended particles present in the fluid to be filtered in laboratory tests 1 4 it has been shown that filter clogging is the main cause of the head losses increase for this reason it was decided to properly protect this cotton core with elements which while ensuring a good hydraulic permeability are capable of stopping much of the particles suspended in the fluid before they reach the cartridge causing its clogging and a considerable increase in head losses white marble pebbles em ceramic cylinders and granular active coal were used to protect the wadding core first one at a time thus making three different filtering cartridges and then all of them properly mixed for the final filter cartridge proposed in this paper all these materials are generally used for water treatment and in contact with each other form a continuous grain skeleton which is capable of incorporating in their structure particles of smaller size without impairing the hydraulic permeability and thus avoiding the undesirable pressure drops increase all the tested filters exhibit different head loss trends in relation to the progressive clogging rate due to the different filtration mechanisms but all of them guarantee even for high clogging degree average head losses significantly lower than those shown by the analyzed commercial cartridges this also solves the problem of their substitution in a short time the latter will no longer be necessary as the filters so designed and manufactured are able to withstand a large amount of suspended substances before they absorb their filter capacity resulting in longer durability in conclusion the proposed solution covered by a patent recently filed represents a valid option to avoid the limitations of the commercial cartridges the analysis of the materials to be used for the cartridge construction is illustrated in section 2 together with technical features and laboratory equipment the mechanical filters here built as well as the experimental conditions with the modalities of the progressive filter clogging and of the head losses evaluations are further detailed then the obtained results are presented in section 3 while an attentive analysis of them and of the filtration mechanisms is reported in section 4 the advantages of using the system compared to a generic commercial wrapped wire cartridge are discussed in sections 4 and 5 where also remarks on the correct implementation of the mechanical filters proposed therein are reported a photographic report is also proposed as ref 5 with the aim of allowing the reader to concretely view and better understand the process of filter clogging 2 experimental investigation materials and methods 2 1 materials and components the materials used to build the proposed filters are essentially stone ceramic plastic and activated carbon all of them being non toxic and therefore incapable of contaminating the drinking water they come into contact with 6 9 fine laboratory sand was also used to clog the filters below they are described in detail 2 1 1 white marble pebbles pebbles are the largest granulometry material used to make the filters proposed here in particular marble cobblestones with a diameter of 10 20 mm fig 1 were chosen the material was selected in such a way as to avoid elongated and flattened shapes which could by compacting and disposing in a preferential direction reduce the basic hydraulic permeability of the filter by increasing initial head losses this type of pebbles being made by a crusher from a calcium carbonate metamorphic rock are not able to absorb or release any substance to the fluid they are immersed a matter of primary importance for drinking water filters 2 1 2 em ceramic cylinders another material used for the filters tested here is a special commercial ceramic shaped as small discs with diameter of 8 mm and height of 4 mm fig 2 then smaller in size than the marble pebbles above described the cylindrical shape with a ratio radius height almost equal to one has been chosen again to avoid elongated shapes prevent interlocking cohesion phenomena and provide a greater hydraulic permeability this particular type of ceramic is obtained by fermentation of effective microorganisms em on a clay substrate gray porous pasta ceramics and it is a material with excellent adsorption capacity unchanged performance over time and not polluting thanks to an antioxidant and regenerating effect it is capable of eliminating methanogens and toxic pollutants formed as a result of the chemical breakdown process and tends to break down the bacterial load due to em or to adsorb undesirable substances due to porous ceramic 10 today em technology is an all powerful tool for disinfection of all waters worldwide and has excellent uses in numerous fields 2 1 3 activated carbon grains another component of the new filters is granular active carbon whose particles have the smallest size among the used materials in particular grains with a rounded shape and of different size 2 4 mm diameter were used fig 3 in order to avoid cohesion and poor hydraulic permeability thus reducing the pressure losses resulting from the filtration process this material has long been used for the production of water treatment cartridges since it is able to remove halogenated organic substances such as thrihalomethane and other dbp disinfestation products pesticides herbicides triazines chlorine and other substances that cause water alterations it is mainly composed of amorphous carbon which has a highly microporous structure and a very wide specific area and therefore is able to retain molecules of other substances inside it and for its high adsorption capacities it is suitable for a wide variety of treatment processes 11 12 2 1 4 synthetic inert cotton inert synthetic cotton was used to make the actual filtering septum in lieu of wire wounded commercial cartridges specifically this cotton is polyethylene terephthalate pet in polymer grains fig 4 a suitably worked and reduced to wadding a biologically inert and insoluble material which does not release substances removes waste of all kinds in suspension and makes the water clear 13 the optimum wadding has a filtration degree of 10 μm which however is reduced considerably with stiffening of the fibers during the realization of the filters therefore special care is devoted not to compress the fibers so as not to alter the filtering capacity and not cause an undesirable head losses increase in the laboratory activities it was made use of rolls produced by askoll group soft to the touch and white with a height of 25 cm so as to be able to easily wrap the wadding around a rigid support and place it inside the filter element instead of any commercial cartridge fig 4b the wadding is capable of absorbing large amounts of water thus increasing its surface for expansion of the interstices between the fibers this guarantees a good hydraulic permeability and consequently modest head losses but also causes a worsening of the ability to retain the impurities present in the fluid during this experimental activity then several overlapping wadding layers were wound to the polypropylene support in order to return a cartridge with good hydraulic permeability but at the same time with excellent ability to retain suspended particles 2 1 5 polypropylene slashed cylinder a 100 pure polypropylene cylinder with rectangular windows similar to the one of the wrapped wire commercial cartridges from which it has been obtained was used as a support for the pet cartridge built here fig 5 forming the inner core of the synthetic wrap filter in all the filters proposed here this element in the commercial cartridges can not be removed so once the filter is replaced it can not be retrieved in the proposed filters instead the wool is only wound to such support and therefore when necessary it can be easily replaced thereby allowing the cylinder to be used several times 2 1 6 fine sand fine sand was used to artificially and progressively clog the filters both commercial and ad hoc made in particular crushed sand was used an homogeneous inorganic material consisting of calcium carbonate particles of 0 10 mm size fig 6 well weighed the sand was added inside the cartridge holder by using water that poured from the top pushed down the sand progressively for each achieved clogging degree the resulting head losses were measured 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 measuring operations before carrying out the experiments a storage tank feeding the circuit 1 is filled up to a certain level 1 50 m referred to the floor to be kept constant during the tests in order to fix the water head upstream of the circuit to this level refer all the measurements taken during the laboratory activity in different tests the upstream shut off valve is closed in order to disconnect the filter container and each time the different cartridges artificially clogged with quantities of sand established a priori were inserted once set in position the filter was gradually put under water pressure by slowly opening the upstream shut off valve by doing so sand was gently pushed toward the filter surface and at this point the test began setting off the pump for each cartridge commercial ones and proposed ones with the different clogging degrees tests were performed for the three different circuit flow velocities corresponding to the three fixed curve modes set in the electronic pump in each scenario the pressure drops produced by the cartridges were measured 2 2 2 measuring instruments an electronic differential manometer was used to measure the pressure losses at the filter with higher accuracy than with the liquid column gauges along the circuit 3 specifically the pressure gauge is the 0 7 bar digitron 2023 p fig 7 a with 0 15 absolute accuracy connected to the circuit by joining with plastic tubes its two inlets with two derivations located upstream and downstream of the filter element respectively fig 7b in this way the pressure difference between these points which corresponds to the head loss due to the filter operation can be evaluated more in detail the pressure values correspond to the ensemble average of three measures taken in steady flow conditions reductions at the derivations were necessary to allow the connection between the manometer inlets external diameter 8 mm and the stainless steel pipes diameter 25 mm piezometers were also placed upstream and downstream of the filters for independent measurements of the produced head losses below 0 2 bar a sf 400 balance was used to accurately measure the amount of sand to be progressively introduced into the filters to clog them the same quantity of sand i e 20 g in fact was added each time to guarantee an appreciable variation in head losses to be recorded at each increment 2 3 analyzed filtration elements laboratory tests started with the assessment of the head losses of commercial cartridges for several clogging rates in particular wire wound cartridges have been used as they represent the most common type used for mechanical filtration of drinking water see also 1 once evaluated the pressure losses in optimum conditions that is at zero degree of clogging then the cartridge has been progressively clogged adding 20 g of sand at a time up to 300 g and evaluating for each increment the corresponding head losses the recorded values refer to the amount of sand that actually remained trapped in the cartridge so it was not considered the residual although minimal left inside the styrene acrylonitrile san resin container the process of sedimentation and absorption of the particles suspended in the liquid by the cartridge has in fact very long times incompatible with the activities to be carried out for this reason to rapidly increase the degree of actual clogging of the cartridges a small amount of food glue was used this substance allowed the sand to adhere to the outer surface of the cartridge and not to deposit to the bottom of the container so as to simulate an effective clogging of the filter once the circuit was in operation the glue used only to fix the sand to the filtering septum was shortly washed away being it soluble in water thus leaving only the sand deposited on the outer surface at this point the head losses related to the specific clogging degree were measured through the differential pressure gauge the results confirmed previous investigations obtained by using honey instead of food glue 1 below a description of the filter elements object of the experiments is given indicating the construction characteristics the operating modes the way the water flows into them and the interior sedimentation process of the particles suspended in water 2 3 1 commercial wire wound filter cartridge commercial wire wound filter cartridges of the type shown in fig 8 with an efficiency of 80 and a filtration degree of 50 μm were used in the laboratory tests fig 8 also provides some information about dimensions and weights as well as water flow pattern in the cartridge this type of cartridge is produced by wrapping a 3 mm thick wire on a slashed cylinder support both in 100 pure polypropylene non toxic and therefore suitable for the treatment of drinking or domestic water the fluid inlet is carried out laterally from the outer edge towards the inside of the cartridge by depositing in the filter the still dirty water which is thus pushed by the flow into the central duct and moves away from the filter without impurity the honeycomb texture allows to retain most of the suspended particles larger than the interstices on the surface of the filtering septum with prolonged use over time the store of substances on the outer surface and inside the cartridge causes a decrease in the hydraulic properties of the same leaving less transitory space to the fluid until the filtering septum is completely clogged to this extent a considerable increase in head losses and a reduction in the filtration capacity occur 1 14 18 wire wound filter cartridges fall into the category of deep filtration cartridges and are therefore not washable so they need to be replaced in a short time resulting in increased service costs and waste production this coupled with the high level of head losses also in modest clogging conditions are the limits found in this filtering element 2 4 built cartridge and filters the wire wound commercial cartridge limits were the starting point for the development of new mechanical filters designed precisely to reduce head losses even for high clogging values and increase their life time all the filters tested in this work consist of a central septum in pet inert wadding wrapped around a polypropylene cylindrical core an element that as any commercial cartridge has to stop the suspended particles present in the fluid to be filtered to limit and delay clogging the wadding core was properly protected and the volume involved in the filtration process was expanded fig 9 occupying in the new built filters the entire interior space of the cartridge holder and not just the central septum as for commercial cartridges the materials described above in section 2 1 have been used namely white marble pebbles em ceramic cylinders and granular active carbon 2 4 1 cartridge in inert synthetic wadding after having measured head losses for the commercial cartridge a new filter was made by replacing in the cartridge the polypropylene wire by pet cotton or synthetic inert wadding and the head loss exhibited by different clogging degrees and for the different pump velocities were evaluated the wadding is wrapped around the polypropylene slashed supporting cylinder as several layers overlapped with each other to create a spiral system capable of retaining even smaller particles fig 10 shows a picture of the proposed pet cartridge compared with the classic commercial wire wound one also giving information on the new cartridge size and materials used to make it while fig 11 contains pictures that illustrate its building process once built the cartridge head losses corresponding to a zero clog were registered subsequently the filtering septum was progressively and artificially clogged placing the sand at a rate of 20 g at a time up to 120 g directly between the overlapping wadding layers and to a lesser extent on the outer surface with honey and or food glue to ensure effective clogging of the sand at each increment of added sand and thus with the progressive clogging the corresponding head losses for each pump velocity were detected the cartridge was proved to be reproducible crucial condition for the marketing of the filter cartridges proposed here since once recreated it using the same cylinder and the same quantity of synthetic wadding the head losses were re evaluated under initial conditions and the obtained values were identical to those recorded on the cartridge previously built 2 4 2 filter 1 inert synthetic cotton cartridge and white marble pebbles at the aim of retaining as much sand as possible out of the cartridge thus limiting and delaying clogging and the associated head losses in the first proposed filter referred to in the following as filter 1 an outer radial layer composed of white marble pebbles section 2 1 1 of various sizes was added to the synthetic wadding cartridge section 2 4 1 randomly occupying the space between the cartridge and the san glass in the positioning of pebbles it is important not to compress the wadding so the pebbles would not be forcefully constrained in the glass but just dropped little by little freely until they cover all the available space between the cartridge and the filter holder this precaution is crucial as it provides a good voids distribution and a proper settling down before putting the filter into service this must be internally stable i e the position of the grains must not change over time in order to ensure this stone elements of bigger granulometry and weight have been placed on the top thus when the circuit is started the incoming liquid flow does not cause any change in the initial state without this technical precaution pebbles could be compressed and constipated by the input water in the filter or washed away by the outflow the schematic section in fig 12 a helps to better understand the composition of the filter fig 12b also shows a photo of the filter made in the laboratory and fig 12c reports information about the constructive features with quantities of the used material once the filter was completed and put into operation again the head losses were first evaluated under zero clogging conditions then the filter was clogged progressively by adding 20 g of fine sand for each increment from the top of the container and pushing it down using a small amount of water at the end of the clogging process the polypropylene core was recovered from the filter and reused also this cartridge was reproduced again and the initial head losses checked 2 4 3 filter 2 cartridge in inert synthetic wadding and em ceramic cylinders the pet cartridge was reproduced and the initial head losses calculated but in this second case it was used the em ceramic as protection of the pet filter thus realizing the filter denoted in the following as filter 2 as in the previous case the em discs introduced in the space between the cartridge holder and the filter septum should not be compressed but set up to occupy spontaneously the free spaces in order to reduce interlocking cohesion phenomena guarantee an adequate hydraulic permeability and ensure as lower head losses as possible fig 13 shows a schematic representation of the filter with a indication of the constituent elements b photo of the filter made in the laboratory c information about components materials and quantities for the proposed filter once built the filter and evaluated the initial head losses as for the previous filters it was progressively clogged with fine sand in quantities of 20 g at a time and the correspondent pressure drops were measured 2 4 4 filter 3 cartridge in inert synthetic wadding and granular active carbon to build the third proposed filter again the cartridge in inert synthetic wadding was rebuilt and the initial head losses measured to prove the perfect reproduction in this case the filtering septum was protected by activated carbon in grains which thanks to its high specific area and a very porous structure is able to retain molecules of other substances inside it the filter referred in the following as filter 3 therefore allows as filter 2 both water treatment and mechanical filtration a condition very difficult to find in standard commercial cartridges during the fabrication of the filter again the activated carbon should not be constipated but introduced in small quantities and piecemeal in the space between the filter cartridge and the san glass fig 14 shows a a schematic representation of the filter element under consideration with its different components b a photo of the built filter and c some information about its constructive features the filter was again progressively clogged with addition of 20 g of sand at a time from the top with water permeated downwards inside the filter in this case the clogging process was much slower and much more water was used than in the previous case as the small size of the particles and then of the voids made the insertion of sand very difficult 2 4 5 sand clogging limit during the laboratory activities the maximum values of head losses to which the built filters should tend were sought in the condition that all the available voids between the grains were occupied by the added sand these values were obtained by recreating these condition by means of a specially designed filter a new pet cartridge identical to the previous ones was then built but in this case only fine sand was added in the space between the filter and the san glass fig 15 it would have been very difficult to achieve this condition of all voids completely occupied by sand in the filters described above because in them the sand is added with increasing difficulty as the clogging degree rises due to the progressive reduction of voids and hydraulic permeability of the medium additionally the reciprocal settling down of the grains to protect the cartridge creates areas where the sand could not penetrate anyway to recreate the clogging limit a total of 800 g of sand was added and subsequently the head losses corresponding to the three fixed speed values of the pump were evaluated 2 4 6 filter 4 inert synthetic wadding cartridge white marble pebbles em ceramic cylinders and granular active carbon the fourth and last filter referred to in the following as filter 4 was designed based on the results obtained in the previous cases it has been specifically sought to put in place a filter capable of displaying low head losses for both low and medium clogging values this result was obtained by combining all the materials used to make the filters described above in particular marble pebbles were used which have a greater granulometry and hence a larger voids size than the other elements and then they yield a greater hydraulic permeability with low head losses for a low clogging degree then em ceramic flakes and granular active carbon were also used which in addition to retaining the sand and preventing it from reaching the cartridge quickly by virtue of the porous structure and its adsorptive abilities purify the water and neutralize harmful molecules and smells also improving its appearance again in this case the first step was the realization of the cartridge in inert synthetic wadding all the materials used appropriately dosed were previously mixed together to ensure a distribution as homogeneous as possible to facilitate its ingrowth and maximize the ability to retain the sand to be filtered the three mixed components were subsequently poured into the cartridge holder box also in this case without being constipated but allowing them to fall freely in their dedicated space the assessment of the quantities of the various elements to be used for the filter construction was carried out in relation to the head losses that the latter would have to guarantee in particular the amount of marble pebbles has been increased until in zero clogging conditions the head losses were conveniently low estimated this amount the other elements were added later until completely filling the space between the san glass and the wadding cartridge fig 16 shows a the various parts of the filter b a photo of the filter made in laboratory and c the constructive features with the quantities of materials used to make it as in the previous cases after completing the construction and putting the filter into service it was progressively clogged by adding 20 g of sand each time from the top and measuring for each of these increments the corresponding head losses for the three different fixed speed curves of the pump 3 results of the experimental investigation in this section the results of the laboratory tests conducted on the filter elements above described are presented in particular graphs with the trends of the obtained head losses for the various filters in relation to the progressively added sand are reported for each of the three fixed curve speeds of the electronic pump 3 1 commercial wrapped wire cartridge and inert synthetic wadding cartridge first the results of the investigations carried out on the wrapped wire commercial cartridges are presented in terms of head losses δp in mbar respective to the measurements obtained both from previous experiences 1 4 in which honey was used to help clogging the filter and from the experiments conducted in this work making use of food glue the plot in fig 17 shows the trend of the results in terms of increase of head losses as the sand is progressively added i e as the clogging degree increases for the three velocities of the pump and the two experimental scenarios also in comparison with the results obtained with the simple inert synthetic wadding cartridge looking only at the results related to the commercial cartridge it can be noticed that for low and intermediate velocities in the circuit head losses are significantly less than those exhibited for maximum velocity in a first step up to the first 20 g of added sand the losses vary slightly then the slopes of the curves increase for all the three velocities the peak in terms of head losses is recorded at the maximum circulator velocity and for a clog degree of about 60 g of sand in addition the data obtained by using honey or food glue are very similar especially for low and intermediate velocities the only difference found in the use of these two substances is that honey started the water flow in the circuit washed away more quickly than food glue thus causing more detachment of sand from the cartridge and thus slightly less actual clogging with the same added sand this check was conducted to verify and assess whether the glue used to fix the sand on the filtering septum would affect the results and give rise to different head losses it is proved that the head losses trend in the cartridge does not depend on the material but only on the achieved degree of clogging and on the pump speed therefore for the comparisons of the head losses in the different filters reported in the following it was only referred to the values obtained by clogging the cartridges with honey comparing these results with the ones obtained with inert synthetic wadding for progressive clogging up to 120 g it can be noticed that the curves have a similar pattern however the cartridge made in the laboratory has in general lower head losses than a generic wound wire cartridge so it can be concluded that the built filtering septum is more efficient than the commercial ones the commercial cartridge for example reaches for 80 g of added fine sand and at the maximum circulating velocity a pressure loss of about 86 5 mbar whereas the cartridge proposed here reaches this value for a higher degree of clogging greater than 90 g the new cartridge therefore requires 10 g of sand more to exhibit the same head loss 3 2 new filters the results obtained with filters 1 2 3 and 4 are reported graphically in fig 18 in terms of head losses for the three pump velocities respectively and for progressive clogging of the filter with 20 g of sand each time up to 300 g in comparison against the ones obtained with the commercial cartridge for filter 1 the head loss trend with the increase of added sand is almost linear for the three pump velocities for filter 2 the trend can be tripartite for all three velocities as follows at an initial stage up to 120 g of added sand the curves grow linearly then there is an interval between 120 and 220 g of sand where the head losses trend is sub horizontal i e increasing the amount of sand head losses almost do not change in the final part between 220 and 300 g of introduced sand there is again a linear increase in the head losses with a greater slope than in the first segment as for the filter 3 trend of head losses in relation to the increasing clogging degree for the three different pump velocities at an initial stage approximately up to 200 g of inserted sand head losses are little affected by the presence of sand subsequently exceeding this value there is a noticeable increase of the head losses and hence a sharp increase in the curve slope in comparison with the head losses exhibited by the commercial filter the benefit in terms of pressure drops and then of durability is remarkable for the three filters it can be noticed for example how filter 1 shows the same 73 2 mbar head loss that the commercial filter manifests for maximum speed at 60 g of clogging only at 300 g of added sand this means that the commercial filter should be replaced much earlier since for low clogging values it shows great losses whereas the proposed filters are also efficient at high levels of clogging so they ensure a longer duration in time the comparison with the simple wadding cartridge fig 18 where the commercial filter is only wrapped with wadding shows the advantage of protecting the cartridge with marble ceramic or carbon material again proved by lower head losses and longer life time in fact for example at the maximum speed where head losses are higher filter 1 achieves the same head losses that the wadding cartridge reaches for 80 g at about 300 g of added sand summarizing the three filters are realized starting from the same cartridge in synthetic wadding and then protecting it with materials of different nature and size the filter made with pebbles filter 1 material with the biggest granulometry among the used ones guarantees minimal head losses at both initial and maximum clogging conditions but exhibits maximum head losses in the central zone of the chart so for an average clogging degree precisely for values between 120 and 260 g of added sand the filter made with activated carbon filter 3 i e with the material among those used with the smaller grain size returns inverted results minimum head losses in the central zone for added sand values between 120 and 240 g and maximum head losses at clogging degrees zero and maximum i e in the initial and final zones of the chart the filter made using the em ceramic filter filter 2 intermediate size component among the used materials both in the initial and final phase exhibits pressure losses higher than filter 1 and smaller than filter 3 whereas in the center of the graph it shows pressure losses higher than filter 3 and lower than filter 1 finally filter 4 made by combining the various granular elements for low clogging values produces very small head losses greater only to those related to filter 1 and for average clogging values it has head losses higher only respect to filter 3 but lower than those of filter 2 and much smaller respect to filter 1 filter 4 tends to the minimum values in terms of head losses both for a low and a medium degree of clogging finally the head losses found for 300 g of added sand are still very small and greater only respect to the filter made with marble pebbles this suggests the use of a greater amount of such elements for the realization of the final version of filter 4 the smaller the size of the material moving from filter 1 to filter 3 the higher the head losses for low values of added sand the advantage in using smaller grains becomes evident for high values of filter clogging particularly at about 80 100 g of sand introduced where filter 3 returns the lowest values of head losses with the progressive clogging up to a considerable degree of clogging corresponding to approximately 240 260 g of added sand however the results obtained by adding such amounts of sand are interesting for analyzing the various filtration mechanisms but represent little significant data since a filter would be cleaned or replaced before reaching such high clogging values manufacturers of drinking water filter cartridges in fact recommend replacing cartridges on average after three months of use filter 3 can be considered therefore advantageous since it causes low head losses for low and medium clogging values conditions which really occur in the life cycle of the cartridge table 1 shows the experimental data in terms of head losses for the three velocity values related to the filter made to simulate the condition of maximum clogging by sand section 2 4 5 i e in which the introduced sand occupies all the voids present between the interstices of the materials used to protect the cartridge it is noted how filter 3 is the filter which shows the head loss values closest to the ones reported in table 1 since it is the one among the proposed filters which gives the smaller void size finally the head losses trends for filter 4 show that in this case there are no stalemate areas for head losses but the trends are almost linear with a steady slope and the variations in head losses are well distributed from the lowest clogging values up to the highest ones filter 4 compared to a generic commercial wire wound cartridge once again allowed to obtain sparing pressure losses also with a high degree of clogging with a consequent benefit in terms of durability comparing the head losses trends of filter 4 with the ones of filter 3 it can be seen that the mix of materials selected for the realization of the final filter which contains a big amount of marble pebbles allowed to significantly lower the values of the head losses at the initial and final stage of the graph however this caused a slight rise still acceptable in the head losses in the central zone where instead filter 3 made only with activated carbon grains retains better the added sand so as to prevent it from reaching the cartridge and return therefore reduced head losses in comparison with filter 2 the trend of filter 4 does not deviate significantly only for the maximum velocity filter 4 exhibits for low clogging values less pressure drops the pressure drops are very similar because in filter 4 the mixing of the different elements creates a grain skeleton very similar to that of filter 2 made with material of intermediate granulometry between pebbles and active carbon grains however the general trend of the curves is not the same in fact filter 2 shows the tripartite pattern described above hence initial increase in head losses sub horizontal central phase and final stage with losses linear raise the pressure loss trend of filter 4 is instead rather linear finally the comparison of the head loss trends for filter 4 and filter 1 highlights that the curves are for both linear and increasing filter 4 however exhibits lower gradients and therefore lower increments in head losses as the clogging level increases in conclusion filter 4 appears very effective because for any clogging rate it exhibits overall pressure losses lower compared to the other proposed filters combining properly the various components in filter 4 led therefore to satisfactory results because the advantage of the more coarse fraction for low clogging degrees and the advantage of the finest elements for intermediate clogging degrees are merged 4 discussion of the results 4 1 analysis of the head losses trends the different behaviors of the filters can be explained by observing from the transparent walls of the filter container see the photographic documentation in ref 5 the evolution of the process in filter 1 for example the pebbles showed a poor ability to retain the sand and then to protect the filter in the clogging process they place themselves in the space between the cartridge and the filter holder with very low gear leaving many empty spaces that are immediately filled with sand the sand even adding the least amount of water immediately deposited on the glass bottom and quickly clogged the cartridge this phenomenon starting from the bottom where the sand deposited initially proceeded with parallel levels towards the top until all the interstices were occupied by the introduced grains as a consequence the introduced sand produces an increase in head losses however since the pebbles do not hold properly the sand they return a very permeable solid skeleton and then permit to keep head losses relatively low in filter 2 unlike filter 1 clogging does not proceed from the bottom up but horizontally by level the introduced sand has therefore a different preferential direction and is no longer able to reach the bottom but moves towards the edges particularly toward the outer edge or to the interface between the cartridge holder and the ceramic discs migrating later towards the filtering septum the outer edge of the filter appears to have a greater amount of voids than the wadding discs interface which is almost without voids in fact being the wadding soft it fits very well to the surface of the discs initial head losses can be attributed therefore to the minimum amount of sand that moving horizontally into the space between the cartridge and the holder pushed by the current instead of reaching the outer edge reaches the cartridge the stalemate phase on the other hand corresponds to the time when the introduced sand fills the voids between the discs i e the space between the cartridge and the holder finally in the third stage the interstices between the particles are saturated and therefore additional added sand creates pressures on the wadding cartridge that will be reached from other sand with a consequent increase in head losses the filter 3 trend can be explained by the fact that it shows from the first grams of added sand a greater resistance than the other filters previously proposed since the active carbon grains retain the sand very well and do not let it flow to the cartridge in the first phase therefore the head losses do not have large variations when sand is added because it does not reach the cartridge but it remains trapped between the grains and in part migrates towards the outer edge or towards the cartridge holder granular carbon interface thus as for filter 2 the outer area is the one with more voids due to the low adhesion between grains and the smooth surface of the cartridge holder it is therefore the region where water migrates more easily in the final part of the curve after the 260 g of added sand all the interstices are saturated and the migration of sand forced by the circulating water towards the cartridge begins resulting in increased head losses generated by the filter the comparison of filter 2 with filter 1 shows that as the size of the material used for the cartridge protection is smaller than in filter 1 the losses in filter 2 are initially larger because at 0 g of added sand smaller pieces leave less voids resulting in increased water resistance however in the interval between about 120 260 g filter 2 produces significantly lower head losses than filter 1 whereas in the final segment the head losses of filter 2 are again higher this behavior can be explained by the greater ability of the ceramic to retain the sand respect to the marble pebbles larger volumes of water were needed even to introduce the minimum amount of fine sand due to the smaller dimensions of the ceramic elements which guarantees a better distribution and a smaller size of the voids this in response to a slight increase in initial head losses due to the lower hydraulic permeability of the medium returns a filter capable of more effectively retaining the suspended particles em ceramic discs constitute a more effective protection for the central filtration septum since it is clogged with sand in times longer than those required for the previous filter with consequent lower head losses filter 2 has also the ability to combine mechanical filtration and water treatment two conditions that are typically carried out by different products during this experience it was noted as well that by compressing the wadding the head losses increased in comparison with filter 2 filter 3 manifests higher head losses initially in no clogging conditions in fact the small sized grains make water passage more difficult as they leave less voids however activated carbon grains recreate many overlapping radial layers in the interposed area between the cartridge and the san container thus blocking very well the permeation of the sand and preventing it from reaching the cartridge as a result in the middle part of the chart the filter has lower losses than those of the filter made with ceramic discs which retains less sand finally appreciable head losses for filter 3 are only reached at a high degree of clogging due to the smaller amount of voids compared to the other materials the differences in head losses with filter 1 are instead very marked specifically under zero clogging conditions without any sand addition filter 1 has very little head losses compared to filter 3 this gap is decreasing with higher losses for filter 1 until the first 80 100 g of added sand after this value in fact it is the activated carbon filter that shows lower head losses up to 240 260 g of added sand therefore the advantage of using larger cobs extends to about 80 g of sand introduced into the filter as the benefit derived from the higher water permeability is counteracted by the rapid clogging of the cartridge the advantage in using activated carbon is instead evident by average clogging values up to 260 g of added sand after this value the interstices are already saturated and therefore there are considerable increases in head losses i e filter 3 exhibits greater head losses than filter 1 due as before to the lower presence of voids i e to the lower hydraulic permeability of the medium 4 2 identified filtration mechanisms from the experimental evidences correlations were found between the head losses trends showed by the filters for the different clogging degrees and the constructive characteristics of the filters themselves which determines a different way of depositing sand inside the filter and thus a different clogging mechanisms for the filters first of all the water flow that reaches and passes through a filtering septum splits into smaller flows so that it can cross the fibers of which the septum is made the suspended particles therefore undergo a number of changes in direction until they are trapped depending on the type of filter fig 19 in the specific case to model the filtration process reference is made to the sieve mechanism 13 this type of mechanism occurs when the diameter of the suspended materials is greater than the distance between the fibers and therefore the particles fail to cross the septum the larger particles deposit on the first layers of the filter element while the minutest ones can pass to the innermost layers the spongy structure result of the building process of the wadding used for the pet cartridge allows the bulk of particles suspended in water to be retained on the filtering surface although the cartridge can only retain particles larger than the minimum size of its interstices with prolonged use over time accumulation of suspended particles will cause a decrease in the hydraulic properties of the cartridge leaving less transitory space to the fluid until the filtering septum is completely clogged by the solid particles extracted from the liquid at this point as shown by the experimental results there is a considerable increase in head losses besides the filtering mechanism it is important to define also the way in which the different filters reach the maximum clogging observing the manner in which the sand added from time to time is deposited inside fig 20 the identified mechanisms are mainly three fig 21 the first filtration mechanism 1 fm1 concerns the filter made using white marble pebbles the second filtration mechanism 2 fm2 with appropriate variations refers to the filter made with em ceramic and to the one with granular activated carbon the third filtration mechanism 3 fm3 occurs in the final filter made by combining all the granular elements in the first detected mechanism fm1 which interests filter 1 the filter clogging proceeds from the bottom upwards specifically given the high permeability of the skeleton formed by the marble grains for the large size of the voids the sand flowing from the top where it is introduced does not encounter any obstacle and proceeds undisturbed to the bottom of the glass the pictures show a progressive increase in the clogging degree for horizontal planes 5 thus the cartridge is poorly protected as sand comes to it from the first quantities introduced the described mechanism is associated with an almost linear and growing trend of the head losses as the clogging increases the use of a highly permeable material such as marble pebbles therefore gives poor protection against the filtering clogging and a consequent immediate increase in pressure drops however it is also able to guarantee at the initial stage the minimum detected head losses in the second mechanism fm2 occurring both in filter 2 and filter 3 fig 21b the clogging proceeds instead from the outer edge to the inside then starting from the cartridge glass until it reaches the pet filtration septum the sand added from time to time flowing through the interstices of the granular material pushed by the circulating water proceeds to the direction which has the least resistance to transit that is the one in which the presence of voids is higher in the specific case to the filter container outer walls which are smooth and regular and therefore unable to adapt to the shape of the granular elements the spongy texture of the filtering septum on the other hand perfectly adheres to the shapes of the material placed in the protection of the same returning a small amount of voids and creating a zone less permeable than the outer edge thus two distinct zones are created one interior at the interface between the spongy material and the grain skeleton characterized by a low presence of voids and one outside close to the pet glass and made of the granular elements characterized by a high hydraulic permeability the two zones are respectively separated from em ceramic cylinders in the case of filter 2 and from granular active carbon in the case of filter 3 the grain skeleton formed from filter 2 presents given the larger dimensions of the particles a greater presence of voids and therefore the sand proceeding from the outer edge towards the cartridge is only partly stopped depositing in the interstices of the solid skeleton of the granular material whereas the other part goes to the cartridge thus being responsible for the head losses detected at the initial stage of the clogging process by keeping adding sand there is a slight increase in pressure losses as in this second phase the sifted sand is saturating the voids between the grains and therefore can not reach the cartridge in the final part of the process there is a considerable increase in head losses corresponding to the progressive clog of the cartridge the mechanism just described is associated with the tripartite graph described in section 3 the activated carbon even smaller in size than the em ceramic stops almost totally the incoming sand not allowing it to reach the septum and it is able therefore to prevent the increase of pressure losses this second just described clogging mode is associated with a pressure trend distinguished by a low slope starting segment characterized by a modest increase in head losses and from a high slope end section where on the contrary there is a sudden increase of the drops the third identified mechanism fm3 affects filter 4 fig 21c it is completely analogous to the first presented with respect to filter 1 but the direction must be inverted because the sand introduced from time to time in this case saturates the voids between the interstices of the solid skeleton by proceeding from top to bottom this is due to the less permeability of the medium which retains the sand by preventing it from flowing deep into the filter the sand progressively added from the top of the san holder by the inlet water flow exerting pressure on the underlying layers pushes more and more deeper the sand already deposited between the interstices of the skeleton reaching the bottom of the glass condition corresponding to the maximum clogging of the filter 5 new cartridge design 5 1 technical precautions for the correct implementation of mechanical filters after the analysis of the experimental results some remarks can be pointed out regarding the technical implementation of the proposed cartridges in fact these filters are only effective if equipped with some specifications such as internal stability open porosity rounded shape of the materials placed as protection for the filters adequate hydraulic permeability non cementing components adequate grain settling and so on all the material used in combination with the inert synthetic pet wadding for the realization of the various filters as said before are able to incorporate in their granular structure smaller particles without impairing the hydraulic permeability a property that guided the search and the choice of such materials used to protect the filtering septum is the porosity fig 21 generally defined as the ratio between the volume of voids or pores and the total volume of the material depending on the size and distribution of pores the mechanism responsible for the diffusion of matter changes together with the characteristics and phenomena associated with it in fact in this case what affects the filtration process is not the porosity of the single element related to its adsorption capacity but the porosity of the solid skeleton formed by aggregation of various grains of different materials but considered as a whole medium 19 20 the suspended particles can move transported by the fluid in the adjacent pores if they are sufficiently small i e if the narrow gorges connecting two or more interstices of the main skeleton are larger than the embedded particles the re created skeleton must be permeable only to the fluid to be treated i e water in the specific case but not to the suspended particles which must be appropriately retained in order not to reach the filtering septum the different granular materials of different dimensions when combined return a solid skeleton having different sizes of the voids too fig 22 the permeability of the skeleton which unlike porosity is a vector represents its ability to be crossed by fluids is affected by factors related to the characteristics essentially to the microscopic structure for example curvature and pore size of the porous medium and appears as a constant of proportionality in the darcy s law between the pressure gradient and the discharge 14 21 porosity and permeability are therefore two properties that although correlated are distinct and not to be confused since a single carbon grain is for example porous and non permeable the solid skeleton formed by the aggregation of more grains of the same material is instead porous and permeable fig 23 19 22 the design and building of the filters is essential to ensure an adequate permeability of the solid grain skeleton a granular filter such as the one created in the proposed cartridges has to be also internally stable in order to be efficient i e its structure must not undergo variations in time settlements or reciprocal displacements between grains that may vary the distribution and size of the voids this condition has been guaranteed by the use of large scale stone material which placed in correspondence with the filter element ring inhibits by exercising a slight pressure on the underlying elements the reciprocal movements between the grains thus ensuring the stability required for the solid skeleton however it is also necessary to avoid the so called cohesion by interlocking a phenomenon linked to the elongated form of the particles preferring rounded grains in order to favor hydraulic permeability and to avoid the arrangement of grains in parallel filaments finally another required property is that the different used granular materials must be non cementing i e not soluble in water cementation is in fact one of the mechanisms occurring together with the sedimentation and consists in the precipitation of substances brought to solution from the circulating waters to the pores of the sediment the process of lithification that is of transformation of an inconsistent sediment into a coherent or high consistency one can occur with mechanical actions reduction of pores generally occupied by water or air by means of mechanical compression resulting in a reduction in volume and chemical reactions further reduction in volume as interstitial waters determines the precipitation of the substances contained in sediment pores each filter made using grain material and therefore also the proposed filters exhibits a clogging limit a condition analogous to that rebuilt in the laboratory in which the pores of the coarsest material are gradually occluded by the particles of the finer material to a level that prevents hydraulic efficiency to this extent it is necessary to clean it if possible or to replace it immediately the use of materials with the aforementioned properties and the steps to be taken in implementation described in this section are necessary conditions for making mechanical filters such as those proposed capable of yielding moderate head losses even at high degrees of clogging and much longer lasting than normal cartridges 5 2 advantages and properties of the new proposed filters in fig 24 an axonometric explosion of the proposed system and a detailed image of the container designed to accommodate granular elements are reported the main advantage of this new designed and built cartridge is that it is capable of ensuring low head losses this last aspect is not to be underestimated for example in the case of dwellings on the top of a building in which the input pressure may not be sufficient for the operation of the various water appliances if the filter element has a great impact on the plant the new filter here proposed can guarantee reduced pressure losses in all working conditions thus avoiding this inconvenience even in the presence of waters with many suspended elements or dissolved substances in fact it is demonstrated to provide average head losses significantly lower than those shown by the analyzed commercial cartridges even for high levels of clogging this also resolves the problem of a substitution in a short time the filter so designed and manufactured is able to withstand a large amount of suspended particles before annulling its filtering capacity so high clogging values are reached in longer operating times and as a result the filter lasts longer to this feature it has to be added the combined action of mechanical filtration and water treatment difficult to find on the market as the various currently available products act selectively by resolving the proposed issues individually another noteworthy factor is the advantage in economic terms which concerns both the individual materials used for the various filters and the management of the filter itself concerning the former 1 kg of white pebble actually sells for just 080 eur the activated carbon grains range from 6 to 10 eur per kg while em ceramic cylinders despite featuring the highest price 50 60eur per kg have the advantage to be reused for up to 10 years about the latter aspect the modified cartridge can be used for period up to one order of magnitude longer respect to the commercial products i e featuring a lifecycle of 5 6 years depending on the progressive clogging of the outer region of the filter the reduced cost of the various components with reference to this time horizon makes the filters very economical additionally the long lasting life and efficiency make the replacement not required in short periods with a further benefit in terms of labor and costs the proposed filters are also ecologically compatible in fact being composed of natural elements they are simple to dispose of in the case in which they have to be replaced lastly the new cartridge has an excellent chemical compatibility with foods drinks drinking water and chemical solvents and therefore it shows a great versatility and can be used extensively the proposed solution not only solves the before mentioned limitations of the commercial cartridges but also present additional properties and benefits which justify its selection all these advantages are summarized in table 2 the only disadvantage found is the implementation as this is more articulate and demanding than a simple replacement of a generic commercial cartridge however this problem may be easily solved by using a specially designed plastic slashed holder of the type similar to that used for the commercial cartridge support suitably shaped so as to fit perfectly inside the san glass and leave a special vacuum in the center useful for receiving any filter cartridge or septum by introducing the grain elements inside this container it would be possible to guarantee the internal stability required for the solid skeleton for optimum operation of the filter and at the same time a quicker and easier installation the container was not used during laboratory tests it was designed later and has as its sole purpose to simplify the process of making the filtering cartridge as reproducible as possible in this way the same simplicity and immediacy in the implementation of the commercially available cartridges would be reproduced since the realization of the filter would reduce to insert in the interior of this special container the various pre packaged and ready to use elements 6 conclusions and future perspectives the experimental activity carried out in this work permitted to draw up some useful remarks on the filtering cartridges aimed at proposing innovative long lasting in time and economic systems capable of ensuring low head losses significantly lower than those produced by commercial cartridges even in high clogging conditions the experiments in fact led to the design of a versatile cartridge and the selection of a proper combination of various granular materials for the proper protection of the filter from the clogging effects this benefit of inducing low pressure drops may be particularly relevant in low pressure plants and allows for longer operating times of the cartridge the proposed filtering cartridge also presents advantages in economic terms both for the reduced cost of the materials and various components and for the long lasting life and efficiency which make the replacement not required in short periods it is also ecologically compatible in fact it is composed of natural elements simple to dispose of when they have to be replaced to this feature it has to be added the combined action of mechanical filtration and water treatment difficult to find on the market in a single filter cartridge the new cartridge has also an excellent chemical compatibility with foods drinks drinking water and chemical solvents and therefore it has a great versatility and can be used extensively the proposed solution covered by a recently filed patent not only solves the limitations of the commercial cartridges but also present additional benefits which justify its use

concerns as groundwater pollutants are highly toxic and nonbiodegradable causing major harm to human health 1 3 arsenic as and nitrate no3 are commonly found in ground water sources all over the world especially in some rural regions of western kurdistan province iran the united states environmental protection agency us epa has classified arsenic as a group a carcinogen 4 therefore it poses serious threats to human health such as arsenicosis and different types of cancer 5 7 arsenic exists in the environment in two oxidation states of arsenate as v and arsenite as iii as iii is 60 times more toxic than as v 8 10 it is noted that as iii has a higher toxicity and is more difficult to eliminate than as v 11 but as iii is easily converted to as v by oxidation under aerobic conditions 12 thus as v is generally the dominant aqueous inorganic arsenic species under oxidizing conditions and is typically found in shallow groundwater and surface waters for this reason studies on the treatment of the waters typically focused on as v 13 15 nitrate contaminated drinking water may cause several health problems such as blue baby syndrome methemoglobinemia and mental retardation in infants 16 19 stomach bladder and colorectal cancers and formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines in adults 20 21 to protect human health the world health organization who and institute of standards and industrial research of iran isiri have set the maximum contaminant level mcl of 11 3 mg l for no3 n 50 mg l no3 and 0 01 mg l for as v in drinking water 22 24 the current methods used to remove these pollutants from aqueous solutions include chemical precipitation 25 adsorption 26 27 ion exchange 28 29 nano zero valent iron 30 and membrane separation 31 32 the limitations of these methods include energy consumption and production of toxic by products that must be treated appropriately 33 recently the membrane separation process has been extensively utilized for the treatment of ground water containing toxic contaminants 34 ultrafiltration uf or microfiltration mf is usually used for separation of pollutants with a high molecular weight 35 36 to remove these pollutants nanofiltration nf or reverse osmosis ro can be applied considering the ion size in aqueous solutions 36 however these processes have a restricted flux and require high operating pressure making them quite costly 1 37 in the past decade micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf has been an effective method to separate inorganic pollutants from the aqueous phase 38 40 in the meuf process surfactants are added to solutions with concentrations exceeding the critical micelle concentration cmc the surfactant molecules accumulate to form spherical micelles which are larger than the membrane pore 41 42 the micelles can be bind to inorganic ions by electrostatic interaction 38 39 therefore inorganic pollutants can be removed by applying the uf technique 37 43 this method has advantages such as high removal efficiency low energy requirement and simple operation 36 38 43 iqbal et al 44 evaluated as v removal using various cationic surfactants and attributed the highest removal efficiency 96 to cetylpyridinium chloride cpc surfactant beak et al 45 applied cpc surfactant for no3 and phosphate po4 3 removal they reported no3 and po4 3 removal efficiencies of 86 and 91 respectively when the molar ratio of cpc to pollutants exceeded three various studies on the meuf process have separated organic and inorganic pollutants heavy metals and nutrients in single pollutant systems 46 47 and few studies have reported contaminant elimination in multipollutant systems 48 50 competition owing to the difference in the binding power of contaminants may inhibit the binding of pollutants with lower binding potential in multipollutant systems 37 41 several authors studied the removal of as v or no3 using the meuf process however to our knowledge there are no reports on simultaneous removal of as v and no3 although arsenic is usually a natural source and nitrate is an anthropogenic source both of the as v and no3 are commonly found in some rural regions of western kurdistan province iran for

experiments double distilled deionized ddi water was used 2 2 preparation of membrane polymer membrane was prepared by phase inversion method the polymer solution was prepared by dissolving a 16 w v pan polymer in dmf solvent the polymer solution was placed on a magnetic stirrer at 55 60 c for 5 h to produce a completely homogenous solution then the solution was kept for 24 h at room temperature to eliminate air bubbles subsequently the polymer solution was cast on a glass plate with a casting knife with a thickness of 150 μm for the phase inversion process the casting solution was exposed to the atmosphere for 60 s and then immersed in a water bath to for 24 h to remove residual solvent 41 2 3 characterization of membrane the morphology of the membrane was analyzed via scanning electron

experiments experiments were performed at 25 3 c room temperature using a dead end uf cell with an effective membrane area of 12 4 cm2 and feed volume of 500 ml before each experiment the membrane was soaked in deionized water for 24 h and then compacted at a pressure of 1 bar for almost 1 h with deionized water the filtration system consisted of a 500 ml feed tank a nitrogen gas cylinder a stainless steel flat membrane module valves and pressure gauges fig 1 the feed solution was prepared by dissolving the predetermined amounts of cpc arsenate and nitrate in 300 ml of deionized water the solution ph was adjacent by 0 1 m hno3 or naoh a magnetic stirrer was used to stir the solution for 1 h at a constant speed of 300 rpm 31 42 rad s to obtain an efficient mixture then it was settled for 30 min to facilitate micelle formation the aqueous solution was subjected to the uf membrane 30 min after the onset of the experiment the experimental processes were terminated and the permeate samples were collected and analyzed the meuf experiments were designed to study the effects of some operating parameters concentration of cpc tmp and ph on the permeate flux and removal of pollutants and surfactant rejection all experiments were repeated 3 times and their average was reported after each experiment to recover the membrane permeability it was washed with 0 1 m naoh at 1

spectra aa 200 and ion chromatography ic metrohm 882 compact switzerland were performed to determine the concentrations of as v and nitrate respectively in the feed and permeate samples 55 56 the cpc concentration was measured by a uv vis spectrophotometer at 258 nm 1 also ph was determined using a ph meter 3510 jenway 3 results and discussion 3 1 uf membrane characterization the top surface and cross sectional sem morphology of prepared membrane are presented in fig 2 a and b prepared membrane had a symmetric structure the structure morphology of the membrane is associated with the rate of phase inversion in a water bath 57 this membrane has a top thin layer that functions as a selective barrier film for the solute this layer was supported by a finger like sub layer containing macro voids and microspores which increase the membrane mechanical strength xrd patterns of uf membrane is presented in fig 3 a pan membrane has diffraction peaks at 2θ 16 7 relating to the crystal plane of pan 58 the ftir spectra of pan membrane are shown in fig 3b the peaks of stretching vibration at 2246 cm 1 indicate the symmetrical cn stretching at 2929 cm 1 for ch stretch while the peaks at 1731 and 1664 cm 1 refer to co stretch co stretch is observed at 1037 cm 1 the edx spectrum of the uf membrane was shown in fig 3c which represents the weight percentage of the elements in the membrane structure such as carbon c nitrogen n and oxygen o fig 3d presents 3d afm images of the prepared membrane according to fig 3d the dark and bright areas indicate the valleys and the peaks on the membrane surface respectively with a magnification of 40 μm and surface roughness ra of 88 84 nm 3 2 effect of cpc concentration on removal efficiency and permeate flux fig 4 a indicates the effects of feed cpc concentration on the removal efficiency of as v and no3 the initial as v and no3 concentrations were respectively set at 1000 μg l and 100 mg l the system performance in as v and no3 removal was investigated at 25 c ph of 7 8 and tmp of 1 bar fig 4a shows that as v and no3 removal efficiency increased with an increase in the surfactant concentration this could be attributed to the concentration polarization during this process cpc concentration increased on the membrane surface and formed a gel layer adjacent to or on the membrane surface where micelles were formed to bind to anion molecules and cpc concentration reached cmc according to fig 4a with a further increase in cpc concentration 5 mm anion rejection decreased which could be due to reduced aggregation and mean size of micelles at higher cpc levels also active binding sites did not increase by increasing the feed cpc concentration 59 samper et al 36 confirmed this phenomenon also similar results were reported by some other researchers 41 43 theoretically no micelles were formed at cpc concentrations below cmc 0 9 mm therefore no no3 removal occurred nonetheless the rather high removal of as v 49 3 was observed this unanticipated rejection can be attributed to the negative membrane charge leading to arsenate repulsion donna exclusion effect 60 61 as the cpc value increased from 0 1 mm to 5 mm the rejection of as v and no3 increased from 49 3 to 96 9 and from 0 3 to 90 5 respectively this shown that negative charged anions bound with cationic surfactant micelles and removed from the aqueous solution by uf membrane the cationic surfactant micelles formed in aqueous phase can be bind with anionic arsenate species based on the absolute electrostatic potential and the high surface charge density in the next step the created micelles can be separated during uf because their size are physically too large to pass through membrane pores in cpc concentration of 5 mm removal efficiency of as v and no3 reaches below mcl 0 01 mg l and 11 3 mg l for arsenate and nitrate respectively tanhaei et al 41 removed 5 mg l aniline and 10 mg l nickel from aqueous solution after they were entrapped with sds micelles by uf membrane as shown in fig 4a the rejection of as v was higher than that of no3 at the same value of cpc because of the lower initial concentration of as v and also the higher valence of as v the same results were obtained by beak et al 62 who reported that the removal of chromate was higher than that of nitrate because the higher valence of chromate resulted in higher binding according to fig 4b the permeate flux reduced as the feed cpc concentration increased at cpc concentrations below cmc most cpc molecules can be found as free monomers which have a smaller size than the pore diameter monomers can move through the membrane easily under these conditions therefore the permeate flux is high as cpc concentration increased concentration polarization took place adjacent to or on the surface of membrane the membrane pores were blocked in a short period which resulted in membrane fouling increased hydraulic resistance and reduced flux at all concentrations of cpc the permeate flux was lower than the flux of pure water 63 1 l m2 h data not shown it can be because of the presence of cpc and anions in the feed solution as mentioned above due to the higher removal of arsenate compared to nitrate the permeate flux of nitrate was greater than that of arsenate reduction in membrane permeability is generally associated with surfactant deposition in the membrane pore or on the membrane surface 42 3 3 effect of cpc concentration on cpc rejection fig 4c indicates cpc rejection in terms of cpc concentration cpc rejection increased by increasing the feed cpc concentration and then decreased when cpc concentration increased to 5 mm cpc molecules at the membrane surface formed micelles and rejection of cpc for both arsenate and nitrate reached more than 96 at higher concentration of cpc 8 mm the cpc rejection decreased as discussed earlier when cpc concentration increased the mean micelle size decreased they might break into mono di and trimmers leading to the crossing of more micelles through the membrane 63 however the permeate cpc concentration was lower than the surfactant cmc 0 9 mm at concentrations higher than 5 mm 8 mm this is in fact a positive finding since surfactant leakage into the permeate is an important meuf parameter due to minimization of environmental issues and costs 3 4 effect of cpc concentration on simultaneous removal of arsenate and nitrate fig 5 a indicates the simultaneous removal of as v and no3 relative to cpc concentration the removal efficiency of as v in the presence of no3 was similar to removal efficiency without no3 this result showed that no3 does not inhibit the binding of as v to cationic micelles since binding of no3 to cpc micelles is related to the electrostatic attraction of negative charges of no3 to the positively charged head of cpc 41 however rejection of as v decreased by 3 4 at low cpc concentrations compared to the as cpc system this result was supported by the findings reported by iqbal et al 44 which showed a minor decline 4 8 in the removal of arsenate with nitrate and phosphate on the other hand as v decreased the removal of no3 compared to the no3 cpc system considering the binding competition on micelles sites in the presence of no3 as v bound to cpc micelles preferentially to no3 beak et al reported that rejection of ferricyanide with valence of 3 was higher than that of chromate with valence of 2 considering the ion valences ferricyanide showed a greater binding power than chromate for binding on oda surfactant micelles 37 3 5 effect of ph on removal efficiency and permeate flux the solution ph value has been identified as a most important factor during meuf process 38 the effect of feed ph on as v and no3 removal is presented in fig 5b as ph increases from 3 to 11 removal efficiency of as v and no3 increased from 81 2 to 99 7 and from 68 5 to 98 1 respectively at ph 6 9 arsenate ions are available in form of mono ionic h2aso4 while at ph 6 9 di ionic haso4 2 species of arsenate is dominant therefore at high ph di ionic species of arsenate can bind to more micelles which resulted in the increased removal efficiency of as v this finding is consistent with a study by gecol et al 64 who showed that the removal efficiency of as v was enhanced by increasing ph from 5 5 to 8 fig 5b shows that by increasing ph from 3 to 11 the removal efficiency of no3 increased it can be due to the fact that at low ph hno3 was formed which could cross the membrane easily while at higher ph hydroxyl ions in the solution increased and the membrane surface became negatively charged leading to the formation of a strong complex between micelles and membrane surface it can result in increased removal efficiency of no3 the previous studies supported these results 65 as presented in fig 5c by increasing ph the permeate flux reduced due to the structural change of micelles based on the findings by increasing ph from 3 to 11 the permeate flux of as v and no3 decreased from 35 2 to 3 4 and from 61 6 to 10 4 l m2 h respectively previous studies showed that smaller micelles are formed at low ph rather than high ph therefore presence of bigger micelles at higher ph led to the formation of a denser layer on the surface of the membrane resulting in reduced flux 66 in the all experiments ph was set in 7 8 because at this ph removal efficiency of anions was effective 3 6 effect of operating pressure on removal efficiency and permeate flux fig 6 a is present the effects of tmp on removal efficiency of as v and no3 the removal efficiency decreased with tmp which can be attributed to lower compact of micelles at high pressure 67 68 therefore anions molecules are extracted from micelles complex and pass through the membrane 41 based on the findings the removal efficiency of as v and no3 decreased from 98 9 to 86 2 and from 90 5 to 82 1 as tmp increased from 1 to 2 bar also according to fig 6b the permeate flux is greater at higher tmp due to a higher driving force which resulted in increased mass transport across the membrane as tmp increased from 1 to 2 bar the permeate flux increased from 11 1 to 23 4 l m2 h for as v and from 35 6 to 41 2 l m2 h for no3 similar results were reported by schwarze et al 66 who indicated that an increase in pressure caused a flux increase 3 7 removal mechanism according to donnan effect and steric hindrance the arsenic as and nitrate no3 removal depend on the membrane sieving mechanisms i donnan effect named after the american physicist josiah willard gibbs and the british chemist frederick g donnan and also known as the donnan law donnan equilibrium or gibbs donnan equilibrium and ii steric hindrance prevention or retardation of inter or intramolecular interactions due to the spatial structure of a molecule the no3 ion has a negative charge and as is also converted into arsenate as v in solution which has a negative charge in contrast the membrane is modified with cationic surfactant and therefore has a positive charge hence the membrane repels positively charged ions from surface of membrane consequently the concentration of positive ions increases in the solution so due to donnan exclusion no3 and as ions will be less close to the surface of the membrane so that their separation increase this phenomenon improves their removal efficiency regarding the steric hindrance the membrane is made up of polyacrylonitrile a macromolecular with molecular weight of 100 kda this macromolecule has several functional groups that will be charged due to ph changes therefore due to the steric hindrance phenomenon it prevents the ions getting close to the surface of the membrane and increase the efficiency 4 conclusions this study examined the performance of meuf process in the removal of as v and no3 from aqueous solutions using a prepared pan membrane and cpc as the cationic surfactant the pan uf membrane was produced by a phase inversion process and used in a dead end cell system the influence of cpc concentration solution ph and tmp was studied on the membrane performance in terms of permeate flux and removal efficiency of as v and no3 as well as rejection of cpc increasing the cpc concentration from 0 1 to 5 mm the removal efficiency of as v and no3 increased from 49 3 to 96 9 and from 0 3 to 90 5 while the permeate flux reduced from 36 6 to 10 2 l m2 h and from 54 2 to 33 3 l m2 h respectively the reduced flux can be attributed to the concentration polarization and gel layer of cpc increasing the cpc concentration to 8 mm removal of as v and no3 decreased which can be related to reduced mean micelle size and micelle aggregation at higher concentrations of cpc the concentration of cpc in the permeate was maintained below the cmc of cpc for preserving the concentration polarization layer in addition feasibility of simultaneous removal of as v and no3 by meuf was investigated the presence of as v ions in the solution decreased the removal efficiency of no3 whereas no3 removal was not majorly influenced by as v therefore as v preferentially binds on cpc micelles since its binding power on cpc micelles exceeds that of no3 this result shows that the prepared pan membrane could produce a high quality permeate at concentrations below the mcl of as v and no3 0 01 mg l and 11 3 mg l respectively under optimal conditions cpc

experiments experiments were performed at 25 3 c room temperature using a dead end uf cell with an effective membrane area of 12 4 cm2 and feed volume of 500 ml before each experiment the membrane was soaked in deionized water for 24 h and then compacted at a pressure of 1 bar for almost 1 h with deionized water the filtration system consisted of a 500 ml feed tank a nitrogen gas cylinder a stainless steel flat membrane module valves and pressure gauges fig 1 the feed solution was prepared by dissolving the predetermined amounts of cpc arsenate and nitrate in 300 ml of deionized water the solution ph was adjacent by 0 1 m hno3 or naoh a magnetic stirrer was used to stir the solution for 1 h at a constant speed of 300 rpm 31 42 rad s to obtain an efficient mixture then it was settled for 30 min to facilitate micelle formation the aqueous solution was subjected to the uf membrane 30 min after the onset of the experiment the experimental processes were terminated and the permeate samples were collected and analyzed the meuf experiments were designed to study the effects of some operating parameters concentration of cpc tmp and ph on the permeate flux and removal of pollutants and surfactant rejection all experiments were repeated 3 times and their average was reported after each experiment to recover the membrane permeability it was washed with 0 1 m naoh at 1

spectra aa 200 and ion chromatography ic metrohm 882 compact switzerland were performed to determine the concentrations of as v and nitrate respectively in the feed and permeate samples 55 56 the cpc concentration was measured by a uv vis spectrophotometer at 258 nm 1 also ph was determined using a ph meter 3510 jenway 3 results and discussion 3 1 uf membrane characterization the top surface and cross sectional sem morphology of prepared membrane are presented in fig 2 a and b prepared membrane had a symmetric structure the structure morphology of the membrane is associated with the rate of phase inversion in a water bath 57 this membrane has a top thin layer that functions as a selective barrier film for the solute this layer was supported by a finger like sub layer containing macro voids and microspores which increase the membrane mechanical strength xrd patterns of uf membrane is presented in fig 3 a pan membrane has diffraction peaks at 2θ 16 7 relating to the crystal plane of pan 58 the ftir spectra of pan membrane are shown in fig 3b the peaks of stretching vibration at 2246 cm 1 indicate the symmetrical cn stretching at 2929 cm 1 for ch stretch while the peaks at 1731 and 1664 cm 1 refer to co stretch co stretch is observed at 1037 cm 1 the edx spectrum of the uf membrane was shown in fig 3c which represents the weight percentage of the elements in the membrane structure such as carbon c nitrogen n and oxygen o fig 3d presents 3d afm images of the prepared membrane according to fig 3d the dark and bright areas indicate the valleys and the peaks on the membrane surface respectively with a magnification of 40 μm and surface roughness ra of 88 84 nm 3 2 effect of cpc concentration on removal efficiency and permeate flux fig 4 a indicates the effects of feed cpc concentration on the removal efficiency of as v and no3 the initial as v and no3 concentrations were respectively set at 1000 μg l and 100 mg l the system performance in as v and no3 removal was investigated at 25 c ph of 7 8 and tmp of 1 bar fig 4a shows that as v and no3 removal efficiency increased with an increase in the surfactant concentration this could be attributed to the concentration polarization during this process cpc concentration increased on the membrane surface and formed a gel layer adjacent to or on the membrane surface where micelles were formed to bind to anion molecules and cpc concentration reached cmc according to fig 4a with a further increase in cpc concentration 5 mm anion rejection decreased which could be due to reduced aggregation and mean size of micelles at higher cpc levels also active binding sites did not increase by increasing the feed cpc concentration 59 samper et al 36 confirmed this phenomenon also similar results were reported by some other researchers 41 43 theoretically no micelles were formed at cpc concentrations below cmc 0 9 mm therefore no no3 removal occurred nonetheless the rather high removal of as v 49 3 was observed this unanticipated rejection can be attributed to the negative membrane charge leading to arsenate repulsion donna exclusion effect 60 61 as the cpc value increased from 0 1 mm to 5 mm the rejection of as v and no3 increased from 49 3 to 96 9 and from 0 3 to 90 5 respectively this shown that negative charged anions bound with cationic surfactant micelles and removed from the aqueous solution by uf membrane the cationic surfactant micelles formed in aqueous phase can be bind with anionic arsenate species based on the absolute electrostatic potential and the high surface charge density in the next step the created micelles can be separated during uf because their size are physically too large to pass through membrane pores in cpc concentration of 5 mm removal efficiency of as v and no3 reaches below mcl 0 01 mg l and 11 3 mg l for arsenate and nitrate respectively tanhaei et al 41 removed 5 mg l aniline and 10 mg l nickel from aqueous solution after they were entrapped with sds micelles by uf membrane as shown in fig 4a the rejection of as v was higher than that of no3 at the same value of cpc because of the lower initial concentration of as v and also the higher valence of as v the same results were obtained by beak et al 62 who reported that the removal of chromate was higher than that of nitrate because the higher valence of chromate resulted in higher binding according to fig 4b the permeate flux reduced as the feed cpc concentration increased at cpc concentrations below cmc most cpc molecules can be found as free monomers which have a smaller size than the pore diameter monomers can move through the membrane easily under these conditions therefore the permeate flux is high as cpc concentration increased concentration polarization took place adjacent to or on the surface of membrane the membrane pores were blocked in a short period which resulted in membrane fouling increased hydraulic resistance and reduced flux at all concentrations of cpc the permeate flux was lower than the flux of pure water 63 1 l m2 h data not shown it can be because of the presence of cpc and anions in the feed solution as mentioned above due to the higher removal of arsenate compared to nitrate the permeate flux of nitrate was greater than that of arsenate reduction in membrane permeability is generally associated with surfactant deposition in the membrane pore or on the membrane surface 42 3 3 effect of cpc concentration on cpc rejection fig 4c indicates cpc rejection in terms of cpc concentration cpc rejection increased by increasing the feed cpc concentration and then decreased when cpc concentration increased to 5 mm cpc molecules at the membrane surface formed micelles and rejection of cpc for both arsenate and nitrate reached more than 96 at higher concentration of cpc 8 mm the cpc rejection decreased as discussed earlier when cpc concentration increased the mean micelle size decreased they might break into mono di and trimmers leading to the crossing of more micelles through the membrane 63 however the permeate cpc concentration was lower than the surfactant cmc 0 9 mm at concentrations higher than 5 mm 8 mm this is in fact a positive finding since surfactant leakage into the permeate is an important meuf parameter due to minimization of environmental issues and costs 3 4 effect of cpc concentration on simultaneous removal of arsenate and nitrate fig 5 a indicates the simultaneous removal of as v and no3 relative to cpc concentration the removal efficiency of as v in the presence of no3 was similar to removal efficiency without no3 this result showed that no3 does not inhibit the binding of as v to cationic micelles since binding of no3 to cpc micelles is related to the electrostatic attraction of negative charges of no3 to the positively charged head of cpc 41 however rejection of as v decreased by 3 4 at low cpc concentrations compared to the as cpc system this result was supported by the findings reported by iqbal et al 44 which showed a minor decline 4 8 in the removal of arsenate with nitrate and phosphate on the other hand as v decreased the removal of no3 compared to the no3 cpc system considering the binding competition on micelles sites in the presence of no3 as v bound to cpc micelles preferentially to no3 beak et al reported that rejection of ferricyanide with valence of 3 was higher than that of chromate with valence of 2 considering the ion valences ferricyanide showed a greater binding power than chromate for binding on oda surfactant micelles 37 3 5 effect of ph on removal efficiency and permeate flux the solution ph value has been identified as a most important factor during meuf process 38 the effect of feed ph on as v and no3 removal is presented in fig 5b as ph increases from 3 to 11 removal efficiency of as v and no3 increased from 81 2 to 99 7 and from 68 5 to 98 1 respectively at ph 6 9 arsenate ions are available in form of mono ionic h2aso4 while at ph 6 9 di ionic haso4 2 species of arsenate is dominant therefore at high ph di ionic species of arsenate can bind to more micelles which resulted in the increased removal efficiency of as v this finding is consistent with a study by gecol et al 64 who showed that the removal efficiency of as v was enhanced by increasing ph from 5 5 to 8 fig 5b shows that by increasing ph from 3 to 11 the removal efficiency of no3 increased it can be due to the fact that at low ph hno3 was formed which could cross the membrane easily while at higher ph hydroxyl ions in the solution increased and the membrane surface became negatively charged leading to the formation of a strong complex between micelles and membrane surface it can result in increased removal efficiency of no3 the previous studies supported these results 65 as presented in fig 5c by increasing ph the permeate flux reduced due to the structural change of micelles based on the findings by increasing ph from 3 to 11 the permeate flux of as v and no3 decreased from 35 2 to 3 4 and from 61 6 to 10 4 l m2 h respectively previous studies showed that smaller micelles are formed at low ph rather than high ph therefore presence of bigger micelles at higher ph led to the formation of a denser layer on the surface of the membrane resulting in reduced flux 66 in the all experiments ph was set in 7 8 because at this ph removal efficiency of anions was effective 3 6 effect of operating pressure on removal efficiency and permeate flux fig 6 a is present the effects of tmp on removal efficiency of as v and no3 the removal efficiency decreased with tmp which can be attributed to lower compact of micelles at high pressure 67 68 therefore anions molecules are extracted from micelles complex and pass through the membrane 41 based on the findings the removal efficiency of as v and no3 decreased from 98 9 to 86 2 and from 90 5 to 82 1 as tmp increased from 1 to 2 bar also according to fig 6b the permeate flux is greater at higher tmp due to a higher driving force which resulted in increased mass transport across the membrane as tmp increased from 1 to 2 bar the permeate flux increased from 11 1 to 23 4 l m2 h for as v and from 35 6 to 41 2 l m2 h for no3 similar results were reported by schwarze et al 66 who indicated that an increase in pressure caused a flux increase 3 7 removal mechanism according to donnan effect and steric hindrance the arsenic as and nitrate no3 removal depend on the membrane sieving mechanisms i donnan effect named after the american physicist josiah willard gibbs and the british chemist frederick g donnan and also known as the donnan law donnan equilibrium or gibbs donnan equilibrium and ii steric hindrance prevention or retardation of inter or intramolecular interactions due to the spatial structure of a molecule the no3 ion has a negative charge and as is also converted into arsenate as v in solution which has a negative charge in contrast the membrane is modified with cationic surfactant and therefore has a positive charge hence the membrane repels positively charged ions from surface of membrane consequently the concentration of positive ions increases in the solution so due to donnan exclusion no3 and as ions will be less close to the surface of the membrane so that their separation increase this phenomenon improves their removal efficiency regarding the steric hindrance the membrane is made up of polyacrylonitrile a macromolecular with molecular weight of 100 kda this macromolecule has several functional groups that will be charged due to ph changes therefore due to the steric hindrance phenomenon it prevents the ions getting close to the surface of the membrane and increase the efficiency 4 conclusions this study examined the performance of meuf process in the removal of as v and no3 from aqueous solutions using a prepared pan membrane and cpc as the cationic surfactant the pan uf membrane was produced by a phase inversion process and used in a dead end cell system the influence of cpc concentration solution ph and tmp was studied on the membrane performance in terms of permeate flux and removal efficiency of as v and no3 as well as rejection of cpc increasing the cpc concentration from 0 1 to 5 mm the removal efficiency of as v and no3 increased from 49 3 to 96 9 and from 0 3 to 90 5 while the permeate flux reduced from 36 6 to 10 2 l m2 h and from 54 2 to 33 3 l m2 h respectively the reduced flux can be attributed to the concentration polarization and gel layer of cpc increasing the cpc concentration to 8 mm removal of as v and no3 decreased which can be related to reduced mean micelle size and micelle aggregation at higher concentrations of cpc the concentration of cpc in the permeate was maintained below the cmc of cpc for preserving the concentration polarization layer in addition feasibility of simultaneous removal of as v and no3 by meuf was investigated the presence of as v ions in the solution decreased the removal efficiency of no3 whereas no3 removal was not majorly influenced by as v therefore as v preferentially binds on cpc micelles since its binding power on cpc micelles exceeds that of no3 this result shows that the prepared pan membrane could produce a high quality permeate at concentrations below the mcl of as v and no3 0 01 mg l and 11 3 mg l respectively under optimal conditions cpc

coliform bacteria was also tested using dip bag and was found to be equally effective keywords moringa oleifera anti bacterial water purification 1 introduction water is the foundation of life and is used for numerous purposes by humans but the level of purity of the water being consumed is very crucial since it has a direct effect on health while over 70 of the earth s surface is covered by water most of it is unusable for human consumption the treatment of water to make it fit for human consumption has become a problem of central importance both in developing and in developed countries a large population depends on the natural resources of water for their drinking and other needs but urbanization and infrastructure development lead to the contamination of the natural water sources as explained in the recent studies 1 3 about one billion people lack uncontaminated drinking water and above six million people of which 2 million are children die because of diarrhea every year 4 waterborne ailments still kill on the average 25 000 people every day in developing countries while millions suffer the devastating effects of these ailments about 75 of the present world population live in the developing countries and about 80 of all ailments in developing countries are water related e g cholera diarrhea dysentery etc in developed countries water purification processes use chemicals despite the fact that their safety for health during long term use and impact on the environment remain under question synthetic coagulants such as aluminum sulfate alum have been widely used in water treatment for coagulation ﬂocculation processes it was evident that aluminum based coagulants led to the development of alzheimer s disease in humans 5 due to challenges related with the use of current water treatment methods there is a great demand for substitute coagulants of natural origin which are effectual cost effective readily available non toxic and require minimal maintenance and operator skills 6 8 for centuries surface water have been treated traditionally using herbs as natural coagulants in india ripe seeds of strychnos potatorum wiry roots of the rhizome of vetiveria zizanioides seed coats of elettaria cardamomum and leaves from phyllantus emblica were popular for their use in water treatment 9 another natural alternative for water purification is the seeds of moringa oleifera mo the world health organization who has been reviewing the use of mo for many years as a low cost supplement enhancer in the underprivileged countries around the world 10 mo is a tropical plant and it is among the 14 species of trees that belong to the family moringaceae it is extensively distributed in india the philippines sri lanka thailand malaysia burma pakistan singapore the west indies cuba jamaica and nigeria 11 it is believed to be native to india but is now grown in a most tropical climate of the world 12 the edible plant is widely consumed as a result of its extremely attributed nutritional and medicinal value it is a versatile tree whose seeds contain a high quality edible oil up to 40 by weight and a water soluble cationic protein having a molecular weight of about 6 kda and isoelectric ph value of 10 and 11 13 14 the powdered seeds of the mo are not harmful to humans and have coagulating properties that have been used for various aspects of water treatment such as turbidity alkalinity total dissolved solids and hardness 15 18 mo seeds further showed coagulant activity like aluminum sulfate 19 21 apart from turbidity exclusion mo can be exploited as an antimicrobial flocculant for water clarification 22 the extracted part of mo seed prevents the growth of total bacteria and coliforms in raw water 15 16 18 23 researchers have also investigated the coagulative capability of mo seeds to reduce turbidity and to determine the effectiveness of solar disinfection for the inactivation of escherichia coli and coliforms on various turbid waters 24 use of mo seed extract as a primary coagulant for a local river water source was studied with respect to turbidity removal and total coliform reduction 25 mo seeds were reported to have a bacterial removal range of 90 99 and it has signiﬁcantly removed the number of c parvum oocysts in wastewater compared with a natural sedimentation of 90 min 26 27 to investigate the coagulation activity of mo seed powder conventional jar tests were used 28 31 the present study was attempted to develop an innovative water purification technology in the form of dip bag using readily and locally available mo seeds this safe and cost effective product can be used to purify drinking water at every doorstep and as a consequence of which the incidence of water borne ailments among the population can be reduced 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection mo seeds were collected from three different regions of the country i e s1 agra district of uttar pradesh s2 mandi

change appeared was taken as the mic value of aqueous mo seed extract against different test strains 2 5 development of a portable water purification kit semi permeable container in the form of dipbag containing mo s3 seed powder was developed as a water purifier fig 1 this dipbag was used for treating water samples inoculated with various pathogenic strains and the water collected from different natural water sources different parameters such as minimum time and seed quantity required for the anti bacterial activity of dipbag were optimized to standardize the minimum time essential for the activity of dipbag experiments for different time intervals i e 180 min 120 min 60 min 30 min 25 min 20 min 15 min 10 min 5 min were performed against all the test strains to standardize the seed quantity for a single dipbag various quantities of seed i e 30 mg l 50 mg l 100 mg l were analyzed against pathogenic strain of e coli information for anti microbial activity and anti fungal activity

seeds was not reported in any of the research articles the protocol for the experiments was standardized in the molecular plant microbe interaction laboratory shoolini university of biotechnology and management sciences solan india for this study two autoclaved reagent bottles were taken each of them containing 1 l of milliq water 100 μl of test strain of od600 0 45 was inoculated in both the

their morphological differences the seed morphological study showed a wide range of variations among different seed characters size shape weight and color study about seed size revealed that the seeds showed different size and weight maximum size and weight were noted in s3 1 8 1 2 cm 300 mg seed followed by s2 1 8 1 cm 150 mg seed and s1 1 0 8 cm 100 mg seed the shape of s1 s2 s3 seeds was found to be oval lenticular and elliptic respectively the color was found to be pale yellow green cream and dark brown for s1 s2 and s3 respectively fig 1 3 2 anti bacterial activity of aqueous seed extract of moringa oleifera aqueous extract of mo seeds was prepared in different concentrations as described in section 2 3 however significant results were only obtained at a concentration of 100 mg ml of aqueous mo seed extract which showed 28 75 0 707 mm of inhibition zone against e coli 26 0 0 707 mm against s aureus 26 75 0 mm against s typhi 29 75 0 707 mm against p aeruginosa in the present study the anti bacterial efficacy of aqueous mo seed extract was also checked against an antibiotic resistant bacterial strain mrsa which showed effective results i e 25 5 0 707 mm of inhibition zone and this bacterial strain was not found to be tested in already reported studies table 1 and fig 2 results revealed that the aqueous mo seed extract was effective against all the five bacterial strains ampicillin positive control 10 μl at a concentration of 100 mg ml showed 31 75 0 707 mm 27 75 0 mm 26 5 0 707 mm 32 75 0 707 mm 32 0 0 707 mm of inhibition zone against e coli s aureus s typhi p aeruginosa and mrsa respectively milliq water negative control showed no inhibition zone in any of the test strains 100 mg ml of aqueous mo seed extract was also found to be bactericidal against all the studied strains the antibacterial activity of aqueous mo seed extract was in close agreement with the findings of saadabi and abu zaid 34 the inhibition zone of 32 0 11 mm against s aureus 31 0 90 mm against b subtilis 18 1 96 mm against e coli 20 0 76 mm against p aeruginosa 11 0 41 mm against a niger was observed with extract concentration of 5 i e 200 mg ml which was higher than the extract concentration 100 mg ml used in the present study the outcomes of their study showed an increase in inhibition zone with an increase in extract concentration from 5 to 40 it was also testified that the aqueous mo seed extract was more effectual than the methanol extract showing inhibition zone of 11 1 98 mm against s aureus 12 95 0 99 mm against b subtilis 14 0 22 mm against e coli 12 77 0 65 mm against p aeruginosa when the extract concentration was 10 i e 400 mg ml another group of scientists 35 isolated s aureus e coli and v cholerae from shrimp extract and studied that 200 mg ml of water based moringa extracts efficiently repressed the growth of these bacterial strains the zone of inhibition was found to be less when correlated with the conclusions of the present study i e 22 mm against s aureus 22 mm against v cholerae and 17 mm against e coli even when the extract concentration was higher than the concentration used in the present investigation bukar et al 36 also evaluated the anti bacterial efficacy of ethanolic extracts of mo seeds which were found to be effective against three bacterial strains with s aureus 10 mm and e coli 7 mm being susceptible to the lowest concentration of 50 mg ml s typhi 10 mm was only susceptible to the extract at 200 mg ml concentration mo seed chloroform extract was effective against two bacterial strains with e coli 9 mm and s typhimurium 9 mm only susceptible to the concentration of 100 mg ml it was quantified that the mo seed chloroform extract showed lower anti bacterial activity compared to ethanol extract of mo seed and even inferior when compared to the aqueous mo seed extract used in the present study however in the present investigation the zones of inhibition were larger using only 100 mg ml concentration of aqueous seed extract a team of scientists 37 assayed mo seed extracts for the evaluation of antimicrobial activity against bacterial p multocida b subtilis e coli and s aureus and fungal f solani and r solani strains which is different from the present study in terms of microbial strains tested in this study crude samples showed very strong activity against f solani 37 5 mm b subtilis 36 mm and s aureus 31 mm but showed almost no activity against r solani 9 mm and less activity against p multocida 21 mm a niger 2 mm m anisopliae 26 mm and e coli 20 mm whereas poor activity of supernatant was found against r solani p multocida b subtilis s aureus and moderate activity against e coli a niger and m anisopliae the mo seed extract was more susceptible for the bacterial strains as compared to the fungal strains however in this instance the moringa extracts were prepared in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer ph 7 by a ratio of 1 2 w v phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride 10 mm pmsf was added as a

14459,the purpose of this study was to develop a water purification kit using seeds of moringa oleifera mo for this purpose aqueous extract of mo seeds was investigated for antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacterial strains viz escherichia coli pseudomonas aeruginosa staphylococcus aureus salmonella typhi and mrsa methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus it was determined that 100 mg ml of extract of mo seeds was effective against these bacterial strains resulting in 28 75 0 707 mm of inhibition zone against e coli 26 0 0 707 mm against s aureus 26 75 0 mm against s typhi 29 75 0 707 mm against p aeruginosa and 25 5 0 707 mm against mrsa mic minimum inhibitory concentration of 12 5 0 mg ml against e coli and 6 25 0 mg ml against s aureus p aeruginosa s typhi and mrsa was obtained accordingly portable water purification kit in the form of a dip bag enclosing extremely safe and edible mo seed powder was developed as a key to drinking water problem water purification was performed using dip bag to treat pathogenic strains inoculated in water the minimum time and seed quantity required for the anti bacterial activity of seeds was optimized and was noted that a single dip bag containing 100 mg of mo seed powder was capable of eradicating 99 9 of the microbial load from 1 l of water in a time span of 5 min drinking water from natural water resources containing coliform bacteria was also tested using dip bag and was found to be equally effective keywords moringa oleifera anti bacterial water purification 1 introduction water is the foundation of life and is used for numerous purposes by humans but the level of purity of the water being consumed is very crucial since it has a direct effect on health while over 70 of the earth s surface is covered by water most of it is unusable for human consumption the treatment of water to make it fit for human consumption has become a problem of central importance both in developing and in developed countries a large population depends on the natural resources of water for their drinking and other needs but urbanization and infrastructure development lead to the contamination of the natural water sources as explained in the recent studies 1 3 about one billion people lack uncontaminated drinking water and above six million people of which 2 million are children die because of diarrhea every year 4 waterborne ailments still kill on the average 25 000 people every day in developing countries while millions suffer the devastating effects of these ailments about 75 of the present world population live in the developing countries and about 80 of all ailments in developing countries are water related e g cholera diarrhea dysentery etc in developed countries water purification processes use chemicals despite the fact that their safety for health during long term use and impact on the environment remain under question synthetic coagulants such as aluminum sulfate alum have been widely used in water treatment for coagulation ﬂocculation processes it was evident that aluminum based coagulants led to the development of alzheimer s disease in humans 5 due to challenges related with the use of current water treatment methods there is a great demand for substitute coagulants of natural origin which are effectual cost effective readily available non toxic and require minimal maintenance and operator skills 6 8 for centuries surface water have been treated traditionally using herbs as natural coagulants in india ripe seeds of strychnos potatorum wiry roots of the rhizome of vetiveria zizanioides seed coats of elettaria cardamomum and leaves from phyllantus emblica were popular for their use in water treatment 9 another natural alternative for water purification is the seeds of moringa oleifera mo the world health organization who has been reviewing the use of mo for many years as a low cost supplement enhancer in the underprivileged countries around the world 10 mo is a tropical plant and it is among the 14 species of trees that belong to the family moringaceae it is extensively distributed in india the philippines sri lanka thailand malaysia burma pakistan singapore the west indies cuba jamaica and nigeria 11 it is believed to be native to india but is now grown in a most tropical climate of the world 12 the edible plant is widely consumed as a result of its extremely attributed nutritional and medicinal value it is a versatile tree whose seeds contain a high quality edible oil up to 40 by weight and a water soluble cationic protein having a molecular weight of about 6 kda and isoelectric ph value of 10 and 11 13 14 the powdered seeds of the mo are not harmful to humans and have coagulating properties that have been used for various aspects of water treatment such as turbidity alkalinity total dissolved solids and hardness 15 18 mo seeds further showed coagulant activity like aluminum sulfate 19 21 apart from turbidity exclusion mo can be exploited as an antimicrobial flocculant for water clarification 22 the extracted part of mo seed prevents the growth of total bacteria and coliforms in raw water 15 16 18 23 researchers have also investigated the coagulative capability of mo seeds to reduce turbidity and to determine the effectiveness of solar disinfection for the inactivation of escherichia coli and coliforms on various turbid waters 24 use of mo seed extract as a primary coagulant for a local river water source was studied with respect to turbidity removal and total coliform reduction 25 mo seeds were reported to have a bacterial removal range of 90 99 and it has signiﬁcantly removed the number of c parvum oocysts in wastewater compared with a natural sedimentation of 90 min 26 27 to investigate the coagulation activity of mo seed powder conventional jar tests were used 28 31 the present study was attempted to develop an innovative water purification technology in the form of dip bag using readily and locally available mo seeds this safe and cost effective product can be used to purify drinking water at every doorstep and as a consequence of which the incidence of water borne ailments among the population can be reduced 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection mo seeds were collected from three different regions of the country i e s1 agra district of uttar pradesh s2 mandi district of himachal pradesh and s3 maharashtra fig 1 the hulls and wings were detached from the seed kernels and then these kernels were crushed and grounded to a fine powder using pestle mortar 2 2 collection of test organisms the bacterial strains used during study viz escherichia coli mtcc 82 staphylococcus aureus mtcc 96 pseudomonas aeruginosa mtcc 2453 salmonella typhi mtcc734 and mrsa methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus standard strain ca 05 sccmec type iv were obtained from parasitology laboratory of shoolini university of biotechnology and management sciences solan india these strains were grown in nutrient broth and were maintained on nutrient agar plates incubated at 37 c for 14 16 h 2 3 qualitative assay the sensitivity of various test strains to the aqueous mo seed extract s3 was assayed by using the slightly modified agar well diffusion method 32 aqueous extract of mo seeds was prepared in different concentrations i e 1 mg ml 10 mg ml 20 mg ml 50 mg ml and 100 mg ml to evaluate its anti bacterial efficacy against test organisms the bacterial colonies 2 3 colonies of different strains to be tested were suspended in 1 ml of normal saline 0 85 the test strain was then inoculated on the nutrient agar plate and spread with a sterilized swab to obtain a lawn culture 100 μl of aqueous mo seed extract 100 mg ml 10 μl 100 mg ml stock of positive control ampicillin and 10 μl of negative control milliq water was placed in the wells made in the nutrient agar plate after incubation of 14 16 h at 37 c the diameter of the zone of inhibition was measured the experiment was also conducted to check the bactericidal and bacteriostatic nature of aqueous mo seed extract against all the test strains 2 4 quantitative assay the minimum inhibitory concentration mic was taken as the lowermost concentration of anti bacterial agent that will inhibit the observable growth of test microorganism mic of the extract was evaluated by the broth dilution method described under clsi 33 100 μl of aqueous mo seed extract s3 100 mg ml was used to check its mic against various pathogenic strains in a 96 welled microtiter plate 10 μl of ampicillin 100 mg ml stock was taken as a positive control and 10 μl of milliq water was taken as a negative control for all the bacterial strains plates were incubated at 37 c for 24 h after incubation resazurin sodium dye was added in the wells of a microtiter plate for visualizing the results the growth was indicated by a change in color from purple to pink or colorless the lowest concentration at which color change appeared was taken as the mic value of aqueous mo seed extract against different test strains 2 5 development of a portable water purification kit semi permeable container in the form of dipbag containing mo s3 seed powder was developed as a water purifier fig 1 this dipbag was used for treating water samples inoculated with various pathogenic strains and the water collected from different natural water sources different parameters such as minimum time and seed quantity required for the anti bacterial activity of dipbag were optimized to standardize the minimum time essential for the activity of dipbag experiments for different time intervals i e 180 min 120 min 60 min 30 min 25 min 20 min 15 min 10 min 5 min were performed against all the test strains to standardize the seed quantity for a single dipbag various quantities of seed i e 30 mg l 50 mg l 100 mg l were analyzed against pathogenic strain of e coli information for anti microbial activity and anti fungal activity of aqueous mo seed extract is available in the literature but statistical data for the standardization of minimum time and minimum seed quantity required for purifying certain volume of water using mo seeds was not reported in any of the research articles the protocol for the experiments was standardized in the molecular plant microbe interaction laboratory shoolini university of biotechnology and management sciences solan india for this study two autoclaved reagent bottles were taken each of them containing 1 l of milliq water 100 μl of test strain of od600 0 45 was inoculated in both the bottles one of these bottles was kept as a control and the other one as a test dipbag was used to treat the contaminated water sample test by mixing for the initial 10 min of experiment and then incubation for 180 min at room temperature 200 μl of sample from both the test and control was taken for making dilutions 1 5 at all the above mentioned time intervals i e 5 180 min 150 μl of diluted samples were spread on the nutrient agar plates plates were then incubated at 37 c for 14 16 h after incubation cfu colony forming unit ml count of all the plates was noted in another set of experiments defatted seeds were also used for treating contaminated water samples for defatting of seeds the 100 mg of seed powder was mixed with 10 ml of hexane followed by mixing for 30 min the mixture was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant was discarded and the residue was dried at room temperature dipbag containing this dried powder was then used for the experiments 2 5 1 microbial isolation and identification dip bag was also tested for its efficiency against the other contaminants present in water samples collected from natural water resources macconkey agar media and eosin methylene blue media was used for the isolation and identification of microbes present in the water samples collected from natural water resources phenol red mannitol broth was used for mannitol fermentation studies of microbes an inoculum from the pure culture was transferred to the mannitol broth followed by incubation at 37 c for 24 h after incubation a color change from red to yellow was visualized indicating the presence of fermenting bacteria 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological evaluation of collected seeds all the collected seed samples were evaluated based on their morphological differences the seed morphological study showed a wide range of variations among different seed characters size shape weight and color study about seed size revealed that the seeds showed different size and weight maximum size and weight were noted in s3 1 8 1 2 cm 300 mg seed followed by s2 1 8 1 cm 150 mg seed and s1 1 0 8 cm 100 mg seed the shape of s1 s2 s3 seeds was found

of moringa oleifera aqueous extract of mo seeds was prepared in different concentrations as described in section 2 3 however significant results were only obtained at a concentration of 100 mg ml of aqueous mo seed extract which showed 28 75 0 707 mm of inhibition zone against e coli 26 0 0 707 mm against s aureus 26 75 0 mm against s typhi 29 75 0 707 mm against p aeruginosa in the present study the anti bacterial efficacy of aqueous mo seed extract was also checked against an antibiotic resistant bacterial strain mrsa which showed effective results i e 25 5 0 707 mm of inhibition zone and this bacterial strain was not found to be tested in already reported studies table 1 and fig 2 results revealed that the aqueous mo seed extract was effective against all the five bacterial strains ampicillin positive control 10 μl at a concentration of 100 mg ml showed 31 75 0 707 mm 27 75 0 mm 26 5 0 707 mm 32 75 0 707 mm 32 0 0 707 mm of inhibition zone against e coli s aureus s typhi p aeruginosa and mrsa respectively milliq water negative control showed no inhibition zone in any of the test strains 100 mg ml of aqueous mo seed extract was also found to be bactericidal against all the studied strains the antibacterial activity of aqueous mo seed extract was in close agreement with the findings of saadabi and abu zaid 34 the inhibition zone of 32 0 11 mm against s aureus 31 0 90 mm against b subtilis 18 1 96 mm against e coli 20 0 76 mm against p aeruginosa 11 0 41 mm against a niger was observed with extract concentration of 5 i e 200 mg ml which was higher than the extract concentration 100 mg ml used in the present study the outcomes of their study showed an increase in inhibition zone with an increase in extract concentration from 5 to 40 it was also testified that the aqueous mo seed extract was more effectual than the methanol extract showing inhibition zone of 11 1 98 mm against s aureus 12 95 0 99 mm against b subtilis 14 0 22 mm against e coli 12 77 0 65 mm against p aeruginosa when the extract concentration was 10 i e 400 mg ml another group of scientists 35 isolated s aureus e coli and v cholerae from shrimp extract and studied that 200 mg ml of water based moringa extracts efficiently repressed the growth of these bacterial strains the zone of inhibition was found to be less when correlated with the conclusions of the present study i e 22 mm against s aureus 22 mm against v cholerae and 17 mm against e coli even when the extract concentration was higher than the concentration used in the present investigation bukar et al 36 also evaluated the anti bacterial efficacy of ethanolic extracts of mo seeds which were found to be effective against three bacterial strains with s aureus 10 mm and e coli 7 mm being susceptible to the lowest concentration of 50 mg ml s typhi 10 mm was only susceptible to the extract at 200 mg ml concentration mo seed chloroform extract was effective against two bacterial strains with e coli 9 mm and s typhimurium 9 mm only susceptible to the concentration of 100 mg ml it was quantified that the mo seed chloroform extract showed lower anti bacterial activity compared to ethanol extract of mo seed and even inferior when compared to the aqueous mo seed extract used in the present study however in the present investigation the zones of inhibition were larger using only 100 mg ml concentration of aqueous seed extract a team of scientists 37 assayed mo seed extracts for the evaluation of antimicrobial activity against bacterial p multocida b subtilis e coli and s aureus and fungal f solani and r solani strains which is different from the present study in terms of microbial strains tested in this study crude samples showed very strong activity against f solani 37 5 mm b subtilis 36 mm and s aureus 31 mm but showed almost no activity against r solani 9 mm and less activity against p multocida 21 mm a niger 2 mm m anisopliae 26 mm and e coli 20 mm whereas poor activity of supernatant was

of treatment table 3 and fig 3 it clearly indicates the very high efficiency of mo seed powder towards the elimination of bacterial contamination from water even in a short span of 5 min 3 4 2 optimization of seed quantity using 30 mg of mo s3 seed powder the cfu ml count for control in water was 5 46 10³ 0 282 and 5 22 10³ 0 777 after 10 min and 5 min of incubation respectively with an increase in time intervals from 5 min to 10 min the cfu ml count in test samples was observed to be decreasing from 3 06 10³ 0 to 1 06 10³ 0 282 table 4 and fig 4 using 50 mg of mo s3 seed extract the cfu ml count for control in water was 5 46 10³ 0 282 and 5 22 10³ 0 777 after 10 min and 5 min of incubation respectively the cfu ml count in test samples was observed to be decreasing from 1 52 10³ 0 141 to 1 04 10³ 0 424 after increasing time interval from 5 min to 10 min of incubation table 4 and fig 4 using 100 mg of mo s3 seed extract the cfu ml count for control was 12 26 10³ 0 212 and 10 28 10³ 0 after 10 min and 5 min of incubation respectively however no colonies were noticed in test samples at all time points tested table 4 and fig 4 the experiments which were performed using defatted seeds also gave similar results it indicates that 100 mg of seed powder s3 was enough for the removal of pathogenic bacterial isolates from drinking water in a short span of 5 min consequently it was noted that a single dip bag containing 100 mg of mo s3 seed powder has the potential to eliminate 99 9 of the test strain inoculated in 1 l of water in a time span of 5 min minimum time and seed quantity essential for the anti bacterial activity of dip bag containing seed powder of s1 and s2 was also optimized and found to be the same as that of s3 using 100 mg of mo s1 and s2 seed extract the cfu ml count for control in water was 4 88 10³ 0 353 and 4 6 10³ 0 353 after 10 min and 5 min of incubation respectively however no colonies were observed in test samples after the same time intervals table 5 and fig 5 the efficiency of dip bag was also tested against contaminated water samples collected from various natural water sources it was observed that a single dip bag containing 100 mg of mo seed powder s3 was able to eradicate all the bacterial contaminations from the water sample in the same amount of time fig 6 microbes present in the water control were isolated on the selected media and light pink cream and purple colored colonies were observed confirming the presence of coliform bacteria the mannitol fermentation studies further confirmed the fermenting nature of microbes table 6 thakur and panda 3 investigated the piped water sources groundwater sources and natural water sources from various parts of district kangra himachal pradesh and all the collected samples were found to be contaminated with coliforms suggesting the need of a proper water purification strategy another group of scientists 41 also tested the water samples collected from drainage in the residential area of ahmadu bello university main campus zaria and further investigation showed the presence of coliforms in the water samples these results were like the findings of the present investigation 4 conclusions a large population depends on the natural resources of water for their drinking and other needs but urbanization and infrastructure development leads to the contamination of the natural water resources as evident from recent studies 1 3 this study was conducted to develop an inexpensive and environmentally friendly water purification kit based on mo seed extract in the form of dip bag the antibacterial activity of aqueous mo seed extract against various pathogenic strains was investigated by agar well diffusion and mic method both these methods gave positive results further the minimum time and minimum seed quantity requisite for the anti bacterial activity of mo seeds was optimized to develop a portable water purifier dipbag containing 100 mg of mo seed powder was effective in eliminating 99 9 of bacterial contamination from the water in a time span of 5 min only dipbag has numerous advantages over the existing water purification technologies it will not involve any kind of water wastage chemical treatment and will also retain the water quality it will be very cost effective and will not require any expert knowledge before using it is easily portable and can also be effectively used during traveling time acknowledgments authors are thankful to hon ble vice chancellor shoolini university of biotechnology and management sciences for providing
