3315,land use can impact dissolved organic matter dom dynamics directly by changing terrestrial loading in anthropogenic areas and indirectly by promoting in situ phytoplankton production due to the high load of nutrients however understanding how land use and phytoplankton community interact to affect dom quantity and quality is deficient to tease apart the synergistic effects of land use and phytoplankton on dom dynamics fluorescence spectroscopy with parallel factor analysis parafac and mediation analysis was performed in this study parafac produced three components that had two humic like c1 and c2 and a protein like c3 fluorescent components significantly related to anthropogenic land use cropland urban area and phytoplankton concentration p 0 05 through the mediation analysis the altered c1 and c3 at sites with a higher proportion of anthropogenic land use appeared to originate partly as a result of the phytoplankton production fueled by a high load of nutrients from anthropogenic run off 26 6 and 12 5 these results suggested phytoplankton significantly mediated the effects of land use on microbial humic like and protein like dom additionally redundancy analysis rda results further showed that phormidium cyanophyta had a notable influence on the production of the protein like component via phytoplankton conversely the decreases in terrestrial humic like c2 were mainly attributed to the reduced terrestrial loading in anthropogenic areas these findings provide insights into the roles of land use and phytoplankton communities in dom dynamics and advance our understanding of the mechanisms that drive dom composition patterns keywords dissolved organic matter anthropogenic land use phytoplankton community mediation analysis parallel factor analysis 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is widely distributed in the natural waters and closely related to the biogeochemical cycle of aquatic environments lynch et al 2019 wang et al 2019 changes in dom quantity and quality have profound implications for aquatic ecology through affecting food web dynamics water quality carbon storage and metal transport yamashita and jaffé 2008 zhang et al 2013 as well high concentrations of dom can react with disinfectants to produce carcinogenic contaminants and induce microbial regrowth in the water supply network to threaten drinking water quality and human health tomlinson et al 2016 shi et al 2020 thus the influencing factors and mechanisms of dom quantity and quality have received growing attention zhang et al 2011 organelli and claustre 2019 shi et al 2020 dom in the aquatic ecosystem could be both allochthonous and autochthonous origin carstea et al 2009 mostofa et al 2013 the dom quantity and quality depend on a combination of its source and the in situ biogeochemical processes which could be affected by a series of natural and anthropogenic factors i e land use types morphology microbial activity and phytoplankton production within the watershed williams et al 2010 zhuang and yang 2018 khamis et al 2018 lynch et al 2019 watershed land use affects the amounts of terrestrial organic matter inputted to river ecosystems and autochthonous dom production and cycling baker and spencer 2004 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 williams et al 2010 cropland and anthropogenic land cover result in an extensive discharge of anthropogenic run off which tends to increase the inorganic nutrient in rivers above levels found in rivers with more natural land use cover boyer et al 2002 mattsson et al 2009 in aquatic ecosystems high trophic states caused by elevated inorganic nutrient levels can give rise to phytoplankton which could in turn promote dom production sickman et al 2010 wei et al 2019 thus land use can shape dom quantity and quality in rivers both directly by affecting terrestrial loading and indirectly by affecting river autochthonous production and organic matter processing rates similarly phytoplankton production and organic matter cycling can be directly controlled by the source quantity and quality of dom findlay et al 2001 asmala et al 2018 however a thorough understanding of how land use and phytoplankton community interact to affect dom quantity and quality is lacking in aquatic ecosystems the optical properties of dom are conducive to the inferences of the source amount and component of dom blough 2002 jaffé et al 2008 the ultraviolet visible uv vis absorbance and fluorescent characteristics of dom have been utilized to identify its components and trace its dynamics in multiple aquatic environments mcknight et al 2001 weishaar et al 2003 cory and mcknight 2005 coble 2007 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 previous studies have identified changes in terrestrial microbial and in situ characteristics of dom with land use by using uv visible optical properties of dom baker and spencer 2004 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 excitation emission matrices eems coupled with parallel factor analysis parafac is deemed an effective technique to reveal and quantify different dom fluorophore groups due to its simplicity and sensitivity stedmon and markager 2005 zhang et al 2009 organelli and claustre 2019 for example stedmon and markager 2005 observed enriched terrestrial humic like components in forest and agricultural areas yet more abundant uva absorbing humic like components in agricultural and wastewater treatment areas suggesting the terrestrial and anthropogenic influences on dom combining in situ monitoring and phytoplankton degradation experiment zhang et al 2009 found a rapid increase in two humic like fluorophores during the experiment indicating phytoplankton as an important dom producer in the eutrophic shallow lake in the north atlantic subtropical gyre the temporal dynamics of coloured dissolved organic matter cdom are strongly correlated with the chlorophyll concentration suggesting the direct production of dom via phytoplankton metabolism and the strong dependence of dom dynamics on the abundance of phytoplankton organelli and claustre 2019 although the effect of land use and phytoplankton community on quality and quantity of dom has been investigated separately it remains uncertain the cause of the shifts in the quantity and quality of dom related to land use alteration of terrestrial dom sources autochthonous production of dom or both as fluorescence metrics have yet to be able to distinguish specific fluorescent signals between the anthropogenic source and phytoplankton excretion few studies have been able to tease apart the synergistic effects of land use and phytoplankton on dom dynamics in inland rivers which are highly vulnerable to anthropogenic influences the weihe river is a typical inland river in the yellow river basin and its ecosystem health is related to the social and economic development of northwest china song et al 2015 recently investigators have highlighted the relevance of land use on dom composition in the loess plateau liu et al 2019 li et al 2020 thus this study aimed to 1 quantify how the quantity and quality of dom in the weihe river are influenced by watershed land use and the phytoplankton community 2 explore the relationship between spectral characteristics of dom and phytoplankton composition and 3 tease apart the synergistic effects of land use and phytoplankton on dom dynamics by applying the mediation analysis we hypothesized that the shift in land use from natural to anthropogenic can impact the quality and quantity of dom by directly increasing anthropogenic discharge with a high protein signature and indirectly stimulating in situ production via mediating phytoplankton communities knowledge about the dom dynamics is useful for advancing the understanding of river ecosystem processes and developing schemes for water quality protection and management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the weihe river 33 5 37 5 n 103 5 110 5 e the largest tributary of the yellow river has a basin area of 134 800 km2 a total length of 818 km and an elevation of 320 3495 m located in a semi arid and semi humid area the weihe river is mainly supplied by precipitation rainfall increased from june to october with annual precipitation of 500 800 mm which belongs to a typical continental monsoon climate huang et al 2012 song et al 2015 the weihe river spans three different geomorphological units the loess plateau guanzhong basin and qinling mountains giving birth to the guanzhong city group ahamad et al 2020 a major part of the basin is covered by cropland forest grassland and urban construction area fig 1 the diversity of land cover types supports a good environmental background for exploring the impact of land use on dom quantity and quality in the basin shi et al 2020 2 2 sample collection and preparation the field sampling campaign was conducted in the weihe river under base flow conditions 0 33 0 97 m s supplementary methods in november 2019 over a short period of one week to minimize the temporal variation and the effect of increased soil moisture from normal conditions which could reduce the regression coefficients between dom and land use wilson and xenopoulos 2009 no rainfall events occurred during this period a total of 15 sampling sites were established along the mainstream fig 1 including seven sites w1 7 located in the upper stream with narrow river channels and rapid current four sites w8 11 in the midstream with wide and braided channels and four sites w12 15 in the downstream with slow water flow and channel siltation w8 was located in the baojixia reservoir triplicate water samples were collected from each site using 2 l acid cleaned pre rinsed polyethene bottles and immediately filtered through pre combusted 0 45 µm gf f filters after the end of each sampling day all treated water samples were stored in the dark with ice packs before being transported to the laboratory the water samples were stored in the dark at 4 c and measured within 2 weeks in the laboratory regarding the samples for phytoplankton identification 1 l mixed water was collected from the surface middle and bottom water layers 0 5 m intervals using pre rinsed polyethene bottles and fixed with 15 ml lugol s iodine solution the phytoplankton samples were settled for 48 h concentrated by a siphon and identified 2 3 dom concentration and absorption measurement dom concentrations were measured using a total organic carbon analyzer vario toc select elementar and expressed as doc mg l absorbance spectra of all the original filtrates were measured between 200 and 800 nm at 1 nm intervals using a uv vis spectrophotometer unico uv 4800 with matching 1 cm path length quartz cuvettes at room temperature 20 to 25 and milli q water was used as reference the instrumental baseline drift caused by the difference in refractive indexes between the sample and the reference and the scattering of fine particles in the water sample was corrected by subtracting the absorbance at 700 nm absorption coefficients were calculated using the following equation bricaud et al 1981 1 a λ 2 303 a λ l where a λ is the uncorrected absorption coefficient at wavelength λ a λ is the optical density at wavelength λ and l is the path length in m in this study a280 was selected to express the cdom concentration chin et al 1994 the spectral slope ratio sr as an indicator of molecular weight mw is defined by calculating the ratio of the spectral slope of the shorter wavelength interval 275 295 nm to that of the longer wavelength interval 350 400 nm sr decreases with increasing molecular weight nishijima and speitel 2004 helms et al 2008 2 4 dom fluorescence measurement and parafac analysis dom fluorescence eems were analyzed using an f 7000 hitachi fluorescence spectrometer with the excitation ex and emission em ranging from 200 to 450 nm at 5 nm intervals and 250 600 nm at 1 nm intervals respectively the slit widths of all samples were set as 5 nm for both excitation and emission with a scan speed of 12000 nm min the fluorescence spectrum of milli q water was subtracted from the sample eem spectra used to remove the raman scattering peak fluorescence intensities were normalized using the integral of the raman signal of milli q water to raman units r u lawaetz and stedmon 2009 moreover the absorbance spectra at 245 nm of all samples were below 0 05 cm1 samples thus do not need to be diluted to minimize inner filtering effects jaffé et al 2008 yu et al 2015 to identify dom components from fluorescence eems parafac analysis was performed in matlab r2014a with the dreem toolbox according to the method developed by murphy et al 2013 the principle of parafac analysis is to decompose the eems dataset into a series of three linear term and residual arrays and minimize the residual sum of squares stedmon et al 2003 a three fluorescence component model was determined using an eems dataset of 45 samples and validated by split half analysis and analysis of residuals and loadings in this study the model explained 99 7 of the variance within the dataset the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax was used to represent the fluorescence intensity of parafac components 2 5 land cover classification and analysis land use was divided into 6 categories based on chen et al 2019 in the weihe river basin the land use types include cropland 39 forest 35 grassland 18 water 1 urban area 6 and bareland 1 fig 1 on the base of the 30 m digital elevation model dem https www resdc cn the spatial distribution of flow direction watershed boundaries and stream networks of the weihe river basin were studied using hydrological analysis function arcgis 10 1 taking the location of sampling sites and watershed topography into consideration the weihe river basin was divided into 11 sub basins each basin includes all its upstream sub basins to reduce the effect of longitudinal transportation on dom shi et al 2020 the land use types were identified in each sub basin and represented on a percentage basis table s1 the cropland and urban area were combined into anthropogenic land use 2 6 analysis and statistic of phytoplankton community the identification of phytoplankton was supported by the college of fisheries and life science dalian ocean university briefly phytoplankton samples were concentrated to 50 ml after 48 h of settled time 0 1 ml of concentrated sample was placed in a counting frame for species identification and cell counting using a microscope at 400x olympus cx21fs1 japan and species were identified taxonomically according to literature charts species dominance index y mcnaughton 1967 was used as indicators for the phytoplankton community and expressed mathematically as 2 y n i n f i where n i is the number of individuals of species i n is the total number of individuals in all species and f i is the frequency of occurrence of species i at different sampling sites the dominance species was determined when y 0 02 2 7 statistical analysis spatial variability of sampling sites and dom related parameters were visualized using arcgis 10 1 esri usa statistical analysis and figures were performed using r studio 4 0 5 and origin 2021b all datasets were tested by the shapiro wilk test to meet the assumptions of normality a one way anova followed by a tukey hsd was used to assess the differences in the dom dataset between river sections using a p value of 0 05 to determine significance pca was also conducted to depict spatial differences in dom fluorescence components regression and correlation analysis were performed to reveal the relationships between percent land use type phytoplankton concentration and the percentage of fluorescence components mediation analysis was used to quantify the direct and indirect effects of land use and phytoplankton concentration on dom components which has been described in detail in the supplementary methods rda of the percent fluorescence components dom absorbance metric and the dominant genera of phytoplankton community were then conducted to further explore the impact of phytoplankton community on dom compositions 3 results 3 1 eem parafac components a three component model was well validated using the split half procedure and the excitation and emission loadings of parafac components are supplied in fig s1 the eems spectra of the three components identified by parafac analysis are shown in fig 2 three fluorescent components of dom in the weihe river were identified based on previously published data on the open access database openfluor https openfluor lablicate com murphy et al 2014 table s2 and could be classified into two categories including humic like components c1 and c2 and protein like substances c3 the spectral shapes of component 1 c1 containing two peaks at λex em 246 400 nm and λex em 324 400 nm could be identified as a microbial humic like component which is the microbial transformation products of terrestrially derived organic matter yamashita et al 2010 chen et al 2016 kida et al 2019 c2 also displayed two peaks with λex em 263 459 nm and at λex em 365 459 nm characterized by the traditional terrestrially derived humic like component yamashita et al 2011 amaral et al 2020 c3 also displayed two peaks at λex em 231 349 nm and λex em 281 349 categorized as a tryptophan like fluorophore which could originate from both autochthonous production algal bloom and sewage osburn et al 2012 murphy et al 2014 3 2 pca of parafac fluorescent components the pca was conducted using the three fluorescent components c1 c3 for all water samples to determine spatial variances in dom for the weihe river the first two pca axes i e components 1 and 2 explained 99 5 of all the variance in the dataset fig 3 the parafac pca in this study could differentiate the fluorescent characteristics between humic c1 and c2 and protein like components c3 the humic like components c1 and c2 were clustered together on the dominant pc1 with c3 projected opposite displaying strong positive pc2 loading indicating that c3 is the different component that was identified as a protein like component furthermore the pca score plot demonstrated that most of the water samples from downstream were usually clustered with the higher pc1 and pc2 scores and contrasted with samples from upstream and midstream along the negative axis of pc1 and pc2 which implied different dom components and sources of note the protein like component c3 drove the separation of downstream sites from the clustered sites in this study the spatial differences of the dom fluorescence components were further verified using the analysis of variance anova table s3 3 3 spatial distribution of dom quantity and quality based on the sampling sites the mean quantity and quality of dom with standard deviation in the weihe river were presented in table s3 the spatial distributions of mean fmax absorption coefficients and doc for each site were visualized and shown in fig 4 the microbial humic like c1 had the lowest values in the headwater sites w1 and w2 and higher values in the river mouths w14 and w15 the terrestrial humic like c2 was similar to microbial humic like c1 and also had higher intensity in w3 where natural land types forest and grassland had the highest proportion 70 9 the protein like c3 had a lower intensity in the headwater sites and higher in the downstream and w5 where anthropogenic land use 41 4 including cropland and urban area is significantly higher than other upstream and midstream sites fig s5 and table s1 the contribution percentage of humic like components c humic decreased notably from upstream to downstream suggesting c protein had a reverse trend in this study doc and a280 were used to indicate dom and cdom quantity which was positively related to fluorescent components c1 c2 and c3 table s6 doc and a280 showed a similar trend of spatial distribution with the fluorescence components in the weihe river the lower values of doc and a280 were found in the river source and higher values were observed in the estuary sr gradually decreased from upstream to downstream suggesting a stepwise increase in dom molecular weight a special increase in sr was observed in w8 located in the reservoir 3 4 linkages between the dom fluorescence components land use and phytoplankton concentration the relative distribution of fmax was presented as the percentage of fmax fmax for each component at each site in this study to minimize the influence of doc concentration on model scores williams et al 2010 the linear regression analysis between the percentage of land use areas in 2017 the average percentage of fmax fmax and phytoplankton concentration was conducted based on the sampling sites fig 5 percent humic like c1and c2 were both negatively correlated with the anthropogenic land use p 0 001 by contrast a significant positive correlation between the percentage of protein like c3 and the anthropogenic land use was observed r2 0 73 p 0 001 fig 5c table s4 meanwhile a significant positive correlation was found between the anthropogenic land use and the log transformed phytoplankton concentration r2 0 69 p 0 001 fig 5g table s5 positive correlation existed between phytoplankton concentration and protein like c3 r2 0 42 p 0 05 fig 5f table s5 in comparison phytoplankton concentration was negatively correlated with humic like c1 and c2 c1 r2 0 51 p 0 05 c2 r2 0 32 p 0 05 the mediation analysis was performed to assess the mechanisms of land use shifts and phytoplankton concentration on changes in dom composition from humic like c1 and c2 to protein like c3 and explain the reasons for the changes in brief anthropogenic land use served as the independent variable and the percentage of three fluorescent components i e c1 c3 served as the dependent variables the phytoplankton concentration was included as a mediator average causal mediation effect acme and average direct effect ade were both significant to the microbial humic like c1 and protein like c3 c1 p 0 001 c3 p 0 001 table 1 fig s2 which indicated the mediation effects were significant it implied phytoplankton concentration that significantly mediated the effect of land use on the changes in dom composition from microbial humic like c1 to protein like c3 concerning the increase in the proportion of protein like c3 the direct effect of anthropogenic land use on protein like c3 was 1 094 and the indirect effect through phytoplankton production was 0 164 table 1 the total effect of anthropogenic land use was 1 258 the prop mediated demonstrated the relative contribution of the anthropogenic input and the phytoplankton production to dom fluorescence components for the increases in protein like c3 the contribution of anthropogenic input was higher than that that fueled the phytoplankton production 87 5 vs 12 5 whereas acme of the presence of phytoplankton was not significant to terrestrial humic like c2 suggesting changes in terrestrial humic like c2 were simply contributed by anthropogenic land use shifts 3 5 phytoplankton composition and its linkages with the dom composition a total of 53 species of phytoplankton were identified in the weihe river belonging to 6 phyla and 31 genera fig s3 most phytoplankton species belonged to the bacillariophyta 14 genera and 34 species accounting for 44 15 of phytoplankton concentration followed by chlorophyta 10 genera and 12 species 3 90 and cyanophyta 4 genera and 4 species 51 11 of which cyanophyta and bacillariophyta were significant at downstream sites six dominant genera of phytoplankton from the weihe river were determined by calculating the species dominance index y at the genus level thereinto phormidium cyanophyta was dominant at the genus level for most downstream sites with an average relative abundance of 58 73 followed by diatoma bacillariophyta with an average relative abundance of 19 48 in the study the phytoplankton concentration significantly mediated the effects of land use on the microbial humic like c1 and protein like c3 the percentage of microbial humic like c1 was negatively correlated with the phytoplankton concentration in the weihe river p 0 01 whereas significant positive correlations between percent protein like c3 and the phytoplankton concentration were found p 0 05 table s5 to further explore the impact of the phytoplankton community on the dom compositions redundancy analysis rda of the percent fluorescence components dom absorbance metric sr and the dominant genera of phytoplankton community was conducted the first two axes explained 53 86 of the dataset s total variance fig 6 one of the dominant genera phormidium cyanophyta represented a positive correlation with the percent protein like c3 and also strongly influenced on that there were also obvious positive correlations between synedra diatoma and melosira bacillariophyta and protein like c3 the percent microbial humic like c1 was negatively related most of the dominant genera of phytoplankton interestingly cymbella bacillariophyta which mainly predominated upstream of weihe river fig s3b was positively related to microbial humic like c1 sr showed a weak but negative correlation with the percent protein like c3 and most of the dominant genera of phytoplankton indicated that protein like c3 produced by phytoplankton may have a larger mw 4 discussion our results suggest that anthropogenic land use in watersheds acted to increase anthropogenic run off often sewage input and phytoplankton productivity which likely changed the dom composition from humic to protein like components in the river dom pool in this study divergent spatial variations were found for dom and cdom concentrations doc and a280 with samples collected from w5 and sites located downstream containing higher doc and a280 fig 4e and 4f the higher proportion of anthropogenic land use surrounding the w5 41 4 and downstream of the weihe river fig 1 and s5 table s1 resulted in higher concentrations at these sites which is consistent with prior studies showing that the shift in land use from natural to anthropogenic can impact the river dom concentration williams et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 hosen et al 2014 this was verified by the strong positive correlation of doc and a280 with the anthropogenic land use p 0 05 table s4 this result is likely to be related to the increase in anthropogenic run off like wastewater treatment effluent livestock operations etc and or enhanced in situ production due to the high trophic state in urban areas wei et al 2019 li et al 2020 spatial variations were also observed in the compositions of the dom component fig 4a d with higher ratios of humic like components c1 and c2 found in samples from upstream sites and the highest ratios of protein like c3 found in the downstream area this was further validated by pca fig 3 obviously separated clusters were observed among the different river sections downstream sites clustered together and were separated from the other sites of note protein like c3 drove the separation of downstream sites from the other sites downstream of the weihe river forest and grassland were replaced by cropland and urban areas with notable human activities fig 1 and table s1 which resulted in shifts in the sources of dom from terrestrial to anthropogenic and autochthonous origins shang et al 2019 thereby influencing the dom composition williams et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 moreover solar exposure and long water residence time could also reduce the proportion of humic like components c1 and c2 which are the primary targets of dom photodegradation shang et al 2019 and that protein like c3 is more stable during solar exposure sulzberger and durisch kaiser 2009 further investigation should consider the photochemical transformations with longer travel time of dom in inland rivers and especially rivers in anthropogenic landscapes the strong correlations between anthropogenic land use phytoplankton concentration and dom fluorescence components c1 c3 in particular the strong positive correlation between anthropogenic land use phytoplankton concentration and protein like c3 fig 5a f are understandable since the protein like component is thought to be accumulated through autochthonous production algal bloom and anthropogenic run off osburn et al 2012 murphy et al 2014 and it tends to increase in sites affected by human activity and or with higher proportions of anthropogenic land use hosen et al 2014 wang et al 2019 shi et al 2020 interestingly despite the unknown complex hydraulic conditions in the weihe river at different sampling sites the phytoplankton concentration was also higher in downstream sites where the habitat is preferable due to the more intense sunlight and high load of nutrients from human activities fig s3a shang et al 2019 this was further verified by the strong positive correlation between phytoplankton and anthropogenic land use p 0 05 fig 5g indicating that enrichment of nutrients associated with anthropogenic land use would fuel phytoplankton productivity community shifts katsiapi et al 2012 wu et al 2020 therefore these correlations suggest that a change in dom composition could be due to enhancing the concentration and production of phytoplankton by increasing the inorganic nutrients subsides in anthropogenic areas and or due to shifts in allochthonous input from terrestrial organic matter to anthropogenic loading via land use shifts to explore the mechanisms by which land use and phytoplankton production influenced the fluorescence components of river dom further we conducted a mediation analysis as proposed by mackinnon et al 2007 here the direct effect describes changes in dom composition based on land use shifts phytoplankton as a mediating variable transmits the effect of land use on dom compositions the mediation analysis produced divergent results for humic like components c1 and c2 and protein like c3 table 1 phytoplankton mediators of anthropogenic land use effects on terrestrial humic like c2 were non significant suggesting terrestrial humic like c2 should not be influenced by phytoplankton production therefore the changes in terrestrial humic like c2 seemed to be simply due to the increase in impervious land uses and these humic like dom were predominated by compounds originating from forest soils and plants in forested headwater streams lutz et al 2012 hosen et al 2014 li et al 2020 whereas phytoplankton mediated anthropogenic land use effects on microbial humic like c1 and protein like c3 implied that shifting in dom composition from humic like to protein like components in the weihe river downstream could be attributed to the synergistic effects of both factors enrichment of protein like c3 in downstream sites with a higher proportion of anthropogenic land use could be partly attributed to the promoted phytoplankton production via a high load of inorganic nutrients 12 5 and partly from the emission of anthropogenic run off sewage etc in the urban area 87 5 this finding is consistent with that of organelli and claustre 2019 who proposed that coloured dissolved organic matter is produced via phytoplankton production the reduction in microbial humic like c1 originating from the microbial products of terrestrially derived organic matter might be caused mainly by the decreasing terrestrial input 73 4 in the urban area moreover the freshly and autochthonously produced semi labile dom originating from phytoplankton production preferred to be consumed by microorganisms than terrestrially derived organic matter wilson and xenopoulos 2009 zhang et al 2011 the increase in phytoplankton concentration is also part of the cause 26 6 humic like dom is preferentially degraded back to inorganic matter via photochemical processes and thereby recycled for use by phytoplankton sigman and hain 2012 shang et al 2019 which was reflected in a negative correlation between microbial humic like c1 and phytoplankton concentration fig 5c table s5 our results suggest anthropogenic land use showed indirect effects on the part of the increase in protein like c3 via promoting phytoplankton production 12 5 the rda results indicate that phormidium cyanophyta is significantly and positively correlated with protein like c3 fig 6 this also agreed with our observations which showed that phormidium dominated the downstream sites where the percentage of protein like dom has the highest value phytoplankton especially cyanobacteria such as the dominated genera prochlorococcus and synechococcus shapes the dom dynamics organelli and claustre 2019 moreover the positive correlation between microbial humic like c1 and cymbella bacillariophyta might have resulted from these upstream sites where cymbella mainly predominated with relatively higher urban areas and a high load of household sewage which promoted the microbial degradation fig s3b table s1 most cymbella species require higher water quality but prefer waters that are low in nitrogen and high in phosphorus bahls 2007 the most dominant genus of phytoplankton and the percent protein like c3 negatively correlated with sr which further verified the production of large and labile dom molecules via phytoplankton zhang et al 2013 bai et al 2017 thus following the present results which showed that phytoplankton significantly mediated the effect of anthropogenic land use on the changes in microbial humic like c1 and protein like c3 we can infer that the synergistic effects of anthropogenic run off and increased phytoplankton concentration caused by human activity in urban areas would enhance the production of protein like components which would be preferred to degrade by microorganisms than terrestrially derived dom variations in watershed land use would directly impact the quality and quantity of dom by shifting the input pathway of organic matter and indirectly influence dom characteristics by changing the concentration and composition of the phytoplankton community excess dom in an aquatic environment would emit an unpleasant odour and be harmful to human health by producing toxic by products in the disinfection process of drinking water baghoth et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 shi et al 2020 watershed related processes affected by human activity can directly alter the allochthonous input of dom and indirectly impact dom autochthonous sources increases in socioeconomic growth and human activity such as rapid urbanization might motivate anthropogenic input of dom which might intensify the algal growth by the elevated trophic state thereby adding to the accumulation of the protein like dom hosen et al 2014 wang et al 2019 abundant accumulation of the protein like dom from phytoplankton production at high trophic state rivers should be an essential contributor to the microbial food web zhang et al 2013 which in turn will influence dom components and concentrations and affect the balance of aquatic ecology thus the present results provide novel insight into the underlying mechanisms by which anthropogenic impacts on catchment land use and phytoplankton alter dom biogeochemical cycling which has important implications for the protection and management of the river ecosystem especially for monitoring river eutrophication to develop a full picture of the driving mechanisms of source and transfer of dom in aquatic ecosystems future studies need to further investigate the influence of more controlling factors including solar exposure microbial community in river transformation water retention time socio economic and climate temperature and rainfall parameters cawley et al 2012 shang et al 2019 du et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 on the dom dynamic to unravel the contribution of climate change and human activities to the dom pool 5 conclusion the current study was designed to identify mechanisms for changing dom composition down the weihe river by assessing land use in the watershed dom composition along the river and phytoplankton community composition the results presented above support the following conclusion 1 the phytoplankton concentration significantly mediated the effect of land use on microbial humic like c1 and protein like c3 2 protein like c3 increased in sites with a higher proportion of anthropogenic land use which appeared to originate at least in part through autochthonous phytoplankton production that fueled by the high load of nutrient 12 5 3 the reduction in microbial humic like c1 downstream of weihe river partly attributed to the decreasing input of terrestrially derived dom 73 4 and partly because of the increase in phytoplankton concentration 26 6 4 the decreases in terrestrial humic like c2 along the river are mainly attributed to the reduced terrestrial loading via land use shifts 5 the genus phormidium cyanophyta positively affects the protein like c3 these associations support the notion that phytoplankton significantly mediated the effect of land use on the changes in microbial humic like and protein like dom and phytoplankton such as the genus phormidium shaped protein like dom in the weihe river given the importance of cultivated crops in the weihe river basin understanding the synergistic effects of land use and the phytoplankton community is key to the management of aquatic dom cycling declaration of competing

3315,land use can impact dissolved organic matter dom dynamics directly by changing terrestrial loading in anthropogenic areas and indirectly by promoting in situ phytoplankton production due to the high load of nutrients however understanding how land use and phytoplankton community interact to affect dom quantity and quality is deficient to tease apart the synergistic effects of land use and phytoplankton on dom dynamics fluorescence spectroscopy with parallel factor analysis parafac and mediation analysis was performed in this study parafac produced three components that had two humic like c1 and c2 and a protein like c3 fluorescent components significantly related to anthropogenic land use cropland urban area and phytoplankton concentration p 0 05 through the mediation analysis the altered c1 and c3 at sites with a higher proportion of anthropogenic land use appeared to originate partly as a result of the phytoplankton production fueled by a high load of nutrients from anthropogenic run off 26 6 and 12 5 these results suggested phytoplankton significantly mediated the effects of land use on microbial humic like and protein like dom additionally redundancy analysis rda results further showed that phormidium cyanophyta had a notable influence on the production of the protein like component via phytoplankton conversely the decreases in terrestrial humic like c2 were mainly attributed to the reduced terrestrial loading in anthropogenic areas these findings provide insights into the roles of land use and phytoplankton communities in dom dynamics and advance our understanding of the mechanisms that drive dom composition patterns keywords dissolved organic matter anthropogenic land use phytoplankton community mediation analysis parallel factor analysis 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is widely distributed in the natural waters and closely related to the biogeochemical cycle of aquatic environments lynch et al 2019 wang et al 2019 changes in dom quantity and quality have profound implications for aquatic ecology through affecting food web dynamics water quality carbon storage and metal transport yamashita and jaffé 2008 zhang et al 2013 as well high concentrations of dom can react with disinfectants to produce carcinogenic contaminants and induce microbial regrowth in the water supply network to threaten drinking water quality and human health tomlinson et al 2016 shi et al 2020 thus the influencing factors and mechanisms of dom quantity and quality have received growing attention zhang et al 2011 organelli and claustre 2019 shi et al 2020 dom in the aquatic ecosystem could be both allochthonous and autochthonous origin carstea et al 2009 mostofa et al 2013 the dom quantity and quality depend on a combination of its source and the in situ biogeochemical processes which could be affected by a series of natural and anthropogenic factors i e land use types morphology microbial activity and phytoplankton production within the watershed williams et al 2010 zhuang and yang 2018 khamis et al 2018 lynch et al 2019 watershed land use affects the amounts of terrestrial organic matter inputted to river ecosystems and autochthonous dom production and cycling baker and spencer 2004 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 williams et al 2010 cropland and anthropogenic land cover result in an extensive discharge of anthropogenic run off which tends to increase the inorganic nutrient in rivers above levels found in rivers with more natural land use cover boyer et al 2002 mattsson et al 2009 in aquatic ecosystems high trophic states caused by elevated inorganic nutrient levels can give rise to phytoplankton which could in turn promote dom production sickman et al 2010 wei et al 2019 thus land use can shape dom quantity and quality in rivers both directly by affecting terrestrial loading and indirectly by affecting river autochthonous production and organic matter processing rates similarly phytoplankton production and organic matter cycling can be directly controlled by the source quantity and quality of dom findlay et al 2001 asmala et al 2018 however a thorough understanding of how land use and phytoplankton community interact to affect dom quantity and quality is lacking in aquatic ecosystems the optical properties of dom are conducive to the inferences of the source amount and component of dom blough 2002 jaffé et al 2008 the ultraviolet visible uv vis absorbance and fluorescent characteristics of dom have been utilized to identify its components and trace its dynamics in multiple aquatic environments mcknight et al 2001 weishaar et al 2003 cory and mcknight 2005 coble 2007 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 previous studies have identified changes in terrestrial microbial and in situ characteristics of dom with land use by using uv visible optical properties of dom baker and spencer 2004 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 excitation emission matrices eems coupled with parallel factor analysis parafac is deemed an effective technique to reveal and quantify different dom fluorophore groups due to its simplicity and sensitivity stedmon and markager 2005 zhang et al 2009 organelli and claustre 2019 for example stedmon and markager 2005 observed enriched terrestrial humic like components in forest and agricultural areas yet more abundant uva absorbing humic like components in agricultural and wastewater treatment areas suggesting the terrestrial and anthropogenic influences on dom combining in situ monitoring and phytoplankton degradation experiment zhang et al 2009 found a rapid increase in two humic like fluorophores during the experiment indicating phytoplankton as an important dom producer in the eutrophic shallow lake in the north atlantic subtropical gyre the temporal dynamics of coloured dissolved organic matter cdom are strongly correlated with the chlorophyll concentration suggesting the direct production of dom via phytoplankton metabolism and the strong dependence of dom dynamics on the abundance of phytoplankton organelli and claustre 2019 although the effect of land use and phytoplankton community on quality and quantity of dom has been investigated separately it remains uncertain the cause of the shifts in the quantity and quality of dom related to land use alteration of terrestrial dom sources autochthonous production of dom or both as fluorescence metrics have yet to be able to distinguish specific fluorescent signals between the anthropogenic source and phytoplankton excretion few studies have been able to tease apart the synergistic effects of land use and phytoplankton on dom dynamics in inland rivers which are highly vulnerable to anthropogenic influences the weihe river is a typical inland river in the yellow river basin and its ecosystem health is related to the social and economic development of northwest china song et al 2015 recently investigators have highlighted the relevance of land use on dom composition in the loess plateau liu et al 2019 li et al 2020 thus this study aimed to 1 quantify how the quantity and quality of dom in the weihe river are influenced by watershed land use and the phytoplankton community 2 explore the relationship between spectral characteristics of dom and phytoplankton composition and 3 tease apart the synergistic effects of land use and phytoplankton on dom dynamics by applying the mediation analysis we hypothesized that the shift in land use from natural to anthropogenic can impact the quality and quantity of dom by directly increasing anthropogenic discharge with a high protein signature and indirectly stimulating in situ production via mediating phytoplankton communities knowledge about the dom dynamics is useful for advancing the understanding of river ecosystem processes and developing schemes for water quality protection and management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the weihe river 33 5 37 5 n 103 5 110 5 e the largest tributary of the yellow river has a basin area of 134 800 km2 a total length of 818 km and an elevation of 320 3495 m located in a semi arid and semi humid area the weihe river is mainly supplied by precipitation rainfall increased from june to october with annual precipitation of 500 800 mm which belongs to a typical continental monsoon climate huang et al 2012 song et al 2015 the weihe river spans three different geomorphological units the loess plateau guanzhong basin and qinling mountains giving birth to the guanzhong city group ahamad et al 2020 a major part of the basin is covered by cropland forest grassland and urban construction area fig 1 the diversity of land cover types supports a good environmental background for exploring the impact of land use on dom quantity and quality in the basin shi et al 2020 2 2 sample collection and preparation the field sampling campaign was conducted in the weihe river under base flow conditions 0 33 0 97 m s supplementary methods in november 2019 over a short period of one week to minimize the temporal variation and the effect of increased soil moisture from normal conditions which could reduce the regression coefficients between dom and land use wilson and xenopoulos 2009 no rainfall events occurred during this period a total of 15 sampling sites were established along the mainstream fig 1 including seven sites w1 7 located in the upper stream with narrow river channels and rapid current four sites w8 11 in the midstream with wide and braided channels and four sites w12 15 in the downstream with slow water flow and channel siltation w8 was located in the baojixia reservoir triplicate water samples were collected from each site using 2 l acid cleaned pre rinsed polyethene bottles and immediately filtered through pre combusted 0 45 µm gf f filters after the end of each sampling day all treated water samples were stored in the dark with ice packs before being transported to the laboratory the water samples were stored in the dark at 4 c and measured within 2 weeks in the laboratory regarding the samples for phytoplankton identification 1 l mixed water was collected from the surface middle and bottom water layers 0 5 m intervals using pre rinsed polyethene bottles and fixed with 15 ml lugol s iodine solution the phytoplankton samples were settled for 48 h concentrated by a siphon and identified 2 3 dom concentration and absorption measurement dom concentrations were measured using a total organic carbon analyzer vario toc select elementar and expressed as doc mg l absorbance spectra of all the original filtrates were measured between 200 and 800 nm at 1 nm intervals using a uv vis spectrophotometer unico uv 4800 with matching 1 cm path length quartz cuvettes at room temperature 20 to 25 and milli q water was used as reference the instrumental baseline drift caused by the difference in refractive indexes between the sample and the reference and the scattering of fine particles in the water sample was corrected by subtracting the absorbance at 700 nm absorption coefficients were calculated using the following equation bricaud et al 1981 1 a λ 2 303 a λ l where a λ is the uncorrected absorption coefficient at wavelength λ a λ is the optical density at wavelength λ and l is the path length in m in this study a280 was selected to express the cdom concentration chin et al 1994 the spectral slope ratio sr as an indicator of molecular weight mw is defined by calculating the ratio of the spectral slope of the shorter wavelength interval 275 295 nm to that of the longer wavelength interval 350 400 nm sr decreases with increasing molecular weight nishijima and speitel 2004 helms et al 2008 2 4 dom fluorescence measurement and parafac analysis dom fluorescence eems were analyzed using an f 7000 hitachi fluorescence spectrometer with the excitation ex and emission em ranging from 200 to 450 nm at 5 nm intervals and 250 600 nm at 1 nm intervals respectively the slit widths of all samples were set as 5 nm for both excitation and emission with a scan speed of 12000 nm min the fluorescence spectrum of milli q water was subtracted from the sample eem spectra used to remove the raman scattering peak fluorescence intensities were normalized using the integral of the raman signal of milli q water to raman units r u lawaetz and stedmon 2009 moreover the absorbance spectra at 245 nm of all samples were below 0 05 cm1 samples thus do not need to be diluted to minimize inner filtering effects jaffé et al 2008 yu et al 2015 to identify dom components from fluorescence eems parafac analysis was performed in matlab r2014a with the dreem toolbox according to the method developed by murphy et al 2013 the principle of parafac analysis is to decompose the eems dataset into a series of three linear term and residual arrays and minimize the residual sum of squares stedmon et al 2003 a three fluorescence component model was determined using an eems dataset of 45 samples and validated by split half analysis and analysis of residuals and loadings in this study the model explained 99 7 of the variance within the dataset the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax was used to represent the fluorescence intensity of parafac components 2 5 land cover classification and analysis land use was divided into 6 categories based on chen et al 2019 in the weihe river basin the land use types include cropland 39 forest 35 grassland 18 water 1 urban area 6 and bareland 1 fig 1 on the base of the 30 m digital elevation model dem https www resdc cn the spatial distribution of flow direction watershed boundaries and stream networks of the weihe river basin were studied using hydrological analysis function arcgis 10 1 taking the location of sampling sites and watershed topography into consideration the weihe river basin was divided into 11 sub basins each basin includes all its upstream sub basins to reduce the effect of longitudinal transportation on dom shi et al 2020 the land use types were identified in each sub basin and represented on a percentage basis table s1 the cropland and urban area were combined into anthropogenic land use 2 6 analysis and statistic of phytoplankton community the identification of phytoplankton was supported by the college of fisheries and life science dalian ocean university briefly phytoplankton samples were concentrated to 50 ml after 48 h of settled time 0 1 ml of concentrated sample was placed in a counting frame for species identification and cell counting using a microscope at 400x olympus cx21fs1 japan and species were identified taxonomically according to literature charts species dominance index y mcnaughton 1967 was used as indicators for the phytoplankton community and expressed mathematically as 2 y n i n f i where n i is the number of individuals of species i n is the total number of individuals in all species and f i is the frequency of occurrence of species i at different sampling sites the dominance species was determined when y 0 02 2 7 statistical analysis spatial variability of sampling sites and dom related parameters were visualized using arcgis 10 1 esri usa statistical analysis and figures were performed using r studio 4 0 5 and origin 2021b all datasets were tested by the shapiro wilk test to meet the assumptions of normality a one way anova followed by a tukey hsd was used to assess the differences in the dom dataset between river sections using a p value of 0 05 to determine significance pca was also conducted to depict spatial differences in dom fluorescence components regression and correlation analysis were performed to reveal the relationships between percent land use type phytoplankton concentration and the percentage of fluorescence components mediation analysis was used to quantify the direct and indirect effects of land use and phytoplankton concentration on dom components which has been described in detail in the supplementary methods rda of the percent fluorescence components dom absorbance metric and the dominant genera of phytoplankton community were then conducted to further explore the impact of phytoplankton community on dom compositions 3 results 3 1 eem parafac components a three component model was well validated using the split half procedure and the excitation and emission loadings of parafac components are supplied in fig s1 the eems spectra of the three components identified by parafac analysis are shown in fig 2 three fluorescent components of dom in the weihe river were identified based on previously published data on the open access database openfluor https openfluor lablicate com murphy et al 2014 table s2 and could be classified into two categories including humic like components c1 and c2 and protein like substances c3 the spectral shapes of component 1 c1 containing two peaks at λex em 246 400 nm and λex em 324 400 nm could be identified as a microbial humic like component which is the microbial transformation products of terrestrially derived organic matter yamashita et al 2010 chen et al 2016 kida et al 2019 c2 also displayed two peaks with λex em 263 459 nm and at λex em 365 459 nm characterized by the traditional terrestrially derived humic like component yamashita et al 2011 amaral et al 2020 c3 also displayed two peaks at λex em 231 349 nm and λex em 281 349 categorized as a tryptophan like fluorophore which could originate from both autochthonous production algal bloom and sewage osburn et al 2012 murphy et al 2014 3 2 pca of parafac fluorescent components the pca was conducted using the three fluorescent components c1 c3 for all water samples to determine spatial variances in dom for the weihe river the first two pca axes i e components 1 and 2 explained 99 5 of all the variance in the dataset fig 3 the parafac pca in this study could differentiate the fluorescent characteristics between humic c1 and c2 and protein like components c3 the humic like components c1 and c2 were clustered together on the dominant pc1 with c3 projected opposite displaying strong positive pc2 loading indicating that c3 is the different component that was identified as a protein like component furthermore the pca score plot demonstrated that most of the water samples from downstream were usually clustered with the higher pc1 and pc2 scores and contrasted with samples from upstream and midstream along the negative axis of pc1 and pc2 which implied different dom components and sources of note the protein like component c3 drove the separation of downstream sites from the clustered sites in this study the spatial differences of the dom fluorescence components were further verified using the analysis of variance anova table s3 3 3 spatial distribution of dom quantity and quality based on the sampling sites the mean quantity and quality of dom with standard deviation in the weihe river were presented in table s3 the spatial distributions of mean fmax absorption coefficients and doc for each site were visualized and shown in fig 4 the microbial humic like c1 had the lowest values in the headwater sites w1 and w2 and higher values in the river mouths w14 and w15 the terrestrial humic like c2 was similar to microbial humic like c1 and also had higher intensity in w3 where natural land types forest and grassland had the highest proportion 70 9 the protein like c3 had a lower intensity in the headwater sites and higher in the downstream and w5 where anthropogenic land use 41 4 including cropland and urban area is significantly higher than other upstream and midstream sites fig s5 and table s1 the contribution percentage of humic like components c humic decreased notably from upstream to downstream suggesting c protein had a reverse trend in this study doc and a280 were used to indicate dom and cdom quantity which was positively related to fluorescent components c1 c2 and c3 table s6 doc and a280 showed a similar trend of spatial distribution with the fluorescence components in the weihe river the lower values of doc and a280 were found in the river source and higher values were observed in the estuary sr gradually decreased from upstream to downstream suggesting a stepwise increase in dom molecular weight a special increase in sr was observed in w8 located in the reservoir 3 4 linkages between the dom fluorescence components land use and phytoplankton concentration the relative distribution of fmax was presented as the percentage of fmax fmax for each component at each site in this study to minimize the influence of doc concentration on model scores williams et al 2010 the linear regression analysis between the percentage of land use areas in 2017 the average percentage of fmax fmax and phytoplankton concentration was conducted based on the sampling sites fig 5 percent humic like c1and c2 were both negatively correlated with the anthropogenic land use p 0 001 by contrast a significant positive correlation between the percentage of protein like c3 and the anthropogenic land use was observed r2 0 73 p 0 001 fig 5c table s4 meanwhile a significant positive correlation was found between the anthropogenic land use and the log transformed phytoplankton concentration r2 0 69 p 0 001 fig 5g table s5 positive correlation existed between phytoplankton concentration and protein like c3 r2 0 42 p 0 05 fig 5f table s5 in comparison phytoplankton concentration was negatively correlated with humic like c1 and c2 c1 r2 0 51 p 0 05 c2 r2 0 32 p 0 05 the mediation analysis was performed to assess the mechanisms of land use shifts and phytoplankton concentration on changes in dom composition from humic like c1 and c2 to protein like c3 and explain the reasons for the changes in brief anthropogenic land use served as the independent variable and the percentage of three fluorescent components i e c1 c3 served as the dependent variables the phytoplankton concentration was included as a mediator average causal mediation effect acme and average direct effect ade were both significant to the microbial humic like c1 and protein like c3 c1 p 0 001 c3 p 0 001 table 1 fig s2 which indicated the mediation effects were significant it implied phytoplankton concentration that significantly mediated the effect of land use on the changes in dom composition from microbial humic like c1 to protein like c3 concerning the increase in the proportion of protein like c3 the direct effect of anthropogenic land use on protein like c3 was 1 094 and the indirect effect through phytoplankton production was 0 164 table 1 the total effect of anthropogenic land use was 1 258 the prop mediated demonstrated the relative contribution of the anthropogenic input and the phytoplankton production to dom fluorescence components for the increases in protein like c3 the contribution of anthropogenic input was higher than that that fueled the phytoplankton production 87 5 vs 12 5 whereas acme of the presence of phytoplankton was not significant to terrestrial humic like c2 suggesting changes in terrestrial humic like c2 were simply contributed by anthropogenic land use shifts 3 5 phytoplankton composition and its linkages with the dom composition a total of 53 species of phytoplankton were identified in the weihe river belonging to 6 phyla and 31 genera fig s3 most phytoplankton species belonged to the bacillariophyta 14 genera and 34 species accounting for 44 15 of phytoplankton concentration followed by chlorophyta 10 genera and 12 species 3 90 and cyanophyta 4 genera and 4 species 51 11 of which cyanophyta and bacillariophyta were significant at downstream sites six dominant genera of phytoplankton from the weihe river were determined by calculating the species dominance index y at the genus level thereinto phormidium cyanophyta was dominant at the genus level for most downstream sites with an average relative abundance of 58 73 followed by diatoma bacillariophyta with an average relative abundance of 19 48 in the study the phytoplankton concentration significantly mediated the effects of land use on the microbial humic like c1 and protein like c3 the percentage of microbial humic like c1 was negatively correlated with the phytoplankton concentration in the weihe river p 0 01 whereas significant positive correlations between percent protein like c3 and the phytoplankton concentration were found p 0 05 table s5 to further explore the impact of the phytoplankton community on the dom compositions redundancy analysis rda of the percent fluorescence components dom absorbance metric sr and the dominant genera of phytoplankton community was conducted the first two axes explained 53 86 of the dataset s total variance fig 6 one of the dominant genera phormidium cyanophyta represented a positive correlation with the percent protein like c3 and also strongly influenced on that there were also obvious positive correlations between synedra diatoma and melosira bacillariophyta and protein like c3 the percent microbial humic like c1 was negatively related most of the dominant genera of phytoplankton interestingly cymbella bacillariophyta which mainly predominated upstream of weihe river fig s3b was positively related to microbial humic like c1 sr showed a weak but negative correlation with the percent protein like c3 and most of the dominant genera of phytoplankton indicated that protein like c3 produced by phytoplankton may have a larger mw 4 discussion our results suggest that anthropogenic land use in watersheds acted to increase anthropogenic run off often sewage input and phytoplankton productivity which likely changed the dom composition from humic to protein like components in the river dom pool in this study divergent spatial variations were found for dom and cdom concentrations doc and a280 with samples collected from w5 and sites located downstream containing higher doc and a280 fig 4e and 4f the higher proportion of anthropogenic land use surrounding the w5 41 4 and downstream of the weihe river fig 1 and s5 table s1 resulted in higher concentrations at these sites which is consistent with prior studies showing that the shift in land use from natural to anthropogenic can impact the river dom concentration williams et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 hosen et al 2014 this was verified by the strong positive correlation of doc and a280 with the anthropogenic land use p 0 05 table s4 this result is likely to be related to the increase in anthropogenic run off like wastewater treatment effluent livestock operations etc and or enhanced in situ production due to the high trophic state in urban areas wei et al 2019 li et al 2020 spatial variations were also observed in the compositions of the dom component fig 4a d with higher ratios of humic like components c1 and c2 found in samples from upstream sites and the highest ratios of protein like c3 found in the downstream area this was further validated by pca fig 3 obviously separated clusters were observed among the different river sections downstream sites clustered together and were separated from the other sites of note protein like c3 drove the separation of downstream sites from the other sites downstream of the weihe river forest and grassland were replaced by cropland and urban areas with notable human activities fig 1 and table s1 which resulted in shifts in the sources of dom from terrestrial to anthropogenic and autochthonous origins shang et al 2019 thereby influencing the dom composition williams et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 moreover solar exposure and long water residence time could also reduce the proportion of humic like components c1 and c2 which are the primary targets of dom photodegradation shang et al 2019 and that protein like c3 is more stable during solar exposure sulzberger and durisch kaiser 2009 further investigation should consider the photochemical transformations with longer travel time of dom in inland rivers and especially rivers in anthropogenic landscapes the strong correlations between anthropogenic land use phytoplankton concentration and dom fluorescence components c1 c3 in particular the strong positive correlation between anthropogenic land use phytoplankton concentration and protein like c3 fig 5a f are understandable since the protein like component is thought to be accumulated through autochthonous production algal bloom and anthropogenic run off osburn et al 2012 murphy et al 2014 and it tends to increase in sites affected by human activity and or with higher proportions of anthropogenic land use hosen et al 2014 wang et al 2019 shi et al 2020 interestingly despite the unknown complex hydraulic conditions in the weihe river at different sampling sites the phytoplankton concentration was also higher in downstream sites where the habitat is preferable due to the more intense sunlight and high load of nutrients from human activities fig s3a shang et al 2019 this was further verified by the strong positive correlation between phytoplankton and anthropogenic land use p 0 05 fig 5g indicating that enrichment of nutrients associated with anthropogenic land use would fuel phytoplankton productivity community shifts katsiapi et al 2012 wu et al 2020 therefore these correlations suggest that a change in dom composition could be due to enhancing the concentration and production of phytoplankton by increasing the inorganic nutrients subsides in anthropogenic areas and or due to shifts in allochthonous input from terrestrial organic matter to anthropogenic loading via land use shifts to explore the mechanisms by which land use and phytoplankton production influenced the fluorescence components of river dom further we conducted a mediation analysis as proposed by mackinnon et al 2007 here the direct effect describes changes in dom composition based on land use shifts phytoplankton as a mediating variable transmits the effect of land use on dom compositions the mediation analysis produced divergent results for humic like components c1 and c2 and protein like c3 table 1 phytoplankton mediators of anthropogenic land use effects on terrestrial humic like c2 were non significant suggesting terrestrial humic like c2 should not be influenced by phytoplankton production therefore the changes in terrestrial humic like c2 seemed to be simply due to the increase in impervious land uses and these humic like dom were predominated by compounds originating from forest soils and plants in forested headwater streams lutz et al 2012 hosen et al 2014 li et al 2020 whereas phytoplankton mediated anthropogenic land use effects on microbial humic like c1 and protein like c3 implied that shifting in dom composition from humic like to protein like components in the weihe river downstream could be attributed to the synergistic effects of both factors enrichment of protein like c3 in downstream sites with a higher proportion of anthropogenic land use could be partly attributed to the promoted phytoplankton production via a high load of inorganic nutrients 12 5 and partly from the emission of anthropogenic run off sewage etc in the urban area 87 5 this finding is consistent with that of organelli and claustre 2019 who proposed that coloured dissolved organic matter is produced via phytoplankton production the reduction in microbial humic like c1 originating from the microbial products of terrestrially derived organic matter might be caused mainly by the decreasing terrestrial input 73 4 in the urban area moreover the freshly and autochthonously produced semi labile dom originating from phytoplankton production preferred to be consumed by microorganisms than terrestrially derived organic matter wilson and xenopoulos 2009 zhang et al 2011 the increase in phytoplankton concentration is also part of the cause 26 6 humic like dom is preferentially degraded back to inorganic matter via photochemical processes and thereby recycled for use by phytoplankton sigman and hain 2012 shang et al 2019 which was reflected in a negative correlation between microbial humic like c1 and phytoplankton concentration fig 5c table s5 our results suggest anthropogenic land use showed indirect effects on the part of the increase in protein like c3 via promoting phytoplankton production 12 5 the rda results indicate that phormidium cyanophyta is significantly and positively correlated with protein like c3 fig 6 this also agreed with our observations which showed that phormidium dominated the downstream sites where the percentage of protein like dom has the highest value phytoplankton especially cyanobacteria such as the dominated genera prochlorococcus and synechococcus shapes the dom dynamics organelli and claustre 2019 moreover the positive correlation between microbial humic like c1 and cymbella bacillariophyta might have resulted from these upstream sites where cymbella mainly predominated with relatively higher urban areas and a high load of household sewage which promoted the microbial degradation fig s3b table s1 most cymbella species require higher water quality but prefer waters that are low in nitrogen and high in phosphorus bahls 2007 the most dominant genus of phytoplankton and the percent protein like c3 negatively correlated with sr which further verified the production of large and labile dom molecules via phytoplankton zhang et al 2013 bai et al 2017 thus following the present results which showed that phytoplankton significantly mediated the effect of anthropogenic land use on the changes in microbial humic like c1 and protein like c3 we can infer that the synergistic effects of anthropogenic run off and increased phytoplankton concentration caused by human activity in urban areas would enhance the production of protein like components which would be preferred to degrade by microorganisms than terrestrially derived dom variations in watershed land use would directly impact the quality and quantity of dom by shifting the input pathway of organic matter and indirectly influence dom characteristics by changing the concentration and composition of the phytoplankton community excess dom in an aquatic environment would emit an unpleasant odour and be harmful to human health by producing toxic by products in the disinfection process of drinking water baghoth et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 shi et al 2020 watershed related processes affected by human activity can directly alter the allochthonous input of dom and indirectly impact dom autochthonous sources increases in socioeconomic growth and human activity such as rapid urbanization might motivate anthropogenic input of dom which might intensify the algal growth by the elevated trophic state thereby adding to the accumulation of the protein like dom hosen et al 2014 wang et al 2019 abundant accumulation of the protein like dom from phytoplankton production at high trophic state rivers should be an essential contributor to the microbial food web zhang et al 2013 which in turn will influence dom components and concentrations and affect the balance of aquatic ecology thus the present results provide novel insight into the underlying mechanisms by which anthropogenic impacts on catchment land use and phytoplankton alter dom biogeochemical cycling which has important implications for the protection and management of the river ecosystem especially for monitoring river eutrophication to develop a full picture of the driving mechanisms of source and transfer of dom in aquatic ecosystems future studies need to further investigate the influence of more controlling factors including solar exposure microbial community in river transformation water retention time socio economic and climate temperature and rainfall parameters cawley et al 2012 shang et al 2019 du et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 on the dom dynamic to unravel the contribution of climate change and human activities to the dom pool 5 conclusion the current study was designed to identify mechanisms for changing dom composition down the weihe river by assessing land use in the watershed dom composition along the river and phytoplankton community composition the results presented above support the following conclusion 1 the phytoplankton concentration significantly mediated the effect of land use on microbial humic like c1 and protein like c3 2 protein like c3 increased in sites with a higher proportion of anthropogenic land use which appeared to originate at least in part through autochthonous phytoplankton production that fueled by the high load of nutrient 12 5 3 the reduction in microbial humic like c1 downstream of weihe river partly attributed to the decreasing input of terrestrially derived dom 73 4 and partly because of the increase in phytoplankton concentration 26 6 4 the decreases in terrestrial humic like c2 along the river are mainly attributed to the reduced terrestrial loading via land use shifts 5 the genus phormidium cyanophyta positively affects the protein like c3 these associations support the notion that phytoplankton significantly mediated the effect of land use on the changes in microbial humic like and protein like dom and phytoplankton such as the genus phormidium shaped protein like dom in the weihe river given the importance of cultivated crops in the weihe river basin understanding the synergistic effects of land use and the phytoplankton community is key to the management of aquatic dom cycling declaration of competing

3316,the hydrologic performance of green roofs can be notably influenced by local climatic conditions the majority of studies have focused on event based retention performance of particular green roof configuration and climatic condition making it difficult to predict green roof retention and formulate an efficient green roof configuration in a new location to date limited studies have assessed and compared annual or long term runoff retention performance of green roofs in different climatic regions and the impacts of climatic conditions on reduction effectiveness of green roofs remain unclear in this study a water balance model of green roofs coupling evapotranspiration rate estimation was developed to simulated the annual retention performance of green roofs four cities located in different climatic regions of china were selected to compare their average annual and seasonal runoff retention performances of extensive green roofs using 11 years of meteorological data and assess the impacts of substrate storage capacity vegetation types parameters and rainfall patterns on runoff retention performance among climatic regions results showed that average annual runoff retention in the dry continental climate of lanzhou was 73 8 which was higher than that in the humid climatic regions of beijing 48 9 chongqing 45 2 and shenzhen 30 0 average runoff retention performance of extensive green roofs was the highest in spring for beijing and lanzhou and in winter for chongqing and shenzhen in lanzhou and beijing the enhancement of increases in substrate water storage capacity on runoff retention was higher and in chongqing and shenzhen the impact for increases in crop coefficients i e higher water use plants was more efficient runoff retention performances of extensive green roofs were significantly decreased as rainfall depth increased longer antecedent dry weather period significantly lowered antecedent substrate moisture and resulted in higher runoff retention performances of extensive green roofs these results can assist to formulate an efficient green roof configuration in local climatic condition and spatially allocate appropriate sites to optimize retention performance of green roofs keywords annual retention performance climatic condition rainfall pattern seasonal change substrate storage capacity vegetation type 1 introduction urban floods have great adverse socioeconomic impacts on urban ecosystem and can cause disruptions to city services and damages to urban infrastructures hlodversdottir et al 2015 karamouz et al 2011 wu et al 2020 yin et al 2016 there is a growing concern that flooding risk will increase in many regions of the world especially in metropolitan areas hirabayashi et al 2013 climate change further aggravates flood probability by increasing both the frequency and intensity of climatic extremes avashia and garg 2020 leandro et al 2020 martel et al 2020 thus we need innovative solutions to address the deteriorating effectiveness of existing urban drainage infrastructure lund et al 2019 given the large amount of unused building rooftops which generally constitutes 40 50 of total impermeable surfaces and limited land resources in highly urbanized areas for creating green space dunnett and kingsbury 2008 retrofitting exist conventional roofs with extensive or intensive green roofs provides considerable opportunity to mitigate the risk of urban flooding green roofs are normally classified as either extensive or intensive based on the thickness of the growing substrate layer extensive green roofs are typically 15 cm thick or less and feature short rooting drought resistant plants whereas intensive roof substrates are greater than 15 cm thick and may be sowed with deeper rooting plants including shrubs and trees carson et al 2013 due to building weight restrictions and costs extensive green roofs are more common than deeper intensive roofs thus extensive green roofs are the focus of this study in recent years green roofs have received increased recognition in many countries such as the usa japan australia germany uk and china shafique et al 2018 vijayaraghavan 2016 williams et al 2021 xiao et al 2014 numerous studies have experimentally investigated the ability of green roofs to retain stormwater runoff and the reported cumulative runoff retention percentages ranged from 50 to 90 carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 fassman beck et al 2013 gong et al 2019 harper et al 2015 lee et al 2015 liu et al 2019 stovin et al 2012 zhang et al 2021 moreover reported runoff retention performances of green roofs were varied in different climatic regions around the world for example beecham and razzaghmanesh 2015 found that event based runoff retention of experimental extensive and intensive green roof configurations is between 51 and 96 in a dry climate of south australia gregoire and clausen 2011 reported extensive green roofs on average retain 34 more precipitation under weekly and individual rain storms in a humid continental climate of connecticut united states wong and jim 2014 showed the overall retention for extensive green roof treatments under rainfall events in ten months ranged from 24 3 to 36 3 in a humid tropical region of hong kong nawaz et al 2015 concluded that the overall mean retention of a full scale extensive green roof in 30 individual rainfall events is 66 in a temperate maritime climate of leeds united kingdom fassman beck et al 2013 reported 39 event based runoff retention for extensive green roofs in a sub tropical climate of auckland new zealand sims et al 2016 investigated extensive green roofs in a semi arid and continental climate location finding significantly better runoff retention 67 than both the humid continental climate 48 and humid maritime climate 34 in canada while these laboratory and roof scale findings are important for understanding the possible retention effectiveness of green roofs their variability inherently depending on local climatic settings makes it difficult to reliably translate local results to other climatic regions barnhart et al 2021 some studies have found climatic factors such as rainfall depth and intensity antecedent dry period solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and evapotranspiration rate have notably influenced hydrological performance of green roofs carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 kasmin et al 2010 nawaz et al 2015 sims et al 2016 voyde et al 2010 wong and jim 2015 zheng et al 2021 the rainfall amount determines input to the green roofs while temperature together with wind and irradiance drives evapotranspiration johannessen et al 2017 it is widely acknowledged that runoff retention of green roofs has a negative correlation with rainfall intensity carter and rasmussen 2006 lee et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 and a positive correlation with antecedent dry weather period lee et al 2015 li et al 2019 wong and jim 2015 pointed out the meteorological factors of temperature and wind speed have a great influence on evapotranspiration and end up affecting water storage capacity of extensive green roofs retained substrate moisture and rainfall intercepted by vegetation will all be returned to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration which restores substrate water storage capacity available for the next rainfall event talebi et al 2019 although the ability to accurately predict evapotranspiration from green roofs over a wide range of initial moisture condition is critical for the design of green roofs only few studies experimentally assessed evapotranspiration rates digiovanni et al 2013 poë et al 2015 sherrard and jacobs 2012 wadzuk et al 2013 many of the mathematical models have been used to evaluate the evaporation of water from the substrate and transpiration of plants however only few models were validated considering experimental data of evapotranspiration rates and in many cases the experiments were conducted in laboratory conditions and for short periods cascone et al 2019 although the differences of retention performance may be due to climatic conditions it is difficult to evaluate the effects of climatic conditions from the current literature due to the differing green roof structural configurations and durations of previous studies in various climatic regions sims et al 2016 many numerical models have been developed to evaluate the hydrological performance of green roofs li and babcock 2014 such as swmm storm water management model cipolla et al 2016 versini et al 2015 hydrus 1d model hakimdavar et al 2014 qin et al 2016 soil water atmosphere and plant swap metselaar 2012 water balance model starry et al 2016 vanuytrecht et al 2014 and other conceptual or probabilistic models modeling approaches have been also proposed to simulate green roof performances in unmonitored conditions and where climatic conditions may be different from available field experiments barnhart et al 2021 hellies et al 2018 roehr and kong 2010 sarkar et al 2018 for example roehr and kong 2010 examined extensive green roofs could reduce annual rooftop runoff by 29 in vancouver 55 in shanghai and 100 in kelowna by employing the soil conservation service curve number scs cn method palla and gnecco 2020 used the swmm and climate data series to continuously simulate runoff volume and peak reduction rates of extensive green roofs at three italian sites results simulate the median value of runoff reduction varied from 30 to 52 stovin et al 2013 used a simple model to evaluate the long term runoff retention for four climatic conditions in the uk the model predicts that extensive green roofs retained 19 and 59 of total rainfall amount in cool wet and warm dry climates respectively johannessen et al 2017 employed a simple water balance model coupled with the oudin model of evapotranspiration to study the substrate water storage capacity in ten cold and wet climatic regions in the northern europe norway sweden uk and iceland results indicate large differences in annual runoff retention of extensive green roof among locations driven by distinctions in precipitation amounts and daily temperature talebi et al 2019 applied a water balance equation along with two potential evapotranspiration models to simulate runoff retention by extensive green roofs in six canadian cities their results show that runoff reduction percentages varied from 17 to 50 among the studied locations however the majority of these previous studies relied on specific climatic assumptions to develop the final simulation models their prediction accuracy and applicability of results from different locations are still needed to be validated sohn et al 2019 since green roof hydrologic performance is impacted by regional environmental conditions green roof studies are needed across a range of climate zones to fully understand the feasibility of using this technology in an effective stormwater management strategy carson et al 2013 to evaluate the potential for green roof technology implementing in various locations answers are needed to question of how retention performance varies among climatic conditions johannessen et al 2017 moreover it is still difficult to priori to predict green roof retention in a new location as well as formulate an efficient green roof configuration to enhance retention performance in regional climatic condition barnhart et al 2021 although the majority of studies have focused on event based retention performance of particular green roof configurations and climatic conditions limited studies have assessed and compared annual or long term runoff retention performance in various climatic regions shafique et al 2018 talebi et al 2019 to date the impacts of climatic conditions on annual green roof performance remain unclear and the applicability of simulation results from different locations needed to be validated sohn et al 2019 therefore a fully understanding of climate impacts on the hydrological behavior of green roofs is needed to accurately predict their long term performance under various climatic conditions and formulate an efficient configuration and appropriate placement strategy to enhance retention efficiency with uncertain climate variability eckart et al 2017 sohn et al 2019 the long term retention performances are a more reliable estimate of annual rainfall capture and highlight the importance of long term evaluation when reporting green roof performance consequently there is a need to develop methods for estimating green roof retention rates over multiple years to reduce any bias caused by rainfall distribution within the monitoring period itself carson et al 2013 in this study a water balance model of green roofs coupling evapotranspiration rate estimation was developed four climatic regions in china were selected to compare their annual and seasonal runoff retention performances under identical extensive green roof adoption based on long term 11 years meteorological data and the impacts of substrate and vegetation parameters rainfall patterns on runoff retention performance among different climatic regions were assessed the main goals of the present study are 1 to assess average annual and seasonal runoff retention performances of green roofs in different climatic regions 2 to simulate the impacts of substrate storage capacity and vegetation types on runoff retention of green roofs across different climatic regions 3 to quantify the relationship between rainfall patterns and runoff retention performance the results can advance a key understanding of the impact mechanism of climatic conditions on annual and seasonal runoff retention effectiveness of green roofs in order to optimize structural configuration and strategic placement of green roof implementation 2 materials and methods this study selected four cities lanzhou beijing chongqing and shenzhen in china as the studied sites the simulation and assessment of annual runoff retention performance of green roofs were included three steps the first step is to develop a water balance model of green roofs coupling evapotranspiration rate estimation determine the key substrate and vegetation parameters values and use field monitoring substrate moisture data to calibrate and validate the model the second is to simulate the annual runoff retention and compare the seasonal retention variations of the four climatic locations the final step is to assess the impacts of substrate storage capacity and crop coefficient on annual retention performance and analyze the relationship between rainfall depth as well as antecedent dry weather period and annual runoff retention performance of green roofs the process of research procedures is shown in fig 1 2 1 description of study sites to assess the climate impacts on extensive green roof retention performance four cities lanzhou beijing chongqing and shenzhen in northern and southern china were selected which are located in different climatic regions and have larger gradient of annual precipitation the geographical locations and the climate characteristics with average monthly precipitation and air temperature of the four study sites are shown in fig 2 lanzhou has a temperate continental climate with an average annual temperature of 10 5 c and an average annual rainfall of 320 mm beijing is characterized by a temperate monsoon climate with an average precipitation of 592 mm year and an average annual temperature of 12 5 c chongqing is situated in the humid subtropical monsoon climatic zone with a mean annual precipitation of 1091 mm and annual temperatures of 18 9 c shenzhen has a subtropical maritime monsoon climate with a mean annual precipitation of 1926 mm and a mean annual temperature of 23 0 c 2 2 modeling annual runoff retention of a green roof system according to the water mass balance principle substrate water balance for non irrigated extensive green roofs can be described by the following expression hilten et al 2008 δ s p r e t where δ s is the change in substrate water storage mm p is the rainfall depth input mm r is the discharged runoff depth from green roof mm and et is the actual evapotranspiration of green roof mm then eq 1 can be re written to reflect the condition of substrate water storage at the end of the time step t such that s t 1 s t p t r t et t during a rainfall event the substrate of a green roof will retain rainfall until the point when maximum water storage capacity is reached any water in excess of the substrate storage capacity will be drained vertically down through the substrate layer discharged as runoff when the water content in the substrate is greater than its water will seep from the substrate layer into the storage layer and be temporarily stored meanwhile water stored in the substrate will be removed from the green roof system by the substrate evaporation and plant transpiration during dry periods the available substrate water storage capacity at the beginning of each time step s t 1 mm determines the rainfall amount that can be stored in the substrate before runoff event occurs therefore at each time step t runoff from a green roof r t mm is calculated depending on the rainfall depth p t mm the actual evapotranspiration et t mm the maximum runoff retention capacity of the green roof s m a x mm and the initial substrate moisture content s t 1 it expressed as r t 0 s t 1 p t et t s max p t s max s t 1 et t s t 1 p t et t s max the maximum runoff storage capacity will depend on substrate characteristics of a green roof system before the next rainfall event the green roof s storage capacity will be restored via evapotranspiration accordingly substrate moisture content s t is then updated as follows s t s t 1 p t et t s t 1 p t et t s max s max s t 1 p t et t s max for estimating the actual evaporation of the substrate et t under conditions of restricted water availability the et t is defined as a function of the actual evapotranspiration pet mm multiplied by the ratio of actual water storage to the maximum water holding capacity of the substrate and it can be expressed as et t p e t s t s m a x k c where k c is the crop coefficient crop coefficients defined as the ratio of total evaporation and reference crop evaporation of vegetation types which vary depending on the specific plant species used and the growth stage of the plants for plant species with water requirements exceeding those of the reference crop the crop coefficient is greater than 1 while values 1 indicate lower water requirements relative to the reference crop the equation for calculating potential evapotranspiration pet used the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 which is given as pet 0 0023 ra m a x λ t m a x t m i n 0 5 t a v 17 8 where ra m a x is the extraterrestrial radiation of the surface related to latitude mj m2 d λ is the latent heat of vapor which is 2 45 mj kg t m a x is the maximum daily temperature oc t m i n is the minimum daily temperature oc and t av is the average daily temperature oc 2 3 model input parameters designed green roofs in the study locations were identically assumed as extensive green roofs with substrate depths of 15 cm and planted with sedum species the values of maximum water storage capacity of the green roof s m a x for four locations were acquired from the experimental studies table 1 in the model implementation the maximum storage capacity was assumed to be equal to 13 2 mm which is in accordance with the average value reported in literature from the studied locations a large variety of crop coefficients k c have been obtained from the sedum based green roof studies table 2 most of the reported values of crop coefficients were between 0 21 and 1 1 but values up to almost 2 0 have been found a mean crop coefficient of 0 8 was applied to the model and expected to represent the sedum species initial substrate water content was assumed to be equal to 10 mm these values of model input parameters also defined as a baseline scenario in simulating the impacts of substrate and vegetation parameters on green roof retention performance 2 4 meteorological data collection and field monitoring experiments in this study the daily precipitation and maximum minimum average temperature data of four study cities from the year 2010 to 2020 were obtained from the national meteorological information center china meteorological administration http data cma cn a scale based plot module of extensive green roof was constructed from 2 mm thick stainless steel platform with internal dimensions of 1 0 m wide 1 0 m long 0 25 m height and placed at the testing ground at the dingxi institute of soil and water conservation in gansu province china fig 3 this site is only 85 km straight line distance from lanzhou and the mean annual precipitation is 421 mm the green roof module was assembled with the composite substrate the mix ratio of rural soil peat soil perlite and vermiculite as 2 5 5 2 0 5 substrate depth of 15 cm the vegetation planted with sedum spectabile and the slope level was set 2 based on its metal base the monitoring experiment of substrate moisture content in natural rainfall events was performed with soil moisture sensors 5te decagon devices inc before field experiments 5te sensors were specifically calibrated for the utilized substrate according to the methodology described by kargas et al 2013 the rainfall depth was automatically monitored by a standard tipping bucket rain gauge onset hobo 0 2 mm rainfall smart sensor s rgb the ambientair temperature was measured by an air temperature probe hmp45c campbell scientific inc 2 5 model simulation implementation and evaluation criteria the model was implemented at a daily time step to continuously simulate the runoff depth of green roofs in response to long term rainfall and temperature data the daily pet value was assumed to be a constant rate note that although in reality et rates vary according to a diurnal cycle this was neglected in the model it was the cumulative effect of et over several days prior to a rainfall event that impacts on the substrate moisture condition and determined runoff retention performance of green roofs all algorithms of process equations were implemented in the r software version 3 4 2 in this study the observed and simulated substrate water content were evaluated using two criteria indices the nash sutcliffe efficient nse and mean absolute relative error mae nse is a commonly used goodness of fit measure between the simulated and observed values nash and sutcliffe 1970 mae gives both the performance index of predicted values and the distribution of the estimated errors chai and draxler 2014 the expression for nse value is given as nse 1 i 1 n s pi s oi 2 i 1 n s oi s ave 2 the mae value is expressed as mae 1 n i 1 n s pi s oi in the above equations n is the total number of observations s pi is the simulated substrate water content mm s oi is the observed substrate water content mm s ave is the mean of observed substrate water content mm the best performance for substrate water content simulation is expected to yield nse value is close to 1 and mae value is close to 0 walvoord et al 2003 a model simulation could be judged as satisfactory if nse greater than 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 2 6 definition of runoff retention performance and season classification the expression describing runoff retention percentages rr of the green roof for each rainfall event was computed as follows rr p r v p 100 where p denotes the rainfall volume input to the green roof mm and r v is the discharged runoff depth of the green roof mm in the present study the general distribution of four seasons is identically classified based on local monthly meteorological data as follows spring march may summer june august autumn september november winter december february since on winter days of lanzhou and beijing some precipitation fell as snow during the coldest temperature and thus this study did not consider the seasonal changes in winter for lanzhou and beijing 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation results the model was calibrated and validated using the measured substrate water content of the pilot green roof module together with synchronously monitored rainfall events and temperature series in field experiments the observation data from experimental periods was divided into two independent sub periods from 1 april to 10 may 2021 for calibration and from 25 july to 24 august 2018 for validation the monitored rainfall depths and average daily temperature of the calibration and validation periods were 42 8 mm and 82 0 mm 6 1 c and 22 8 c respectively the model input parameters were then adjusted by the trial and error method to obtain a reasonable estimation of the measured substrate water content data the calibrated values of the model parameter are shown in table 3 the comparison between observed and simulated substrate water content for the green roof is plotted in fig 4 in these cases the model followed closely with the shape of observed hydrographs results showed the nse value computed over the calibration period was 0 94 and the mean absolute relative error mae was 0 011 during the validation period the nse coefficient was 0 80 and the mae was 0 012 overall satisfactory results were obtained for substrate moisture of the green roof at both calibration and validation periods therefore the model can be used to adequately simulate the impacts of climatic conditions on hydrological performances of green roofs 3 2 comparison of annual runoff retention performance among different climatic regions the average annual rainfall depth simulated potential and actual evapotranspiration runoff depth and runoff retention percentages of four studied locations for the analyzed 11 years of time series from the year 2010 to 2020 are summarized in table 4 results showed the greatest average annual runoff retention of green roofs 73 8 was simulated at the driest location lanzhou green roofs in beijing and chongqing have similar annual runoff retention percentages achieving 48 9 and 45 2 respectively however the same green roof configuration in shenzhen retained only 30 0 of the annual rainfall amount which was less than half of that in lanzhou fig 5 also presents the cumulative average annual rainfall and runoff depths of green roofs for the 11 years of time series analyzed at four locations consistent with the retention performances the differences between cumulative average annual rainfall and runoff depths of green roofs vary widely across four locations and are dependent on local climatic conditions the cumulative average annual runoff depths of shenzhen showed a close increased trends with rainfall depths and the increased trend was not close between cumulative average annual rainfall and runoff of lanzhou 3 3 seasonal changes in runoff retention performance seasonal climate characteristics of average rainfall depth daily temperature of rainy days and antecedent dry weather period adwp of four locations are summarized in table 5 average rainfall depth was the smallest and average adwp was the longest in spring of lanzhou and beijing as well as in winter of chongqing and shenzhen fig 6 shows the seasonal variations of runoff retention performances of green roofs at four locations in lanzhou average runoff retention percentage of green roofs in summer was 89 2 which was significantly lower than the spring 92 9 or autumn 94 3 performances similarly green roof retention percentage in spring 94 6 was significantly higher than in summer 80 9 for beijing the highest runoff retention percentages of green roofs in winter of chongqing and shenzhen achieved were 96 4 and 87 9 respectively average runoff retention of green roofs in spring of chongqing was 83 7 which was higher than the summer and autumn 73 8 performance runoff retention performance of green roofs in spring and autumn was significantly higher than for the summer of shenzhen however no significant differences were found in runoff retention percentages of green roofs between spring and autumn of lanzhou and shenzhen and between spring or summer and autumn in beijing as well as between summer and autumn in chongqing 3 4 influences of substrate and vegetation parameters on retention performance the overall results for the analyzed 11 years of meteorological data showed that as maximum water storage capacity increased from 5 mm to 25 mm lanzhou beijing chongqing and shenzhen had average runoff retention enhancements of 34 2 29 6 24 5 and 15 4 respectively for the same vegetation type fig 7 meanwhile runoff retention percentages reached 84 4 60 0 54 5 and 36 1 for lanzhou beijing chongqing and shenzhen respectively for water storage capacity of 25 mm as crop coefficient increased from 0 2 to 1 8 the impact of vegetation types i e low and high water use plants on the enhancement of runoff retention was the greatest in lanzhou 33 8 and was 24 4 and 33 6 for beijing and chongqing respectively and was the lowest in shenzhen 26 0 runoff retention percentages achieved were 80 1 54 7 55 3 and 40 1 for lanzhou beijing chongqing and shenzhen respectively under high water use plants with a crop coefficient of 1 8 moreover it is noted that in lanzhou and beijing the impact of substrate water storage capacity on annual runoff retention was higher and in chongqing and shenzhen the vegetation types had a greater influence on retention 3 5 influences of rainfall patterns on runoff retention performance 3 5 1 rainfall depth since rainfall is the sole input to non irrigated green roofs rainfall depth directly influences the potential for runoff volume reduction results of the regression analysis showed that rainfall depths and runoff retention percentages of the four study locations had a significant non linear negative correlation r 2 0 76 p 0 0001 see fig 8 it revealed that runoff retention performances of green roofs decreased as rainfall depth increased from 0 1 mm to 254 mm therefore green roofs can effectively retain rainwater in substrate for small rainfall events but retention effectiveness was limited when facing heavy storms 3 5 2 antecedent dry weather period antecedent dry weather period is another critical climatic factor that determined the substrate s antecedent moisture level thus an association should exist between adwps and runoff retention fig 9 shows that adwps of the four study locations have a significant negative correlation with substrate water content r 2 0 31 p 0 0001 and have a positive relationship with runoff retention percentages r 2 0 13 p 0 0001 this suggests that as the length of dry period increases antecedent substrate moisture is lower i e more available substrate storage volume and ultimately resulted in higher runoff retention performances of green roofs 4 discussion 4 1 influences of climatic conditions on annual and seasonal retention performances in this study average annual runoff retention percentage of green roofs in beijing chongqing and shenzhou with humid climates was substantially lower than that in lanzhou with an arid continental climate this suggests that green roof adoption in the climatic conditions of lanzhou leads to drier substrate and greater potential for runoff retention it is also noted that beijing and chongqing have similar annual runoff retention percentages this may be due to both being located in the monsoon climatic zone these findings agreed with sims et al 2016 who found that average runoff retention is significantly higher for extensive green roofs in a semi arid climate 75 2 compared to that in a maritime climate 43 4 johannessen et al 2017 found that the lowest percentage of runoff reduction 18 27 of extensive green roofs is predicted for a coastal climate and the highest reduction 40 45 for a continental climate talebi et al 2019 showed that average annual water retention of extensive green roofs is the highest in regina and calgary with a semi arid climate and the lowest in halifax and vancouver with a marine climate zheng et al 2021 indicated that green roofs in continental climates have peak runoff retention rates 35 higher than those in temperate climates runoff retention performance of green roofs is fundamentally governed by the dynamic changes of runoff retention capacity which is depleted during rainfall events and regenerated via evapotranspiration during inter event dry period since longer drying period in lanzhou resulted in a greater amount of available storage for runoff retention the dry substrate can then retain runoff better consistently zhang et al 2021 found higher evapotranspiration between rainfall events on extensive green roofs in a semi arid climate resulting in greater restoration of substrate retention capacity results showed that average runoff retention performance of green roofs was the highest in spring for beijing and lanzhou and in winter for chongqing and shenzhen this could be explained by the fact that the high frequency of light rainfall events and short average dry weather period in spring or winter of their climatic conditions vanuytrecht et al 2014 pointed out runoff retention is expected to decrease in summer and increase in winter of all extensive green roof types stovin et al 2013 concluded that extensive green roofs perform better in a warmer season with smaller rainfall events and lower antecedent substrate moisture level most green roofs studies attribute the seasonal variations in hydrological performances to changes in evapotranspiration rates between different seasons fassman beck et al 2013 graceson et al 2013 in general evapotranspiration is highly influenced by meteorological conditions like air temperature irradiance wind speed and water availability showing long term variation due to seasonal fluctuations in weather conditions cipolla et al 2016 marasco et al 2015 todorov et al 2018 concluded that for extensive green roofs with limited runoff retention seasonal variation in runoff is attributed to variation in rainfall and evapotranspiration in summer the longer the period after last rainfall and drier climate can jointly enhance the retention efficiency of green roofs berretta et al 2014 stovin et al 2013 however several studies reported runoff retention performances of green roofs were higher in summer than that of in winter bengtsson 2005 johannessen et al 2017 nawaz et al 2015 schroll et al 2011 nawaz et al 2015 investigated significant higher retention rates in the summer than in the winter seasons of a full scale extensive green roof the inconsistent findings on seasonal retention performance may be attributed to distinctive climate variations between seasons therefore the above predictions advance a key understanding of the impact mechanism of climatic conditions on annual and seasonal runoff retention performance of green roofs it can further promote spatially strategizing an appropriate placement of green roof implementation by regional climate conditions to optimize retention effectiveness of green roofs in the nationwide 4 2 impacts of substrate and vegetation characteristics on runoff retention capacity results showed that as maximum water storage capacity and crop coefficient increased runoff retention performances of green roofs were distinctly enhanced for the four study locations consistently locatelli et al 2014 found that increasing the retention capacity of extensive green roofs reduces annual runoff and the relation is not linear zhang et al 2019 suggested that substrate water storage capacity is the most important factor govern runoff retention performance of extensive green roofs in a green roof system the actual retained runoff volume is determined by the substrate s water storage capacity and initial water content at the start of a rainfall event liu et al 2021 in a substrate design although better runoff reduction efficiency may be achieved by increasing the thickness and porosity of the substrate the adverse impact of an increase in the building s rooftop load must also be considered todorov et al 2018 in addition hydraulic parameters evolution of ageing substrate over time but the impact of green roof ageing on retention capacity was not inconsistent de ville et al 2017 pointed out increased water holding capacity with age increases the potential for retention performance in contrast bouzouidja et al 2018 indicated that the retention capacity and the delay effect of an extensive green roof are always higher for the new substrate than for the aged one higher crop coefficients denoted higher water use plants giving higher evapotranspiration rates which generate more available water storage capacity to retain stormwater johannessen et al 2017 talebi et al 2019 found the enhancement in runoff retention of the high water use plants increased by more than twice those in low water use plants stovin et al 2013 pointed out higher crop coefficients e g more vigorous plants will lead to enhanced runoff retention of extensive green roofs results also concluded in lanzhou and beijing the enhancement of increased substrate water storage capacity had a greater influence on runoff retention in chongqing and shenzhen the impact for changes of vegetation types was more efficient the main reason for the distinct improvements may be the lower rainfall amount and higher cumulative evapotranspiration between rainfall events in dry climates resulting relatively greater available volume for water storage in substrate high water use plant generally driven higher evapotranspiration rates which is more effective in recovering substrate storage capacity in wet climatic conditions the findings aligned with talebi et al 2019 who found the impact enhancement of the vegetation types in humid climates has a greater influence on runoff reduction than the impact of increases in substrate storage capacity johannessen et al 2017 also concluded annual runoff retention is more sensitive to changes in crop coefficient than to changes in substrate water storage capacity in wet climates however these predicted annual impacts are partially inconsistent with previous storm event based experimental studies that the substrate has a significantly greater influence on runoff retention capacity of green roofs than vegetation type and cover berndtsson 2010 liu et al 2019 stovin et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 concluded the plant induced reduction in the storage capacity of the substrate has a greater effect on available storage and therefore retention regardless of whether the plant was a high or low water user it is worth note that although high water use plants have been suggested as the ideal plants for enhancing retention performance on green roofs farrell et al 2013 it is also important to select plants with caution for dry climates in terms of the survivability as they might not be drought tolerant klein and coffman 2015 4 3 impact mechanism of rainfall patterns on runoff retention the regeneration process of green roof s runoff retention capacity is fundamentally determined by the substrate properties vegetation types and local climatic conditions akther et al 2018 peng et al 2019 stovin et al 2013 schultz et al 2018 found the hydrologic responses of extensive green roofs are depended strongly on the rainfall patterns i e total depth of the storm event and length of the adwp as expected the regression analysis results showed that runoff retention percentages of green roofs were significantly and non linearly decreased as rainfall depth increased these results are consistent with previous findings fassman beck et al 2013 liu et al 2021 nawaz et al 2015 sims et al 2019 speak et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 and indicate that rainfall depth is negatively correlated with runoff retention of green roofs the volume of runoff retained by a green roof system during a rainfall event is determined by the input rainfall depth and its runoff retention capacity palla et al 2009 poë et al 2015 zhang and guo 2013 in general rainfall will be absorbed by a green roof with no runoff discharged during small rainfall size runoff will only occur when rainfall amount exceeds maximum runoff retention capacity of the green roof results indicated that the longer adwp significantly increases runoff retention percentages of green roofs these findings corroborate literature reports which state that the longer the adwp the higher the green roof retention capacity akther et al 2018 hakimdavar et al 2014 razzaghmanesh and beecham 2014 chowdhury and beecham 2013 observed that runoff retention rate of intensive and extensive green roofs can reach nearly 100 when the mean adwp was highest in summer lee et al 2015 reported that an increase in the number of adwp improves runoff retention capacity of intensive and extensive green roofs it is evident that runoff retention capacity is highly sensitive to the initial moisture condition of the green roof prior to a rainfall event which is controlled by the evapotranspiration process during the dry period a longer adwp allows the substrate to dry out through evapotranspiration thereby allowing green roofs have more capacity to retain rainwater in the next rainfall event berndtsson 2010 wong and jim 2014 berretta et al 2014 concluded that for the circumstances with sufficiently long dry period and high evapotranspiration rates the initial substrate moisture content may drop to the wilting point and thus green roof retention capacity could recover to its maximum value therefore the analysis of impact mechanism of rainfall patterns on runoff retention would enhance the efficiency of green roofs to adapt to future climate variability 5 conclusions and future research in this study a water balance model of green roofs coupling evapotranspiration rate estimation of green roofs was developed to enable economic assessment of the long term hydrologic performance it continuously simulated annual runoff retention performances of identical green roof configurations across four different climatic regions based on 11 years of meteorological data and assessed the impacts of substrate storage capacity vegetation types and rainfall patterns on retention performance of green roofs average annual runoff retention percentage of green roofs in beijing 48 9 chongqing 45 2 and shenzhou 30 0 with humid climate was substantially lower than that in lanzhou 73 8 with arid continental climate longer drying period in lanzhou resulted in a greater amount of storage available for runoff retention thus presenting the highest runoff retention performance average runoff retention performance of green roofs was highest in spring of beijing and lanzhou and in winter of chongqing and shenzhen which could be explained by the high frequency of light rainfall events and short average dry weather period in spring or winter in lanzhou and beijing the impact of increased substrate water storage capacity had a greater influence on annual runoff retention in chongqing and shenzhen the enhancement for changes of vegetation types was more efficient as expected the regression analysis results showed that runoff retention performances of green roofs were significantly non linear decreased as rainfall depth increased the longer adwp significantly enhanced runoff retention performance of green roofs the present study provides an effective method for continuously simulating annual runoff retention effectiveness of green roofs in different climatic regions it can provide information to policy makers involved in urban planning and interested in evaluating the possible hydrological impact of green roofs in locations where the field experiment is tricky or high cost in further these predictions can promote spatially strategizing an appropriate placement of green roof implementation by regional climate conditions to optimize flood mitigation effectiveness of green roofs in the nationwide it is important to note that the present study is a moderately accurate hydrologic model and relatively simple assumptions have been used to simulate evapotranspiration and runoff processes of green roofs moreover this study did not explicitly consider rainfall interception by green roof vegetation rather the method assumed that all rainfall is infiltrated into the growing substrate additionally the model parameters such as substrate water storage capacity and crop coefficient used in this study may not represent the actual design characteristics of green roofs such as substrate depth or porosity and plant traits the impacts of green roof ageing on substrate hydraulic parameters evolution and long term retention performance over time were not considered in this study instead this study developed an approach that used a water balance model to enable predicting average annual green roof runoff retention based on the measured values of substrate water content rainfall and temperature data and knowledge of substrate s maximum water storage capacity and crop coefficient in future studies accurate simulation of vegetation interception and evapotranspiration processes of green roofs and quantification of the substrate water storage capacity and crop coefficient related to practical design parameters of substrate and vegetation characteristics are needed moreover long term field monitoring experiments for substrate moisture dynamic evapotranspiration and runoff processes of green roofs in various climatic regions will be also needed to validate simulation results credit

3316,the hydrologic performance of green roofs can be notably influenced by local climatic conditions the majority of studies have focused on event based retention performance of particular green roof configuration and climatic condition making it difficult to predict green roof retention and formulate an efficient green roof configuration in a new location to date limited studies have assessed and compared annual or long term runoff retention performance of green roofs in different climatic regions and the impacts of climatic conditions on reduction effectiveness of green roofs remain unclear in this study a water balance model of green roofs coupling evapotranspiration rate estimation was developed to simulated the annual retention performance of green roofs four cities located in different climatic regions of china were selected to compare their average annual and seasonal runoff retention performances of extensive green roofs using 11 years of meteorological data and assess the impacts of substrate storage capacity vegetation types parameters and rainfall patterns on runoff retention performance among climatic regions results showed that average annual runoff retention in the dry continental climate of lanzhou was 73 8 which was higher than that in the humid climatic regions of beijing 48 9 chongqing 45 2 and shenzhen 30 0 average runoff retention performance of extensive green roofs was the highest in spring for beijing and lanzhou and in winter for chongqing and shenzhen in lanzhou and beijing the enhancement of increases in substrate water storage capacity on runoff retention was higher and in chongqing and shenzhen the impact for increases in crop coefficients i e higher water use plants was more efficient runoff retention performances of extensive green roofs were significantly decreased as rainfall depth increased longer antecedent dry weather period significantly lowered antecedent substrate moisture and resulted in higher runoff retention performances of extensive green roofs these results can assist to formulate an efficient green roof configuration in local climatic condition and spatially allocate appropriate sites to optimize retention performance of green roofs keywords annual retention performance climatic condition rainfall pattern seasonal change substrate storage capacity vegetation type 1 introduction urban floods have great adverse socioeconomic impacts on urban ecosystem and can cause disruptions to city services and damages to urban infrastructures hlodversdottir et al 2015 karamouz et al 2011 wu et al 2020 yin et al 2016 there is a growing concern that flooding risk will increase in many regions of the world especially in metropolitan areas hirabayashi et al 2013 climate change further aggravates flood probability by increasing both the frequency and intensity of climatic extremes avashia and garg 2020 leandro et al 2020 martel et al 2020 thus we need innovative solutions to address the deteriorating effectiveness of existing urban drainage infrastructure lund et al 2019 given the large amount of unused building rooftops which generally constitutes 40 50 of total impermeable surfaces and limited land resources in highly urbanized areas for creating green space dunnett and kingsbury 2008 retrofitting exist conventional roofs with extensive or intensive green roofs provides considerable opportunity to mitigate the risk of urban flooding green roofs are normally classified as either extensive or intensive based on the thickness of the growing substrate layer extensive green roofs are typically 15 cm thick or less and feature short rooting drought resistant plants whereas intensive roof substrates are greater than 15 cm thick and may be sowed with deeper rooting plants including shrubs and trees carson et al 2013 due to building weight restrictions and costs extensive green roofs are more common than deeper intensive roofs thus extensive green roofs are the focus of this study in recent years green roofs have received increased recognition in many countries such as the usa japan australia germany uk and china shafique et al 2018 vijayaraghavan 2016 williams et al 2021 xiao et al 2014 numerous studies have experimentally investigated the ability of green roofs to retain stormwater runoff and the reported cumulative runoff retention percentages ranged from 50 to 90 carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 fassman beck et al 2013 gong et al 2019 harper et al 2015 lee et al 2015 liu et al 2019 stovin et al 2012 zhang et al 2021 moreover reported runoff retention performances of green roofs were varied in different climatic regions around the world for example beecham and razzaghmanesh 2015 found that event based runoff retention of experimental extensive and intensive green roof configurations is between 51 and 96 in a dry climate of south australia gregoire and clausen 2011 reported extensive green roofs on average retain 34 more precipitation under weekly and individual rain storms in a humid continental climate of connecticut united states wong and jim 2014 showed the overall retention for extensive green roof treatments under rainfall events in ten months ranged from 24 3 to 36 3 in a humid tropical region of hong kong nawaz et al 2015 concluded that the overall mean retention of a full scale extensive green roof in 30 individual rainfall events is 66 in a temperate maritime climate of leeds united kingdom fassman beck et al 2013 reported 39 event based runoff retention for extensive green roofs in a sub tropical climate of auckland new zealand sims et al 2016 investigated extensive green roofs in a semi arid and continental climate location finding significantly better runoff retention 67 than both the humid continental climate 48 and humid maritime climate 34 in canada while these laboratory and roof scale findings are important for understanding the possible retention effectiveness of green roofs their variability inherently depending on local climatic settings makes it difficult to reliably translate local results to other climatic regions barnhart et al 2021 some studies have found climatic factors such as rainfall depth and intensity antecedent dry period solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and evapotranspiration rate have notably influenced hydrological performance of green roofs carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 kasmin et al 2010 nawaz et al 2015 sims et al 2016 voyde et al 2010 wong and jim 2015 zheng et al 2021 the rainfall amount determines input to the green roofs while temperature together with wind and irradiance drives evapotranspiration johannessen et al 2017 it is widely acknowledged that runoff retention of green roofs has a negative correlation with rainfall intensity carter and rasmussen 2006 lee et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 and a positive correlation with antecedent dry weather period lee et al 2015 li et al 2019 wong and jim 2015 pointed out the meteorological factors of temperature and wind speed have a great influence on evapotranspiration and end up affecting water storage capacity of extensive green roofs retained substrate moisture and rainfall intercepted by vegetation will all be returned to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration which restores substrate water storage capacity available for the next rainfall event talebi et al 2019 although the ability to accurately predict evapotranspiration from green roofs over a wide range of initial moisture condition is critical for the design of green roofs only few studies experimentally assessed evapotranspiration rates digiovanni et al 2013 poë et al 2015 sherrard and jacobs 2012 wadzuk et al 2013 many of the mathematical models have been used to evaluate the evaporation of water from the substrate and transpiration of plants however only few models were validated considering experimental data of evapotranspiration rates and in many cases the experiments were conducted in laboratory conditions and for short periods cascone et al 2019 although the differences of retention performance may be due to climatic conditions it is difficult to evaluate the effects of climatic conditions from the current literature due to the differing green roof structural configurations and durations of previous studies in various climatic regions sims et al 2016 many numerical models have been developed to evaluate the hydrological performance of green roofs li and babcock 2014 such as swmm storm water management model cipolla et al 2016 versini et al 2015 hydrus 1d model hakimdavar et al 2014 qin et al 2016 soil water atmosphere and plant swap metselaar 2012 water balance model starry et al 2016 vanuytrecht et al 2014 and other conceptual or probabilistic models modeling approaches have been also proposed to simulate green roof performances in unmonitored conditions and where climatic conditions may be different from available field experiments barnhart et al 2021 hellies et al 2018 roehr and kong 2010 sarkar et al 2018 for example roehr and kong 2010 examined extensive green roofs could reduce annual rooftop runoff by 29 in vancouver 55 in shanghai and 100 in kelowna by employing the soil conservation service curve number scs cn method palla and gnecco 2020 used the swmm and climate data series to continuously simulate runoff volume and peak reduction rates of extensive green roofs at three italian sites results simulate the median value of runoff reduction varied from 30 to 52 stovin et al 2013 used a simple model to evaluate the long term runoff retention for four climatic conditions in the uk the model predicts that extensive green roofs retained 19 and 59 of total rainfall amount in cool wet and warm dry climates respectively johannessen et al 2017 employed a simple water balance model coupled with the oudin model of evapotranspiration to study the substrate water storage capacity in ten cold and wet climatic regions in the northern europe norway sweden uk and iceland results indicate large differences in annual runoff retention of extensive green roof among locations driven by distinctions in precipitation amounts and daily temperature talebi et al 2019 applied a water balance equation along with two potential evapotranspiration models to simulate runoff retention by extensive green roofs in six canadian cities their results show that runoff reduction percentages varied from 17 to 50 among the studied locations however the majority of these previous studies relied on specific climatic assumptions to develop the final simulation models their prediction accuracy and applicability of results from different locations are still needed to be validated sohn et al 2019 since green roof hydrologic performance is impacted by regional environmental conditions green roof studies are needed across a range of climate zones to fully understand the feasibility of using this technology in an effective stormwater management strategy carson et al 2013 to evaluate the potential for green roof technology implementing in various locations answers are needed to question of how retention performance varies among climatic conditions johannessen et al 2017 moreover it is still difficult to priori to predict green roof retention in a new location as well as formulate an efficient green roof configuration to enhance retention performance in regional climatic condition barnhart et al 2021 although the majority of studies have focused on event based retention performance of particular green roof configurations and climatic conditions limited studies have assessed and compared annual or long term runoff retention performance in various climatic regions shafique et al 2018 talebi et al 2019 to date the impacts of climatic conditions on annual green roof performance remain unclear and the applicability of simulation results from different locations needed to be validated sohn et al 2019 therefore a fully understanding of climate impacts on the hydrological behavior of green roofs is needed to accurately predict their long term performance under various climatic conditions and formulate an efficient configuration and appropriate placement strategy to enhance retention efficiency with uncertain climate variability eckart et al 2017 sohn et al 2019 the long term retention performances are a more reliable estimate of annual rainfall capture and highlight the importance of long term evaluation when reporting green roof performance consequently there is a need to develop methods for estimating green roof retention rates over multiple years to reduce any bias caused by rainfall distribution within the monitoring period itself carson et al 2013 in this study a water balance model of green roofs coupling evapotranspiration rate estimation was developed four climatic regions in china were selected to compare their annual and seasonal runoff retention performances under identical extensive green roof adoption based on long term 11 years meteorological data and the impacts of substrate and vegetation parameters rainfall patterns on runoff retention performance among different climatic regions were assessed the main goals of the present study are 1 to assess average annual and seasonal runoff retention performances of green roofs in different climatic regions 2 to simulate the impacts of substrate storage capacity and vegetation types on runoff retention of green roofs across different climatic regions 3 to quantify the relationship between rainfall patterns and runoff retention performance the results can advance a key understanding of the impact mechanism of climatic conditions on annual and seasonal runoff retention effectiveness of green roofs in order to optimize structural configuration and strategic placement of green roof implementation 2 materials and methods this study selected four cities lanzhou beijing chongqing and shenzhen in china as the studied sites the simulation and assessment of annual runoff retention performance of green roofs were included three steps the first step is to develop a water balance model of green roofs coupling evapotranspiration rate estimation determine the key substrate and vegetation parameters values and use field monitoring substrate moisture data to calibrate and validate the model the second is to simulate the annual runoff retention and compare the seasonal retention variations of the four climatic locations the final step is to assess the impacts of substrate storage capacity and crop coefficient on annual retention performance and analyze the relationship between rainfall depth as well as antecedent dry weather period and annual runoff retention performance of green roofs the process of research procedures is shown in fig 1 2 1 description of study sites to assess the climate impacts on extensive green roof retention performance four cities lanzhou beijing chongqing and shenzhen in northern and southern china were selected which are located in different climatic regions and have larger gradient of annual precipitation the geographical locations and the climate characteristics with average monthly precipitation and air temperature of the four study sites are shown in fig 2 lanzhou has a temperate continental climate with an average annual temperature of 10 5 c and an average annual rainfall of 320 mm beijing is characterized by a temperate monsoon climate with an average precipitation of 592 mm year and an average annual temperature of 12 5 c chongqing is situated in the humid subtropical monsoon climatic zone with a mean annual precipitation of 1091 mm and annual temperatures of 18 9 c shenzhen has a subtropical maritime monsoon climate with a mean annual precipitation of 1926 mm and a mean annual temperature of 23 0 c 2 2 modeling annual runoff retention of a green roof system according to the water mass balance principle substrate water balance for non irrigated extensive green roofs can be described by the following expression hilten et al 2008 δ s p r e t where δ s is the change in substrate water storage mm p is the rainfall depth input mm r is the discharged runoff depth from green roof mm and et is the actual evapotranspiration of green roof mm then eq 1 can be re written to reflect the condition of substrate water storage at the end of the time step t such that s t 1 s t p t r t et t during a rainfall event the substrate of a green roof will retain rainfall until the point when maximum water storage capacity is reached any water in excess of the substrate storage capacity will be drained vertically down through the substrate layer discharged as runoff when the water content in the substrate is greater than its water will seep from the substrate layer into the storage layer and be temporarily stored meanwhile water stored in the substrate will be removed from the green roof system by the substrate evaporation and plant transpiration during dry periods the available substrate water storage capacity at the beginning of each time step s t 1 mm determines the rainfall amount that can be stored in the substrate before runoff event occurs therefore at each time step t runoff from a green roof r t mm is calculated depending on the rainfall depth p t mm the actual evapotranspiration et t mm the maximum runoff retention capacity of the green roof s m a x mm and the initial substrate moisture content s t 1 it expressed as r t 0 s t 1 p t et t s max p t s max s t 1 et t s t 1 p t et t s max the maximum runoff storage capacity will depend on substrate characteristics of a green roof system before the next rainfall event the green roof s storage capacity will be restored via evapotranspiration accordingly substrate moisture content s t is then updated as follows s t s t 1 p t et t s t 1 p t et t s max s max s t 1 p t et t s max for estimating the actual evaporation of the substrate et t under conditions of restricted water availability the et t is defined as a function of the actual evapotranspiration pet mm multiplied by the ratio of actual water storage to the maximum water holding capacity of the substrate and it can be expressed as et t p e t s t s m a x k c where k c is the crop coefficient crop coefficients defined as the ratio of total evaporation and reference crop evaporation of vegetation types which vary depending on the specific plant species used and the growth stage of the plants for plant species with water requirements exceeding those of the reference crop the crop coefficient is greater than 1 while values 1 indicate lower water requirements relative to the reference crop the equation for calculating potential evapotranspiration pet used the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 which is given as pet 0 0023 ra m a x λ t m a x t m i n 0 5 t a v 17 8 where ra m a x is the extraterrestrial radiation of the surface related to latitude mj m2 d λ is the latent heat of vapor which is 2 45 mj kg t m a x is the maximum daily temperature oc t m i n is the minimum daily temperature oc and t av is the average daily temperature oc 2 3 model input parameters designed green roofs in the study locations were identically assumed as extensive green roofs with substrate depths of 15 cm and planted with sedum species the values of maximum water storage capacity of the green roof s m a x for four locations were acquired from the experimental studies table 1 in the model implementation the maximum storage capacity was assumed to be equal to 13 2 mm which is in accordance with the average value reported in literature from the studied locations a large variety of crop coefficients k c have been obtained from the sedum based green roof studies table 2 most of the reported values of crop coefficients were between 0 21 and 1 1 but values up to almost 2 0 have been found a mean crop coefficient of 0 8 was applied to the model and expected to represent the sedum species initial substrate water content was assumed to be equal to 10 mm these values of model input parameters also defined as a baseline scenario in simulating the impacts of substrate and vegetation parameters on green roof retention performance 2 4 meteorological data collection and field monitoring experiments in this study the daily precipitation and maximum minimum average temperature data of four study cities from the year 2010 to 2020 were obtained from the national meteorological information center china meteorological administration http data cma cn a scale based plot module of extensive green roof was constructed from 2 mm thick stainless steel platform with internal dimensions of 1 0 m wide 1 0 m long 0 25 m height and placed at the testing ground at the dingxi institute of soil and water conservation in gansu province china fig 3 this site is only 85 km straight line distance from lanzhou and the mean annual precipitation is 421 mm the green roof module was assembled with the composite substrate the mix ratio of rural soil peat soil perlite and vermiculite as 2 5 5 2 0 5 substrate depth of 15 cm the vegetation planted with sedum spectabile and the slope level was set 2 based on its metal base the monitoring experiment of substrate moisture content in natural rainfall events was performed with soil moisture sensors 5te decagon devices inc before field experiments 5te sensors were specifically calibrated for the utilized substrate according to the methodology described by kargas et al 2013 the rainfall depth was automatically monitored by a standard tipping bucket rain gauge onset hobo 0 2 mm rainfall smart sensor s rgb the ambientair temperature was measured by an air temperature probe hmp45c campbell scientific inc 2 5 model simulation implementation and evaluation criteria the model was implemented at a daily time step to continuously simulate the runoff depth of green roofs in response to long term rainfall and temperature data the daily pet value was assumed to be a constant rate note that although in reality et rates vary according to a diurnal cycle this was neglected in the model it was the cumulative effect of et over several days prior to a rainfall event that impacts on the substrate moisture condition and determined runoff retention performance of green roofs all algorithms of process equations were implemented in the r software version 3 4 2 in this study the observed and simulated substrate water content were evaluated using two criteria indices the nash sutcliffe efficient nse and mean absolute relative error mae nse is a commonly used goodness of fit measure between the simulated and observed values nash and sutcliffe 1970 mae gives both the performance index of predicted values and the distribution of the estimated errors chai and draxler 2014 the expression for nse value is given as nse 1 i 1 n s pi s oi 2 i 1 n s oi s ave 2 the mae value is expressed as mae 1 n i 1 n s pi s oi in the above equations n is the total number of observations s pi is the simulated substrate water content mm s oi is the observed substrate water content mm s ave is the mean of observed substrate water content mm the best performance for substrate water content simulation is expected to yield nse value is close to 1 and mae value is close to 0 walvoord et al 2003 a model simulation could be judged as satisfactory if nse greater than 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 2 6 definition of runoff retention performance and season classification the expression describing runoff retention percentages rr of the green roof for each rainfall event was computed as follows rr p r v p 100 where p denotes the rainfall volume input to the green roof mm and r v is the discharged runoff depth of the green roof mm in the present study the general distribution of four seasons is identically classified based on local monthly meteorological data as follows spring march may summer june august autumn september november winter december february since on winter days of lanzhou and beijing some precipitation fell as snow during the coldest temperature and thus this study did not consider the seasonal changes in winter for lanzhou and beijing 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation results the model was calibrated and validated using the measured substrate water content of the pilot green roof module together with synchronously monitored rainfall events and temperature series in field experiments the observation data from experimental periods was divided into two independent sub periods from 1 april to 10 may 2021 for calibration and from 25 july to 24 august 2018 for validation the monitored rainfall depths and average daily temperature of the calibration and validation periods were 42 8 mm and 82 0 mm 6 1 c and 22 8 c respectively the model input parameters were then adjusted by the trial and error method to obtain a reasonable estimation of the measured substrate water content data the calibrated values of the model parameter are shown in table 3 the comparison between observed and simulated substrate water content for the green roof is plotted in fig 4 in these cases the model followed closely with the shape of observed hydrographs results showed the nse value computed over the calibration period was 0 94 and the mean absolute relative error mae was 0 011 during the validation period the nse coefficient was 0 80 and the mae was 0 012 overall satisfactory results were obtained for substrate moisture of the green roof at both calibration and validation periods therefore the model can be used to adequately simulate the impacts of climatic conditions on hydrological performances of green roofs 3 2 comparison of annual runoff retention performance among different climatic regions the average annual rainfall depth simulated potential and actual evapotranspiration runoff depth and runoff retention percentages of four studied locations for the analyzed 11 years of time series from the year 2010 to 2020 are summarized in table 4 results showed the greatest average annual runoff retention of green roofs 73 8 was simulated at the driest location lanzhou green roofs in beijing and chongqing have similar annual runoff retention percentages achieving 48 9 and 45 2 respectively however the same green roof configuration in shenzhen retained only 30 0 of the annual rainfall amount which was less than half of that in lanzhou fig 5 also presents the cumulative average annual rainfall and runoff depths of green roofs for the 11 years of time series analyzed at four locations consistent with the retention performances the differences between cumulative average annual rainfall and runoff depths of green roofs vary widely across four locations and are dependent on local climatic conditions the cumulative average annual runoff depths of shenzhen showed a close increased trends with rainfall depths and the increased trend was not close between cumulative average annual rainfall and runoff of lanzhou 3 3 seasonal changes in runoff retention performance seasonal climate characteristics of average rainfall depth daily temperature of rainy days and antecedent dry weather period adwp of four locations are summarized in table 5 average rainfall depth was the smallest and average adwp was the longest in spring of lanzhou and beijing as well as in winter of chongqing and shenzhen fig 6 shows the seasonal variations of runoff retention performances of green roofs at four locations in lanzhou average runoff retention percentage of green roofs in summer was 89 2 which was significantly lower than the spring 92 9 or autumn 94 3 performances similarly green roof retention percentage in spring 94 6 was significantly higher than in summer 80 9 for beijing the highest runoff retention percentages of green roofs in winter of chongqing and shenzhen achieved were 96 4 and 87 9 respectively average runoff retention of green roofs in spring of chongqing was 83 7 which was higher than the summer and autumn 73 8 performance runoff retention performance of green roofs in spring and autumn was significantly higher than for the summer of shenzhen however no significant differences were found in runoff retention percentages of green roofs between spring and autumn of lanzhou and shenzhen and between spring or summer and autumn in beijing as well as between summer and autumn in chongqing 3 4 influences of substrate and vegetation parameters on retention performance the overall results for the analyzed 11 years of meteorological data showed that as maximum water storage capacity increased from 5 mm to 25 mm lanzhou beijing chongqing and shenzhen had average runoff retention enhancements of 34 2 29 6 24 5 and 15 4 respectively for the same vegetation type fig 7 meanwhile runoff retention percentages reached 84 4 60 0 54 5 and 36 1 for lanzhou beijing chongqing and shenzhen respectively for water storage capacity of 25 mm as crop coefficient increased from 0 2 to 1 8 the impact of vegetation types i e low and high water use plants on the enhancement of runoff retention was the greatest in lanzhou 33 8 and was 24 4 and 33 6 for beijing and chongqing respectively and was the lowest in shenzhen 26 0 runoff retention percentages achieved were 80 1 54 7 55 3 and 40 1 for lanzhou beijing chongqing and shenzhen respectively under high water use plants with a crop coefficient of 1 8 moreover it is noted that in lanzhou and beijing the impact of substrate water storage capacity on annual runoff retention was higher and in chongqing and shenzhen the vegetation types had a greater influence on retention 3 5 influences of rainfall patterns on runoff retention performance 3 5 1 rainfall depth since rainfall is the sole input to non irrigated green roofs rainfall depth directly influences the potential for runoff volume reduction results of the regression analysis showed that rainfall depths and runoff retention percentages of the four study locations had a significant non linear negative correlation r 2 0 76 p 0 0001 see fig 8 it revealed that runoff retention performances of green roofs decreased as rainfall depth increased from 0 1 mm to 254 mm therefore green roofs can effectively retain rainwater in substrate for small rainfall events but retention effectiveness was limited when facing heavy storms 3 5 2 antecedent dry weather period antecedent dry weather period is another critical climatic factor that determined the substrate s antecedent moisture level thus an association should exist between adwps and runoff retention fig 9 shows that adwps of the four study locations have a significant negative correlation with substrate water content r 2 0 31 p 0 0001 and have a positive relationship with runoff retention percentages r 2 0 13 p 0 0001 this suggests that as the length of dry period increases antecedent substrate moisture is lower i e more available substrate storage volume and ultimately resulted in higher runoff retention performances of green roofs 4 discussion 4 1 influences of climatic conditions on annual and seasonal retention performances in this study average annual runoff retention percentage of green roofs in beijing chongqing and shenzhou with humid climates was substantially lower than that in lanzhou with an arid continental climate this suggests that green roof adoption in the climatic conditions of lanzhou leads to drier substrate and greater potential for runoff retention it is also noted that beijing and chongqing have similar annual runoff retention percentages this may be due to both being located in the monsoon climatic zone these findings agreed with sims et al 2016 who found that average runoff retention is significantly higher for extensive green roofs in a semi arid climate 75 2 compared to that in a maritime climate 43 4 johannessen et al 2017 found that the lowest percentage of runoff reduction 18 27 of extensive green roofs is predicted for a coastal climate and the highest reduction 40 45 for a continental climate talebi et al 2019 showed that average annual water retention of extensive green roofs is the highest in regina and calgary with a semi arid climate and the lowest in halifax and vancouver with a marine climate zheng et al 2021 indicated that green roofs in continental climates have peak runoff retention rates 35 higher than those in temperate climates runoff retention performance of green roofs is fundamentally governed by the dynamic changes of runoff retention capacity which is depleted during rainfall events and regenerated via evapotranspiration during inter event dry period since longer drying period in lanzhou resulted in a greater amount of available storage for runoff retention the dry substrate can then retain runoff better consistently zhang et al 2021 found higher evapotranspiration between rainfall events on extensive green roofs in a semi arid climate resulting in greater restoration of substrate retention capacity results showed that average runoff retention performance of green roofs was the highest in spring for beijing and lanzhou and in winter for chongqing and shenzhen this could be explained by the fact that the high frequency of light rainfall events and short average dry weather period in spring or winter of their climatic conditions vanuytrecht et al 2014 pointed out runoff retention is expected to decrease in summer and increase in winter of all extensive green roof types stovin et al 2013 concluded that extensive green roofs perform better in a warmer season with smaller rainfall events and lower antecedent substrate moisture level most green roofs studies attribute the seasonal variations in hydrological performances to changes in evapotranspiration rates between different seasons fassman beck et al 2013 graceson et al 2013 in general evapotranspiration is highly influenced by meteorological conditions like air temperature irradiance wind speed and water availability showing long term variation due to seasonal fluctuations in weather conditions cipolla et al 2016 marasco et al 2015 todorov et al 2018 concluded that for extensive green roofs with limited runoff retention seasonal variation in runoff is attributed to variation in rainfall and evapotranspiration in summer the longer the period after last rainfall and drier climate can jointly enhance the retention efficiency of green roofs berretta et al 2014 stovin et al 2013 however several studies reported runoff retention performances of green roofs were higher in summer than that of in winter bengtsson 2005 johannessen et al 2017 nawaz et al 2015 schroll et al 2011 nawaz et al 2015 investigated significant higher retention rates in the summer than in the winter seasons of a full scale extensive green roof the inconsistent findings on seasonal retention performance may be attributed to distinctive climate variations between seasons therefore the above predictions advance a key understanding of the impact mechanism of climatic conditions on annual and seasonal runoff retention performance of green roofs it can further promote spatially strategizing an appropriate placement of green roof implementation by regional climate conditions to optimize retention effectiveness of green roofs in the nationwide 4 2 impacts of substrate and vegetation characteristics on runoff retention capacity results showed that as maximum water storage capacity and crop coefficient increased runoff retention performances of green roofs were distinctly enhanced for the four study locations consistently locatelli et al 2014 found that increasing the retention capacity of extensive green roofs reduces annual runoff and the relation is not linear zhang et al 2019 suggested that substrate water storage capacity is the most important factor govern runoff retention performance of extensive green roofs in a green roof system the actual retained runoff volume is determined by the substrate s water storage capacity and initial water content at the start of a rainfall event liu et al 2021 in a substrate design although better runoff reduction efficiency may be achieved by increasing the thickness and porosity of the substrate the adverse impact of an increase in the building s rooftop load must also be considered todorov et al 2018 in addition hydraulic parameters evolution of ageing substrate over time but the impact of green roof ageing on retention capacity was not inconsistent de ville et al 2017 pointed out increased water holding capacity with age increases the potential for retention performance in contrast bouzouidja et al 2018 indicated that the retention capacity and the delay effect of an extensive green roof are always higher for the new substrate than for the aged one higher crop coefficients denoted higher water use plants giving higher evapotranspiration rates which generate more available water storage capacity to retain stormwater johannessen et al 2017 talebi et al 2019 found the enhancement in runoff retention of the high water use plants increased by more than twice those in low water use plants stovin et al 2013 pointed out higher crop coefficients e g more vigorous plants will lead to enhanced runoff retention of extensive green roofs results also concluded in lanzhou and beijing the enhancement of increased substrate water storage capacity had a greater influence on runoff retention in chongqing and shenzhen the impact for changes of vegetation types was more efficient the main reason for the distinct improvements may be the lower rainfall amount and higher cumulative evapotranspiration between rainfall events in dry climates resulting relatively greater available volume for water storage in substrate high water use plant generally driven higher evapotranspiration rates which is more effective in recovering substrate storage capacity in wet climatic conditions the findings aligned with talebi et al 2019 who found the impact enhancement of the vegetation types in humid climates has a greater influence on runoff reduction than the impact of increases in substrate storage capacity johannessen et al 2017 also concluded annual runoff retention is more sensitive to changes in crop coefficient than to changes in substrate water storage capacity in wet climates however these predicted annual impacts are partially inconsistent with previous storm event based experimental studies that the substrate has a significantly greater influence on runoff retention capacity of green roofs than vegetation type and cover berndtsson 2010 liu et al 2019 stovin et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 concluded the plant induced reduction in the storage capacity of the substrate has a greater effect on available storage and therefore retention regardless of whether the plant was a high or low water user it is worth note that although high water use plants have been suggested as the ideal plants for enhancing retention performance on green roofs farrell et al 2013 it is also important to select plants with caution for dry climates in terms of the survivability as they might not be drought tolerant klein and coffman 2015 4 3 impact mechanism of rainfall patterns on runoff retention the regeneration process of green roof s runoff retention capacity is fundamentally determined by the substrate properties vegetation types and local climatic conditions akther et al 2018 peng et al 2019 stovin et al 2013 schultz et al 2018 found the hydrologic responses of extensive green roofs are depended strongly on the rainfall patterns i e total depth of the storm event and length of the adwp as expected the regression analysis results showed that runoff retention percentages of green roofs were significantly and non linearly decreased as rainfall depth increased these results are consistent with previous findings fassman beck et al 2013 liu et al 2021 nawaz et al 2015 sims et al 2019 speak et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 and indicate that rainfall depth is negatively correlated with runoff retention of green roofs the volume of runoff retained by a green roof system during a rainfall event is determined by the input rainfall depth and its runoff retention capacity palla et al 2009 poë et al 2015 zhang and guo 2013 in general rainfall will be absorbed by a green roof with no runoff discharged during small rainfall size runoff will only occur when rainfall amount exceeds maximum runoff retention capacity of the green roof results indicated that the longer adwp significantly increases runoff retention percentages of green roofs these findings corroborate literature reports which state that the longer the adwp the higher the green roof retention capacity akther et al 2018 hakimdavar et al 2014 razzaghmanesh and beecham 2014 chowdhury and beecham 2013 observed that runoff retention rate of intensive and extensive green roofs can reach nearly 100 when the mean adwp was highest in summer lee et al 2015 reported that an increase in the number of adwp improves runoff retention capacity of intensive and extensive green roofs it is evident that runoff retention capacity is highly sensitive to the initial moisture condition of the green roof prior to a rainfall event which is controlled by the evapotranspiration process during the dry period a longer adwp allows the substrate to dry out through evapotranspiration thereby allowing green roofs have more capacity to retain rainwater in the next rainfall event berndtsson 2010 wong and jim 2014 berretta et al 2014 concluded that for the circumstances with sufficiently long dry period and high evapotranspiration rates the initial substrate moisture content may drop to the wilting point and thus green roof retention capacity could recover to its maximum value therefore the analysis of impact mechanism of rainfall patterns on runoff retention would enhance the efficiency of green roofs to adapt to future climate variability 5 conclusions and future research in this study a water balance model of green roofs coupling evapotranspiration rate estimation of green roofs was developed to enable economic assessment of the long term hydrologic performance it continuously simulated annual runoff retention performances of identical green roof configurations across four different climatic regions based on 11 years of meteorological data and assessed the impacts of substrate storage capacity vegetation types and rainfall patterns on retention performance of green roofs average annual runoff retention percentage of green roofs in beijing 48 9 chongqing 45 2 and shenzhou 30 0 with humid climate was substantially lower than that in lanzhou 73 8 with arid continental climate longer drying period in lanzhou resulted in a greater amount of storage available for runoff retention thus presenting the highest runoff retention performance average runoff retention performance of green roofs was highest in spring of beijing and lanzhou and in winter of chongqing and shenzhen which could be explained by the high frequency of light rainfall events and short average dry weather period in spring or winter in lanzhou and beijing the impact of increased substrate water storage capacity had a greater influence on annual runoff retention in chongqing and shenzhen the enhancement for changes of vegetation types was more efficient as expected the regression analysis results showed that runoff retention performances of green roofs were significantly non linear decreased as rainfall depth increased the longer adwp significantly enhanced runoff retention performance of green roofs the present study provides an effective method for continuously simulating annual runoff retention effectiveness of green roofs in different climatic regions it can provide information to policy makers involved in urban planning and interested in evaluating the possible hydrological impact of green roofs in locations where the field experiment is tricky or high cost in further these predictions can promote spatially strategizing an appropriate placement of green roof implementation by regional climate conditions to optimize flood mitigation effectiveness of green roofs in the nationwide it is important to note that the present study is a moderately accurate hydrologic model and relatively simple assumptions have been used to simulate evapotranspiration and runoff processes of green roofs moreover this study did not explicitly consider rainfall interception by green roof vegetation rather the method assumed that all rainfall is infiltrated into the growing substrate additionally the model parameters such as substrate water storage capacity and crop coefficient used in this study may not represent the actual design characteristics of green roofs such as substrate depth or porosity and plant traits the impacts of green roof ageing on substrate hydraulic parameters evolution and long term retention performance over time were not considered in this study instead this study developed an approach that used a water balance model to enable predicting average annual green roof runoff retention based on the measured values of substrate water content rainfall and temperature data and knowledge of substrate s maximum water storage capacity and crop coefficient in future studies accurate simulation of vegetation interception and evapotranspiration processes of green roofs and quantification of the substrate water storage capacity and crop coefficient related to practical design parameters of substrate and vegetation characteristics are needed moreover long term field monitoring experiments for substrate moisture dynamic evapotranspiration and runoff processes of green roofs in various climatic regions will be also needed to validate simulation results credit

3317,understanding migration characteristics and the representative elementary volume rev variation of the entrapped light non aqueous phase fluids lnapl under dynamic groundwater conditions is significant in quantifying the effective parameters and formulating pollution treatment strategies this paper investigates the effect of the initial water table height the fluctuation intensity and the fluctuation sequence on redistribution characteristics and revs of lnapl in a two dimensional 2d flow chamber the migration behaviors of pollution plumes and associated revs were quantified by spatial moments and the criterion χi the results indicated that the redistribution location of residual pollutants was mainly determined by the fluctuation sequence the rev gradually decreases as the rising water table while the minimum so rev frequency distribution becomes closer to a regular gaussian distribution these results shed light upon the effect of dynamic water tables on the morphology features and revs of lnapl which can offer valuable guidance for designing remediation schemes keywords entrapped lnap light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl representative elementary volume rev redistribution characteristics water table fluctuation 1 introduction organic contaminants in non aqueous phase liquid napl form are among the main causes of groundwater and soil contamination alazaiza et al 2020a maire et al 2018 as a consequence of their low aqueous solubility these contaminants are difficult to remove entirely and therefore commonly constitute long term sources of contamination in the groundwater environment which has become a widespread and challenging problem jiang et al 2018 ogunlaja et al 2019 yang et al 2020 napls with densities less than water are defined as light non aqueous phase fluids lnapl while napls with densities greater than water are defined as dense non aqueous phase fluids dnapl when lnapl is spilled into the groundwater system it can be trapped as residual ganglia and globules in the vadose zone because of capillary forces if a sufficient quantity is present it will migrate downward through the vadose zone to the top of the saturated zone and accumulate as contaminant pools mateas et al 2017 shi et al 2018 groundwater fluctuations will cause lnapl to be trapped below the water table and reach a new equilibrium resulting in a more complex contaminant transport process fetter et al 2017 sharma and mohamed 2003 the lnapl trapped in the saturated zone is more difficult to remediate than the contaminant pools accumulated above the water therefore understanding the migration of the entrapped lnapls under dynamic groundwater conditions is of great significance to evaluate contamination source zones and design remediation schemes qi et al 2020b ramli 2014 numerous experimental and simulation researches were conducted to investigate the effect of groundwater fluctuation on the migration characteristics of the lnapl plume yimsiri et al 2018 used the simplified image analysis method siam to explore the redistribution characteristics under a fluctuation sequence of falling first and then rising they found that the groundwater fluctuation increased the vertical diffusion of pollution sources and enhanced the mass transfer effect of the interface based on the same fluctuation sequence flores et al 2011 and azimi et al 2020 investigated the influences of grain sizes and lnapl viscosities on the redistribution of lnapl plume they systematically analyzed the variation of lnapl saturation during the fluctuation based on the fluctuation sequence of rising first and then falling alazaiza et al 2020a qi et al 2020a and gupta et al 2019 quantified the variation of lnapl saturation under the effects of multiple factors including groundwater fluctuation parameters fluctuation amplitude and fluctuation velocity soil types coarse sand medium sand and silt and contaminant types similar analyses can be seen in other investigations and several transport models have been established based on laboratory column migration experiments fiori et al 2015 lu et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 zhou et al 2014 tested the feasibility of napl simulator under water table fluctuations and found that the simulation results were accurate during the first cycle of water table fluctuation but the accuracy decreased rapidly in the second one these studies enhance our understanding of the redistribution characteristics of the lnapl under dynamic water tables cavelan et al 2022 gatsios et al 2018 onaa et al 2021 however the studies above were based on a fixed fluctuation sequence to investigate the effect of other factors which could not obtain the effect of different fluctuation sequences on the redistribution of entrapped lnapl since the fluctuation sequences may lead to different redistribution characteristics and source locations it would undoubtedly help us to develop a remediation strategy if we could deeply understand the transport and fate of the lnapl under different fluctuation sequences the heterogeneity of aquifers leads to a complex contaminant transport problem therefore the modeling of this process is usually based on continuous media wiącek and molenda 2016 wildenschild and sheppard 2013 determining the representative elementary volume rev the key to measuring and quantifying effective parameters of complex heterogeneous media is a prerequisite for accurately modeling the lnapl transport process al raoush and papadopoulos 2010 brown et al 2000 the conceptual model of porosity n variation with measuring scale l for an idealized system is shown in fig 1 a costanza robinson et al 2011 the fluctuation in porosity due to micro heterogeneity region i gradually becomes smooth rev plateau as the incremental measurement scale however it continues to fluctuate as the measurement scale increases due to macro heterogeneity region iii the minimum rev defined as the left hand side boundary of region ii is difficult to delineate in reality zhang et al 2000 recent studies were mainly focused on the effect of porous media parameters such as grain diameter manda and gross 2006 singh 2017 and heterogeneity wu et al 2017a wu et al 2017b on rev but lost sight of the influence of groundwater parameters wu et al 2020b reported that rev decreases with an increasing solute concentration indicating that groundwater parameters also significantly affect rev due to seasonal variations barometric effects precipitation groundwater withdrawal ocean tides and other transient hydrogeological conditions groundwater fluctuations occur frequently in nature shen et al 2012 shoushtari et al 2016 however the association between groundwater fluctuations and rev has not been investigated previously undoubtedly conducting the rev assessment of the lnapl plume under dynamic water tables can effectively complement these studies in this study the effect of different fluctuation sequences on the redistribution characteristics of entrapped lnapl and the effect of groundwater fluctuation parameters water table height fluctuation intensity and fluctuation sequence on rev were systematically investigated which has not been reported in previous studies the siam and spatial moments were used to quantify lnapl saturation and the changes in lnapl morphological characteristics while the rev of the lnapl plume was determined through the criterion χi this study deepens the knowledge of the effect of water table fluctuations on the redistribution characteristics and provides new insights into rev variations under dynamic water table conditions it also offers a theoretical basis and reference that effectively determines the contaminant plume migration trends and thus enhances the remediation efficiency in soil and groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 material characteristics for better visualization alginate beads were used as porous material alginate beads were formed by dispensing a 2 sodium alginate solution dropwise into 1 calcium chloride the alginate beads do not swell in neutral and acidic solutions but swell in alkaline solutions determined by their ph sensitivity agüero et al 2017 they are non toxic and biodegradable and have a hydrophilic surface with a contact angle of 34 the median grain size and the porosity of the beads were 0 78 mm and 0 362 respectively for the experiments deionized di water was used as a wetting liquid while an industrial white oil was used to represent the lnapl the density of white oil is 0 825 g cm3 and its kinematic viscosity is 7 9 mm2 s at 25 additional properties of white oil can be found in these studies tchameni et al 2018 wen et al 2011 to differentiate it by color and improve visualization the white oil was dyed with oil red o at the concentration of 0 05 g l no noticeable change was observed in the physical properties of white oil after being dyed moreover the dye did not migrate between the water and oil and was not absorbed by alginate beads the same dye and concentration can be found in these studies bob et al 2008 zhang et al 2021 2 2 experimental setup four lnapl migration experiments were conducted in a 2d flow chamber to investigate the effect of groundwater table fluctuations on entrapped lnapl below the water table a schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 b the experimental device comprises the following four parts the lnapl injection part the water table control part the 2d flow chamber and the siam system the 2d flow chamber was fabricated by 1 cm thick polymethyl methacrylate plates the glass plates with set bolts were used to secure the 2d flow chamber and produced a watertight seal by compressing the sealing gasket between the joints of the glass plates the 2d flow chamber was divided into a porous media chamber and a water tank the porous media chamber was used to fill the porous media material while the water tank was connected with a peristaltic pump to control the water table height a transparent ruler was fixed on the front panel of the water tank to evaluate the height of the water table the nominal internal dimensions of the porous media chamber were 50 cm length 50 cm height 5 cm thickness the lnapl injection point was located at the center of the horizontal axis of the porous media chamber and 10 cm away from the bottom plate to avoid backflow the lnapl was injected by a syringe pump the porous media chamber was connected to the water tank through some small holes with a diameter of 2 mm these small holes were evenly distributed on the bottom plate of the porous media chamber before each experiment the 2d flow chamber was thoroughly cleaned with deionized water and dried with paper towels the experimental arrangements are illustrated in table 1 the time dependent water table adjustments of the experiments are presented in fig 1 c the initial water table level is higher than the lnapl injection point to ensure the entrapment phenomena occur below the water table two different drainage intensities were used in exp i and exp ii to investigate the effect of groundwater fluctuation intensity on migration behaviors of entrapped lnapl the water table fluctuation intensity adopted in this experiment 20 mm h of moderate rain and 40 mm h of heavy rain referred to the actual rainfall situation alazaiza et al 2021 exp i and exp iv were used to compare the influence of initial water table height while exp iii and exp iv were used to compare the influence of water table fluctuation sequences due to accuracy and cost effectiveness siam was used to quantify the lnapl saturation in the 2d flow chamber alazaiza et al 2020b flores et al 2011 the siam system was mainly composed of a sony alpha 6400l digital camera and a led floodlight godox led1000d ii the whole experimental system was placed in a dark room and the led floodlight was fixed as the sole lighting source the led floodlight consisted of 1024 lamp beads with a maximum power of 70 w and a integrated diffuser was installed on it to achieve a uniform light intensity the digital camera with 24 2 effective megapixels and an 8 bit dynamic range was placed in a fixed position of 1 5 m from the flow chamber during the experiments images were acquired through imaging edge desktop control software for sony cameras installed on the computer connected to the camera the camera has been focused on the lnapl injection point in all images to ensure that the image boundaries were perfectly coincident the temperature of the experimental environment was maintained at 25 1 2 3 experimental procedures in each experiment the porous media chamber was wet packed to avoid the formation of entrapped air ye et al 2009 zheng et al 2015 the bottom of the porous media chamber was packed with alginate beads in 1 cm median grain sizes to prevent the beads from releasing into the water tank the porous media chamber was filled by stepwise packing of 2 3 cm alginate beads and the water table remained 2 cm higher than the height of the beads during the packing process the front and back plates of the porous media chamber were tapped with a rubber mallet after each packing to achieve a compact pack after the beads packing the water table was adjusted by the peristaltic pump until deionized water di ponding on the surface of the porous medium afterward the flow chamber was left to rest for 24 h to ensure that the beads were thoroughly saturated with water after fully saturated condition the water table height in the water tank was maintained at the initial water level table 1 for 12 h through the peristaltic pump the experiments involved five steps as described below for the case with a fluctuation sequence of falling first and then rising a lnapl injection stage 10 ml dyed oil was injected into the porous media at a constant rate of 1 ml min for 10 min from the injection point afterward the 2d flow chamber was left for 0 5 h for stabilization b first drainage the water table in the water tank was lowered by 5 cm for exp i and exp iv by the peristaltic pump while it lowered by 10 cm for exp ii the entire process of the water level fall was completed in five stages fig 1 c and the flow chamber was stabilized for 0 5 h after each fall c first imbibition the water table in the water tank was raised to the initial height this process was also completed in five stages and the flow chamber was stabilized for 0 5 h after each raise d second drainage step b was repeated in this step e second imbibition step c was repeated in this step for the case with a fluctuation sequence of rising first and then falling just exchange step b and step c above 2 4 image analysis prior to image analysis an image correction operation a method proposed by bob et al bob et al 2008 for removing the effects of light intensity transients was performed on the acquired images the reference image was captured when the flow chamber was fully saturated with water and two small regions 3 cm 3 cm in the reference image were defined as correction zones alazaiza et al 2021 alazaiza et al 2017 the principle of determining correction zones was to ensure that these regions were fully saturated with water for all images therefore the difference in light intensity for correction zones of different images was caused by changes in source light intensity the correction coefficients were defined as the ratio of the average light intensity in correction zones of the reference image to that of the images to be corrected the corrected image was obtained by multiplying the light intensity of the image to be corrected with the corresponding correction coefficient for each image two consecutive frames were collected and the average light intensities of these two images were used for calculations alazaiza et al 2017 subsequently the quantitative analysis of lnapl saturation was carried out based on these corrected images 2 4 1 siam flores et al 2011 proposed the siam to simplify the complex calibration process of the multispectral image analysis method miam this method increases the mathematical complexity of the computational analysis while improving the accuracy the siam was based on the beer lambert law of transmittance and assumed a linear relationship between average optical density and lnapl saturation the average optical density was determined from the following equation flores et al 2011 1 d 1 n j 1 n d j 1 n j 1 n log 10 i j r i j o where d is the average optical density n is the number of pixels in the study area dj is the optical density of the individual pixels ir j and io j denote the light intensity of the reflected light by individual pixel value and an ideal white surface respectively only water and lnapl were involved in the experimental system the lnapl saturation was obtained by comparing the average optical density with two calibration images dw do for the water saturated stage and the lnapl saturated stage respectively the correlation equation between average optical density and lnapl saturation is shown in eq 2 2 d a b d a b w d a b o d a b w s o a b where d a b is the average optical density of the pixel a b dw a b and do a b are the average optical density of the pixel a b for water saturated beads and lnapl saturated beads respectively so a b is the lnapl saturation of the pixel a b the detailed quantification process of lnapl saturation is shown in fig 2 a with a unique equation at each pixel a flowchart of the main procedures performed by siam is shown in fig 2 b the volume of the lnapl injected was calculated pixel by pixel from the saturation in the flow chamber 3 v b 1 n 2 a 1 n 1 s o a b a t θ where n 1 and n 2 are the numbers of pixel points in the studied domain along the horizontal and vertical direction respectively a is the area of each pixel t is the thickness of the flow chamber θ is the porosity of the porous media the correlation coefficient and the overall deviation were calculated to measure the accuracy of image analysis in lnapl saturation calculation the total volume of lnapl in the flow chamber at a certain time vcal was calculated by eq 3 during the experiment the actual injected volume of lnapl vinj was calculated as follow 4 v inj v in j t inj where vinj is the injection velocity of lnapl which is fixed to 1 ml min in this study tinj is the injection time min during the lnapl injection stage vinj gradually increases with incremental injection time while it remains constant at 10 ml during the water fluctuation stage to assess the overall deviation of the calculated lnapl volumes from actual volumes injected the root mean squared error rmse was calculated alazaiza et al 2020a 4 rmse 1 n v cal v inj 2 where n is the number of lnapl injection events and water table fluctuation events the actual injected volume of lnapl is in good agreement with the volume calculated by siam as shown in fig 1 d to assess the correlation between the two volumes pearson s correlation coefficient was calculated 5 ρ i n j c a l cov inj c a l σ inj σ c a l where ρinj cal is the population correlation coefficient cov inj cal is the covariance of vinj and vcal σinj and σcal are the standard deviations of vinj and vcal respectively in all experiments the correlation coefficient between the actual volume and the calculated volume exceeds 0 99 indicating a strong correlation between the two values the rmse for all experiments was relatively small ranging from 0 32 ml to 0 43 ml with a maximum error of 4 3 2 4 2 spatial moments and rev quantification spatial moments are commonly used to characterize contaminant plume distribution and spatial behavior the definition of the spatial moment mij is natarajan and kumar 2017 6 m ij x 0 x 1 z 0 z 1 θ s o x z t x i z j d x d z where i and j are the moment orders so x z t is lnapl saturation at time t x 0 and x 1 are the minimum and maximum along the x direction z 0 and z 1 are the minimum and maximum along the z direction respectively the first order moments and the second order moments are defined as sudicky 1986 wu et al 2019 7 x c m 10 m 00 8 z c m 01 m 00 9 σ xx m 20 m 00 x c 2 10 σ zz m 02 m 00 z c 2 where xc and zc are the x coordinate and z coordinate of the mass center of the contaminant plume respectively σxx and σzz are the distribution range around the mass center along x axis and z axis m 00 is the total volume of lnapl m 10 and m 01 are the weighted volumes of lnapl along the x direction and the z direction respectively m 20 and m 02 are the inertia rotational with the x axis and z axis as the rotation axis respectively as shown in fig 1 a a traditional point centered cube geometry is used to identify the rev costanza robinson et al 2011 the window length scale l increases symmetrically to the surroundings along with the initial pixel point while the rev of the lnapl plume is identified through the criterion χi wu et al 2020a 11 χ i δ i 1 δ i 1 δ i δ l 12 δ i φ l i max φ l i min φ l i where i is the window increment number δi is the dimensionless range of the variable φ on the window length scale li δl is the increment of the window geometry which is fixed to 2 pixels in this study φ li max and φ li min are the maximum and minimum values on the window length scale li respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 migration characteristics as described above the saturation of lnapl in the flow chamber is quantified by the siam the 10 cm 10 cm area centered on the injection point assigned as the area of interest aoi is intercepted for quantitative analysis after lnapl injection the water table in the water tank fluctuates periodically from 40 min to 640 min as shown in fig 1 c the water table level changes monotonically during the first 150 min of the periodic fluctuation stage the effects of monotonic fluctuation and periodic fluctuation on the redistribution characteristics of the lnapl plume are systematically analyzed in this section 3 1 1 the effect of monotonic fluctuation fig 3 presents the morphological change of the lnapl plume in the flow chamber under the monotonic fluctuated groundwater the x and z denote the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the aoi while hw is the water table height the entrapped shape of lnapl is an approximate drop shape in all experiments which is narrower and longer under the high initial water table exp i and exp ii a high water table means greater pore water pressure preventing the lateral extension of lnapl consistent results can be found in the work of rühle et al 2015 in this paper an extended study of the redistribution characteristics of the plume under periodic fluctuation was carried out which can be seen in section 3 1 2 the initial entrapped shape of lnapl has an essential effect on the redistribution shape of the lnapl plume under water table fluctuation from fig 3 it can be seen that the water table fluctuation in the flow chamber leads to the redistribution of the pollution plume the pollution plume varies significantly in the vertical direction and is relatively small in the lateral direction the sharper part of the pollution plume observed in experiment iii is caused by the injection needle in the center of the flow chamber however this phenomenon will not affect the redistribution of the pollution plume in the flow chamber the morphology of the lnapl plume is strongly correlated with the pore water pressure a rising water table promotes the vertical extension of the lnapl plume and inhibits its lateral extension while a falling water table has an opposite effect on the morphology of the lnapl plume since the fluctuation intensity in exp ii is greater than that in exp i the redistribution of the lnapl plume is more pronounced in exp ii than that in exp i a higher amplitude of groundwater variations can increase the mobility of the entrapped lnapl the distribution characteristics of the lnapl plume under the monotonic fluctuated groundwater were evaluated by moment analysis and associated analysis results are displayed in fig 4 the mass center of lnapl plume in the x direction xc of exp i and exp ii are in good agreement before water table fluctuation while xc of exp iii and exp iv have a relatively large difference fig 4 a the difference is caused by the uniformity indexes of the beads packed in the flow chamber the high initial water table in exp i and exp ii results in higher pore water pressure which limits the lateral extension of the pollution plume a similar phenomenon the first order moment of the contamination plume along the horizontal axis under high solute concentration conditions is lower than that under low solute concentration conditions was achieved by wu et al 2020b moreover the fluctuation sequence has a significant effect on the mass center of the lnapl plume in the z direction zc fig 4 b from the change rate of dz the highest rising distance of the pollution plume a higher water table and fluctuation intensity can enhance the vertical transport velocity of the lnapl plume fig 4 h the value of ddz dt is closely related to the water table fluctuation sequence the second order moment of lnapl plume along the z direction σzz is much larger than that along the x direction σxx in all experiments fig 4 c and d indicating the morphological changes of lnapl in the flow chamber are dominated by vertical extension the lateral distribution range of the lnapl plume increases with the falling water table while the vertical distribution range decreases with the falling water table however an opposite tendency occurs under a rising water table this phenomenon is more pronounced in the change rate of the second order moment fig 4 e and f the main reason for this phenomenon is that the reduction of pore water pressure promotes the lateral migration of the pollution plume and thus has a certain inhibitory effect on vertical migration the change rate of the second order moment represents the variation in the lateral and vertical distribution range of the lnapl plume under water table fluctuations which is shown in fig 4 e and f comparing exp i and exp iv it can be seen that a high initial water table can promote the influence of water table fluctuations on the lateral and vertical distribution range of the pollution plume the results of exp i and exp ii exhibit that a higher fluctuation intensity can also increase the variation degree in the distribution range of the lnapl plume fig 4 g shows the plume area as a function of the infiltration time under the monotonic fluctuated water table both the drainage stage falling water table in exp i exp ii and exp iv and the imbibition stage rising water table in exp iii result in a slight reduction in the lnapl plume area compared with the fluctuation sequence and the initial water table height the fluctuation intensity significantly influences the plume area these results show that a higher initial water table will promote the vertical extension of the pollution plume and inhibit the lateral extension of the pollution resulting in a larger pollution plume area 3 1 2 the effect of periodic fluctuation secondary water table fluctuation experiments were carried out to explore the effect of the periodic fluctuated water table on the redistribution characteristics of entrapped lnapl the time dependent water table adjustments of the four experiments are shown in fig 1 c the morphological changes of the lnapl plume under the periodic fluctuation are shown in fig 5 each experiment was divided into the following five stages initial state at 40 min first fluctuation stage at 190 min first restoration stage at 340 min second fluctuation stage at 490 min and second restoration stage at 640 min from fig 5 slight differences can be found in the morphology of the redistribution plume at different fluctuation periods the shape of the pollution plume in the saturated porous media is mainly determined by the initial residual pollution plume however the fluctuation period changes the equilibrium position of the plume the redistribution characteristics of the pollution plume under the periodic fluctuation were quantitatively analyzed by the spatial moment method fig 6 shows the xc zc σxx σzz ap plume area dz as a function of the tflu the period of water table fluctuation from fig 6 a the xc after the secondary water table fluctuation is similar to that at the initial state in exp i and exp ii a fluctuation sequence of falling first and then rising promotes the lateral migration of the pollution plume while an opposite fluctuation sequence inhibits its lateral migration comparing the zc of the four experiments under periodic fluctuations it can be found that the vertical migration of the pollution plume is significantly higher at high initial water tables than that at low initial water tables under the periodic fluctuated water tables a high initial water table inhibits the lateral migration of the pollution plume and it also promotes its vertical migration compared with the case of a high initial water table the lateral migration range σxx under a low initial water table is greatly affected by the periodic fluctuation a larger fluctuation intensity causes a larger change in the migration range under the periodic fluctuated water tables a similar phenomenon can also be found in the variation of the vertical migration range σzz fig 6 d it can be concluded that a lower initial water table and a larger fluctuation intensity can enhance the migration ability of pollution plumes the main reason is that the low initial water table makes the pollution plume reach an equilibrium state under lower pore water pressure compared with the high initial water table the equilibrium state of the pollution plume is easier to break when the water table changes moreover it can be found that the water table fluctuation sequence has a significant effect on the migration range of the pollution plume under the periodic fluctuated water tables the fluctuation sequence of falling first and then rising expands the lateral migration range of the pollution plume while it diminishes its vertical migration range however an opposite regulation can be found in the case with the fluctuation sequence of rising first and then falling compared with the plume area ap under the initial stage the ap shows a downward trend at the secondary fluctuation for the case with a high initial water table however it shows an upward trend in the case with a low initial water table among the four experiments exp ii has the most significant change in the plume area under the periodic fluctuated water tables combined with σxx σzz and fig 5 it can be concluded that a larger fluctuation intensity reduces the vertical migration range of the pollution plume and increases the local saturation the dz in fig 6 f reflects the upward migration degree of the pollution plume which has a similar trend to zc under the periodic fluctuated water tables in the four experiments the value of dz decreases after secondary water table fluctuation except for exp iii this result shows that the redistribution of residual pollutants in the water saturated porous matrix under a periodic fluctuated water table is mainly determined by the fluctuation sequence the fluctuation sequence of falling first and then rising will cause the pollution plume to move downward while the opposite fluctuation sequence will cause the pollution plume to move upward these results can be used to predict the variation in the migration range and trend of the trapped contaminant plume under dynamic water tables in practical engineering projects therefore they can provide a reference for emergency decision formulation 3 2 revs estimation the aoi is discretized into multiple grids with 1 cm sides 100 grids in total as shown in fig 5 six observation grids numbered 1 6 are selected at the same position in each experiment to analyze the rev changes a traditional point centered window geometry is used to estimate the changes of system variables as the increasing window size fig 1 a based on the lnapl saturation obtained by image analysis the relationship between the saturation and the window length scale l of the six observation grids are shown in fig 7 a the window length scale l is defined as the edge length of the window geometry the saturation of all observation grids in exp i and exp ii shows a decreasing trend as the window size increases some grids in exp iii and exp iv exhibit an increasing trend indicating the diversity of saturation changes under low initial water tables when the window length scale is small erratic variation in so is observed for incremental growth in window size however the curve fluctuations gradually level off with a further increase in the window scale consistent with the conceptual schematic in fig 1 a from the saturation curves we can determine the regions with smoothed fluctuations but we cannot identify the starting point of the rev plateau therefore the minimum rev is quantified by the criterion so χi as shown in fig 7 b each curve in fig 7 b has a point representing the minimum so rev the so rev sizes of i 1 i 6 ii 1 ii 6 iii 1 iii 6 and iv 1 iv 6 range 1 67 mm 6 11 mm 3 13 mm 7 19 mm 3 82 mm 9 64 mm and 2 87 mm 9 54 mm respectively fig 7 b the range of rev distribution and rev values under a low water table exp iii and exp iv are larger than those under a high water table exp i and exp ii erratic variation in so χi can be observed from fig 7 b the peak positions of the six observation grids in exp i and exp ii are similar while the double peak phenomenon is observed in exp iii and exp iv it can be concluded that a lower water table leads to an uneven distribution of so rev which is consistent with the saturation curve fig 8 shows the minimum so rev of six selected grids as a function of water table fluctuation periods the line graph represents the change in the mean value of so rev the rev in each observation grid varies continuously with the water table fluctuation periods the rev distribution ranges of i 1 i 6 ii 1 ii 6 and iv 1 iv 6 show an expanding trend after two fluctuation periods while the range of iii 1 iii 6 shows a shrinking trend it can be concluded that the fluctuation sequence of falling first and then rising will increase the difference of rev at different locations of the lnapl plume while the opposite water table fluctuation sequence can reduce the difference for the average minimum so rev of the selected observation grids the exp i and exp ii under the high water table show a increasing trend after the secondary fluctuation while the exp iii and exp iv under the low water table presents a decreasing trend the initial average rev under the high water table is lower than that under the low water table but this phenomenon is reversed after the secondary fluctuation the initial water table height has a decisive influence on the change of the rev under dynamic groundwater conditions however the fluctuation intensity of the water table has no apparent influence on the average value of so rev therefore it is necessary to further analyze the influence of water table height the rev of all observation grids at different water tables of the four experiments is statistically analyzed and the frequency distribution histogram is shown in fig 9 the rev sizes are divided into 10 groups of 0 mm 10 mm and associated relative and cumulative frequency curves are fitted using theoretical gaussian distributions which is the most widely used frequency distribution of variables for natural aquifers montgomery et al 1987 the frequency distribution characteristics of rev under different water tables are similar and the minimum so rev frequency distribution becomes closer to a regular gaussian distribution with the increasing water table height at the low water table a valley value of frequency appears at 6 mm 8 mm indicating less rev size distribution in this range as the water table increases the rev size distribution becomes more uniform and a peak value of frequency appears at 3 mm 4 mm compared with the cumulative curve in fig 9 a and b the shape of cumulative frequency becomes smoother in fig 9 c the minimum so rev presents a statistically negative linear correlation with water table height fig 9 d table 2 demonstrates the confidence intervals of so rev for the four experiments at a significance level of 0 05 after two periods of water table fluctuations the width of the confidence interval in exp iii was shortened by 0 91 mm while it increased by 0 48 mm 1 mm and 0 32 mm in exp i exp ii and exp iv respectively this phenomenon indicates that the fluctuation sequences has an essential effect on the variation of the rev confidence interval under dynamic water tables which is consistent with the rev distribution in fig 7 comparing the changes of confidence intervals in exp i and exp ii it can be concluded that the increment of width after water table fluctuation in exp ii is twice as large as that in exp i indicating that the greater the fluctuation intensity the larger the increment for the confidence interval under different water table heights both the upper limits and widths decrease as the water table increases the influence of the water table fluctuation sequence on rev changes is much more significant than that of the fluctuation intensity and water table height previous studies mainly focused on the effect of median grain diameter and heterogeneity on rev costanza robinson et al 2011 wu et al 2017a wu et al 2020 investigated the effect of solute concentration on rev which is the only study to our knowledge that considers groundwater parameters in rev studies the change rate in the rev confidence interval caused by heterogeneity and solution concentration in wu s study was 32 and 20 respectively the results of this study show that the rev confidence interval of exp ii has increased by 51 after two periods of water table fluctuations indicating the significant effect of groundwater parameters on rev although differences in experimental conditions prevents quantitative comparisons of rev values the change rate of the confidence interval is a normalized result that can be used for qualitative analysis it can be concluded that the influence of groundwater parameters on rev can even exceed the effect of geological conditions therefore groundwater parameters such as ph ion type and groundwater velocity need to be considered in the analysis of rev in further studies this study was conducted in a two dimensional flow chamber which is a simplification of the actual aquifer therefore the quantitative analysis results in this study cannot be directly applied to an aquifer however laboratory scale experiments are the most widely used method in aquifer contaminant transport studies due to limitations such as the high cost and measurement difficulties of field scale tests because of the controlled operating conditions laboratory scale experiments are often used to explain phenomena that cannot be explained by field scale tests within the aquifer joun et al 2016 therefore the qualitative conclusions about the effects of fluctuation sequence and initial water table height on the migration behavior of the contaminant plume in this study can be directly used to guide the aquifer remediation conducting field scale contaminant transport simulations in porous media is usually based on the continuum media assumption for which the determination of rev is a prerequisite therefore the rev data obtained in this study plays an essential role in the upscaling processes from laboratory scale to field scale 4 conclusions lnapl migration experiments based on a 2d flow chamber have been conducted to study the morphological changes and revs variation of the entrapped lnapl under dynamic groundwater conditions influence factors including initial water table height water table fluctuation intensity and water table fluctuation sequence are considered in this study results indicate that a high initial water table inhibits the lateral migration of the pollution plume and it also promotes its vertical migration under the periodic fluctuated water tables the fluctuation sequence of falling first and then rising expands the lateral migration range of the pollution plume while it diminishes its vertical migration range the redistribution location of the entrapped lnapl is mainly determined by the fluctuation sequence from rev estimation the range of rev distribution and rev values under the low water table are more extensive than those under a higher water table the rev presents a statistically negative linear correlation with water table height the fluctuation sequence of falling first and then rising leads to a wider confidence interval of rev while the opposite water table fluctuation sequence results in a narrower confidence interval furthermore a higher water table leads to a narrower rev confidence interval these results are essential to understand the effect of transient hydrological conditions on the migration behaviors and revs of the lnapl trapped below the water table which can provide a reference for emergency decision

3317,understanding migration characteristics and the representative elementary volume rev variation of the entrapped light non aqueous phase fluids lnapl under dynamic groundwater conditions is significant in quantifying the effective parameters and formulating pollution treatment strategies this paper investigates the effect of the initial water table height the fluctuation intensity and the fluctuation sequence on redistribution characteristics and revs of lnapl in a two dimensional 2d flow chamber the migration behaviors of pollution plumes and associated revs were quantified by spatial moments and the criterion χi the results indicated that the redistribution location of residual pollutants was mainly determined by the fluctuation sequence the rev gradually decreases as the rising water table while the minimum so rev frequency distribution becomes closer to a regular gaussian distribution these results shed light upon the effect of dynamic water tables on the morphology features and revs of lnapl which can offer valuable guidance for designing remediation schemes keywords entrapped lnap light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl representative elementary volume rev redistribution characteristics water table fluctuation 1 introduction organic contaminants in non aqueous phase liquid napl form are among the main causes of groundwater and soil contamination alazaiza et al 2020a maire et al 2018 as a consequence of their low aqueous solubility these contaminants are difficult to remove entirely and therefore commonly constitute long term sources of contamination in the groundwater environment which has become a widespread and challenging problem jiang et al 2018 ogunlaja et al 2019 yang et al 2020 napls with densities less than water are defined as light non aqueous phase fluids lnapl while napls with densities greater than water are defined as dense non aqueous phase fluids dnapl when lnapl is spilled into the groundwater system it can be trapped as residual ganglia and globules in the vadose zone because of capillary forces if a sufficient quantity is present it will migrate downward through the vadose zone to the top of the saturated zone and accumulate as contaminant pools mateas et al 2017 shi et al 2018 groundwater fluctuations will cause lnapl to be trapped below the water table and reach a new equilibrium resulting in a more complex contaminant transport process fetter et al 2017 sharma and mohamed 2003 the lnapl trapped in the saturated zone is more difficult to remediate than the contaminant pools accumulated above the water therefore understanding the migration of the entrapped lnapls under dynamic groundwater conditions is of great significance to evaluate contamination source zones and design remediation schemes qi et al 2020b ramli 2014 numerous experimental and simulation researches were conducted to investigate the effect of groundwater fluctuation on the migration characteristics of the lnapl plume yimsiri et al 2018 used the simplified image analysis method siam to explore the redistribution characteristics under a fluctuation sequence of falling first and then rising they found that the groundwater fluctuation increased the vertical diffusion of pollution sources and enhanced the mass transfer effect of the interface based on the same fluctuation sequence flores et al 2011 and azimi et al 2020 investigated the influences of grain sizes and lnapl viscosities on the redistribution of lnapl plume they systematically analyzed the variation of lnapl saturation during the fluctuation based on the fluctuation sequence of rising first and then falling alazaiza et al 2020a qi et al 2020a and gupta et al 2019 quantified the variation of lnapl saturation under the effects of multiple factors including groundwater fluctuation parameters fluctuation amplitude and fluctuation velocity soil types coarse sand medium sand and silt and contaminant types similar analyses can be seen in other investigations and several transport models have been established based on laboratory column migration experiments fiori et al 2015 lu et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 zhou et al 2014 tested the feasibility of napl simulator under water table fluctuations and found that the simulation results were accurate during the first cycle of water table fluctuation but the accuracy decreased rapidly in the second one these studies enhance our understanding of the redistribution characteristics of the lnapl under dynamic water tables cavelan et al 2022 gatsios et al 2018 onaa et al 2021 however the studies above were based on a fixed fluctuation sequence to investigate the effect of other factors which could not obtain the effect of different fluctuation sequences on the redistribution of entrapped lnapl since the fluctuation sequences may lead to different redistribution characteristics and source locations it would undoubtedly help us to develop a remediation strategy if we could deeply understand the transport and fate of the lnapl under different fluctuation sequences the heterogeneity of aquifers leads to a complex contaminant transport problem therefore the modeling of this process is usually based on continuous media wiącek and molenda 2016 wildenschild and sheppard 2013 determining the representative elementary volume rev the key to measuring and quantifying effective parameters of complex heterogeneous media is a prerequisite for accurately modeling the lnapl transport process al raoush and papadopoulos 2010 brown et al 2000 the conceptual model of porosity n variation with measuring scale l for an idealized system is shown in fig 1 a costanza robinson et al 2011 the fluctuation in porosity due to micro heterogeneity region i gradually becomes smooth rev plateau as the incremental measurement scale however it continues to fluctuate as the measurement scale increases due to macro heterogeneity region iii the minimum rev defined as the left hand side boundary of region ii is difficult to delineate in reality zhang et al 2000 recent studies were mainly focused on the effect of porous media parameters such as grain diameter manda and gross 2006 singh 2017 and heterogeneity wu et al 2017a wu et al 2017b on rev but lost sight of the influence of groundwater parameters wu et al 2020b reported that rev decreases with an increasing solute concentration indicating that groundwater parameters also significantly affect rev due to seasonal variations barometric effects precipitation groundwater withdrawal ocean tides and other transient hydrogeological conditions groundwater fluctuations occur frequently in nature shen et al 2012 shoushtari et al 2016 however the association between groundwater fluctuations and rev has not been investigated previously undoubtedly conducting the rev assessment of the lnapl plume under dynamic water tables can effectively complement these studies in this study the effect of different fluctuation sequences on the redistribution characteristics of entrapped lnapl and the effect of groundwater fluctuation parameters water table height fluctuation intensity and fluctuation sequence on rev were systematically investigated which has not been reported in previous studies the siam and spatial moments were used to quantify lnapl saturation and the changes in lnapl morphological characteristics while the rev of the lnapl plume was determined through the criterion χi this study deepens the knowledge of the effect of water table fluctuations on the redistribution characteristics and provides new insights into rev variations under dynamic water table conditions it also offers a theoretical basis and reference that effectively determines the contaminant plume migration trends and thus enhances the remediation efficiency in soil and groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 material characteristics for better visualization alginate beads were used as porous material alginate beads were formed by dispensing a 2 sodium alginate solution dropwise into 1 calcium chloride the alginate beads do not swell in neutral and acidic solutions but swell in alkaline solutions determined by their ph sensitivity agüero et al 2017 they are non toxic and biodegradable and have a hydrophilic surface with a contact angle of 34 the median grain size and the porosity of the beads were 0 78 mm and 0 362 respectively for the experiments deionized di water was used as a wetting liquid while an industrial white oil was used to represent the lnapl the density of white oil is 0 825 g cm3 and its kinematic viscosity is 7 9 mm2 s at 25 additional properties of white oil can be found in these studies tchameni et al 2018 wen et al 2011 to differentiate it by color and improve visualization the white oil was dyed with oil red o at the concentration of 0 05 g l no noticeable change was observed in the physical properties of white oil after being dyed moreover the dye did not migrate between the water and oil and was not absorbed by alginate beads the same dye and concentration can be found in these studies bob et al 2008 zhang et al 2021 2 2 experimental setup four lnapl migration experiments were conducted in a 2d flow chamber to investigate the effect of groundwater table fluctuations on entrapped lnapl below the water table a schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 b the experimental device comprises the following four parts the lnapl injection part the water table control part the 2d flow chamber and the siam system the 2d flow chamber was fabricated by 1 cm thick polymethyl methacrylate plates the glass plates with set bolts were used to secure the 2d flow chamber and produced a watertight seal by compressing the sealing gasket between the joints of the glass plates the 2d flow chamber was divided into a porous media chamber and a water tank the porous media chamber was used to fill the porous media material while the water tank was connected with a peristaltic pump to control the water table height a transparent ruler was fixed on the front panel of the water tank to evaluate the height of the water table the nominal internal dimensions of the porous media chamber were 50 cm length 50 cm height 5 cm thickness the lnapl injection point was located at the center of the horizontal axis of the porous media chamber and 10 cm away from the bottom plate to avoid backflow the lnapl was injected by a syringe pump the porous media chamber was connected to the water tank through some small holes with a diameter of 2 mm these small holes were evenly distributed on the bottom plate of the porous media chamber before each experiment the 2d flow chamber was thoroughly cleaned with deionized water and dried with paper towels the experimental arrangements are illustrated in table 1 the time dependent water table adjustments of the experiments are presented in fig 1 c the initial water table level is higher than the lnapl injection point to ensure the entrapment phenomena occur below the water table two different drainage intensities were used in exp i and exp ii to investigate the effect of groundwater fluctuation intensity on migration behaviors of entrapped lnapl the water table fluctuation intensity adopted in this experiment 20 mm h of moderate rain and 40 mm h of heavy rain referred to the actual rainfall situation alazaiza et al 2021 exp i and exp iv were used to compare the influence of initial water table height while exp iii and exp iv were used to compare the influence of water table fluctuation sequences due to accuracy and cost effectiveness siam was used to quantify the lnapl saturation in the 2d flow chamber alazaiza et al 2020b flores et al 2011 the siam system was mainly composed of a sony alpha 6400l digital camera and a led floodlight godox led1000d ii the whole experimental system was placed in a dark room and the led floodlight was fixed as the sole lighting source the led floodlight consisted of 1024 lamp beads with a maximum power of 70 w and a integrated diffuser was installed on it to achieve a uniform light intensity the digital camera with 24 2 effective megapixels and an 8 bit dynamic range was placed in a fixed position of 1 5 m from the flow chamber during the experiments images were acquired through imaging edge desktop control software for sony cameras installed on the computer connected to the camera the camera has been focused on the lnapl injection point in all images to ensure that the image boundaries were perfectly coincident the temperature of the experimental environment was maintained at 25 1 2 3 experimental procedures in each experiment the porous media chamber was wet packed to avoid the formation of entrapped air ye et al 2009 zheng et al 2015 the bottom of the porous media chamber was packed with alginate beads in 1 cm median grain sizes to prevent the beads from releasing into the water tank the porous media chamber was filled by stepwise packing of 2 3 cm alginate beads and the water table remained 2 cm higher than the height of the beads during the packing process the front and back plates of the porous media chamber were tapped with a rubber mallet after each packing to achieve a compact pack after the beads packing the water table was adjusted by the peristaltic pump until deionized water di ponding on the surface of the porous medium afterward the flow chamber was left to rest for 24 h to ensure that the beads were thoroughly saturated with water after fully saturated condition the water table height in the water tank was maintained at the initial water level table 1 for 12 h through the peristaltic pump the experiments involved five steps as described below for the case with a fluctuation sequence of falling first and then rising a lnapl injection stage 10 ml dyed oil was injected into the porous media at a constant rate of 1 ml min for 10 min from the injection point afterward the 2d flow chamber was left for 0 5 h for stabilization b first drainage the water table in the water tank was lowered by 5 cm for exp i and exp iv by the peristaltic pump while it lowered by 10 cm for exp ii the entire process of the water level fall was completed in five stages fig 1 c and the flow chamber was stabilized for 0 5 h after each fall c first imbibition the water table in the water tank was raised to the initial height this process was also completed in five stages and the flow chamber was stabilized for 0 5 h after each raise d second drainage step b was repeated in this step e second imbibition step c was repeated in this step for the case with a fluctuation sequence of rising first and then falling just exchange step b and step c above 2 4 image analysis prior to image analysis an image correction operation a method proposed by bob et al bob et al 2008 for removing the effects of light intensity transients was performed on the acquired images the reference image was captured when the flow chamber was fully saturated with water and two small regions 3 cm 3 cm in the reference image were defined as correction zones alazaiza et al 2021 alazaiza et al 2017 the principle of determining correction zones was to ensure that these regions were fully saturated with water for all images therefore the difference in light intensity for correction zones of different images was caused by changes in source light intensity the correction coefficients were defined as the ratio of the average light intensity in correction zones of the reference image to that of the images to be corrected the corrected image was obtained by multiplying the light intensity of the image to be corrected with the corresponding correction coefficient for each image two consecutive frames were collected and the average light intensities of these two images were used for calculations alazaiza et al 2017 subsequently the quantitative analysis of lnapl saturation was carried out based on these corrected images 2 4 1 siam flores et al 2011 proposed the siam to simplify the complex calibration process of the multispectral image analysis method miam this method increases the mathematical complexity of the computational analysis while improving the accuracy the siam was based on the beer lambert law of transmittance and assumed a linear relationship between average optical density and lnapl saturation the average optical density was determined from the following equation flores et al 2011 1 d 1 n j 1 n d j 1 n j 1 n log 10 i j r i j o where d is the average optical density n is the number of pixels in the study area dj is the optical density of the individual pixels ir j and io j denote the light intensity of the reflected light by individual pixel value and an ideal white surface respectively only water and lnapl were involved in the experimental system the lnapl saturation was obtained by comparing the average optical density with two calibration images dw do for the water saturated stage and the lnapl saturated stage respectively the correlation equation between average optical density and lnapl saturation is shown in eq 2 2 d a b d a b w d a b o d a b w s o a b where d a b is the average optical density of the pixel a b dw a b and do a b are the average optical density of the pixel a b for water saturated beads and lnapl saturated beads respectively so a b is the lnapl saturation of the pixel a b the detailed quantification process of lnapl saturation is shown in fig 2 a with a unique equation at each pixel a flowchart of the main procedures performed by siam is shown in fig 2 b the volume of the lnapl injected was calculated pixel by pixel from the saturation in the flow chamber 3 v b 1 n 2 a 1 n 1 s o a b a t θ where n 1 and n 2 are the numbers of pixel points in the studied domain along the horizontal and vertical direction respectively a is the area of each pixel t is the thickness of the flow chamber θ is the porosity of the porous media the correlation coefficient and the overall deviation were calculated to measure the accuracy of image analysis in lnapl saturation calculation the total volume of lnapl in the flow chamber at a certain time vcal was calculated by eq 3 during the experiment the actual injected volume of lnapl vinj was calculated as follow 4 v inj v in j t inj where vinj is the injection velocity of lnapl which is fixed to 1 ml min in this study tinj is the injection time min during the lnapl injection stage vinj gradually increases with incremental injection time while it remains constant at 10 ml during the water fluctuation stage to assess the overall deviation of the calculated lnapl volumes from actual volumes injected the root mean squared error rmse was calculated alazaiza et al 2020a 4 rmse 1 n v cal v inj 2 where n is the number of lnapl injection events and water table fluctuation events the actual injected volume of lnapl is in good agreement with the volume calculated by siam as shown in fig 1 d to assess the correlation between the two volumes pearson s correlation coefficient was calculated 5 ρ i n j c a l cov inj c a l σ inj σ c a l where ρinj cal is the population correlation coefficient cov inj cal is the covariance of vinj and vcal σinj and σcal are the standard deviations of vinj and vcal respectively in all experiments the correlation coefficient between the actual volume and the calculated volume exceeds 0 99 indicating a strong correlation between the two values the rmse for all experiments was relatively small ranging from 0 32 ml to 0 43 ml with a maximum error of 4 3 2 4 2 spatial moments and rev quantification spatial moments are commonly used to characterize contaminant plume distribution and spatial behavior the definition of the spatial moment mij is natarajan and kumar 2017 6 m ij x 0 x 1 z 0 z 1 θ s o x z t x i z j d x d z where i and j are the moment orders so x z t is lnapl saturation at time t x 0 and x 1 are the minimum and maximum along the x direction z 0 and z 1 are the minimum and maximum along the z direction respectively the first order moments and the second order moments are defined as sudicky 1986 wu et al 2019 7 x c m 10 m 00 8 z c m 01 m 00 9 σ xx m 20 m 00 x c 2 10 σ zz m 02 m 00 z c 2 where xc and zc are the x coordinate and z coordinate of the mass center of the contaminant plume respectively σxx and σzz are the distribution range around the mass center along x axis and z axis m 00 is the total volume of lnapl m 10 and m 01 are the weighted volumes of lnapl along the x direction and the z direction respectively m 20 and m 02 are the inertia rotational with the x axis and z axis as the rotation axis respectively as shown in fig 1 a a traditional point centered cube geometry is used to identify the rev costanza robinson et al 2011 the window length scale l increases symmetrically to the surroundings along with the initial pixel point while the rev of the lnapl plume is identified through the criterion χi wu et al 2020a 11 χ i δ i 1 δ i 1 δ i δ l 12 δ i φ l i max φ l i min φ l i where i is the window increment number δi is the dimensionless range of the variable φ on the window length scale li δl is the increment of the window geometry which is fixed to 2 pixels in this study φ li max and φ li min are the maximum and minimum values on the window length scale li respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 migration characteristics as described above the saturation of lnapl in the flow chamber is quantified by the siam the 10 cm 10 cm area centered on the injection point assigned as the area of interest aoi is intercepted for quantitative analysis after lnapl injection the water table in the water tank fluctuates periodically from 40 min to 640 min as shown in fig 1 c the water table level changes monotonically during the first 150 min of the periodic fluctuation stage the effects of monotonic fluctuation and periodic fluctuation on the redistribution characteristics of the lnapl plume are systematically analyzed in this section 3 1 1 the effect of monotonic fluctuation fig 3 presents the morphological change of the lnapl plume in the flow chamber under the monotonic fluctuated groundwater the x and z denote the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the aoi while hw is the water table height the entrapped shape of lnapl is an approximate drop shape in all experiments which is narrower and longer under the high initial water table exp i and exp ii a high water table means greater pore water pressure preventing the lateral extension of lnapl consistent results can be found in the work of rühle et al 2015 in this paper an extended study of the redistribution characteristics of the plume under periodic fluctuation was carried out which can be seen in section 3 1 2 the initial entrapped shape of lnapl has an essential effect on the redistribution shape of the lnapl plume under water table fluctuation from fig 3 it can be seen that the water table fluctuation in the flow chamber leads to the redistribution of the pollution plume the pollution plume varies significantly in the vertical direction and is relatively small in the lateral direction the sharper part of the pollution plume observed in experiment iii is caused by the injection needle in the center of the flow chamber however this phenomenon will not affect the redistribution of the pollution plume in the flow chamber the morphology of the lnapl plume is strongly correlated with the pore water pressure a rising water table promotes the vertical extension of the lnapl plume and inhibits its lateral extension while a falling water table has an opposite effect on the morphology of the lnapl plume since the fluctuation intensity in exp ii is greater than that in exp i the redistribution of the lnapl plume is more pronounced in exp ii than that in exp i a higher amplitude of groundwater variations can increase the mobility of the entrapped lnapl the distribution characteristics of the lnapl plume under the monotonic fluctuated groundwater were evaluated by moment analysis and associated analysis results are displayed in fig 4 the mass center of lnapl plume in the x direction xc of exp i and exp ii are in good agreement before water table fluctuation while xc of exp iii and exp iv have a relatively large difference fig 4 a the difference is caused by the uniformity indexes of the beads packed in the flow chamber the high initial water table in exp i and exp ii results in higher pore water pressure which limits the lateral extension of the pollution plume a similar phenomenon the first order moment of the contamination plume along the horizontal axis under high solute concentration conditions is lower than that under low solute concentration conditions was achieved by wu et al 2020b moreover the fluctuation sequence has a significant effect on the mass center of the lnapl plume in the z direction zc fig 4 b from the change rate of dz the highest rising distance of the pollution plume a higher water table and fluctuation intensity can enhance the vertical transport velocity of the lnapl plume fig 4 h the value of ddz dt is closely related to the water table fluctuation sequence the second order moment of lnapl plume along the z direction σzz is much larger than that along the x direction σxx in all experiments fig 4 c and d indicating the morphological changes of lnapl in the flow chamber are dominated by vertical extension the lateral distribution range of the lnapl plume increases with the falling water table while the vertical distribution range decreases with the falling water table however an opposite tendency occurs under a rising water table this phenomenon is more pronounced in the change rate of the second order moment fig 4 e and f the main reason for this phenomenon is that the reduction of pore water pressure promotes the lateral migration of the pollution plume and thus has a certain inhibitory effect on vertical migration the change rate of the second order moment represents the variation in the lateral and vertical distribution range of the lnapl plume under water table fluctuations which is shown in fig 4 e and f comparing exp i and exp iv it can be seen that a high initial water table can promote the influence of water table fluctuations on the lateral and vertical distribution range of the pollution plume the results of exp i and exp ii exhibit that a higher fluctuation intensity can also increase the variation degree in the distribution range of the lnapl plume fig 4 g shows the plume area as a function of the infiltration time under the monotonic fluctuated water table both the drainage stage falling water table in exp i exp ii and exp iv and the imbibition stage rising water table in exp iii result in a slight reduction in the lnapl plume area compared with the fluctuation sequence and the initial water table height the fluctuation intensity significantly influences the plume area these results show that a higher initial water table will promote the vertical extension of the pollution plume and inhibit the lateral extension of the pollution resulting in a larger pollution plume area 3 1 2 the effect of periodic fluctuation secondary water table fluctuation experiments were carried out to explore the effect of the periodic fluctuated water table on the redistribution characteristics of entrapped lnapl the time dependent water table adjustments of the four experiments are shown in fig 1 c the morphological changes of the lnapl plume under the periodic fluctuation are shown in fig 5 each experiment was divided into the following five stages initial state at 40 min first fluctuation stage at 190 min first restoration stage at 340 min second fluctuation stage at 490 min and second restoration stage at 640 min from fig 5 slight differences can be found in the morphology of the redistribution plume at different fluctuation periods the shape of the pollution plume in the saturated porous media is mainly determined by the initial residual pollution plume however the fluctuation period changes the equilibrium position of the plume the redistribution characteristics of the pollution plume under the periodic fluctuation were quantitatively analyzed by the spatial moment method fig 6 shows the xc zc σxx σzz ap plume area dz as a function of the tflu the period of water table fluctuation from fig 6 a the xc after the secondary water table fluctuation is similar to that at the initial state in exp i and exp ii a fluctuation sequence of falling first and then rising promotes the lateral migration of the pollution plume while an opposite fluctuation sequence inhibits its lateral migration comparing the zc of the four experiments under periodic fluctuations it can be found that the vertical migration of the pollution plume is significantly higher at high initial water tables than that at low initial water tables under the periodic fluctuated water tables a high initial water table inhibits the lateral migration of the pollution plume and it also promotes its vertical migration compared with the case of a high initial water table the lateral migration range σxx under a low initial water table is greatly affected by the periodic fluctuation a larger fluctuation intensity causes a larger change in the migration range under the periodic fluctuated water tables a similar phenomenon can also be found in the variation of the vertical migration range σzz fig 6 d it can be concluded that a lower initial water table and a larger fluctuation intensity can enhance the migration ability of pollution plumes the main reason is that the low initial water table makes the pollution plume reach an equilibrium state under lower pore water pressure compared with the high initial water table the equilibrium state of the pollution plume is easier to break when the water table changes moreover it can be found that the water table fluctuation sequence has a significant effect on the migration range of the pollution plume under the periodic fluctuated water tables the fluctuation sequence of falling first and then rising expands the lateral migration range of the pollution plume while it diminishes its vertical migration range however an opposite regulation can be found in the case with the fluctuation sequence of rising first and then falling compared with the plume area ap under the initial stage the ap shows a downward trend at the secondary fluctuation for the case with a high initial water table however it shows an upward trend in the case with a low initial water table among the four experiments exp ii has the most significant change in the plume area under the periodic fluctuated water tables combined with σxx σzz and fig 5 it can be concluded that a larger fluctuation intensity reduces the vertical migration range of the pollution plume and increases the local saturation the dz in fig 6 f reflects the upward migration degree of the pollution plume which has a similar trend to zc under the periodic fluctuated water tables in the four experiments the value of dz decreases after secondary water table fluctuation except for exp iii this result shows that the redistribution of residual pollutants in the water saturated porous matrix under a periodic fluctuated water table is mainly determined by the fluctuation sequence the fluctuation sequence of falling first and then rising will cause the pollution plume to move downward while the opposite fluctuation sequence will cause the pollution plume to move upward these results can be used to predict the variation in the migration range and trend of the trapped contaminant plume under dynamic water tables in practical engineering projects therefore they can provide a reference for emergency decision formulation 3 2 revs estimation the aoi is discretized into multiple grids with 1 cm sides 100 grids in total as shown in fig 5 six observation grids numbered 1 6 are selected at the same position in each experiment to analyze the rev changes a traditional point centered window geometry is used to estimate the changes of system variables as the increasing window size fig 1 a based on the lnapl saturation obtained by image analysis the relationship between the saturation and the window length scale l of the six observation grids are shown in fig 7 a the window length scale l is defined as the edge length of the window geometry the saturation of all observation grids in exp i and exp ii shows a decreasing trend as the window size increases some grids in exp iii and exp iv exhibit an increasing trend indicating the diversity of saturation changes under low initial water tables when the window length scale is small erratic variation in so is observed for incremental growth in window size however the curve fluctuations gradually level off with a further increase in the window scale consistent with the conceptual schematic in fig 1 a from the saturation curves we can determine the regions with smoothed fluctuations but we cannot identify the starting point of the rev plateau therefore the minimum rev is quantified by the criterion so χi as shown in fig 7 b each curve in fig 7 b has a point representing the minimum so rev the so rev sizes of i 1 i 6 ii 1 ii 6 iii 1 iii 6 and iv 1 iv 6 range 1 67 mm 6 11 mm 3 13 mm 7 19 mm 3 82 mm 9 64 mm and 2 87 mm 9 54 mm respectively fig 7 b the range of rev distribution and rev values under a low water table exp iii and exp iv are larger than those under a high water table exp i and exp ii erratic variation in so χi can be observed from fig 7 b the peak positions of the six observation grids in exp i and exp ii are similar while the double peak phenomenon is observed in exp iii and exp iv it can be concluded that a lower water table leads to an uneven distribution of so rev which is consistent with the saturation curve fig 8 shows the minimum so rev of six selected grids as a function of water table fluctuation periods the line graph represents the change in the mean value of so rev the rev in each observation grid varies continuously with the water table fluctuation periods the rev distribution ranges of i 1 i 6 ii 1 ii 6 and iv 1 iv 6 show an expanding trend after two fluctuation periods while the range of iii 1 iii 6 shows a shrinking trend it can be concluded that the fluctuation sequence of falling first and then rising will increase the difference of rev at different locations of the lnapl plume while the opposite water table fluctuation sequence can reduce the difference for the average minimum so rev of the selected observation grids the exp i and exp ii under the high water table show a increasing trend after the secondary fluctuation while the exp iii and exp iv under the low water table presents a decreasing trend the initial average rev under the high water table is lower than that under the low water table but this phenomenon is reversed after the secondary fluctuation the initial water table height has a decisive influence on the change of the rev under dynamic groundwater conditions however the fluctuation intensity of the water table has no apparent influence on the average value of so rev therefore it is necessary to further analyze the influence of water table height the rev of all observation grids at different water tables of the four experiments is statistically analyzed and the frequency distribution histogram is shown in fig 9 the rev sizes are divided into 10 groups of 0 mm 10 mm and associated relative and cumulative frequency curves are fitted using theoretical gaussian distributions which is the most widely used frequency distribution of variables for natural aquifers montgomery et al 1987 the frequency distribution characteristics of rev under different water tables are similar and the minimum so rev frequency distribution becomes closer to a regular gaussian distribution with the increasing water table height at the low water table a valley value of frequency appears at 6 mm 8 mm indicating less rev size distribution in this range as the water table increases the rev size distribution becomes more uniform and a peak value of frequency appears at 3 mm 4 mm compared with the cumulative curve in fig 9 a and b the shape of cumulative frequency becomes smoother in fig 9 c the minimum so rev presents a statistically negative linear correlation with water table height fig 9 d table 2 demonstrates the confidence intervals of so rev for the four experiments at a significance level of 0 05 after two periods of water table fluctuations the width of the confidence interval in exp iii was shortened by 0 91 mm while it increased by 0 48 mm 1 mm and 0 32 mm in exp i exp ii and exp iv respectively this phenomenon indicates that the fluctuation sequences has an essential effect on the variation of the rev confidence interval under dynamic water tables which is consistent with the rev distribution in fig 7 comparing the changes of confidence intervals in exp i and exp ii it can be concluded that the increment of width after water table fluctuation in exp ii is twice as large as that in exp i indicating that the greater the fluctuation intensity the larger the increment for the confidence interval under different water table heights both the upper limits and widths decrease as the water table increases the influence of the water table fluctuation sequence on rev changes is much more significant than that of the fluctuation intensity and water table height previous studies mainly focused on the effect of median grain diameter and heterogeneity on rev costanza robinson et al 2011 wu et al 2017a wu et al 2020 investigated the effect of solute concentration on rev which is the only study to our knowledge that considers groundwater parameters in rev studies the change rate in the rev confidence interval caused by heterogeneity and solution concentration in wu s study was 32 and 20 respectively the results of this study show that the rev confidence interval of exp ii has increased by 51 after two periods of water table fluctuations indicating the significant effect of groundwater parameters on rev although differences in experimental conditions prevents quantitative comparisons of rev values the change rate of the confidence interval is a normalized result that can be used for qualitative analysis it can be concluded that the influence of groundwater parameters on rev can even exceed the effect of geological conditions therefore groundwater parameters such as ph ion type and groundwater velocity need to be considered in the analysis of rev in further studies this study was conducted in a two dimensional flow chamber which is a simplification of the actual aquifer therefore the quantitative analysis results in this study cannot be directly applied to an aquifer however laboratory scale experiments are the most widely used method in aquifer contaminant transport studies due to limitations such as the high cost and measurement difficulties of field scale tests because of the controlled operating conditions laboratory scale experiments are often used to explain phenomena that cannot be explained by field scale tests within the aquifer joun et al 2016 therefore the qualitative conclusions about the effects of fluctuation sequence and initial water table height on the migration behavior of the contaminant plume in this study can be directly used to guide the aquifer remediation conducting field scale contaminant transport simulations in porous media is usually based on the continuum media assumption for which the determination of rev is a prerequisite therefore the rev data obtained in this study plays an essential role in the upscaling processes from laboratory scale to field scale 4 conclusions lnapl migration experiments based on a 2d flow chamber have been conducted to study the morphological changes and revs variation of the entrapped lnapl under dynamic groundwater conditions influence factors including initial water table height water table fluctuation intensity and water table fluctuation sequence are considered in this study results indicate that a high initial water table inhibits the lateral migration of the pollution plume and it also promotes its vertical migration under the periodic fluctuated water tables the fluctuation sequence of falling first and then rising expands the lateral migration range of the pollution plume while it diminishes its vertical migration range the redistribution location of the entrapped lnapl is mainly determined by the fluctuation sequence from rev estimation the range of rev distribution and rev values under the low water table are more extensive than those under a higher water table the rev presents a statistically negative linear correlation with water table height the fluctuation sequence of falling first and then rising leads to a wider confidence interval of rev while the opposite water table fluctuation sequence results in a narrower confidence interval furthermore a higher water table leads to a narrower rev confidence interval these results are essential to understand the effect of transient hydrological conditions on the migration behaviors and revs of the lnapl trapped below the water table which can provide a reference for emergency decision

3318,groundwater flooding can cause severe damages to homes utilities and infrastructure and yield significant economic and social costs numerical models are used to understand these events and are the basis to produce imagery products for risk management and communication however such maps are generally produced using forward model simulations and most of the mapping products are still deterministic in contrast to pluvial and fluvial floods an open issue in the analysis of susceptibility to groundwater flooding is the lack of probabilistic assessment and mapping products recognizing parametric uncertainty hence we propose a bayesian based framework to create probabilistic risk maps and to identify the susceptibility to groundwater flood events we aim to assess the spatial distribution and temporal variability of groundwater flooding by decomposing the uncertainty and the sensitivity of distributed groundwater numerical models the scheme involves the use of the elementary effects method the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream algorithm and the exploration of the predictive posterior distributions of the groundwater heads to evaluate the susceptibility according to exceedance levels we use the proposed bayesian framework with a numerical model that simulates the groundwater flood event that occurred in the valley of the alz river in 2013 this study developed two types of susceptibility maps based on the exceedance probability of certain groundwater levels and specific cellar depths the bayesian inference supports the parameter estimation and thereby increases the spatial confidence of the areas susceptible to inundation this study shows that maps of susceptibility to groundwater flooding can be built over one single event models and acknowledge the inherent spatial and temporal uncertainty of such events keywords groundwater flooding bayesian inversion probability maps flood risk sensitivity analysis uncertainty quantification 1 introduction the increasingly frequent occurrence of extreme weather events has raised attention about flood events kaiser et al 2020 tabari 2020 winsemius et al 2016 although the focus of flood risk assessment often tends to be on the fluvial and pluvial floods ascott et al 2017 collins et al 2020 groundwater flooding can yield significant economic and social damages and disruptions such as sewer backups abboud et al 2018 morris et al 2018 roads and property inundation abboud et al 2018 keilholz et al 2015 morris et al 2018 soren 1976 foundation failures and corrosion colombo et al 2018 oyedele et al 2009 damages to underground structures and infrastructure gattinoni and scesi 2017 preene and fisher 2015 underground pollution transport gonzález quirós and fernández álvarez 2019 and crop damage booth et al 2016 this type of flood event refers to the groundwater emergence at the ground surface and the rising groundwater level into underground civil infrastructure macdonald et al 2012 macdonald et al 2008 unlike other types of floods groundwater flooding can be difficult to identify and assess kreibich et al 2009 mckenzie et al 2010 and traditional flood protection systems may not be effective yu et al 2019 similar to traditional flood risk management a large number of studies applies numerical modeling at different scales and with a varying degree of complexity to understand groundwater flood events abboud et al 2018 gonzález quirós and fernández álvarez 2019 morrissey et al 2020 yu et al 2019 these models are typically posed as forward problems which involve predicting error free model states based on a prior parameterization of the model tarantola 2005 one disadvantage in this type of strategy is that it requires specifying a variety of parameters which are impossible to characterize exhaustively zhou et al 2014 another drawback of forward problems is that once calibrated the model ignores the equifinality thesis beven and freer 2001 and the uncertainties which may imply to adopt strong and questionable assumptions about its forecast reliability di baldassarre et al 2010 consequently probability theory tools such as inverse methods helton et al 2004 kaipio and somersalo 2005 have evolved to address aleatory and epistemic uncertainties merz and thieken 2009 ross et al 2009 in contrast to forward models inverse methods were developed to support parameter identification and consequently to improve predictions zhou et al 2014 bayesian approaches solve inverse problems considering parameters as random variables and providing posterior probabilities by incorporating known data smith 2013 due to their inferential and predictive properties bayesian methods are considered one of the most appropriate techniques for uncertainty analysis heße et al 2019 in spite of the progress in the field of uncertainty quantification the temporal and spatial uncertainties of the models are often declared but not quantified in groundwater flooding studies a limited number of studies includes a formal quantification of the uncertainty colombo et al 2018 fürst et al 2015 jimenez martinez et al 2015 and to the best of the authors knowledge the explicit application of bayesian inference on groundwater flooding modeling remains unexplored flood risk mapping is a fundamental tool for flood risk management and communication demeritt and nobert 2014 henstra et al 2019 accordingly a lot of effort has been made to generate groundwater flood maps for planning damage assessment and insurance purposes morris et al 2018 maps of groundwater flooding susceptibility are regularly constructed on the basis of lumped parameter models upton and jackson 2011 or by analyzing geological and hydrogeological data british geological survey 2006 mancini et al 2020 yu et al 2019 recent studies employ this type of data with machine learning techniques to create spatially distributed maps of susceptibility to groundwater flood events allocca et al 2021 still the lack of probabilistic and inverse methods in groundwater flooding models has been transferred to the groundwater flooding imagery which often does not include formal likelihood quantification this partially occurs due to the computational challenge from distributed models and high dimensional inverse problems boyce and yeh 2014 merz and thieken 2009 xu et al 2017 zhou et al 2014 and to limitations derived from data quality and availability mckenzie et al 2010 merz and thieken 2009 morris et al 2018 alternatives to overcome these problems are the reduction of the dimension of the input parameter space bittner et al 2021 boyce and yeh 2014 erdal and cirpka 2019 mara et al 2017 stanko et al 2016 teixeira parente et al 2019 and the optimization of the problem design by changing the spatial and temporal scaling i e simulation period and model extension and resolution i e time and space discretization guillaume et al 2016 scheibe et al 2015 assembling these alternatives can be useful to assess groundwater flooding in a probabilistic manner as explained by teng et al 2017 and di baldassarre et al 2010 probabilistic flood risks maps are preferable to single deterministic maps of inundation because they acknowledge the inherent uncertainty in comparison to pluvial and fluvial flooding there is less detail for hazard and risk management in groundwater flood mapping morris et al 2018 as the demand for probabilistic maps in pluvial and fluvial flood risk analysis increases bhola et al 2020 teng et al 2017 the need for groundwater flooding analysis is not expected to behave differntly this study introduces a framework to recognize the susceptibility of residential property areas to groundwater flooding acknowledging the uncertainty in the model input parameters we aim to create mapping products with the estimation of the probability of groundwater flood inundations by targeting one groundwater flood event as the basis of the problem design we propose to decompose cell by cell the uncertainty and the sensitivity of a distributed groundwater numerical model to understand the spatial distribution and temporal variability of groundwater flood events the framework involves three components 1 elementary effects method to identify influential input factors and reduce the problem dimensionality 2 bayesian inference using the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream algorithm to estimate statistics of the relevant uncertain parameters and to quantify the output uncertainty incorporating evidence data and 3 exploration of the predictive posterior distributions to assess the susceptibility to groundwater flooding according to exceedance probability levels to demonstrate the relevance and feasibility of the application the framework is applied to evaluate a groundwater flood event that occurred in the valley of the alz river in germany in 2013 the event is simulated using a numerical model built on modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 the posterior probability distributions of the groundwater heads are then explored against groundwater depth thresholds and registered cellar depths 2 methods 2 1 groundwater flow equation groundwater flow in a heterogeneous unconfined aquifer can be described by coupling the continuity equation with darcy s law fetter 1999 such that 1 x k xx h x y k yy h y z k zz h z w s h t where h is the piezometric groundwater head l k xx k yy and k zz denote the hydraulic conductivity values lt 1 along the x y and z coordinate axes s is the specific storage l 1 and w represents the sources and sinks t 1 modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 solves the groundwater flow equation in a finite difference form the rate of change in storage within each cell is equal to the sum of flows into and out of the cell so that 2 q i s δ h δ t δ v where q i is the i component of the flow rate into the cell l3t 1 δ v is the cell volume l3 and δ h l is the change in the groundwater head over a time interval δ t t external sources or stressors such as the infiltration into the saturated zone and the river aquifer fluxes can be represented as q i elements hence the forward problem is driven to predict the groundwater head distributions at successive times as a function of an uncertain set of model inputs θ i e uncertain parameters source terms initial or boundary conditions 2 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is used to quantify how the uncertainty in the output of a model can be apportioned to the different uncertainties in the model inputs saltelli 2002 smith 2013 we use the elementary effects method also known as morris method to identify the sensitive parameters through basic statistical moments campolongo et al 2007 morris 1991 due to its sampling strategy this technique is advantageous for quantifying the sensitivity in computationally expensive models with many uncertain inputs campolongo et al 2007 jaxa rozen and kwakkel 2018 smith 2013 in our research the purpose of its application is to identify which input factors are non influential and therefore negligible as well as to recognize the input factors that are non linear or involved in interactions those input factors that are non influential are fixed to reduce the problem dimensionality which is an essential step to define an affordable experimental design and proceed with the subsequent bayesian analysis the elementary effect method considers that each model input q q 1 q k varies across p selected levels forming a k dimensional p level finite grid of experimentation γ p then p represents the number of partitions of the model parameter space at which the model can be evaluated assuming that the input terms are scaled to the interval 0 1 the elementary effect associated with the input q i is defined as 3 d i q f q 1 q i 1 q i δ q i 1 q k f q δ f q δ e i f q δ with a jump size δ 1 p 1 1 1 p 1 and transformed point q δ e i where q q 1 q k is any selected value in γ p and e i is a vector of zeros with one in the i th component then d i q quantifies the local sensitivity behavior at the point q the global sensitivity measure requires to approximate the statistical moments from the associated finite dimensional distribution g i by randomly sampling q from the grid points in γ p morris 1991 proposed the mean μ i and the standard deviation σ i of the distribution g i by sampling m points these metrics associated with the i th parameter and j th samples can be expressed as 4 μ i 1 m j 1 m d i j q 5 σ i 1 m 1 j 1 m d i j q μ i 2 campolongo et al 2007 introduced an additional sensitivity metric μ to avoid the problems associated to non monotonic models that may contain effects with opposite signs this refined version estimates the mean of the absolute values of the elementary effects and can be written as 6 μ i 1 m j 1 m d i j q the elementary effects method proposes to construct μ i and σ i with m trajectories of k 1 points in the input space which provide k elementary effects the total number of realizations is defined by k 1 m the sampling strategy employs the orientation matrix b to obtain random samples from g i so that 7 b j k 1 1 q δ 2 2 b j k 1 k d j k 1 k p where q is a random initial point j k 1 k is a k 1 k matrix of ones b is a k 1 k strictly lower triangular matrix of ones d is a k k diagonal matrix formed by randomly chosen elements from the set 1 1 and p is a k k random permutation matrix 2 3 bayesian inference and sampling algorithm 2 3 1 bayesian inference bayesian inference is derived from the bayes theorem to explicitly introduce in the analysis assumptions about evidence data and prior knowledge of the model inputs box and tiao 2011 smith 2013 let y represent a given set of observations or evidence data and θ denote a set of parameters following the bayesian formulation the posterior probability of the parameter set p θ y can be obtained with the prior probability of the parameter set p θ the observed data p y and the likelihood function p y θ l θ y such that 8 p θ y p y θ p θ p y given that all statistical inferences of p θ y can be made from the unnormalized density p y can be omitted vrugt 2016 and the bayes equation is simplified as 9 p θ y l θ y p θ l θ y summarizes the distance between the observation and the simulated quantity of interest groundwater heads for the sake of our research our formulation of the bayesian inference problem assumes that the error residuals are homoscedastic and normally distributed ε t n 0 σ 2 and it employs the log likelihood l θ y for numerical stability vrugt 2016 then considering n vector of error residuals at times t s 1 n the log likelihood function applied in this study can be written as 10 ℒ θ y n 2 log t s 1 n ε t θ 2 for further debate about mathematical definitions of the likelihood function and details in their derivation process we refer the readers to the corresponding literature kaipio and somersalo 2005 schoups and vrugt 2010 vrugt 2016 2 3 2 sampling algorithm to estimate the probability density function of the parameters markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling is implemented using the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream scheme vrugt et al 2009 2008 vrugt and ter braak 2011 in general mcmc techniques consist of the iterative sampling of a probabilistic space to find areas of a high likelihood of the posterior distribution of the parameter space the dream algorithm is an efficient mcmc based method it runs multiple chains of simulations simultaneously and adjusts the scale and orientation of the proposal distribution during the run candidate points are created by sampling the prior parameter distribution for each chain and the metropolis hastings ratio is used to decide if a candidate point is accepted or not the convergence of each chain is evaluated using the gelman rubin diagnostic gelman and rubin 1992 extensive theoretical descriptions of the dream algorithm implementation can be found in the literature houska et al 2015 vrugt 2016 vrugt et al 2009 2008 vrugt and ter braak 2011 2 4 exceedance probability and susceptibility maps the final step of the framework involves extracting information from the posterior distributions of the groundwater heads at each element of the model and at different time steps to analyze the spatial and temporal conditions of the event we characterize the associated groundwater flooding risk by computing the probability of the groundwater table of exceeding a certain threshold value i e exceedance probability for convenience this can be explained from the cumulative distribution function of the predicted groundwater heads f h for f r 0 1 that can be described by 11 f h p h h the exceedance probability p can then be estimated with the complementary cumulative distribution function of eq 11 expressed as 12 p p h h 1 f h consequently we create the maps of susceptibility to groundwater flooding considering the probability p i j t of exceeding a threshold k i j computed at the time step t t 1 t n and the discrete point i 1 n c and j 1 n r where n c and n r are respectively the number of columns and rows used for the spatial discretization thus 13 p i j t 1 f i j t k i j we propose two types of thresholds in this work the first one is the groundwater depth threshold κ i j which represents a specified distance d between the surface elevation and the groundwater table at the cell i j hence it can be defined according to a two dimensional array of a digital elevation model t i j that is 14 κ i j t i j d the second threshold is defined according to the cellar depths κ i j at a specific house property or building hence κ i j is the reported depth of the underground infrastructure located at the cell i j therefore k i j can be equal to κ i j or κ i j depending on the assessment 2 5 practical application 2 5 1 case study the study area is located in southeastern bavaria germany during heavy rainfall events at the beginning of june 2013 the region was affected by flood events that caused several damages in the residential properties disse et al 2015 keilholz et al 2015 the study region is characterized by an unconsolidated shallow sedimentary aquifer formed by gravels and sands doppler et al 2011 keilholz et al 2015 merchán rivera et al 2018 the groundwater flow is very dynamic due to the high permeability of the porous material of the aquifer the relatively rapid groundwater recharge and the hydraulic connection with the alz river and the alz canal the flood event in 2013 in the alz river valley and the hydrogeological features of the region were the subjects of previous studies doppler et al 2011 and bayerisches landesamt für umwelt 2017 describe the geological properties and the morphological features of the valley further studies also estimate the uncertainty in the discharge and stage of the alz river willems 2011 willems and stricker 2012 and quantify the propagation of uncertainty due to the representation of the river boundary conditions merchán rivera et al 2021 fig 1 includes details of the study area and the flood event 2 5 2 model description a two dimensional model was built using modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 to describe the event the model simulates 300 stress periods at intervals of six hours to cover a total of 75 days from may 02 2013 to july 15 2013 the spatial discretization is a finite difference grid formed by one layer 260 rows and 260 columns the initial and boundary conditions were defined based on the preexisting regional model built by keilholz 2015 three types of boundary conditions are used in the model 1 specified head boundaries using time variant specified head package harbaugh et al 2000 leake and prudic 1991 to simulate the variation in the water table at the borders of the domain 2 recharge into the saturated zone using the recharge package harbaugh 2005 harbaugh et al 2000 to simulate the distributed infiltration flux and 3 river interactions using the river package harbaugh 2005 harbaugh et al 2000 to simulate the interaction between the streams and the aquifer the spatial distribution of the specified head and river boundaries are illustrated in fig 1a given that the initial conditions of the groundwater heads and the specified head boundaries were extracted from the regional model keilholz et al 2015 which include a larger simulation period there was no need to include a warm up period three hydraulic conductivity values k a k b and k c are defined based on the geological studies bayerisches landesamt für umwelt 2017 doppler et al 2011 and accordingly three specific storage values s a s b and s c and three specific yield values γ a γ b and γ c these parameters were assumed to be homogeneous within each soil section sa sb and sc recharge into the saturated zone values q i j t are defined according to the deterministic estimations from the hydrological model made by keilholz et al 2015 finally the streams are parameterized considering two streambed conductance values for the canal c 1 and c 2 three streambed conductance values for the river r 1 r 2 and r 3 which are outlined according to observed differences in the morphology of the streams and stream stage values ξ i j t based on the previous estimations made by merchán rivera et al 2021 groundwater field measurements were registered every six hours during the simulation period in four groundwater monitoring wells alzpitz b1 b3 and b4 keilholz et al 2015 these observations were used as the evidence for the bayesian inference although we computed the hydraulic head values for the entire simulation period we chose four simulation time steps to be representative of different phases of the event to present the results before the event at stress period 86 may 23 2013 peak flow at stress period 127 june 02 2013 recession phase at stress period 145 june 07 2013 and after the flood event at stress period 290 july 13 2013 we define the recession phase as the stage that immediately follows the peak flow whereas after the event refers to the phase where the declining period has ended these separate periods were used along with the results and discussion to understand the temporal variation of the outcomes fig 1 includes details of the study the model settings and the digital elevation model 2 5 3 scheme implementation the hydraulic properties are summarized in table 1 where u a b denotes the prior belief distributed uniformly between a and b except for q i j t and ξ i j t the uncertainty analysis considers the parameters as random variables that are simply sampled from a uniform distribution and used in the realizations of the scheme the choice to set the prior beliefs to be uniform i e non informative is a conservative assumption at costs of computational efficiency in practice this means that we need a larger sample size to obtain better estimates of the posterior distribution during bayesian inversion more informative prior distributions would require a smaller sample size to reach a similar precision note that the sampling strategy in the elementary effect method should be modified if non uniform distributions are considered feng et al 2019 the recharge influx into the saturated zone q i j t is spatially distributed over the domain and varies at every stress period t of the simulation keilholz et al 2015 estimated deterministic values for recharge into the saturated zone q i j t in a regional hydrologic model using mike she dhi 2013 in our research the uncertainty in these recharge values is introduced as a single multiplier r for all the grid cells affected by recharge at all time steps similarly to the approach employed by mustafa et al 2018 hence the random variable r u a b is used in combination with q i j t to obtain the corrected spatial distributed recharge q i j t such that 15 q i j t q i j t r similarly keilholz et al 2015 provided scatter stage information for the river and the canal these scatter data were post processed by merchán rivera et al 2021 to obtain the stream head ξ i j t at every cell that represents the river and the canal hence the streams are represented as time variant and spatially distributed inputs the uncertainty in the stage is included by the error ψ u a b where the bounds a and b are approximated according to the works by willems 2011 and willems and stricker 2012 this means that ψ increases or reduces the stream stage ξ i j t for all of the stress periods t at each cell i j that represent the streams to obtain 16 ξ i j t ξ i j t ψ the implementation of the elementary effects considers all parameters mentioned in table 1 as input factors given that the values of p and m are primarily an experimental choice saltelli et al 2004 we performed an extensive exploration of different factor levels and sampling size by constructing various experimental combinations using p 4 6 8 and 10 and m 10 20 and 30 the elementary effects approach reduces the dimensionality of our problem and provide a list of influential factors that are later used in the bayesian inversion with the dream algorithm the posterior distributions are calculated from the last 50 of the samples generated with the dream algorithm from 10 000 realization we explore the posterior predictive distributions of the groundwater heads at every element of the domain and every stress period to compute the threshold κ i j we define t i j with the digital elevation model dem of the region bayerisches landesamt für umwelt 2017 and the groundwater depth d to be equal to 0 5 and 1 5 note that d values are arbitrarily selected and they can simply be modified once the posterior predictive distributions are quantified the dem resolution is 5 5 m cell size finally we define the threshold κ i j using the cellar depth records from the household survey run by disse et al 2015 in april 2014 κ h 1 459 0 m a s l above sea level κ h 2 458 6 m a s l κ h 3 459 4 m a s l κ h 4 461 1 m a s l κ h 5 460 1 m a s l κ h 6 461 0 m a s l κ h 7 460 3 m a s l we employ the salib python library herman and usher 2017 to compute the elementary effect indices with the efficient sampling strategy introduced by campolongo et al 2007 the dream algorithm was implemented using the spotpy framework houska et al 2015 the probability maps in the results were created by arranging the output data in matrix arrays using the numpy library harris et al 2020 and plotting them with the matplotlib library hunter 2007 in python 3 the algorithm for implementing the exposed approach was written in python 3 and the files are available in the research dataset merchán rivera 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis based on the values of μ we obtain a ranking of model sensitivity that can be easily interpreted see fig 2 a high absolute measure of central tendency μ denotes an input with a significant overall influence on the output hence the most sensitive parameters are k a k b γ a r c 2 and r 2 also there are spatial and temporal variabilities in the results of the elementary effects the positions in the ranking change depending on the location and the phase of the event we observe higher values of the elementary effects metrics at the peak flow similarly we can see more significant differences between the minimum and maximum values of μ at this phase the spatial variation in the sensitivity of the recharge multiplier r occurs due to the heterogeneous distribution of the recharge into the saturated zone q i j t the parameters that describe the streams c 1 c 2 r 1 r 2 r 3 and ψ gain relevance close to the streams at the monitoring wells alzpitz and b3 the sensitivity of the canal conductance c 2 is also large at b1 and h1 the second sensitivity measure that we obtain is the spread σ a high value of σ indicates input factors with a non linear effect in the model output the existence of parameter interactions or both the ratio σ μ is an indicator of model linearity if σ μ 0 or non linearity if σ μ 0 also this indicator can occasionally give evidence of monotonic and non monotonic model responses when 0 σ μ 0 5 and σ μ 0 5 respectively garcia sanchez et al 2014 in fig 3 we display all the outcomes of μ and σ from every combination of p and m and classify them based on the event phase in a scatter plot overall the model behavior is subject of non linearities non monotonicities or interactions between model parameters the results also show temporal variation in this behavior while the functional relationships between the input factors and the outputs are highly non linear interactive or non monotonic during the peak and the recession phase the relationships tend to reduce these qualities before and after the event non monotonic responses can occur with respect to the input factors associated to the hydraulic conductivity particularly k a and k b the effect of the parameter interactions can increase due to the increased influx from the high staged river seen in the peak flow and the recession phase which would also influence the non monotonicity from k a and k b notice that the non linearity of the model responses is not affected directly by variations in the influx from the streams and the recharge but by the effect that these have on the hydraulic gradient magnitude five parameters can be considered non influential factors k c s a s b s c and γ c as expected the specific storage values are negligible because we study an unconfined aquifer and their contribution to the storativity is orders of magnitude lower than the specific yield in the case of k c and γ c the low values of μ are determined by the spatial location of the soil type sc hence these five parameters are fixed to reduce the problem dimensionality for the bayesian inversion from 16 to 11 calibration parameters even if a further reduction of the parameter space could be assumed and be quite useful for the application of the bayesian inversion we want to retain the properties of the original model for the scope of the study at the cost of higher computational demand 3 2 bayesian inversion in fig 4 we can observe the prior and posterior discrete distributions of the sensitive parameters these results show that the algorithm updated the distributions of the sensitive parameters reducing their uncertainty we also observe that most of the parameters tend to unimodality except ψ whose posterior distribution is only slightly updated in comparison to the prior distribution this can be reasonably explained by the sensitivity analysis that shows low scores for this parameter the statistical moments of the posterior distribution of the uncertain parameters can be found in table 2 the expected values of the conductance from the river sections r 1 and r 2 range within the same order of magnitude the latter suggests that the bed conductance of the river may be overparameterized considering the location of the observation wells used for the inversion given these results and the outcomes of the sensitivity analysis an additional reduction of the model dimensionality could be possible by grouping r 1 and r 2 in one parameter we observe a high frequency of samples in the lower end of r that reduces the revised infiltration q i j t used in the model evaluations this implies that the deterministic values of the infiltration into the saturated zone extracted from the regional model q i j t do not represent accurate the system whether by overestimating the inflow rates or the recharge extension this remarks the importance of quantifying the uncertainty in the analysis of risk of these events still note that r and ψ are random variables that aim to catch the uncertainty in model parameters that are fundamentally transient recharge into the saturated zone q i j t and river stage ξ i j t this means that a single random sample per evaluation may not exhaustively capture the temporal variability and the uncertainty of these parameters also it is important to point out that the bayesian approach relies in the information fed by the empirical evidence therefore the location of the observation wells plays a fundamental role some parameters may not be adequately represented due to the location of the monitoring wells such as r c 1 r 1 and r 3 the reduction of the model parametric uncertainty is evident after taking into consideration the observed data with the bayesian approach see table 3 and fig 5 in fig 5 we can see the probability distribution of the groundwater heads considering the prior and posterior distribution of the sensitive parameters a lower standard deviation σ o in the hydraulic head distribution indicates that the values tend to be close to the central tendency metric μ o see table 3 fig 5 shows the approximation of the probability density function of the groundwater heads from the prior and the posterior predictive simulations at different locations and different phases of the event the kernel density plot was calculated using scott s rule scott 2010 over the finite output data of the groundwater heads located at the different monitoring wells this plot is helpful to identify the position and relative amplitude of the density distributions and to recognize if the distribution is multimodal the groundwater heads at alzpitz located immediately next to the river display a bimodal distribution with the parameterization of the model using the prior distribution of the parameters this distribution is later updated with the posterior to a unimodal distribution the spread of the groundwater heads is evidence of significant uncertainty in the prior beliefs which is driven by the interconnection with the river especially during the peak flow discharges the interquartile range between the first and third quartile q3 q1 range shows the variability around the median of 50 of the predictive values of the groundwater heads using the prior distribution of the parameters we see that the q3 q1 range is larger than one meter at alzpitz and b3 for the model considering the prior distribution of the parameters lastly we can observe the skewness of the prior predictive distributions which depict positive asymmetry about their mean fig 6 shows the final results of the predictive groundwater heads after applying the bayesian inference we use the mean and the interval μ o σ o μ o σ o of the predictive posterior distribution as a measure of the uncertainty we observe that these metrics properly capture the observations particularly in the wells alzpitz and b3 at b4 the predictive uncertainty does not include the peak observations also we observe disagreements in the responses at b1 that may occur due to the influence of the southern time variant specified heads boundary conditions 3 3 probability maps the bayesian approach allows us to study groundwater flood events considering the posterior distribution of the groundwater levels which can be used for subsequent analysis such as transport modeling scenario modeling or assembling more complex model structures in our case the posterior distributions at every cell of the domain can be used to create probability maps of susceptibility to groundwater flooding based on limit exceedances we present two types of maps in this section the first one is a distributed map based on the water depth levels in relation to the topographic level figs 7 and 8 the second type is a graduated symbol map where the size of the circles indicates the probability of exceedance given the depth of a specific house cellar fig 9 figs 7 and 8 show the probability of having groundwater tables rising at the defined thresholds κ i j d 1 5 and κ i j d 0 5 respectively the maps include the outcomes of simulations with the prior uncertainty figs 7a and 8a and the revised uncertainty from the bayesian inversion figs 7b and 8b areas with a low probability of exceedance are reduced in the maps built with the posterior distributions thanks to the reduced variability in the sensitive parameters many zones are highly susceptible to groundwater flooding even before and after the peak flow this agrees with reports of cellar inundations out of the peak flow event and the high groundwater levels that can also be observed during non flood seasons bayerisches landesamt für umwelt 2020 the heavy precipitation at the end of may and the beginning of june 2013 between stress period 115 and stress period 130 could have been the inundation catalyst but the results show a high groundwater table at every phase of the event regardless of the heavy rainfall indeed initial conditions such as soil saturation before the event can influence recharge from rainfall the underground infrastructure and properties can hence be exposed during longer periods to groundwater flooding and not only during specific hydrological events the uncertainty in the soil saturation parametrized using the recharge multiplier in this study is essential because the occurrence duration and severity of groundwater flooding will be determined by both the antecedent water table and groundwater recharge rate during the peak flow and the recession phase the probability of having groundwater depths above 1 5 m reaches maximum values this shows the relatively slow decrease in the hydraulic head in the recession phase in comparison with fluvial floods groundwater flooding can last for an extended period and infrastructure and property damage can be associated with long lasting exposure by comparing the outcomes from prior and posterior evaluations we observe cells where the prior beliefs overestimate the exceedance probabilities while others underestimate them in such cases preconceptions based on one single forward simulation could be misleading maps over the basis of a distributed model help to avoid such biases and identify spatial responses that may be overlooked otherwise also creating the maps with a bayesian approach increases the spatial confidence of the groundwater flooding susceptibility we mainly assign this improvement to the updated posterior distributions of the hydraulic conductivity k a and k b which are very sensitive parameters and describe the ability of the material to transmit the fluid through the pore space within significant regions of the domain comparing figs 7 and 8 we can observe that the choice in the threshold value d is very important for the delineation of the areas affected by groundwater flooding hence it should be carefully chosen according to site specific problematics or different values of d should be investigated to have a clear picture of the possibly inundated areas based on the household survey we define the threshold κ i j at different residential properties and the resulting maps can be observed in fig 9 the properties selected in this analysis are far enough from the boundary conditions such that they are not influenced by the time variant specified heads we observe that the probability of reaching the cellar depth is unrelated to the distance to the river see probabilities of building h2 and h3 given the high groundwater table of the simulated period it is very likely to reach the cellar depths at h1 h2 h3 and h6 even before and after the peak event the probability of groundwater levels reaching the cellar is higher at the recession phase at h2 h5 h6 and h7 these results may imply a delayed propagation of the flood wave from the river into the aquifer a drawback of the presented scheme is the memory requirement to store the element wise data to construct the probability density functions still in practice it is possible to cluster the output data in relation to their spatial and temporal relevance and build maps of smaller regions this means once the zones and periods of major importance are identified there is no need to keep in memory the simulation data that is out of the cluster the presented results are obtained from a groundwater flow model that evaluates one actual event which involves a relatively short timeframe of simulation compared to mapping products that measure susceptibility to groundwater flooding from the description of the return period however the approach can be easily extended considering appropriate design parameters e g changing the return period of the precipitation event of the peak river discharge and or of the volume of the event this single event approach could be informative for industries property managers or insurance companies to evaluate the susceptibility to groundwater flooding of underground structures 4 conclusions the broad implication of this research is the presentation of a bayesian based framework to create probability maps of susceptibility to groundwater flooding in order to incorporate the parameter uncertainties in the risk imagery the scheme proposes to break down the uncertainty and sensitivity of one flood event into spatial and temporal terms and compute the statistics of interest at each domain element the elementary effects method is used to reduce the problem dimensionality by quantifying the model sensitivity with a relatively low number of model evaluations we use the dream algorithm as an mcmc based technique to estimate the posterior distributions of the relevant uncertain parameters and reduce the uncertainty in the predicted groundwater heads finally we propose to explore the posterior probability distribution of the groundwater heads to compute the exceedance probability based on the groundwater depths and cellar depths two types of maps are created to describe the susceptibility to groundwater flooding a distributed map using the groundwater depth threshold and a graduated symbol map given the depth of a specific house cellar the approach is illustrated with an application in a numerical model that describes the groundwater flood event in the alz river valley in 2013 we are able to increase the spatial confidence of the results thanks to the reduction in the uncertainty during the inference process by using a relatively large temporal scale we are able to employ accurate temporal resolutions to detect the exposure to groundwater inundation at particular properties and areas the framework can be applied over one flood event and this may be considered a promising aspect due to the reduced amount of data and the low computational demand the posterior probabilities of the groundwater head and the exceedance evaluation help us distinguish highly exposed zones from those exposed only during peak flow and the recession phase this is relevant in practical applications because definitions of the susceptible zones can be easily constructed from a probabilistic perspective and the accuracy of the simulations can be updated with new evidence data in addition these findings provide additional information about the incidence of groundwater flooding beyond the flood season in this specific case study the results indicate that infrastructure and property can be long lastingly exposed to inundation hazards finally we stress the importance of opting for a bayesian approach to understand groundwater flood events and create risk imagery the temporal and spatial nature of groundwater flow confirms that the problem can be presented from a different perspective than the view of traditional flood events besides the exposure of the assets groundwater flooding risk depends on temporal and spatial details from hydrological climatic and geomorphological elements ultimately this level of detail makes flood mapping the crucial tool for flood risk management employed by a wide variety of partakers such as planners developers insurance companies and property owners but it is not possible to characterize the hydrogeological systems in such detail without being affected by uncertainty and an explicit quantification is therefore required probability maps built over inverse methods can be relevant not only for incorporating the uncertainty and improving the reliability of the model but also for the accuracy of the message that is transmitted to different actors credit authorship contribution statement pablo merchán rivera conceptualization methodology software formal analysis investigation

3318,groundwater flooding can cause severe damages to homes utilities and infrastructure and yield significant economic and social costs numerical models are used to understand these events and are the basis to produce imagery products for risk management and communication however such maps are generally produced using forward model simulations and most of the mapping products are still deterministic in contrast to pluvial and fluvial floods an open issue in the analysis of susceptibility to groundwater flooding is the lack of probabilistic assessment and mapping products recognizing parametric uncertainty hence we propose a bayesian based framework to create probabilistic risk maps and to identify the susceptibility to groundwater flood events we aim to assess the spatial distribution and temporal variability of groundwater flooding by decomposing the uncertainty and the sensitivity of distributed groundwater numerical models the scheme involves the use of the elementary effects method the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream algorithm and the exploration of the predictive posterior distributions of the groundwater heads to evaluate the susceptibility according to exceedance levels we use the proposed bayesian framework with a numerical model that simulates the groundwater flood event that occurred in the valley of the alz river in 2013 this study developed two types of susceptibility maps based on the exceedance probability of certain groundwater levels and specific cellar depths the bayesian inference supports the parameter estimation and thereby increases the spatial confidence of the areas susceptible to inundation this study shows that maps of susceptibility to groundwater flooding can be built over one single event models and acknowledge the inherent spatial and temporal uncertainty of such events keywords groundwater flooding bayesian inversion probability maps flood risk sensitivity analysis uncertainty quantification 1 introduction the increasingly frequent occurrence of extreme weather events has raised attention about flood events kaiser et al 2020 tabari 2020 winsemius et al 2016 although the focus of flood risk assessment often tends to be on the fluvial and pluvial floods ascott et al 2017 collins et al 2020 groundwater flooding can yield significant economic and social damages and disruptions such as sewer backups abboud et al 2018 morris et al 2018 roads and property inundation abboud et al 2018 keilholz et al 2015 morris et al 2018 soren 1976 foundation failures and corrosion colombo et al 2018 oyedele et al 2009 damages to underground structures and infrastructure gattinoni and scesi 2017 preene and fisher 2015 underground pollution transport gonzález quirós and fernández álvarez 2019 and crop damage booth et al 2016 this type of flood event refers to the groundwater emergence at the ground surface and the rising groundwater level into underground civil infrastructure macdonald et al 2012 macdonald et al 2008 unlike other types of floods groundwater flooding can be difficult to identify and assess kreibich et al 2009 mckenzie et al 2010 and traditional flood protection systems may not be effective yu et al 2019 similar to traditional flood risk management a large number of studies applies numerical modeling at different scales and with a varying degree of complexity to understand groundwater flood events abboud et al 2018 gonzález quirós and fernández álvarez 2019 morrissey et al 2020 yu et al 2019 these models are typically posed as forward problems which involve predicting error free model states based on a prior parameterization of the model tarantola 2005 one disadvantage in this type of strategy is that it requires specifying a variety of parameters which are impossible to characterize exhaustively zhou et al 2014 another drawback of forward problems is that once calibrated the model ignores the equifinality thesis beven and freer 2001 and the uncertainties which may imply to adopt strong and questionable assumptions about its forecast reliability di baldassarre et al 2010 consequently probability theory tools such as inverse methods helton et al 2004 kaipio and somersalo 2005 have evolved to address aleatory and epistemic uncertainties merz and thieken 2009 ross et al 2009 in contrast to forward models inverse methods were developed to support parameter identification and consequently to improve predictions zhou et al 2014 bayesian approaches solve inverse problems considering parameters as random variables and providing posterior probabilities by incorporating known data smith 2013 due to their inferential and predictive properties bayesian methods are considered one of the most appropriate techniques for uncertainty analysis heße et al 2019 in spite of the progress in the field of uncertainty quantification the temporal and spatial uncertainties of the models are often declared but not quantified in groundwater flooding studies a limited number of studies includes a formal quantification of the uncertainty colombo et al 2018 fürst et al 2015 jimenez martinez et al 2015 and to the best of the authors knowledge the explicit application of bayesian inference on groundwater flooding modeling remains unexplored flood risk mapping is a fundamental tool for flood risk management and communication demeritt and nobert 2014 henstra et al 2019 accordingly a lot of effort has been made to generate groundwater flood maps for planning damage assessment and insurance purposes morris et al 2018 maps of groundwater flooding susceptibility are regularly constructed on the basis of lumped parameter models upton and jackson 2011 or by analyzing geological and hydrogeological data british geological survey 2006 mancini et al 2020 yu et al 2019 recent studies employ this type of data with machine learning techniques to create spatially distributed maps of susceptibility to groundwater flood events allocca et al 2021 still the lack of probabilistic and inverse methods in groundwater flooding models has been transferred to the groundwater flooding imagery which often does not include formal likelihood quantification this partially occurs due to the computational challenge from distributed models and high dimensional inverse problems boyce and yeh 2014 merz and thieken 2009 xu et al 2017 zhou et al 2014 and to limitations derived from data quality and availability mckenzie et al 2010 merz and thieken 2009 morris et al 2018 alternatives to overcome these problems are the reduction of the dimension of the input parameter space bittner et al 2021 boyce and yeh 2014 erdal and cirpka 2019 mara et al 2017 stanko et al 2016 teixeira parente et al 2019 and the optimization of the problem design by changing the spatial and temporal scaling i e simulation period and model extension and resolution i e time and space discretization guillaume et al 2016 scheibe et al 2015 assembling these alternatives can be useful to assess groundwater flooding in a probabilistic manner as explained by teng et al 2017 and di baldassarre et al 2010 probabilistic flood risks maps are preferable to single deterministic maps of inundation because they acknowledge the inherent uncertainty in comparison to pluvial and fluvial flooding there is less detail for hazard and risk management in groundwater flood mapping morris et al 2018 as the demand for probabilistic maps in pluvial and fluvial flood risk analysis increases bhola et al 2020 teng et al 2017 the need for groundwater flooding analysis is not expected to behave differntly this study introduces a framework to recognize the susceptibility of residential property areas to groundwater flooding acknowledging the uncertainty in the model input parameters we aim to create mapping products with the estimation of the probability of groundwater flood inundations by targeting one groundwater flood event as the basis of the problem design we propose to decompose cell by cell the uncertainty and the sensitivity of a distributed groundwater numerical model to understand the spatial distribution and temporal variability of groundwater flood events the framework involves three components 1 elementary effects method to identify influential input factors and reduce the problem dimensionality 2 bayesian inference using the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream algorithm to estimate statistics of the relevant uncertain parameters and to quantify the output uncertainty incorporating evidence data and 3 exploration of the predictive posterior distributions to assess the susceptibility to groundwater flooding according to exceedance probability levels to demonstrate the relevance and feasibility of the application the framework is applied to evaluate a groundwater flood event that occurred in the valley of the alz river in germany in 2013 the event is simulated using a numerical model built on modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 the posterior probability distributions of the groundwater heads are then explored against groundwater depth thresholds and registered cellar depths 2 methods 2 1 groundwater flow equation groundwater flow in a heterogeneous unconfined aquifer can be described by coupling the continuity equation with darcy s law fetter 1999 such that 1 x k xx h x y k yy h y z k zz h z w s h t where h is the piezometric groundwater head l k xx k yy and k zz denote the hydraulic conductivity values lt 1 along the x y and z coordinate axes s is the specific storage l 1 and w represents the sources and sinks t 1 modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 solves the groundwater flow equation in a finite difference form the rate of change in storage within each cell is equal to the sum of flows into and out of the cell so that 2 q i s δ h δ t δ v where q i is the i component of the flow rate into the cell l3t 1 δ v is the cell volume l3 and δ h l is the change in the groundwater head over a time interval δ t t external sources or stressors such as the infiltration into the saturated zone and the river aquifer fluxes can be represented as q i elements hence the forward problem is driven to predict the groundwater head distributions at successive times as a function of an uncertain set of model inputs θ i e uncertain parameters source terms initial or boundary conditions 2 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is used to quantify how the uncertainty in the output of a model can be apportioned to the different uncertainties in the model inputs saltelli 2002 smith 2013 we use the elementary effects method also known as morris method to identify the sensitive parameters through basic statistical moments campolongo et al 2007 morris 1991 due to its sampling strategy this technique is advantageous for quantifying the sensitivity in computationally expensive models with many uncertain inputs campolongo et al 2007 jaxa rozen and kwakkel 2018 smith 2013 in our research the purpose of its application is to identify which input factors are non influential and therefore negligible as well as to recognize the input factors that are non linear or involved in interactions those input factors that are non influential are fixed to reduce the problem dimensionality which is an essential step to define an affordable experimental design and proceed with the subsequent bayesian analysis the elementary effect method considers that each model input q q 1 q k varies across p selected levels forming a k dimensional p level finite grid of experimentation γ p then p represents the number of partitions of the model parameter space at which the model can be evaluated assuming that the input terms are scaled to the interval 0 1 the elementary effect associated with the input q i is defined as 3 d i q f q 1 q i 1 q i δ q i 1 q k f q δ f q δ e i f q δ with a jump size δ 1 p 1 1 1 p 1 and transformed point q δ e i where q q 1 q k is any selected value in γ p and e i is a vector of zeros with one in the i th component then d i q quantifies the local sensitivity behavior at the point q the global sensitivity measure requires to approximate the statistical moments from the associated finite dimensional distribution g i by randomly sampling q from the grid points in γ p morris 1991 proposed the mean μ i and the standard deviation σ i of the distribution g i by sampling m points these metrics associated with the i th parameter and j th samples can be expressed as 4 μ i 1 m j 1 m d i j q 5 σ i 1 m 1 j 1 m d i j q μ i 2 campolongo et al 2007 introduced an additional sensitivity metric μ to avoid the problems associated to non monotonic models that may contain effects with opposite signs this refined version estimates the mean of the absolute values of the elementary effects and can be written as 6 μ i 1 m j 1 m d i j q the elementary effects method proposes to construct μ i and σ i with m trajectories of k 1 points in the input space which provide k elementary effects the total number of realizations is defined by k 1 m the sampling strategy employs the orientation matrix b to obtain random samples from g i so that 7 b j k 1 1 q δ 2 2 b j k 1 k d j k 1 k p where q is a random initial point j k 1 k is a k 1 k matrix of ones b is a k 1 k strictly lower triangular matrix of ones d is a k k diagonal matrix formed by randomly chosen elements from the set 1 1 and p is a k k random permutation matrix 2 3 bayesian inference and sampling algorithm 2 3 1 bayesian inference bayesian inference is derived from the bayes theorem to explicitly introduce in the analysis assumptions about evidence data and prior knowledge of the model inputs box and tiao 2011 smith 2013 let y represent a given set of observations or evidence data and θ denote a set of parameters following the bayesian formulation the posterior probability of the parameter set p θ y can be obtained with the prior probability of the parameter set p θ the observed data p y and the likelihood function p y θ l θ y such that 8 p θ y p y θ p θ p y given that all statistical inferences of p θ y can be made from the unnormalized density p y can be omitted vrugt 2016 and the bayes equation is simplified as 9 p θ y l θ y p θ l θ y summarizes the distance between the observation and the simulated quantity of interest groundwater heads for the sake of our research our formulation of the bayesian inference problem assumes that the error residuals are homoscedastic and normally distributed ε t n 0 σ 2 and it employs the log likelihood l θ y for numerical stability vrugt 2016 then considering n vector of error residuals at times t s 1 n the log likelihood function applied in this study can be written as 10 ℒ θ y n 2 log t s 1 n ε t θ 2 for further debate about mathematical definitions of the likelihood function and details in their derivation process we refer the readers to the corresponding literature kaipio and somersalo 2005 schoups and

of the posterior distribution of the parameter space the dream algorithm is an efficient mcmc based method it runs multiple chains of simulations simultaneously and adjusts the scale and orientation of the proposal distribution during the run candidate points are created by sampling the prior parameter distribution for each chain and the metropolis hastings ratio is used to decide if a candidate point is accepted or not the convergence of each chain is evaluated using the gelman rubin diagnostic gelman and rubin 1992 extensive theoretical descriptions of the dream algorithm implementation can be found in the literature houska et al 2015 vrugt 2016 vrugt et al 2009 2008 vrugt and ter braak 2011 2 4 exceedance probability and susceptibility maps the final step of the framework involves extracting information from the posterior distributions of the groundwater heads at each element of the model and at different time steps to analyze the spatial and temporal conditions of the event we characterize the associated groundwater flooding risk by computing the probability of the groundwater table of exceeding a certain threshold value i e exceedance probability for convenience this can be explained from the cumulative distribution function of the predicted groundwater heads f h for f r 0 1 that can be described by 11 f h p h h the exceedance probability p can then be estimated with the complementary cumulative distribution function of eq 11 expressed as 12 p p h h 1 f h consequently we create the maps of susceptibility to groundwater flooding considering the probability p i j t of exceeding a threshold k i j computed at the time step t t 1 t n and the discrete point i 1 n c and j 1 n r where n c and n r are respectively the number of columns and rows used for the spatial discretization thus 13 p i j t 1 f i j t k i j we propose two types of thresholds in this work the first one is the groundwater depth threshold κ i j which represents a specified distance d between the surface elevation and the groundwater table at the cell i j hence it can be defined according to a two dimensional array of a digital elevation model t i j that is 14 κ i j t i j d the second threshold is defined according to the cellar depths κ i j at a specific house property or building hence κ i j is the reported depth of the underground infrastructure located at the cell i j therefore k i j can be equal to κ i j or κ i j depending on the assessment 2 5 practical application 2 5 1 case study the study area is located in southeastern bavaria germany during heavy rainfall events at the beginning of june 2013 the region was affected by flood events that caused several damages in the residential properties disse et al 2015 keilholz et al 2015 the study region is characterized by an unconsolidated shallow sedimentary aquifer formed by gravels and sands doppler et al 2011 keilholz et al 2015 merchán rivera et al 2018 the groundwater flow is very dynamic due to the high permeability of the porous material of the aquifer the relatively rapid groundwater recharge and the hydraulic connection with the alz river and the alz canal the flood event in 2013 in the alz river valley and the hydrogeological features of the region were the subjects of previous studies doppler et al 2011 and bayerisches landesamt für umwelt 2017 describe the geological properties and the morphological features of the valley further studies also estimate the uncertainty in the discharge and stage of the alz river willems 2011 willems and stricker 2012 and quantify the propagation of uncertainty due to the representation of the river boundary conditions merchán rivera et al 2021 fig 1 includes details of the study area and the flood event 2 5 2 model description a two dimensional model was built using modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 to describe the event the model simulates 300 stress periods at intervals of six hours to cover a total of 75 days from may 02 2013 to july 15 2013 the spatial discretization is a finite difference grid formed by one layer 260 rows and 260 columns the initial and boundary conditions were defined based on the preexisting regional model built by keilholz 2015 three types of boundary conditions are used in the model 1 specified head boundaries using time variant specified head package harbaugh et al 2000 leake and prudic 1991 to simulate the variation in the water table at the borders of the domain 2 recharge into the saturated zone using the recharge package harbaugh 2005 harbaugh et al 2000 to simulate the distributed infiltration flux and 3 river interactions using the river package harbaugh 2005 harbaugh et al 2000 to simulate the interaction between the streams and the aquifer the spatial distribution of the specified head and river boundaries are illustrated in fig 1a given that the initial conditions of the groundwater heads and the specified head boundaries were extracted from the regional model keilholz et al 2015 which include a larger simulation period there was no need to include a warm up period three hydraulic conductivity values k a k b and k c are defined based on the geological studies bayerisches landesamt für umwelt 2017 doppler et al 2011 and accordingly three specific storage values s a s b and s c and three specific yield values γ a γ b and γ c these parameters were assumed to be homogeneous within each soil section sa sb and sc recharge into the saturated zone values q i j t are defined according to the deterministic estimations from the hydrological model made by keilholz et al 2015 finally the streams are parameterized considering two streambed conductance values for the canal c 1 and c 2 three streambed conductance values for the river r 1 r 2 and r 3 which are outlined according to observed differences in the morphology of the streams and stream stage values ξ i j t based on the previous estimations made by merchán rivera et al 2021 groundwater field measurements were registered every six hours during the simulation period in four groundwater monitoring wells alzpitz b1 b3 and b4 keilholz et al 2015 these observations were used as the evidence for the bayesian inference although we computed the hydraulic head values for the entire simulation period we chose four simulation time steps to be representative of different phases of the event to present the results before the event at stress period 86 may 23 2013 peak flow at stress period 127 june 02 2013 recession phase at stress period 145 june 07 2013 and after the flood event at stress period 290 july 13 2013 we define the recession phase as the stage that immediately follows the peak flow whereas after the event refers to the phase where the declining period has ended these separate periods were used along with the results and discussion to understand the temporal variation of the outcomes fig 1 includes details of the study the model settings and the digital elevation model 2 5 3 scheme implementation the hydraulic properties are summarized in table 1 where u a b denotes the prior belief distributed uniformly between a and b except for q i j t and ξ i j t the uncertainty analysis considers the parameters as random variables that are simply sampled from a uniform distribution and used in the realizations of the scheme the choice to set the prior beliefs to be uniform i e non informative is a conservative assumption at costs of computational efficiency in practice this means that we need a larger sample size to obtain better estimates of the posterior distribution during bayesian inversion more informative prior distributions would require a smaller sample size to reach a similar precision note that the sampling strategy in the elementary effect method should be modified if non uniform distributions are considered feng et al 2019 the recharge influx into the saturated zone q i j t is spatially distributed over the domain and varies at every stress period t of the simulation keilholz et al 2015 estimated deterministic values for recharge into the saturated zone q i j t in a regional hydrologic model using mike she dhi 2013 in our research the uncertainty in these recharge values is introduced as a single multiplier r for all the grid cells affected by recharge at all time steps similarly to the approach employed by mustafa et al 2018 hence the random variable r u a b is used in combination with q i j t to obtain the corrected spatial distributed recharge q i j t such that 15 q i j t q i j t r similarly keilholz et al 2015 provided scatter stage information for the river and the canal these scatter data were post processed by merchán rivera et al 2021 to obtain the stream head ξ i j t at every cell that represents the river and the canal hence the streams are represented as time variant and spatially distributed inputs the uncertainty in the stage is included by the error ψ u a b where the bounds a and b are approximated according to the works by willems 2011 and willems and stricker 2012 this means that ψ increases or reduces the stream stage ξ i j t for all of the stress periods t at each cell i j that represent the streams to obtain 16 ξ i j t ξ i j t ψ the implementation of the elementary effects considers all parameters mentioned in table 1 as input factors given that the values of p and m are primarily an experimental choice saltelli et al 2004 we performed an extensive exploration of different factor levels and sampling size by constructing various experimental combinations using p 4 6 8 and 10 and m 10 20 and 30 the elementary effects approach reduces the dimensionality of our problem and provide a list of influential factors that are later used in the bayesian inversion with the dream algorithm the posterior distributions are calculated from the last 50 of the samples generated with the dream algorithm from 10 000 realization we explore the posterior predictive distributions of the groundwater heads at every element of the domain and every stress period to compute the threshold κ i j we define t i j with the digital elevation model dem of the region bayerisches landesamt für umwelt 2017 and the groundwater depth d to be equal to 0 5 and 1 5 note that d values are arbitrarily selected and they can simply be modified once the posterior predictive distributions are quantified the dem resolution is 5 5 m cell size finally we define the threshold κ i j using the cellar depth records from the household survey run by disse et al 2015 in april 2014 κ h 1 459 0 m a s l above sea level κ h 2 458 6 m a s l κ h 3 459 4 m a s l κ h 4 461 1 m a s l κ h 5 460 1 m a s l κ h 6 461 0 m a s l κ h 7 460 3 m a s l we employ the salib python library herman and usher 2017 to compute the elementary effect indices with the efficient sampling strategy introduced by campolongo et al 2007 the dream algorithm was implemented using the spotpy framework houska et al 2015 the probability maps in the results were created by arranging the output data in matrix arrays using the numpy library harris et al 2020 and plotting them with the matplotlib library hunter 2007 in python 3 the algorithm for implementing the exposed approach was written in python 3 and the files are available in the research dataset merchán rivera 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis based on the values of μ we obtain a ranking of model sensitivity that can be easily interpreted see fig 2 a high absolute measure of central tendency μ denotes an input with a significant overall influence on the output hence the most sensitive parameters are k a k b γ a r c 2 and r 2 also there are spatial and temporal variabilities in the results of the elementary effects the positions in the ranking change depending on the location and the phase of the event we observe higher values of the elementary effects metrics at the peak flow similarly we can see more significant differences between the minimum and maximum values of μ at this phase the spatial variation in the sensitivity of the recharge multiplier r occurs due to the heterogeneous distribution of the recharge into the saturated zone q i j t the parameters that describe the streams c 1 c 2 r 1 r 2 r 3 and ψ gain relevance close to the streams at the monitoring wells alzpitz and b3 the sensitivity of the canal conductance c 2 is also large at b1 and h1 the second sensitivity measure that we obtain is the spread σ a high value of σ indicates input factors with a non linear effect in the model output the existence of parameter interactions or both the ratio σ μ is an indicator of model linearity if σ μ 0 or non linearity if σ μ 0 also this indicator can occasionally give evidence of monotonic and non monotonic model responses when 0 σ μ 0 5 and σ μ 0 5 respectively garcia sanchez et al 2014 in fig 3 we display all the outcomes of μ and σ from every combination of p and m and classify them based on the event phase in a scatter plot overall the model behavior is subject of non linearities non monotonicities or interactions between model parameters the results also show temporal variation in this behavior while the functional relationships between the input factors and the outputs are highly non linear interactive or non monotonic during the peak and the recession phase the relationships tend to reduce these qualities before and after the event non monotonic responses can occur with respect to the input factors associated to the hydraulic conductivity particularly k a and k b the effect of the parameter interactions can increase due to the increased influx from the high staged river seen in the peak flow and the recession phase which would also influence the non monotonicity from k a and k b notice that the non linearity of the model responses is not affected directly by variations in the influx from the streams and the recharge but by the effect that these have on the hydraulic gradient magnitude five parameters can be considered non influential factors k c s a s b s c and γ c as expected the specific storage values are negligible because we study an unconfined aquifer and their contribution to the storativity is orders of magnitude lower than the specific yield in the case of k c and γ c the low values of μ are determined by the spatial location of the soil type sc hence these five parameters are fixed to reduce the problem dimensionality for the bayesian inversion from 16 to 11 calibration parameters even if a further reduction of the parameter space could be assumed and be quite useful for the application of the bayesian inversion we want to retain the properties of the original model for the scope of the study at the cost of higher computational demand 3 2 bayesian inversion in fig 4 we can observe the prior and posterior discrete distributions of the sensitive parameters these results show that the algorithm updated the distributions of the sensitive parameters reducing their uncertainty we also observe that most of the parameters tend to unimodality except ψ whose posterior distribution is only slightly updated in comparison to the prior distribution this can be reasonably explained by the sensitivity analysis that shows low scores for this parameter the statistical moments of the posterior distribution of the uncertain parameters can be found in table 2 the expected values of the conductance from the river sections r 1 and r 2 range within the same order of magnitude the latter suggests that the bed conductance of the river may be overparameterized considering the location of the observation wells used for the inversion given these results and the outcomes of the sensitivity analysis an additional reduction of the model dimensionality could be possible by grouping r 1 and r 2 in one parameter we observe a high frequency of samples in the lower end of r that reduces the revised infiltration q i j t used in the model evaluations this implies that the deterministic values of the infiltration into the saturated zone extracted from the regional model q i j t do not represent accurate the system whether by overestimating the inflow rates or the recharge extension this remarks the importance of quantifying the uncertainty in the analysis of risk of these events still note that r and ψ are random variables that aim to catch the uncertainty in model parameters that are fundamentally transient recharge into the saturated zone q i j t and river stage ξ i j t this means that a single random sample per evaluation may not exhaustively capture the temporal variability and the uncertainty of these parameters also it is important to point out that the bayesian approach relies in the information fed by the empirical evidence therefore the location of the observation wells plays a fundamental role some parameters may not be adequately represented due to the location of the monitoring wells such as r c 1 r 1 and r 3 the reduction of the model parametric uncertainty is evident after taking into consideration the observed data with the bayesian approach see table 3 and fig 5 in fig 5 we can see the probability distribution of the groundwater heads considering the prior and posterior distribution of the sensitive parameters a lower standard deviation σ o in the hydraulic head distribution indicates that the values tend to be close to the central tendency metric μ o see table 3 fig 5 shows the approximation of the probability density function of the groundwater heads from the prior and the posterior predictive simulations at different locations and different phases of the event the kernel density plot was calculated using scott s rule scott 2010 over the finite output data of the groundwater heads located at the different monitoring wells this plot is helpful to identify the position and relative amplitude of the density distributions and to recognize if the distribution is multimodal the groundwater heads at alzpitz located immediately next to the river display a bimodal distribution with the parameterization of the model using the prior distribution of the parameters this distribution is later updated with the posterior to a unimodal distribution the spread of the groundwater heads is evidence of significant uncertainty in the prior beliefs which is driven by the interconnection with the river especially during the peak flow discharges the interquartile range between the first and third quartile q3 q1 range shows the variability around the median of 50 of the predictive values of the groundwater heads using the prior distribution of the parameters we see that the q3 q1 range is larger than one meter at alzpitz and b3 for the model considering the prior distribution of the parameters lastly we can observe the skewness of the prior predictive distributions which depict positive asymmetry about their mean fig 6 shows the final results of the predictive groundwater heads after applying the bayesian inference we use the mean and the interval μ o σ o μ o σ o of the predictive posterior distribution as a measure of the uncertainty we observe that these metrics properly capture the observations particularly in the wells alzpitz and b3 at b4 the predictive uncertainty does not include the peak observations also we observe disagreements in the responses at b1 that may occur due to the influence of the southern time variant specified heads boundary conditions 3 3 probability maps the bayesian approach allows us to study groundwater flood events considering the posterior distribution of the groundwater levels which can be used for subsequent analysis such as transport modeling scenario modeling or assembling more complex model structures in our case the posterior distributions at every cell of the domain can be used to create probability maps of susceptibility to groundwater flooding based on limit exceedances we present two types of maps in this section the first one is a distributed map based on the water depth levels in relation to the topographic level figs 7 and 8 the second type is a graduated symbol map where the size of the circles indicates the probability of exceedance given the depth of a specific house cellar fig 9 figs 7 and 8 show the probability of having groundwater tables rising at the defined thresholds κ i j d 1 5 and κ i j d 0 5 respectively the maps include the outcomes of simulations with the prior uncertainty figs 7a and 8a and the revised uncertainty from the bayesian inversion figs 7b and 8b areas with a low probability of exceedance are reduced in the maps built with the posterior distributions thanks to the reduced variability in the sensitive parameters many zones are highly susceptible to groundwater flooding even before and after the peak flow this agrees with reports of cellar inundations out of the peak flow event and the high groundwater levels that can also be observed during non flood seasons bayerisches landesamt für umwelt 2020 the heavy precipitation at the end of may and the beginning of june 2013 between stress period 115 and stress period 130 could have been the inundation catalyst but the results show a high groundwater table at every phase of the event regardless of the heavy rainfall indeed initial conditions such as soil saturation before the event can influence recharge from rainfall the underground infrastructure and properties can hence be exposed during longer periods to groundwater flooding and not only during specific hydrological events the uncertainty in the soil saturation parametrized using the recharge multiplier in this study is essential because the occurrence duration and severity of groundwater flooding will be determined by both the antecedent water table and groundwater recharge rate during the peak flow and the recession phase the probability of having groundwater depths above 1 5 m reaches maximum values this shows the relatively slow decrease in the hydraulic head in the recession phase in comparison with fluvial floods groundwater flooding can last for an extended period and infrastructure and property damage can be associated with long lasting exposure by comparing the outcomes from prior and posterior evaluations we observe cells where the prior beliefs overestimate the exceedance probabilities while others underestimate them in such cases preconceptions based on one single forward simulation could be misleading maps over the basis of a distributed model help to avoid such biases and identify spatial responses that may be overlooked otherwise also creating the maps with a bayesian approach increases the spatial confidence of the groundwater flooding susceptibility we mainly assign this improvement to the updated posterior distributions of the hydraulic conductivity k a and k b which are very sensitive parameters and describe the ability of the material to transmit the fluid through the pore space within significant regions of the domain comparing figs 7 and 8 we can observe that the choice in the threshold value d is very important for the delineation of the areas affected by groundwater flooding hence it should be carefully chosen according to site specific problematics or different values of d should be investigated to have a clear picture of the possibly inundated areas based on the household survey we define the threshold κ i j at different residential properties and the resulting maps can be observed in fig 9 the properties selected in this analysis are far enough from the boundary conditions such that they are not influenced by the time variant specified heads we observe that the probability of reaching the cellar depth is unrelated to the distance to the river see probabilities of building h2 and h3 given the high groundwater table of the simulated period it is very likely to reach the cellar depths at h1 h2 h3 and h6 even before and after the peak event the probability of groundwater levels reaching the cellar is higher at the recession phase at h2 h5 h6 and h7 these results may imply a delayed propagation of the flood wave from the river into the aquifer a drawback of the presented scheme is the memory requirement to store the element wise data to construct the probability density functions still in practice it is possible to cluster the output data in relation to their spatial and temporal relevance and build maps of smaller regions this means once the zones and periods of major importance are identified there is no need to keep in memory the simulation data that is out of the cluster the presented results are obtained from a groundwater flow model that evaluates one actual event which involves a relatively short timeframe of simulation compared to mapping products that measure susceptibility to groundwater flooding from the description of the return period however the approach can be easily extended considering appropriate design parameters e g changing the return period of the precipitation event of the peak river discharge and or of the volume of the event this single event approach could be informative for industries property managers or insurance companies to evaluate the susceptibility to groundwater flooding of underground structures 4 conclusions the broad implication of this research is the presentation of a bayesian based framework to create probability maps of susceptibility to groundwater flooding in order to incorporate the parameter uncertainties in the risk imagery the scheme proposes to break down the uncertainty and sensitivity of one flood event into spatial and temporal terms and compute the statistics of interest at each domain element the elementary effects method is used to reduce the problem dimensionality by quantifying the model sensitivity with a relatively low number of model evaluations we use the dream algorithm as an mcmc based technique to estimate the posterior distributions of the relevant uncertain parameters and reduce the uncertainty in the predicted groundwater heads finally we propose to explore the posterior probability distribution of the groundwater heads to compute the exceedance probability based on the groundwater depths and cellar depths two types of maps are created to describe the susceptibility to groundwater flooding a distributed map using the groundwater depth threshold and a graduated symbol map given the depth of a specific house cellar the approach is illustrated with an application in a numerical model that describes the groundwater flood event in the alz river valley in 2013 we are able to increase the spatial confidence of the results thanks to the reduction in the uncertainty during the inference process by using a relatively large temporal scale we are able to employ accurate temporal resolutions to detect the exposure to groundwater inundation at particular properties and areas the framework can be applied over one flood event and this may be considered a promising aspect due to the reduced amount of data and the low computational demand the posterior probabilities of the groundwater head and the exceedance evaluation help us distinguish highly exposed zones from those exposed only during peak flow and the recession phase this is relevant in practical applications because definitions of the susceptible zones can be easily constructed from a probabilistic perspective and the accuracy of the simulations can be updated with new evidence data in addition these findings provide additional information about the incidence of groundwater flooding beyond the flood season in this specific case study the results indicate that infrastructure and property can be long lastingly exposed to inundation hazards finally we stress the importance of opting for a bayesian approach to understand groundwater flood events and create risk imagery the temporal and spatial nature of groundwater flow confirms that the problem can be presented from a different perspective than the view of traditional flood events besides the exposure of the assets groundwater flooding risk depends on temporal and spatial details from hydrological climatic and geomorphological elements ultimately this level of detail makes flood mapping the crucial tool for flood risk management employed by a wide variety of partakers such as planners developers insurance companies and property owners but it is not possible to characterize the hydrogeological systems in such detail without being affected by uncertainty and an explicit quantification is therefore required probability maps built over inverse methods can be relevant not only for incorporating the uncertainty and improving the reliability of the model but also for the accuracy of the message that is transmitted to different actors credit authorship contribution statement pablo merchán rivera conceptualization methodology software formal analysis investigation

3319,precipitation gauges are critical for assessing precipitation measurements at regional and global scales and are often used to adjust precipitation estimates from other instruments such as satellites however gauge measured precipitation is affected by gauge undercatch that is often larger for solid precipitation in the present work two popular gauge undercatch correction factors cfs were compared one utilizes a dynamic correction model and is used in the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc monitoring product and the other one employs fixed monthly climatologies and is used in the global precipitation climatology project gpcp product how the choice of cfs impacts the total precipitation estimates was quantified over land at seasonal annual regional and global scales the cfs were also compared as a function of the environmental variables used in their development such as near surface air temperature relative humidity and wind speed results showed that the annual precipitation estimate from gauges with no correction can be biased by 9 61 over the global land excluding antarctica although it varied depending on the season from 6 80 in boreal summer to more than 12 33 in boreal winter and the method used for gauge undercatch correction interannual variations of cfs can be large so the use of the fixed climatology cfs requires caution given their magnitudes and differences choosing appropriate cfs has important implications in refining the water and energy budget calculations keywords gauge undercatch global precipitation gpcc legates fuchs water balance 1 introduction precipitation is an essential component of the hydrological cycle and accurate quantification of precipitation is crucial for scientific commercial and operational applications arabzadeh et al 2020 ehsani et al 2021b 2022 kirschbaum et al 2017 tapiador et al 2012 at the global scale precipitation observations are often obtained from satellites or gauges each offering its strengths and weaknesses adler et al 2012 2003 becker et al 2013 song et al 2021 strangeways 2006 sun et al 2018 satellites provide global coverage but often have a relatively poor performance in capturing precipitation rates over snow and ice surfaces adhikari et al 2020 cao and liang 2018 ehsani et al 2021a kidd et al 2012 liu et al 2019 and for orographic precipitation in mountainous regions shige et al 2013 precipitation gauges are critically important as they often serve as a reference to evaluate and develop other precipitation products however gauges are often sparse and topographically biased towards lower altitudes in mountainous regions in addition the ability of a gauge to measure precipitation accurately varies as a function of the gauge characteristics such as height and shape the orifice size the material with which the gauge is constructed presence and type of a windshield and so on adam and lettenmaier 2003 ehsani and behrangi 2021 legates 1995 legates and bogart 2009 precipitation measurement errors can be divided into two main categories systematic and random random errors include human errors such as inaccurate measurements and a partial total blockage of the gauge inlet due to the presence of trees random errors increase decrease the measured precipitation and are difficult to correct systematic errors are related to how accurately gauge catch approximates actual precipitation and can be subdivided into catching and counting errors since the nineteenth century wind has been recognized as the largest cause of the catching error in precipitation measurements larson and peck 1974 the wind induced error depends on the outer shape of the gauge body wind speed precipitation type solid liquid droplet size distribution precipitation intensity and the presence and type of windshield systematic errors in precipitation gauge measurements can also arise from wetting on the internal walls of the gauge gauge evaporation splashing into out of the gauge and blowing snow counting errors are due to the measuring principle e g weighing and tipping bucket mechanism sevruk 1982 due to systematic biases gauge measured precipitation often underestimates actual precipitation these biases are relatively small i e 4 10 for liquid precipitation cauteruccio et al 2021 pollock et al 2018 but tend to be significantly larger for solid precipitation and can exceed 90 of the total precipitation fassnacht 2004 groisman and legates 1994 grossi et al 2017 hirabayashi et al 2008 jimeno sáez et al 2020 koehler 2019 sevruk et al 2009 yang et al 2005 therefore using appropriate correction methods to mitigate precipitation undercatch has a crucial impact on the accuracy of precipitation measurement at regional and global scales gridded precipitation products that interpolate precipitation data from gauges should be corrected for systematic biases ungersböck et al 2001 two popular correction factors cfs currently used in the global precipitation products are legates correction factors cf l utilized in the global precipitation climatology project gpcp adler et al 2018 adler et al 2003 huffman et al 2009 huffman et al 2020 and fuchs correction factors cf f used in the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc monitoring product schneider et al 2017 2014 rustemeier elke et al 2020 both gpcp and gpcc are widely used by researchers for scientific analysis and development of other precipitation products for example gpcp is used at a monthly scale to bias adjust persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 within 60 s n and the integrated multi satellie retrievals for gpm imerg huffman et al 2020 over land and high latitude oceans gpcc is also widely used for global and regional water balance studies assessment of remote sensing precipitation products raziei et al 2015 2011 2010 sarmadi and shokoohi 2015 wang et al 2017a wang et al 2017b wei et al 2019 and verification of numerical models ajaaj et al 2016 basheer and elagib 2019 chen et al 2014 nicholson et al 2003 prakash et al 2015 prakash et al 2011 therefore comparing two cfs and quantifying how they affect precipitation estimates are significantly important legates and willmott 1990 developed a monthly correction factor i e cf l to compensate for the systematic gauge measurement errors however cf l has several issues including 1 most of the data used for the development of cf l were observed between 1920 and 1980 so the climatology was largely representative of those 60 years 2 the compiled station network in arid mountainous and polar regions was not dense 3 the quality of the gauge correction factors depends on information about the gauge types and installation specifics which were possibly obsolete in the early 1980s and 4 fixed monthly meteorological parameters wind velocity solid liquid ratio etc can lead to over correction as high as 200 in some cases goodison et al 1998 therefore it was essential to develop and implement an improved correction method rubel et al 2000 rubel and hantel 1999 2001 efforts such as the development of a new catalog for standard precipitation gauges by the world meteorological organization wmo e g gauge types windshield usage and gauge rim height refinement of the correction terms for evaporation and wetting errors and improvement of the daily precipitation intensity derivative algorithm from synoptic reports originally developed by rubel and hantel 1999 eventually led to another correction method commonly referred to as the fuchs method i e cf f cf f uses a dynamic correction model førland and hanssen bauer 2000 rubel and hantel 1999 and employs different synoptic observations such as near surface air temperature t relative humidity h precipitation rate p and wind speed w both cf l and cf f use climatology correction for evaporation and wetting loss biases similarly none of them correct gauge undercatch for blowing snow which is important for the wind loss adjustment in polar regions however there are differences between the two methods specifically in estimating wind induced bias and determination of precipitation phase cf l uses rough climatology estimates of the meteorological parameters wind velocity ratio of solid liquid precipitation while cf f estimates necessary parameters based on synoptic observations which are routinely exchanged via the global telecommunication system gts of the wmo for the precipitation phase cf l uses an empirical relationship at the monthly time scale while cf f uses an event based combination of relative humidity and air temperature that has a much closer relation to the precipitation phase sims and liu 2015 this is specifically important because the correction factors for liquid and solid precipitation differ significantly cf l categorizes gauges based on three bias influencing criteria the orifice area whether the gauge was equipped with a shield and the height of the orifice above the ground and infers gauge type for countries where this information was not available cf l uses this information to empirically estimate a few parameters and consequently cfs on the other hand cf f collects information about the gauges e g gauge type presence absence of windshield and gauge rim height from many countries and estimates required parameters more accurately details of the cf l and cf f methods are discussed in legates and willmott 1990 and fuchs et al 2001 respectively since precipitation gauges are often the only observational source for precipitation measurement assessment of the cfs is very challenging projects such as the wmo solid precipitation intercomparison experiment spice 2013 2016 are valuable to assess bias correction of precipitation gauges but they cover only limited areas for a limited time and certain gauge types kochendorfer et al 2017 2020 rasmussen et al 2012 smith et al 2020 by focusing on frozen regions in the northern hemisphere behrangi et al 2018a b used mass change observation from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace to estimate monthly and seasonal snow accumulation through the water budget equation they calculated snow accumulations from the mass balance to assess cf f and cf l and found that cf f is more consistent with the precipitation accumulations calculated using grace observations behrangi et al 2019 reported similar results by performing an annual water budget analysis over several arctic basins using streamflow observations although both studies suggested that cf f is preferred over cf l in most high latitude regions panahi and behrangi 2020 showed that in some cases the use of cf f may result in overestimation of snowfall over the northern part of the united states based on the comparison with the university of arizona snow water equivalent ua swe product zeng et al 2018 while additional studies are required to evaluate cfs in different regions the present study quantifies how the choice of cfs impacts the total precipitation estimates over land at annual seasonal regional and global scales the analysis investigates the relationship between cfs and synoptic variables to better understand how the differences between the cfs are related to environmental conditions such as t h p and w 2 datasets and methodology 2 1 gpcc precipitation products gpcc was established in 1989 at the request of the wmo it is operated by deutscher wetterdienst dwd national meteorological service of germany and contributes to the world climate research program wcrp gpcc provides gridded maps of monthly and daily precipitation over land except antarctica based on in situ precipitation gauges in this study the latest gpcc monthly monitoring and full data products gpcc v2020 schneider et al 2020 were used also the previous version of the gpcc monthly full data product gpcc v2018 schneider et al 2018 was used to assess changes in precipitation amount between the two versions gpcc products are available at https opendata dwd de climate environment gpcc 2 2 legates correction factor cf l using traditional land based gauge measurements and shipboard estimates legates and willmott 1990 developed a global climatology of mean monthly precipitation the dataset includes 24 635 spatially independent terrestrial stations and 2 223 oceanic grid point records from 1920 to 1980 legates method can be used to correct gauge induced biases and remove systematic measurement errors due to wind wetting on the inner walls of the gauge and gauge evaporation fixed monthly cf ls are available at 1 resolution from https opendata dwd de climate environment gpcc legates 2 3 fuchs correction factor cf f fuchs s correction method is based on a dynamic correction model explained by førland and hanssen bauer 2000 and rubel and hantel 1999 originally developed for gauges in european countries that participated in the baltic sea experiment baltex of the global energy and water cycle experiment gewex the method uses synoptic observation of environmental variables i e wind speed at the gauge rim air temperature relative humidity and precipitation phase and intensity to calculate correction factors the corrections include wind induced losses and climatological correction for evaporation and wetting loss the fuchs cfs are provided as a field in the gpcc monthly monitoring product 2 4 era5 global reanalysis era5 is the latest generation of european center for medium range weather forecasting ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis era5 is available from 1950 onward and replaces the era interim reanalysis hersbach et al 2019 it uses 4d var data assimilation using cycle 41r2 of the integrated forecasting system ifs in the present work environmental variables at 0 25 spatial resolution were obtained from https cds climate copernicus eu cdsapp dataset reanalysis era5 single levels monthly means 2 5 methodology in the present study two gauge undercatch cfs were applied to the gpcc monthly full data products gpcc v2020 for the study period 1982 2019 fixed monthly cf l were compared to dynamic monthly cf f geographically and zonally for all seasons then annual and seasonal precipitation rates using the two correction methods were quantified and compared on a global scale and in several regions in addition synoptic variables i e t h w from era5 were used to analyze cfs and their differences due to environmental conditions also cfs and their differences were studied as a function of the joint distribution of synoptic variables the analyses were performed only over continental land areas where both cfs are available finally gpcc precipitation estimates before and after applying correction factors were evaluated against spice sites that covered various regions and climates in an attempt to give a more definitive analysis of the true uncertainty of cfs 3 results and discussion 3 1 differences between cf f and cf l fig 1 shows the zonal average of seasonal cf f and cf l i e the average of cfs for each latitude in each season investigating the zonal averages reveals how cfs change with latitude in these plots the blue line represents cf l since cf l provides a fixed map for each month there are no variations in the seasonal values of cf l in different years on the other hand cf f that is shown with the orange line is a dynamic cf i e cf value depends on synoptic conditions therefore in addition to the long term average i e orange line the variation in the study period i e 1982 2019 is shown with the orange shade fig 1 shows that 1 there is a good agreement between cf l and cf f within 45 s n in all seasons i e the zonal averages of cf f and cf l almost overlap 2 variations of cf f are relatively small within 30 s 70 n and 3 the zonal average of cf f is larger than that of cf l poleward of 60 n in djf and mam and poleward of 70 n in son on the other hand cf l suggests larger cfs poleward of 50 s for all seasons except jja the relative difference of the zonal average of seasonal cfs i e 100 cf f c f l cf l is plotted in fig 2 a which confirms the consistency of the two cfs within 45 s n fig 2a also shows that the relative difference between cf f and cf l exceeds 30 around 80 n in winter the larger cfs and the difference between cf l and cf f in higher latitudes and especially during the cold seasons figs 1 and 2a implies that cfs are often larger for snowfall than rainfall which is consistent with the earlier studies behrangi et al 2018a legates 1995 legates and bogart 2009 cf f also shows large variations from one year to another poleward of 30 s and 60 n in all seasons fig 1 in other words in higher latitudes cf f suggests large annual variations which are ignored when fixed monthly cf l is used i e cf l does not provide any information about annual variability this finding indicates that using cf f has the advantage of accounting for the annual variations of cfs in high latitudes fig 1 and fig 2 help to investigate the overall relationship between cfs however it is important to assess the spatial distribution of cfs and their relative differences geographically geographical maps of the seasonal cfs are shown in fig 3 separately for cf f and cf l along with the relative difference of the seasonal cfs i e 100 cf f c f l cf l fig 3 reveals that there are large regional variations in cfs that could not be fully explored in the zonal average plots both cf f and cf l report larger cfs in djf mam and son compared to jja in the northern hemisphere the seasonal relative difference of the cf f and cf l suggests that cf f has larger cfs in north america and alaska except for the coastal regions where precipitation rates are usually higher the western part of greenland and scattered regions in siberia himalaya south america australia and africa on the other hand cf l reports larger cfs in northern europe east siberia east asia and coastal regions in north america in the rest of the world and especially near the tropics the relative difference of the cfs lies within 5 in all seasons conversely in the higher latitudes the relative difference of cfs can exceed 50 in several regions especially in cold months when snowfall is the dominant precipitation type fig 3 also indicates that cf l is close to one over large areas in canada while cf f shows values larger than one that is expected in higher latitude we can also observe that over the northern part of the united states cf f is larger than cf l in all seasons except summer this is consistent with panahi and behrangi 2020 who also found that in very cold conditions the use of cf f may result in overestimation of snowfall accumulation finally over eurasia and especially in winter cf l is considerably larger than cf f mass change analysis using grace observations as well as the net surface water exchange analysis suggests that cf l is likely too high over this region behrangi et al 2018b behrangi et al 2019 3 2 analysis of the correction factors in multiple study areas due to the large regional differences between cfs seven regions shown in fig 4 were defined to further investigate the impact of cfs on the regional mean precipitation rates these regions include canada and alaska the continental united states us greenland tropics eurasia siberia and himalaya and higher latitudes poleward of 60 s in the southern hemisphere hereafter hsh to quantify the impact of cfs on precipitation estimates at both global and regional scales cfs were applied to gpcc v2020 and monthly mean precipitation rates were calculated for the global land except antarctica and the seven regions identified in fig 4 fig 5 shows the seasonal time series of the gpcc gpcc after applying cf l gpcc l and gpcc after applying cf f gpcc f for the global land the us hsh and eurasia the time series represents seasonal mean values but the reported unit is mm day in addition to the absolute values the ratio of gpcc l and gpcc f to gpcc i e gpcc f gpcc and gpcc l gpcc are plotted in separate panels for each region with the linear trendlines showing their evolution in time time series of the global mean precipitation rate fig 5a indicate that choosing cf l over cf f leads to higher mean global precipitation rates fig 5a over the us using cf f instead of cf l leads to larger values in djf and larger seasonal variations fig 5b on the other hand in eurasia fig 5d using cf l results in larger precipitation rates compared to cf f in hsh fig 5c gpcc f gpcc ratio shows an increasing trend since cf l has fixed cfs and no clear trend is observed in gpcc l gpcc ratio over the hsh the increasing trend in gpcc f gpcc ratio can directly be attributed to cf f increasing gpcc f gpcc ratio in these regions is probably related to the dynamic nature of cf f which can be affected by the changes in the environmental conditions i e t h and w due to the its static nature cf l does not follow increasing decreasing trends in climate variables in the past two decades there has been a significant trend in some climate variables in some regions of the world due to climate change and global warming ehsani et al 2020 a similar plot is provided for other regions specified in fig 4 canada and alaska tropics siberia and himalaya and greenland in the supplementary materials figure s1 3 3 correction factors as a function of environmental condition as discussed earlier cf f is based on a dynamic correction model that uses synoptic observations to derive correction factors for individual precipitation events on the other hand cf l is based on the global climatology of mean monthly precipitation at individual gauges the monthly t h and w from era5 for regions identified in this study fig 4 are plotted in figure s2 to further help the investigation of differences between cfs for the global land there is an increasing trend in t a decreasing trend in h and an increasing trend in w figure s2a the trend in the global land is similar to that observed in hsh and the tropics figure s2d and figure s2e the increasing gpcc f gpcc ratio observed in fig 5c and s1b is related to the trend in the environmental conditions in these regions these observations suggest that understanding the changes in gpcc f requires a more detailed analysis of synoptic data that could be a topic for future investigations however it is important to consider that cf f is calculated using synoptic station data for individual precipitation events so the analysis using era5 is not fully representative investigating how cfs behave as a function of environmental variables i e t h and w is insightful fig 6 shows the average values of cf f and cf l and their relative differences for the global land as a function of t h w elevation e and p sample counts in the bins are also shown in adjacent panels fig 6a indicates that both cf f and cf l increase as t decreases however for colder temperatures less than 10 c cf l remains almost constant this behavior can explain why cf f has larger cfs at higher latitudes and very cold regions in the northern contiguous united states fig 3 for temperatures colder than 10 c cf f can exceed cf l by 20 while at warmer temperatures both cfs have similar magnitudes both cfs increase as h increases up to 80 at which cf f shows its maximum value fig 6c cf f is also slightly higher than cf l for h less than 80 for higher h values cf l is larger than cf f while both cfs show a similar relationship to h as w increases up to 7 m s 1 both cfs increase however at higher wind speed e g greater than 10 m s 1 fig 6e both cfs decrease it is not exactly clear why at higher wind speed cfs are smaller but that might be due to the relatively low number of samples at the bins for w greater than 10 m s 1 fig 6f both cfs show similar behavior as a function of precipitation rate p as p increases cfs become smaller fig 6g larger cfs are needed for light precipitation rates because 1 precipitation can be more easily moved away from the gauge inlet 2 the wetting loss can lead to a remarkable error and 3 lighter precipitation tends to occur in higher latitudes where snowfall is more common in terms of e cf f generally exceeds cf l across all elevations also both cfs increase with elevation up to 3000 m and decrease in higher altitudes fig 6i this is probably due to the higher density of the gauges and less intense precipitation rates at lower altitudes in other words precipitation intensity influences the systematic measurement error higher precipitation intensity leads to lower correction factors to summarize fig 6 implies that differences between cfs can be linked to environmental conditions however attributing the behavior of cfs to only a single environmental variable may not be very effective therefore it should be insightful to analyze cfs as a function of two or more environmental variables for this purpose average cfs and their relative difference i e 100 c f f c f l c f l are plotted for the joint distribution of t h w e and p fig 7 fig 7 is insightful as it provides additional information on the more specific environmental conditions that lead to major differences between cf l and cf f fig 7 suggests that the differences between corrected and measured precipitation are larger for higher w and colder t and cf f provides larger cfs in such conditions it can also be observed that cf f is larger than cf l for colder t and light precipitation rates which is typical of high latitude and snowfall events fig 7 also shows that the combination of higher w and higher e corresponds to larger cfs for both methods however the relative difference between the cfs is the largest for higher w and lower e as well as lower w and higher e these are examples of environmental conditions leading to differences in cfs which should be investigated thoroughly in future studies 3 4 impacts of the correction factors on the measured precipitation quantifying how the choice of cfs impacts the measured precipitation amount is very important especially from the perspective of earth s water and energy budget analysis in addition bias correction of gauge observations is an essential step before using gauges for bias adjustment of remotely sensed precipitation products e g in gpcp and imerg hydrologic modeling verification of the model results and climate change studies fuchs et al 2001 table 1 shows the annual and seasonal global mean precipitation rates and associated standard deviation over global land excluding antarctica from gpcc v2020 gpcc l gpcc f and gpcc v2018 the values in parentheses display the mean and standard deviation of percent change in total precipitation compared to gpcc v2020 which has no gauge undercatch correction the results indicate that at the annual scale without using cf l the mean global daily precipitation rate can be underestimated by 9 61 while this value is 6 19 for cf f the analysis also indicates that there is only a slight difference between gpcc v2020 and gpcc v2018 at a global scale with a maximum difference of less than 0 16 in djf seasonal values of gpcc l and gpcc f indicate that both cf l and cf f have the largest increase in precipitation rates in djf 12 33 and 8 31 respectively and the least increase in jja 6 80 and 3 91 respectively which is consistent with fig 3 the increase in precipitation rate due to applying cfs is large previous studies have suggested that the global precipitation rate obtained from gpcp that uses cf l to correct gpcc needs to be increased by 5 rodell et al 2015 or higher stephens et al 2012 to balance the water and energy budget although the present analysis is only over land the large increase in gpcc precipitation rates by applying cfs and the relatively large differences between gpcc l and gpcc f suggest that the choice of cfs can significantly impact the understanding of earth system processes at regional and global scales precise knowledge of the surface energy fluxes and their imbalance affects our ability to understand how earth s climate responds to the increased concentrations of greenhouse gases by using cf f the annual increase in gpcc precipitation rate can be 3 4 less than that suggested by cf l over global land because cf f has a dynamic nature that utilizes synoptic variables and captures inter annual seasonal variabilities it is likely the preferred approach schneider et al 2017 however previous studies have shown that the accuracy of cf f and cf l can be region dependent behrangi et al 2019 behrangi et al 2018b behrangi et al 2018a panahi and behrangi 2020 the mean annual and seasonal precipitation change compared to gpcc v2020 was also investigated in the seven regions identified in this study figure s3 the results indicate that the increase in mean precipitation rate due to applying cfs is largest in greenland i e more than 40 and smallest in the tropics i e less than 5 which emphasizes the importance of using accurate cfs in high latitude regions 3 5 assessment of the correction factors against spice sites in this section gpcc data before and after applying correction factors were evaluated against precipitation data from spcie sites to assess the accuracy of the cfs across different climate regions for this purpose 7 participating sites operating the wmo double fence automated reference dfar were selected the locations and elevations of wmo spice sites are provided in table 2 and shown in figure s4 data for these gauges were available over two seasons 1 october 2015 to 30 april 2016 and 1 october 2016 to 30 april 2017 at the temporal resolution of 30 minutes data were then further processed to a monthly time scale to facilitate the cfs assessment for further information about the dataset please see smith et al 2020 smith et al 2019 the spice s focus is on measuring solid precipitation gpcc monthly precipitation data was converted into solid precipitation using the proportion of solid precipitation field provided by gpcc monitoring product v2020 to have a fair comparison with spice data only gpcc data with a solid precipitation ratio greater than 50 were considered for the analysis the relative bias i e the ratio of gpcc to spice was used as a metric to assess the accuracy of the cfs table 3 shows the relative bias of different gpcc products versus spice sites the results indicate that applying cfs reduces the bias by 20 on average which is very significant and once again shows the importance of adjusting the gauge measured precipitation data for the undercatch issue there are a few important points that should be considered in the evaluation of cfs using spice gauges first gpcc data represents precipitation for the entire grid while spice sites represent point measurements this is especially important in complex terrains where the grid precipitation does not fully represent the gauge measured precipitation i e point measurement and can lead to poor performance of gpcc against spice sites second considering the importance of the cfs for solid precipitation and precipitation in higher latitudes it is necessary to continue and expand internationally coordinated projects and field experiments like spice to have an independent reference for precipitation analyses finally a subjective ratio of 50 was used to convert monthly gpcc precipitation to solid precipitation separating snow rain at finer temporal resolutions can significantly improve gpcc s performance against spice sites 4 concluding remarks accurate estimates of precipitation amount and distribution are critical for regional and global applications and water and energy cycle studies over the land precipitation gauges measure precipitation rate and regional and global precipitation rates can be estimated through interpolation the gauge based products are also critical for bias adjustment of satellite precipitation estimates however it is important to realize that gauge measured precipitation also faces errors due to gauge undercatch and needs to be corrected in the present study two popular gauge undercatch cfs were investigated namely cf l used in gpcp and cf f used in gpcc monitoring product cf l is based on the climatology of monthly precipitation records from 1920 to 1980 and is available as fixed monthly maps of correction factors that do not change from one year to another in contrast cf f is based on a dynamic correction model that uses synoptic observation of environmental variables to calculate cfs for individual events which are then converted to monthly cfs in the present study we quantified the extent that the choice of the cfs impacts the total estimate of precipitation over land at seasonal annual regional and global scales furthermore for a deeper understanding of the differences cfs were compared as a function of major environmental variables i e near surface temperature relative humidity and wind speed used in the development of the cfs cfs were also evaluated against precipitation data from a few spice sites we found that both cfs are larger in higher latitudes and cf f exceeds cf l poleward of 60 n at around 70 n in winter the mean cf f reaches its maximum value suggesting a more than 100 increase in the measured precipitation intensity fig 1a in lower latitudes i e 45 s 45 n however the relative differences between zonally averaged cf f and cf l often stay within 5 partly because cfs are much smaller for rainfall than snowfall and are proportionally smaller for intense precipitation than light precipitation regional assessment of cfs through geographical maps revealed that despite their overall consistency cf f and cf l show large regional differences such as those found in the northern part of the contiguous united states where cf f can be much larger than cf l in all seasons except summer and eurasia where cf l is considerably larger than cf f especially in winter it was also found that cf l tends to be larger than cf f in some coastal regions e g the coastal region of the gulf of alaska where precipitation rates are large and can significantly affect the regional or continental precipitation rates over global land excluding antarctica the mean daily precipitation rate of the latest gpcc full product v2020 can be biased by 9 61 and 6 19 respectively if cf l and cf f were not used the underestimation is largest during boreal winter 12 33 and 8 31 respectively and smallest during boreal summer 6 80 and 3 91 respectively the large bias of the mean daily precipitation rate suggests that the choice of cfs has considerable impacts on the water and energy budget calculations evaluation of cfs against the spice sites also revealed that applying correction factors can reduce the relative bias of the gpcc product by 20 which is substantial employing a careful precipitation phase separation approach and the use of synoptic instead of fixed climatology data to generate correction factors for individual precipitation events help cf f to yield a more realistic cf than cf l however studies have shown that the accuracy of cf f and cf l might be region dependent the correction terms for evaporation and wetting errors in cf f are often only available for rain gauges in northern and central europe and the currently used constant values should be replaced by more realistic ones based on field experiments to further improve cf f the analysis presented here suggests that further efforts are needed to reduce gauge undercatch errors e g through the installation of more accurate gauges or the development of improved methods to correct their undercatch furthermore it is important to understand the sensitivity of cfs to the quality and stability of synoptic data in fact in this study we provided a few examples of how environmental conditions might affect cfs however this topic needs to be investigated in more detail in the future exploring the large difference between cf f and cf l in the northern part of the us is potentially another interesting topic for future investigations credit authorship contribution statement mohammad

3319,precipitation gauges are critical for assessing precipitation measurements at regional and global scales and are often used to adjust precipitation estimates from other instruments such as satellites however gauge measured precipitation is affected by gauge undercatch that is often larger for solid precipitation in the present work two popular gauge undercatch correction factors cfs were compared one utilizes a dynamic correction model and is used in the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc monitoring product and the other one employs fixed monthly climatologies and is used in the global precipitation climatology project gpcp product how the choice of cfs impacts the total precipitation estimates was quantified over land at seasonal annual regional and global scales the cfs were also compared as a function of the environmental variables used in their development such as near surface air temperature relative humidity and wind speed results showed that the annual precipitation estimate from gauges with no correction can be biased by 9 61 over the global land excluding antarctica although it varied depending on the season from 6 80 in boreal summer to more than 12 33 in boreal winter and the method used for gauge undercatch correction interannual variations of cfs can be large so the use of the fixed climatology cfs requires caution given their magnitudes and differences choosing appropriate cfs has important implications in refining the water and energy budget calculations keywords gauge undercatch global precipitation gpcc legates fuchs water balance 1 introduction precipitation is an essential component of the hydrological cycle and accurate quantification of precipitation is crucial for scientific commercial and operational applications arabzadeh et al 2020 ehsani et al 2021b 2022 kirschbaum et al 2017 tapiador et al 2012 at the global scale precipitation observations are often obtained from satellites or gauges each offering its strengths and weaknesses adler et al 2012 2003 becker et al 2013 song et al 2021 strangeways 2006 sun et al 2018 satellites provide global coverage but often have a relatively poor performance in capturing precipitation rates over snow and ice surfaces adhikari et al 2020 cao and liang 2018 ehsani et al 2021a kidd et al 2012 liu et al 2019 and for orographic precipitation in mountainous regions shige et al 2013 precipitation gauges are critically important as they often serve as a reference to evaluate and develop other precipitation products however gauges are often sparse and topographically biased towards lower altitudes in mountainous regions in addition the ability of a gauge to measure precipitation accurately varies as a function of the gauge characteristics such as height and shape the orifice size the material with which the gauge is constructed presence and type of a windshield and so on adam and lettenmaier 2003 ehsani and behrangi 2021 legates 1995 legates and bogart 2009 precipitation measurement errors can be divided into two main categories systematic and random random errors include human errors such as inaccurate measurements and a partial total blockage of the gauge inlet due to the presence of trees random errors increase decrease the measured precipitation and are difficult to correct systematic errors are related to how accurately gauge catch approximates actual precipitation and can be subdivided into catching and counting errors since the nineteenth century wind has been recognized as the largest cause of the catching error in precipitation measurements larson and peck 1974 the wind induced error depends on the outer shape of the gauge body wind speed precipitation type solid liquid droplet size distribution precipitation intensity and the presence and type of windshield systematic errors in precipitation gauge measurements can also arise from wetting on the internal walls of the gauge gauge evaporation splashing into out of the gauge and blowing snow counting errors are due to the measuring principle e g weighing and tipping bucket mechanism sevruk 1982 due to systematic biases gauge measured precipitation often underestimates actual precipitation these biases are relatively small i e 4 10 for liquid precipitation cauteruccio et al 2021 pollock et al 2018 but tend to be significantly larger for solid precipitation and can exceed 90 of the total precipitation fassnacht 2004 groisman and legates 1994 grossi et al 2017 hirabayashi et al 2008 jimeno sáez et al 2020 koehler 2019 sevruk et al 2009 yang et al 2005 therefore using appropriate correction methods to mitigate precipitation undercatch has a crucial impact on the accuracy of precipitation measurement at regional and global scales gridded precipitation products that interpolate precipitation data from gauges should be corrected for systematic biases ungersböck et al 2001 two popular correction factors cfs currently used in the global precipitation products are legates correction factors cf l utilized in the global precipitation climatology project gpcp adler et al 2018 adler et al 2003 huffman et al 2009 huffman et al 2020 and fuchs correction factors cf f used in the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc monitoring product schneider et al 2017 2014 rustemeier elke et al 2020 both gpcp and gpcc are widely used by researchers for scientific analysis and development of other precipitation products for example gpcp is used at a monthly scale to bias adjust persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 within 60 s n and the integrated multi satellie retrievals for gpm imerg huffman et al 2020 over land and high latitude oceans gpcc is also widely used for global and regional water balance studies assessment of remote sensing precipitation products raziei et al 2015 2011 2010 sarmadi and shokoohi 2015 wang et al 2017a wang et al 2017b wei et al 2019 and verification of numerical models ajaaj et al 2016 basheer and elagib 2019 chen et al 2014 nicholson et al 2003 prakash et al 2015 prakash et al 2011 therefore comparing two cfs and quantifying how they affect precipitation estimates are significantly important legates and willmott 1990 developed a monthly correction factor i e cf l to compensate for the systematic gauge measurement errors however cf l has several issues including 1 most of the data used for the development of cf l were observed between 1920 and 1980 so the climatology was largely representative of those 60 years 2 the compiled station network in arid mountainous and polar regions was not dense 3 the quality of the gauge correction factors depends on information about the gauge types and installation specifics which were possibly obsolete in the early 1980s and 4 fixed monthly meteorological parameters wind velocity solid liquid ratio etc can lead to over correction as high as 200 in some cases goodison et al 1998 therefore it was essential to develop and implement an improved correction method rubel et al 2000 rubel and hantel 1999 2001 efforts such as the development of a new catalog for standard precipitation gauges by the world meteorological organization wmo e g gauge types windshield usage and gauge rim height refinement of the correction terms for evaporation and wetting errors and improvement of the daily precipitation intensity derivative algorithm from synoptic reports originally developed by rubel and hantel 1999 eventually led to another correction method commonly referred to as the fuchs method i e cf f cf f uses a dynamic correction model førland and hanssen bauer 2000 rubel and hantel 1999 and employs different synoptic observations such as near surface air temperature t relative humidity h precipitation rate p and wind speed w both cf l and cf f use climatology correction for evaporation and wetting loss biases similarly none of them correct gauge undercatch for blowing snow which is important for the wind loss adjustment in polar regions however there are differences between the two methods specifically in estimating wind induced bias and determination of precipitation phase cf l uses rough climatology estimates of the meteorological parameters wind velocity ratio of solid liquid precipitation while cf f estimates necessary parameters based on synoptic observations which are routinely exchanged via the global telecommunication system gts of the wmo for the precipitation phase cf l uses an empirical relationship at the monthly time scale while cf f uses an event based combination of relative humidity and air temperature that has a much closer relation to the precipitation phase sims and liu 2015 this is specifically important because the correction factors for liquid and solid precipitation differ significantly cf l categorizes gauges based on three bias influencing criteria the orifice area whether the gauge was equipped with a shield and the height of the orifice above the ground and infers gauge type for countries where this information was not available cf l uses this information to empirically estimate a few parameters and consequently cfs on the other hand cf f collects information about the gauges e g gauge type presence absence of windshield and gauge rim height from many countries and estimates required parameters more accurately details of the cf l and cf f methods are discussed in legates and willmott 1990 and fuchs et al 2001 respectively since precipitation gauges are often the only observational source for precipitation measurement assessment of the cfs is very challenging projects such as the wmo solid precipitation intercomparison experiment spice 2013 2016 are valuable to assess bias correction of precipitation gauges but they cover only limited areas for a limited time and certain gauge types kochendorfer et al 2017 2020 rasmussen et al 2012 smith et al 2020 by focusing on frozen regions in the northern hemisphere behrangi et al 2018a b used mass change observation from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace to estimate monthly and seasonal snow accumulation through the water budget equation they calculated snow accumulations from the mass balance to assess cf f and cf l and found that cf f is more consistent with the precipitation accumulations calculated using grace observations behrangi et al 2019 reported similar results by performing an annual water budget analysis over several arctic basins using streamflow observations although both studies suggested that cf f is preferred over cf l in most high latitude regions panahi and behrangi 2020 showed that in some cases the use of cf f may result in overestimation of snowfall over the northern part of the united states based on the comparison with the university of arizona snow water equivalent ua swe product zeng et al 2018 while additional studies are required to evaluate cfs in different regions the present study quantifies how the choice of cfs impacts the total precipitation estimates over land at annual seasonal regional and global scales the analysis investigates the relationship between cfs and synoptic variables to better understand how the differences between the cfs are related to environmental conditions such as t h p and w 2 datasets and methodology 2 1 gpcc precipitation products gpcc was established in 1989 at the request of the wmo it is operated by deutscher wetterdienst dwd national meteorological service of germany and contributes to the world climate research program wcrp gpcc provides gridded maps of monthly and daily precipitation over land except antarctica based on in situ precipitation gauges in this study the latest gpcc monthly monitoring and full data products gpcc v2020 schneider et al 2020 were used also the previous version of the gpcc monthly full data product gpcc v2018 schneider et al 2018 was used to assess changes in precipitation amount between the two versions gpcc products are available at https opendata dwd de climate environment gpcc 2 2 legates correction factor cf l using traditional land based gauge measurements and shipboard estimates legates and willmott 1990 developed a global

correct gauge induced biases and remove systematic measurement errors due to wind wetting on the inner walls of the gauge and gauge evaporation fixed monthly cf ls are available at 1 resolution from https opendata dwd de climate environment gpcc legates 2 3 fuchs correction factor cf f fuchs s correction method is based on a dynamic correction model explained by førland and hanssen bauer 2000 and rubel and hantel 1999 originally developed for gauges in european countries that participated in the baltic sea experiment baltex of the global energy and water cycle experiment gewex the method uses synoptic observation of environmental variables i e wind speed at the gauge rim air temperature relative humidity and precipitation phase and intensity to calculate correction factors the corrections include wind induced losses and climatological correction for evaporation and wetting loss the fuchs cfs are provided as a field in the gpcc monthly monitoring product 2 4 era5 global reanalysis era5 is the latest generation of european center for medium range weather forecasting ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis era5 is available from 1950 onward and replaces the era interim reanalysis hersbach et al 2019 it uses 4d var data assimilation using cycle 41r2 of the integrated forecasting system ifs in the present work environmental variables at 0 25 spatial resolution were obtained from https cds climate copernicus eu cdsapp dataset reanalysis era5 single levels monthly means 2 5 methodology in the present study two gauge undercatch cfs were applied to the gpcc monthly full data products gpcc v2020 for the study period 1982 2019 fixed monthly cf l were compared to dynamic monthly cf f geographically and zonally for all seasons then annual and seasonal precipitation rates using the two correction methods were quantified and compared on a global scale and in several regions in addition synoptic variables i e t h w from era5 were used to analyze cfs and their differences due to environmental conditions also cfs and their differences were studied as a function of the joint distribution of synoptic variables the analyses were performed only over continental land areas where both cfs are available finally gpcc precipitation estimates before and after applying correction factors were evaluated against spice sites that covered various regions and climates in an attempt to give a more definitive analysis of the true uncertainty of cfs 3 results and discussion 3 1 differences between cf f and cf l fig 1 shows the zonal average of seasonal cf f and cf l i e the average of cfs for each latitude in each season investigating the zonal averages reveals how cfs change with latitude in these plots the blue line represents cf l since cf l provides a fixed map for each month there are no variations in the seasonal values of cf l in different years on the other hand cf f that is shown with the orange line is a dynamic cf i e cf value depends on synoptic conditions therefore in addition to the long term average i e orange line the variation in the study period i e 1982 2019 is shown with the orange shade fig 1 shows that 1 there is a good agreement between cf l and cf f within 45 s n in all seasons i e the zonal averages of cf f and cf l almost overlap 2 variations of cf f are relatively small within 30 s 70 n and 3 the zonal average of cf f is larger than that of cf l poleward of 60 n in djf and mam and poleward of 70 n in son on the other hand cf l suggests larger cfs poleward of 50 s for all seasons except jja the relative difference of the zonal average of seasonal cfs i e 100 cf f c f l cf l is plotted in fig 2 a which confirms the consistency of the two cfs within 45 s n fig 2a also shows that the relative difference between cf f and cf l exceeds 30 around 80 n in winter the larger cfs and the difference between cf l and cf f in higher latitudes and especially during the cold seasons figs 1 and 2a implies that cfs are often larger for snowfall than rainfall which is consistent with the earlier studies behrangi et al 2018a legates 1995 legates and bogart 2009 cf f also shows large variations from one year to another poleward of 30 s and 60 n in all seasons fig 1 in other words in higher latitudes cf f suggests large annual variations which are ignored when fixed monthly cf l is used i e cf l does not provide any information about annual variability this finding indicates that using cf f has the advantage of accounting for the annual variations of cfs in high latitudes fig 1 and fig 2 help to investigate the overall relationship between cfs however it is important to assess the spatial distribution of cfs and their relative differences geographically geographical maps of the seasonal cfs are shown in fig 3 separately for cf f and cf l along with the relative difference of the seasonal cfs i e 100 cf f c f l cf l fig 3 reveals that there are large regional variations in cfs that could not be fully explored in the zonal average plots both cf f and cf l report larger cfs in djf mam and son compared to jja in the northern hemisphere the seasonal relative difference of the cf f and cf l suggests that cf f has larger cfs in north america and alaska except for the coastal regions where precipitation rates are usually higher the western part of greenland and scattered regions in siberia himalaya south america australia and africa on the other hand cf l reports larger cfs in northern europe east siberia east asia and coastal regions in north america in the rest of the world and especially near the tropics the relative difference of the cfs lies within 5 in all seasons conversely in the higher latitudes the relative difference of cfs can exceed 50 in several regions especially in cold months when snowfall is the dominant precipitation type fig 3 also indicates that cf l is close to one over large areas in canada while cf f shows values larger than one that is expected in higher latitude we can also observe that over the northern part of the united states cf f is larger than cf l in all seasons except summer this is consistent with panahi and behrangi 2020 who also found that in very cold conditions the use of cf f may result in overestimation of snowfall accumulation finally over eurasia and especially in winter cf l is considerably larger than cf f mass change analysis using grace observations as well as the net surface water exchange analysis suggests that cf l is likely too high over this region behrangi et al 2018b behrangi et al 2019 3 2 analysis of the correction factors in multiple study areas due to the large regional differences between cfs seven regions shown in fig 4 were defined to further investigate the impact of cfs on the regional mean precipitation rates these regions include canada and alaska the continental united states us greenland tropics eurasia siberia and himalaya and higher latitudes poleward of 60 s in the southern hemisphere hereafter hsh to quantify the impact of cfs on precipitation estimates at both global and regional scales cfs were applied to gpcc v2020 and monthly mean precipitation rates were calculated for the global land except antarctica and the seven regions identified in fig 4 fig 5 shows the seasonal time series of the gpcc gpcc after applying cf l gpcc l and gpcc after applying cf f gpcc f for the global land the us hsh and eurasia the time series represents seasonal mean values but the reported unit is mm day in addition to the absolute values the ratio of gpcc l and gpcc f to gpcc i e gpcc f gpcc and gpcc l gpcc are plotted in separate panels for each region with the linear trendlines showing their evolution in time time series of the global mean precipitation rate fig 5a indicate that choosing cf l over cf f leads to higher mean global precipitation rates fig 5a over the us using cf f instead of cf l leads to larger values in djf and larger seasonal variations fig 5b on the other hand in eurasia fig 5d using cf l results in larger precipitation rates compared to cf f in hsh fig 5c gpcc f gpcc ratio shows an increasing trend since cf l has fixed cfs and no clear trend is observed in gpcc l gpcc ratio over the hsh the increasing trend in gpcc f gpcc ratio can directly be attributed to cf f increasing gpcc f gpcc ratio in these regions is probably related to the dynamic nature of cf f which can be affected by the changes in the environmental conditions i e t h and w due to the its static nature cf l does not follow increasing decreasing trends in climate variables in the past two decades there has been a significant trend in some climate variables in some regions of the world due to climate change and global warming ehsani et al 2020 a similar plot is provided for other regions specified in fig 4 canada and alaska tropics siberia and himalaya and greenland in the supplementary materials figure s1 3 3 correction factors as a function of environmental condition as discussed earlier cf f is based on a dynamic correction model that uses synoptic observations to derive correction factors for individual precipitation events on the other hand cf l is based on the global climatology of mean monthly precipitation at individual gauges the monthly t h and w from era5 for regions identified in this study fig 4 are plotted in figure s2 to further help the investigation of differences between cfs for the global land there is an increasing trend in t a decreasing trend in h and an increasing trend in w figure s2a the trend in the global land is similar to that observed in hsh and the tropics figure s2d and figure s2e the increasing gpcc f gpcc ratio observed in fig 5c and s1b is related to the trend in the environmental conditions in these regions these observations suggest that understanding the changes in gpcc f requires a more detailed analysis of synoptic data that could be a topic for future investigations however it is important to consider that cf f is calculated using synoptic station data for individual precipitation events so the analysis using era5 is not fully representative investigating how cfs behave as a function of environmental variables i e t h and w is insightful fig 6 shows the average values of cf f and cf l and their relative differences for the global land as a function of t h w elevation e and p sample counts in the bins are also shown in adjacent panels fig 6a indicates that both cf f and cf l increase as t decreases however for colder temperatures less than 10 c cf l remains almost constant this behavior can explain why cf f has larger cfs at higher latitudes and very cold regions in the northern contiguous united states fig 3 for temperatures colder than 10 c cf f can exceed cf l by 20 while at warmer temperatures both cfs have similar magnitudes both cfs increase as h increases up to 80 at which cf f shows its maximum value fig 6c cf f is also slightly higher than cf l for h less than 80 for higher h values cf l is larger than cf f while both cfs show a similar relationship to h as w increases up to 7 m s 1 both cfs increase however at higher wind speed e g greater than 10 m s 1 fig 6e both cfs decrease it is not exactly clear why at higher wind speed cfs are smaller but that might be due to the relatively low number of samples at the bins for w greater than 10 m s 1 fig 6f both cfs show similar behavior as a function of precipitation rate p as p increases cfs become smaller fig 6g larger cfs are needed for light precipitation rates because 1 precipitation can be more easily moved away from the gauge inlet 2 the wetting loss can lead to a remarkable error and 3 lighter precipitation tends to occur in higher latitudes where snowfall is more common in terms of e cf f generally exceeds cf l across all elevations also both cfs increase with elevation up to 3000 m and decrease in higher altitudes fig 6i this is probably due to the higher density of the gauges and less intense precipitation rates at lower altitudes in other words precipitation intensity influences the systematic measurement error higher precipitation intensity leads to lower correction factors to summarize fig 6 implies that differences between cfs can be linked to environmental conditions however attributing the behavior of cfs to only a single environmental variable may not be very effective therefore it should be insightful to analyze cfs as a function of two or more environmental variables for this purpose average cfs and their relative difference i e 100 c f f c f l c f l are plotted for the joint distribution of t h w e and p fig 7 fig 7 is insightful as it provides additional information on the more specific environmental conditions that lead to major differences between cf l and cf f fig 7 suggests that the differences between corrected and measured precipitation are larger for higher w and colder t and cf f provides larger cfs in such conditions it can also be observed that cf f is larger than cf l for colder t and light precipitation rates which is typical of high latitude and snowfall events fig 7 also shows that the combination of higher w and higher e corresponds to larger cfs for both methods however the relative difference between the cfs is the largest for higher w and lower e as well as lower w and higher e these are examples of environmental conditions leading to differences in cfs which should be investigated thoroughly in future studies 3 4 impacts of the correction factors on the measured precipitation quantifying how the choice of cfs impacts the measured precipitation amount is very important especially from the perspective of earth s water and energy budget analysis in addition bias correction of gauge observations is an essential step before using gauges for bias adjustment of remotely sensed precipitation products e g in gpcp and imerg hydrologic modeling verification of the model results and climate change studies fuchs et al 2001 table 1 shows the annual and seasonal global mean precipitation rates and associated standard deviation over global land excluding antarctica from gpcc v2020 gpcc l gpcc f and gpcc v2018 the values in parentheses display the mean and standard deviation of percent change in total precipitation compared to gpcc v2020 which has no gauge undercatch correction the results indicate that at the annual scale without using cf l the mean global daily precipitation rate can be underestimated by 9 61 while this value is 6 19 for cf f the analysis also indicates that there is only a slight difference between gpcc v2020 and gpcc v2018 at a global scale with a maximum difference of less than 0 16 in djf seasonal values of gpcc l and gpcc f indicate that both cf l and cf f have the largest increase in precipitation rates in djf 12 33 and 8 31 respectively and the least increase in jja 6 80 and 3 91 respectively which is consistent with fig 3 the increase in precipitation rate due to applying cfs is large previous studies have suggested that the global precipitation rate obtained from gpcp that uses cf l to correct gpcc needs to be increased by 5 rodell et al 2015 or higher stephens et al 2012 to balance the water and energy budget although the present analysis is only over land the large increase in gpcc precipitation rates by applying cfs and the relatively large differences between gpcc l and gpcc f suggest that the choice of cfs can significantly impact the understanding of earth system processes at regional and global scales precise knowledge of the surface energy fluxes and their imbalance affects our ability to understand how earth s climate responds to the increased concentrations of greenhouse gases by using cf f the annual increase in gpcc precipitation rate can be 3 4 less than that suggested by cf l over global land because cf f has a dynamic nature that utilizes synoptic variables and captures inter annual seasonal variabilities it is likely the preferred approach schneider et al 2017 however previous studies have shown that the accuracy of cf f and cf l can be region dependent behrangi et al 2019 behrangi et al 2018b behrangi et al 2018a panahi and behrangi 2020 the mean annual and seasonal precipitation change compared to gpcc v2020 was also investigated in the seven regions identified in this study figure s3 the results indicate that the increase in mean precipitation rate due to applying cfs is largest in greenland i e more than 40 and smallest in the tropics i e less than 5 which emphasizes the importance of using accurate cfs in high latitude regions 3 5 assessment of the correction factors against spice sites in this section gpcc data before and after applying correction factors were evaluated against precipitation data from spcie sites to assess the accuracy of the cfs across different climate regions for this purpose 7 participating sites operating the wmo double fence automated reference dfar were selected the locations and elevations of wmo spice sites are provided in table 2 and shown in figure s4 data for these gauges were available over two seasons 1 october 2015 to 30 april 2016 and 1 october 2016 to 30 april 2017 at the temporal resolution of 30 minutes data were then further processed to a monthly time scale to facilitate the cfs assessment for further information about the dataset please see smith et al 2020 smith et al 2019 the spice s focus is on measuring solid precipitation gpcc monthly precipitation data was converted into solid precipitation using the proportion of solid precipitation field provided by gpcc monitoring product v2020 to have a fair comparison with spice data only gpcc data with a solid precipitation ratio greater than 50 were considered for the analysis the relative bias i e the ratio of gpcc to spice was used as a metric to assess the accuracy of the cfs table 3 shows the relative bias of different gpcc products versus spice sites the results indicate that applying cfs reduces the bias by 20 on average which is very significant and once again shows the importance of adjusting the gauge measured precipitation data for the undercatch issue there are a few important points that should be considered in the evaluation of cfs using spice gauges first gpcc data represents precipitation for the entire grid while spice sites represent point measurements this is especially important in complex terrains where the grid precipitation does not fully represent the gauge measured precipitation i e point measurement and can lead to poor performance of gpcc against spice sites second considering the importance of the cfs for solid precipitation and precipitation in higher latitudes it is necessary to continue and expand internationally coordinated projects and field experiments like spice to have an independent reference for precipitation analyses finally a subjective ratio of 50 was used to convert monthly gpcc precipitation to solid precipitation separating snow rain at finer temporal resolutions can significantly improve gpcc s performance against spice sites 4 concluding remarks accurate estimates of precipitation amount and distribution are critical for regional and global applications and water and energy cycle studies over the land precipitation gauges measure precipitation rate and regional and global precipitation rates can be estimated through interpolation the gauge based products are also critical for bias adjustment of satellite precipitation estimates however it is important to realize that gauge measured precipitation also faces errors due to gauge undercatch and needs to be corrected in the present study two popular gauge undercatch cfs were investigated namely cf l used in gpcp and cf f used in gpcc monitoring product cf l is based on the climatology of monthly precipitation records from 1920 to 1980 and is available as fixed monthly maps of correction factors that do not change from one year to another in contrast cf f is based on a dynamic correction model that uses synoptic observation of environmental variables to calculate cfs for individual events which are then converted to monthly cfs in the present study we quantified the extent that the choice of the cfs impacts the total estimate of precipitation over land at seasonal annual regional and global scales furthermore for a deeper understanding of the differences cfs were compared as a function of major environmental variables i e near surface temperature relative humidity and wind speed used in the development of the cfs cfs were also evaluated against precipitation data from a few spice sites we found that both cfs are larger in higher latitudes and cf f exceeds cf l poleward of 60 n at around 70 n in winter the mean cf f reaches its maximum value suggesting a more than 100 increase in the measured precipitation intensity fig 1a in lower latitudes i e 45 s 45 n however the relative differences between zonally averaged cf f and cf l often stay within 5 partly because cfs are much smaller for rainfall than snowfall and are proportionally smaller for intense precipitation than light precipitation regional assessment of cfs through geographical maps revealed that despite their overall consistency cf f and cf l show large regional differences such as those found in the northern part of the contiguous united states where cf f can be much larger than cf l in all seasons except summer and eurasia where cf l is considerably larger than cf f especially in winter it was also found that cf l tends to be larger than cf f in some coastal regions e g the coastal region of the gulf of alaska where precipitation rates are large and can significantly affect the regional or continental precipitation rates over global land excluding antarctica the mean daily precipitation rate of the latest gpcc full product v2020 can be biased by 9 61 and 6 19 respectively if cf l and cf f were not used the underestimation is largest during boreal winter 12 33 and 8 31 respectively and smallest during boreal summer 6 80 and 3 91 respectively the large bias of the mean daily precipitation rate suggests that the choice of cfs has considerable impacts on the water and energy budget calculations evaluation of cfs against the spice sites also revealed that applying correction factors can reduce the relative bias of the gpcc product by 20 which is substantial employing a careful precipitation phase separation approach and the use of synoptic instead of fixed climatology data to generate correction factors for individual precipitation events help cf f to yield a more realistic cf than cf l however studies have shown that the accuracy of cf f and cf l might be region dependent the correction terms for evaporation and wetting errors in cf f are often only available for rain gauges in northern and central europe and the currently used constant values should be replaced by more realistic ones based on field experiments to further improve cf f the analysis presented here suggests that further efforts are needed to reduce gauge undercatch errors e g through the installation of more accurate gauges or the development of improved methods to correct their undercatch furthermore it is important to understand the sensitivity of cfs to the quality and stability of synoptic data in fact in this study we provided a few examples of how environmental conditions might affect cfs however this topic needs to be investigated in more detail in the future exploring the large difference between cf f and cf l in the northern part of the us is potentially another interesting topic for future investigations credit authorship contribution statement mohammad
