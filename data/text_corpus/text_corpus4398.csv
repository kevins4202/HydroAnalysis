21990,a parametric study on the propulsive performance of auto pitch wing in ground effect oscillating foil propulsors apwigs was conducted using an unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes solver the harmonic sinusoidal function is actively imposed to the heave motion of such a configuration which has a passively flow induced pitch motion restrained by torsional springs comparative investigation between apwigs and fully prescribed system was performed indicating that apwigs is capable of producing a satisfactory propulsive efficiency within a wide range of advance speed the jet like profiles implying the time averaged momentum surplus were obtained in the wake of apwigs which is attributed to the produced reverse kármán vortex street behind each oscillating foil obvious vortex shedding along both leading edge and trailing edge can be observed at a high reduced frequency while the low oscillating frequency corresponding to a small reduced frequency tends to produce the high efficiency due to the highly attached flow around foil surface furthermore comprehensive computations for the influence of multiple parameters on the hydro elasticity responses and propulsive characteristics of apwigs were conducted in the current study we noted that heaving amplitude and equilibrium distance only affect the maximum flow induced pitching angle nonetheless the position of elastic pitching axis shows a significant effect on both pitch leading phase difference and the maximum pitching angle the maximum increase of propulsive efficiency around 12 due to the wing in ground effect was discovered within the considered parametric space it was found that the apwigs can achieve a high efficiency of over 70 with the appropriate combination of geometry and motion parameters

motivates human beings to pursue more superior propulsion systems for modern marine vehicles with the wide application of autonomous underwater vehicles auvs in the last few decades there is growing interest in the study of oscillating foil propulsors early efforts were mainly devoted into the physical explanation of thrust producing mechanism it was well known that the wake profile is characterized by a reverse kármán vortex street for the flapping wing generating forward thrust recent studies in oscillating foil propulsors tend to focus on the practical application for both auvs and surface ships the parametric combination of pitch and heave producing optimal propulsive efficiency has become a concern among the related works it was well established that oscillating foil propulsor has shown a significant potential in manoeuvrability implementation and efficiency enhancement compared with conventional screw propellers basically the propulsion systems employing the oscillating foils can be divided into two groups in terms of performed kinematics including the fully imposed configuration and semi active configuration the most common configuration for propulsion is the single oscillating foil with a fully imposed motion which can be traced back to early last century garrick 1937 it was revealed that a heaving foil tends to produce thrust over the whole oscillating frequency range while a pitching foil only generates the thrust with the frequency above a certain value extensive studies were conducted to explore the oscillating mechanism corresponding to a high efficiency using both theoretical methods wu 1971 lighthill 1975 cheng and murillo 1984 and model test scherer 1968 delaurier and harris 1982 the effect of flexibility and finite aspect ratio were considered by liu 1991 1996 using the vortex lattice method and panel method to pursue satisfactory propulsive performance for oscillating foil system a set of experiments on thrust producing oscillating foils with harmonically heave and pitch motion were conducted by anderson et al 1998 which reported a high propulsive efficiency of 87 based on the appropriate parameter combination including the range of strouhal number that lies in 0 25 0 4 large heaving amplitude maximum angle of attack aoa between 15 and 20 and the pitch leading phase angle of 75 a similar experimental study was performed by read et al 2003 with variation of multiple parameters indicating that the pitch leading phase angle between 90 and 100 is more likely to produce the best propulsive performance with the development of measuring methods and computational resources the latest studies with respect to the single oscillating foil tend to focus on the more complicated issues including the transition of boundary cavitation and ground effect yang et al 2010 lapointe and dumas 2011 akcabay et al 2014 perkins et al 2017 the biplane arrangement with a symmetric plane is considered to produce a resulting wing in ground effect when two foils oscillate in counterphase such an effect can improve the propulsive performance in both thrust production and efficiency enhancement compared with single foil configuration jones and platzer 1997 performed the first comprehensive computation on biplane arrangement with the consideration of both heave only motion and combined heave pitch motion after that jones and platzer 1999 and jones et al 2002 conducted a series of measurements in hydrodynamic forces and flow visualization which showed that the propulsive characteristics with a dual mode motion combined pitch and heave has an apparent dependency on the reynolds number a similar numerical study was performed by tuncer and kaya 2005 indicating that the biplane configuration can produce 20 40 more thrust over a single oscillating foil a wing in ground effect propulsor with an anti phase heave only motion was investigated by liu 2005b using a three dimensional panel method systematic calculations with the consideration of various parameters were conducted in his study which confirmed that a small distance between two oscillating foils can enhance the wing in ground effect and thus improve the efficiency to a large extent a direct comparison of propulsive performance between heave only biplane configuration and screw propeller was performed by liu et al 2010 based on a parametric similitude frame it was found that the wing in ground effect propulsor has an independence of advance speed under the assumption of ideal fluid the open water characteristics of dual foil configuration with combined heave pitch motion was studied numerically by politis and tsarsitalidis 2013 which reported a higher thrust coefficient over conventional propellers especially it was found that such a configuration can operate at an optimal efficiency without the cavitation issue more recently wang and xuan 2016 performed a numerical study on the wing in ground effect propulsor in dual mode motion using an unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes solver an increase of around 8 in propulsive efficiency was obtained by the biplane configuration over the single oscillating foil in this study the semi active configuration can be found in extensive studies on the energy harvester young et al 2014 xiao and zhu 2014 characterizing as the prescribed pitch and damping based heave however investigations into oscillating foil with an elastic support as a propulsor are still rare up to now since the heave motion of oscillating foil propulsor generates most of the thrust the semi active configuration usually employs an actively imposed heave motion and the spring restricted pitch motion such a flow adjusted pitching motion is expected to decrease the instantaneous flow separation and simplify the controlling mechanism it should be noted that unlike the configuration with a rigid shaft in the unsteady flow an oscillating foil using an elastic pitching axis introduces the issue of hydro elasticity and fluid structure coupling a multi fidelity study on a semi active propulsor was carried out by willis et al 2007 in which a torsional spring is attached to the leading edge of the oscillating foil the main focus of the research was lied in the construction of the computational frame while the detailed demonstration for the propulsive performance of oscillating foil with a passive pitch was not performed the locomotion of a passively flapping flat plate was numerically studied by zhang et al 2010 using a multiblock lattice boltzmann method indicating that there are two dynamic responses for the passively pitching plate depending on the ratio of natural frequency over heaving frequency especially it was found that the corresponding propulsive performance at the forward movement regime was remarkably improved by the torsional flexibility a similar numerical study on the passively flapping wing that generates a forward or backward motion regime was performed by xiao et al 2014 the frequency of passive pitch was found to be identical to that of prescribed heave when the flapping wing reaches the stable periodic state a systematic calculation with respect to the effect of torsional stiffness on the propulsive performance of semi active oscillating foil propulsor was conducted by thaweewat et al 2018 using the boundary element method satisfactory efficiency was obtained within a wide range of flow conditions for such a configuration which was considered to have analogical open water characteristics with a variable pitch propeller it should be mentioned that the configuration of interest in these studies is restricted to the single oscillating foil the oscillating foil propulsor with a biplane arrangement and the flow induced pitch based on attached torsional springs first appeared at a technical patent by liu 2005a the original intention of this design is to improve the start up thrust and propulsive efficiency of wing in ground effect oscillating foil propulsor by introducing an elastic pitching axis it was expected that the apwigs can adapt the different loaded conditions compared with the biplane configuration with the rigid shaft the effect of torsional spring stiffness on the hydrodynamic behaviours of apwigs has been studied numerically by our previous work wang et al 2019 which seems to be the first evaluation on such a configuration as per the knowledge of authors in the current study we conduct a two dimensional investigation into the influence of multiple motion and geometry parameters on the propulsive characteristics of apwigs which aims to provide the essential implications and guidance for marine applications the rest of this paper is organized as follows the basic methodology verification and validation of numerical model are described in the second section then we present our main computational results and corresponding discussion in the third section the conclusions and major findings are summarized in the last section 2 computational methodology 2 1 motion description in the current study the considered configuration of apwigs experiences an active harmonic heave motion in counterphase and a hydrodynamic induced pitch motion as shown in the left schematic of fig 1 the heave motion is defined by a simple sinusoidal function with amplitude of h 0 and angular frequency of ω a torsional spring is attached to the pivot axis of each foil to restore the foil towards the equilibrium position in addition it does not have any other degrees of freedom with the generated ground plane by two anti phase oscillating foils one foil can be considered as the mirror image of another foil during the operation for the apwigs moving at a constant advance speed of u the instantaneous effective aoa at an arbitrary instant can be defined in the right side of fig 1 and the expression as follow 1 α t tan 1 1 u d h t d t θ t where θ t and h t denote the time varying pitching angle and vertical position of elastic pitching axis respectively the non dimensional frequency is one of the most important parameters used to analyse the inherent flow physics of oscillating foils it is usually represented by either the strouhal number st or reduced frequency k st can be extensively found in studies that focus on the specific range of this parameter producing efficient performance for both animals and artificial structures taylor et al 2003 while researchers prefer measuring the ratio of two characteristic speeds for a particular configuration using k platzer et al 2008 we follow the definition of anderson et al 1998 in which these two parameters are given as follows 2 s t f a u 3 k w c 2 u where f denotes the oscillating frequency in hz a is the characteristic width of the created jet flow which is usually determined by the total excursion of the trailing edge of the foil w and c denote the angular frequency w 2πf and chord length respectively since the maximum displacement of the trailing edge is unknown before the simulation we use the reduced frequency to represent the non dimensional frequency of apwigs torsional spring stiffness is another critical parameter that is relevant to the dynamic responses of system and hence affect the propulsive performance of apwigs it can be represented by the frequency ratio as follows 4 r f f n f 5 f n 1 2 π k i a x i s where f n denotes the natural frequency k and i axis are stiffness of system and moment of inertia respectively the non dimensional torsional spring stiffness can be alternatively defined as follow 6 k k ρ u 2 a 0 c where ρ is the fluid density and a 0 denotes the foil planform area in the current study we employ eq 6 to define the non dimensional torsional spring stiffness of apwigs based on the transform method by floc h et al 2012 an advance coefficient for oscillating foil configuration can be defined as follow which imitates the advance number of traditional propellers 7 j u f d f o i l 8 d f o i l 8 h 0 a 0 π c where h 0 is the heaving amplitude of the oscillating foil and d foil denotes the equivalent diameter of the foil therefore we can present the propulsive performance of apwigs as a function of advance coefficient similar to the open water characteristics of marine propellers the propulsive performance of apwigs is characterized as the time averaged thrust f and input power p over one periodic cycle t as follows 9 f 1 t t t t x t d t 10 p 1 t t t t y t d h t d t d t where x t and y t denote the time varying forces in forward and vertical directions respectively the propulsive efficiency can be defined as the ratio of useful power over input power 11 η f u p the non dimensional coefficients of thrust and power can be defined as follows 12 c t f 0 5 ρ u 2 a 0 13 c p p 0 5 ρ u 3 a 0 alternatively the propulsive efficiency can be expressed as the ratio of thrust coefficient over power coefficient η c t c p 2 2 fluid solver the unsteady flow around the oscillating foils is simulated by the open source cfd code openfoam the finite volume method is used to solve the incompressible navier stokes equations arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method and sliding mesh technique are two efficient approaches to solve the mesh motion of fluid structure interaction and moving boundary a continuous adaptation of mesh without modifying the topology is involved in an ale model while a sliding interface dividing the moving zone and stationary zone is introduced in the sliding mesh model since the mesh motion is moderate in the current simulations the calculation of mass and momentum equations is performed in the moving grid domain using ale method ferziger and peric 2012 the governing equations of fluid can be expressed as the integral form for an arbitrary moving volume v bounded by a closed surface s 14 d d t v ρ u d v s d s ρ u u b u s d s p i ρ υ u where u is the fluid velocity u b denotes the boundary velocity of a finite volume p and ν are the pressure and kinematic viscosity respectively commonly used turbulence models include unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans detached eddy simulation des large eddy simulation les as a hybrid turbulence model of statistical and scale resolving methods the des is more computationally economic than les usta and korkut 2018 although des can provide more insight into the details of flow behaviours compared with urans its requirements of mesh density and computational cost are still extremely high for a large scale parametric computation it is well known that urans can provide a satisfactory prediction for the attached flow and simple geometry with the relatively cheap computational sources for the highly complex separated flow simulations based on urans is not able to distinguish the turbulent chaotic and quasi periodic features of flow field for the most cases breuer et al 2003 since the geometry and flow phenomena in the current simulations are less complicated in addition the flow separation is moderate for the most of situations therefore the turbulence effect is simulated by the urans model in this study which is believed to provide a satisfactory prediction in the hydrodynamic characteristics of oscillating foil configuration the two equation sst k ω turbulence model menter 1993 is used to close the resulting system of fluid equations the minimum y plus at near wall region is set as 45 to ensure that the first mesh cell centre is placed in the log law region the flow behaviours in the viscous layer are modelled by the introduced approximation of wall functions as for the boundary conditions the constant and uniform velocity is imposed at the inlet of the computational domain the boundary condition of downstream outlet is set as the constant static pressure the foil boundary is implemented as the moving wall with no flux normal to the body surface in the current numerical model time discretization is performed by the first order implicit euler scheme for space discretization a second order linear upwind scheme and a second order scheme based on linear interpolation are used to discretise the convection terms and diffusion terms respectively the pressure velocity coupling is solved by the pimple scheme which is a combination of pressure implicit split operator piso algorithm and semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple algorithm with respect to the discretised equations the generalised geometric algebraic multi grid gamg method is employed to calculate the pressure equations the calculation of velocity and turbulence equations is conducted by the preconditioned bi conjugate gradient pbicg method the fluid structure coupling is another issue in terms of auto pitch configuration the heave motion of apwigs is actively prescribed by an actuating system while the pitch motion is determined by the combination of hydrodynamic forces acting on the foils with restoring moment of the attached torsional springs consequently the dynamic responses are governed by following equations 15 h t h 0 sin ω t 16 m a x i s i a x i s θ d p i t c h θ k p i t c h θ where m axis denotes the hydrodynamic moment d pitch and k pitch are the viscous damping coefficient and torsional spring stiffness coefficient respectively note that the viscous damping coefficient is set as zero in this study in the current numerical model a six degree of freedom 6 dof solver in openfoam is modified to perform the kinematics of apwigs and solve the fluid structure interaction the solution of eq 16 is conducted using a second order explicit scheme symplectic splitting method dullweber et al 1997 based on the initial position and speed of foils the velocity and pressure fields of the whole computational domain will be calculated by fluid solver then the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the foils can be determined by the integral of pressure fields along with body boundaries and thus the new position and velocity of each foil can be updated by eqs 15 and 16 once the convergence criteria are satisfied the iteration loop will move on to next time step 2 3 verification and validation the schematic of computational domain is presented in fig 2 which has a horizontal length of 50c and a vertical height of 40c fig 3 shows the mesh resolution and division details around each foil for the apwigs which is generated by the software package of icem cfd the typical time histories of flow induced pitching angle and force coefficients for apwigs are shown in fig 4 numerical results show that both the pitching angles of two foils and force coefficients of each foil tend to present the periodic characteristics after the fourth periodic cycle especially the pitching angle of the upper foil has the same value and opposite direction with that of the lower foil which indicates that the dynamic responses of the two foils are symmetric with respect to the generated ground plane if not particularly indicated the rest of the numerical simulations are monitored with five periodic cycles to make sure that each case reaches a periodic state moreover all time averaged results are obtained based on the calculation of the last periodic cycle a verification study with respect to both the time step and grid size was carried out using the correlation factor method stern et al 2001 wilson et al 2001 in order to evaluate the numerical uncertainties three solutions with systematically refined time step or grid size were conducted when the convergence study of one input parameter was performed all other input parameters were kept constant the numerical setup for the convergence study is shown in table 1 in which the uniform refinement ratio of 2 and 2 for the time step and grid size are used respectively satisfactory independence of time and space can be obtained in fig 5 which presents the variation of thrust coefficients over one periodic cycle it should be noted that time step in the current simulations is limited by the maximum courant number of 0 9 which ensure the maximum time increment is less than 8 10 5 the current study follows the procedure by stern et al 2006 to estimate the numerical uncertainties with respect to the time step and grid size time averaged thrust and power coefficients are selected as the integral variables to perform the uncertainty calculation it is assumed that iterative errors are negligible compared with the time step and grid size convergence errors in this study therefore the numerical errors are decomposed into the contributions from the time step and grid size the variations of thrust and power coefficients between fine medium and coarse solutions for kth input parameter can be calculated as 17 ε k 21 s 2 s 1 18 ε k 32 s 3 s 2 the convergence ratio is defined as the changes between the medium fine and coarse medium solutions 19 r k ε k 21 ε k 32 where s 1 s 2 and s 3 denote the solution from the fine medium and coarse input parameter respectively convergence ratio is employed to determine the convergence conditions which include i monotonic convergence 0 r k 1 ii oscillatory convergence r k 0 r k 1 iii monotonic divergence r k 1 iv oscillatory divergence r k 0 r k 1 for the condition ii numerical uncertainties are predicted by bounding the error based on oscillation with maximum and minimum solutions the errors and uncertainties cannot be estimated for condition iii and iv with respect to the condition i numerical errors and uncertainties are estimated by generalised richardson extrapolation which provides the estimate for one term numerical error and order of accuracy as following equations 20 δ r e k 1 ε k 21 r k p k 1 21 p k ln ε k 32 ε k 21 ln r k where r k is the uniform refinement ratio for kth input parameter a correction factor is employed to account for the effect of higher order terms for the error and uncertainty estimates defined as 22 c k r k p k 1 r k p k e s t 1 where p kest is an estimate for the limiting order of accuracy an improved error estimate can be obtained based on the multiplication of eq 20 by the correction factor 23 δ k c k δ r e k 1 the uncorrected uncertainty u k and corrected uncertainty u kc are estimated by following equations depending on the distance of solutions to the asymptotic range 24 u k 9 6 1 c k 2 1 1 δ r e k 1 1 c k 0 125 2 1 c k 1 δ r e k 1 1 c k 0 125 25 u k c 2 4 1 c k 2 0 1 δ r e k 1 1 c k 0 25 1 c k δ r e k 1 1 c k 0 25 numerical uncertainty with respect to time step and grid size are presented in tables 2 and 3 respectively results indicate that time averaged thrust coefficient has a certain sensitivity for the time step resolution while time averaged power coefficient tends to be more sensitive to the grid size resolution reasonably low level of uncertainty referring to both the time step and grid size was obtained for two integral coefficients the maximum uncertainty level of 3 19 was lied in the time averaged thrust coefficient in time step convergence calculation the current numerical model was validated by comparing with experimental data for the actively prescribed configurations the first benchmark experiment is selected to be the study conducted by anderson et al 1998 which measured propulsive characteristics of a single oscillating foil with fully imposed heave and pitch motion fig 6 presents the comparison of time averaged thrust and power coefficients between current simulations and experimental measurements the configuration has a heaving amplitude of 0 75c and the pitch leading phase angle of 90 the effective aoa is set as a constant value of 15 by adjusting the pitching amplitude and oscillating frequency it can be seen that the major discrepancy between the current results and experimental data was lied in the thrust calculation satisfactory agreement for the power coefficient was obtained indicating that tip vortex shedding due to three dimensional effect is not the major contribution to the disagreement in the current simulations the thrust calculation was also performed using the spalart allmaras turbulence model spalart and allmaras 1992 and k epsilon turbulence model launder and spalding 1983 as shown in fig 6 a the negligible difference between the three numerical models indicates that turbulent effect is not the dominant cause to the discrepancy the disagreement of the thrust coefficient between the current calculations and experimental measurements is mainly attributed to the mismatched baseline of zero horizontal force along the advance speed according to read et al 2003 the data was initialized to zero after the carriage starts to move before oscillation of foil in the measurements by anderson et al 1998 it leads to an artificially high value of mean thrust due to the exclusion of drag in contrast the current results were set as zero value before any motion of carriage and foil starts which ensures that the drag acting on the foil will be included in the thrust calculation for the biplane arrangement our previous study wang et al 2019 performed a validation test with respect to the prescribed heave only configuration which shows an acceptable agreement between the simulation and the experiment here we considered a biplane configuration with dual mode motion combined heave and pitch which has been studied by jones and platzer 1999 experimentally the prescribed pitching and heaving amplitudes of this propulsive system are 5 and 0 335c respectively the pivot axis is set at mid chord position with pitch leading phase angle of 90 detailed geometry and motion parameters of this dual foil configuration can be found in jones and platzer 1999 the comparison of time averaged thrust coefficient between the current calculations and experimental measurements is presented in fig 7 which also presents the numerical results by jones and platzer 1999 using two dimensional panel method the results showed that both the current model and panel method tend to underestimate the thrust at relatively high advance speeds for the heavily loaded conditions with lower speeds satisfactory agreement between the numerical results and experimental measurements can be seen especially current thrust predictions have a remarkably great agreement with the calculations using two dimensional panel method jones and platzer 1999 which indicates that the three dimensional effect and resulting tip vortex behaviour are partly responsible for the thrust underestimation of numerical calculations in addition another likely reason causing such a discrepancy is the flexibility of wings in the experiment a relatively high aspect ratio of 20 was used in the measurements due to the effect of flexibility the heaving amplitude in the wing tip should be higher than the value in the wing root as a result the averaged heaving amplitude of the whole wing in the experiment was supposed to be larger than the initial set value however the assumption of rigid body was implemented in both the current numerical model and calculations by panel method it is reasonable to conjecture that the heaving amplitude in experiment is larger than the input value of numerical calculations which results in the thrust underestimation by both numerical models over experimental measurements 3 results and discussion in this section a comprehensive demonstration of propulsive characteristics for apwigs with various parameters is performed the foil section is taken as naca0012 with a chord length of 0 1 m the density ratio of structure over fluid is set as 15 to ensure numerical stability if not particularly specified typical set of parameters are set as following description the heaving amplitude and mean distance between two foils are 0 5c and 2c respectively the elastic pitching axis is fixed at 0 25 chord position from the leading edge non dimensional torsional stiffness of each foil for apwigs is set as 0 195 with the advance speed of 2 m s the considered range of reynolds number is between 100 000 and 500 000 for the whole parametric space 3 1 propulsive performance of apwigs to see the credibility of apwigs as a marine propulsor we perform a direct comparison between the current configuration and the fully prescribed biplane arrangement the kinematics of the latter system is characterized by both imposed pitch and heave motions using harmonic functions which can be found in several studies jones and platzer 1999 politis and tsarsitalidis 2013 in the current calculations the pitch leading phase angle for the fully prescribed system is fixed at 90 the oscillating frequency is set as 4 hz for all simulations corresponding to the reduced frequency that depends on advance speed since the maximum flow induced pitching angle for apwigs is less than 30 within the current parametric space we broadly test three pitching amplitudes for rigid foil configuration including 10 20 and 30 in addition all other geometry and motion parameters for two configurations are kept consistent fig 8 presents the comparison of propulsive efficiency as the function of advance coefficient between apwigs and the fully imposed configuration with a rigid shaft as the results show the maximum efficiency of apwigs is 68 9 at the advance ratio of 5 87 while the peak of efficiency for the fully prescribed system are 72 9 69 0 56 4 with pitching amplitude of 10 20 30 respectively for the rigid foil configuration the propulsive performance tends to drop rapidly after the advance number is larger than a certain value depending on pitching amplitude however by adding a spring based pitching elasticity the apwigs achieves the propulsive efficiency over 60 within a much wider range of advance coefficient compared with the fully imposed mechanism in addition it can be seen that the efficiency curve of apwigs tends to connect all the peaks of rigid foil configuration with different pitching amplitudes which was also numerically reported by thaweewat et al 2018 using a single oscillating foil such a propulsive characteristic is mainly attributed to the different responding mechanisms to flow separation and resulting stall by two propulsion systems basically the instantaneous effective aoa of the fully prescribed configuration is determined by the given kinematic parameters since the surrounding flow has no influence on the foil motion in contrast the time varying pitching angle of apwigs is adjusted by the flow conditions around the oscillating foils which can substantially reduce the maximum effective aoa and hence the flow separation during the operation fig 9 presents the time variation of flow induced pitching angle and corresponding effective aoa over five periodic cycles for apwigs it can be seen that the maximum pitching angle of apwigs show a decreasing trend with an increase of advance coefficient the peaks of effective aoa at the advance number of 1 96 3 92 5 87 7 83 are 27 0 16 4 12 0 10 9 respectively normally the stall angle for unsteady oscillating foil will be delayed to approximately 20 25 depending on the kinematics of configuration akbari and price 2003 consequently the severe flow separation can be avoided by the self controlled pitch motion of apwigs within a relatively wide range of advance number considering the rigid foil configuration with the pitching amplitude of 10 the maximum effective aoa at four advance numbers are 41 5 22 1 12 7 and 7 4 respectively obviously the severe flow separation is inevitable at the advance coefficient of 1 96 due to the extremely large effective aoa of 41 5 which produces a relatively poor propulsive performance as shown in fig 8 therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the limitation of applicable speed range for the fully prescribed configuration can be greatly improved by current apwigs with a proper spring stiffness to further investigate the inherent thrust producing mechanism for apwigs fig 10 presents the velocity contours in m s over one periodic cycle at three advance speeds the velocity surplus can be seen along the wake of each case such a jet like region of velocity field along the wake of each foil are mainly attributed to the generated reverse kármán vortex streets by oscillating foils which will be discussed in the following section for the low advance speed flow separation along both leading edge and trailing edge can be found due to the high instantaneous effective aoa which results in the relatively low efficiency of 47 4 for apwigs when the apwigs operates at a high advance number the highly attached flow along the leading edge of foils was found only slight flow separation along the trailing edge can be seen previous studies have indicated that the leading edge vortex behaviours have a significant effect on the thrust producing characteristics of oscillating foils platzer et al 2008 therefore constantly high propulsive efficiency can be obtained for apwigs operating at relatively high advance speed due to low flow separation and plain vortex behaviours along the leading edge the time averaged wake profiles for horizontal velocity corresponding to fig 10 are presented in fig 11 in which the cross section probes are set at one and half chord length downstream of the trailing edge it can be seen that a narrow profile of wake jet is generated along the downstream of each foil while the equilibrium plane between two foils appears a velocity deficit the wake profile of one foil is symmetric to that of another foil with respect to the produced ground plane in addition the wake jet of each oscillating foil tends to be more slender with the increase of advance coefficient such a wake profile of u velocity provides a much more straightforward demonstration towards the physical mechanism of thrust generation for apwigs the stable operation of the propulsion system at a given flow condition can always produce a momentum surplus over an oscillating periodic cycle which inherently leads to the forward thrust production 3 2 effect of oscillating frequency the effect of torsional spring stiffness using a fixed oscillating frequency on the propulsive performance of apwigs was studied previously wang et al 2019 in the current study we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the influence of oscillating frequency on the propulsive characteristics of apwigs the various stiffness coefficients are also considered in the calculations here we use three oscillating frequencies including 2 hz 4 hz 6 hz which produce the corresponding reduced frequencies of 0 31 0 63 0 94 the time history of flow induced pitching angle and effective aoa with different reduced frequencies are presented in fig 12 when using a relatively high spring stiffness at the medium reduced frequency the time variation of flow induced pitching angle tends to be chaotic due to the imbalance between hydrodynamic moments by the surrounding flow and restoring moments by the attached spring it can be seen that dynamic responses of apwigs are more sensitive to the attached torsional spring at a low oscillating frequency while much larger spring stiffness should be employed in the situation of high reduced frequency to produce the reasonable kinematics fig 13 presents the time variation of force coefficients for apwigs with different oscillating frequencies two peaks of time varying thrust over one periodic cycle can be seen for all cases in which the second peak is lower than the first one with respect to the lift coefficient there is a single peak in the time series over one periodic cycle both maximum thrust and lift coefficient show an increasing trend with a higher oscillating frequency in addition the time series of force coefficients present more complicated features when the reduced frequency is higher due to the corresponding evident vortex shedding it should be noted that the torsional spring stiffness plays an extremely important role in the hydro elasticity characteristics of apwigs at all three oscillating frequencies therefore it is necessary to perform an in depth study on the propulsive performance of apwigs based on the different oscillating frequencies as the function of stiffness coefficient the peak of flow induced pitching angle maximum effective aoa and pitch leading phase difference for apwigs at three reduced frequencies are presented in fig 14 as the results show the maximum pitching angle shows an increasing trend with a larger spring stiffness while it starts to drop with the further increase of stiffness coefficient the maximum pitching angle of apwigs at three reduced frequencies are 11 1 15 2 and 20 9 respectively the corresponding peak of effective aoa at reduced frequencies of 0 63 and 0 94 show an opposite trend with respect to the pitching angle after a rapid decrease with an increase of stiffness coefficient the peak of effective aoa starts to increase consistently when the spring stiffness is larger than a critical value in contrast the maximum effective aoa at the reduced frequency of 0 31 shows a consistently increasing trend with the stiffer torsional spring the peak of resulting effective aoa at three oscillating frequencies are 11 5 33 6 and 39 5 respectively it indicates that the flow separation and corresponding stall are inevitable for some cases at a relatively high reduced frequency in addition the sustained growth in the phase angle between the flow induced pitch and actively imposed heave can be seen with an increase of spring stiffness this is attributed to that the attached torsional spring with a larger stiffness tends to restore the oscillating foil towards the equilibrium position within a shorter period of time in general both the flow induced pitching angle and corresponding effective aoa tends to become larger when the reduced frequency is higher however the pitch leading phase difference shows a low sensitivity towards the oscillating frequency it varies within a relatively wide range between 60 and 160 depending on the torsional spring stiffness propulsive performance of apwigs with different oscillating frequencies as the function of stiffness coefficient is presented in fig 15 at the low reduced frequency both time averaged thrust and power coefficients show an increasing trend with an increase of spring stiffness however the propulsive efficiency tends to decrease consistently when the stiffness coefficient becomes larger due to the maximum effective aoa being below 15 at the reduced frequency of 0 31 a satisfactory propulsive performance with the efficiency over 60 was obtained for the considered range of spring stiffness with respect to the relatively high reduced frequency an initial rise in time averaged thrust with an increase of spring stiffness can be seen which is followed by a rapid drop when the stiffness coefficient further increases in contrast the time averaged power follows the trend that decrease firstly but then rise rapidly when the stiffness coefficient continues to increase as a result an obvious peak in propulsive efficiency at the reduced frequencies of 0 63 and 0 94 can be found in fig 15 in other words an optimal torsional spring stiffness that produces the highest propulsive efficiency can be found for the apwigs at a given oscillating frequency the maximum efficiency for the reduced frequencies of 0 31 0 63 0 94 are 65 9 63 1 and 54 8 respectively the corresponding stiffness coefficients are 0 06 0 18 and 0 39 which occurred at a pitch leading phase angle of 107 6 89 0 and 85 1 combined with our previous work wang et al 2019 a torsional spring stiffness that produces the pitch leading phase difference of 85 110 depending on advance speed tends to provide a satisfactory propulsive performance for apwigs it should be noted that all the maximum effective aoa for the highest efficiency at three reduced frequencies are below 25 which indicates that an attached flow around the foil surface is one of the crucial factors to ensure the satisfactory propulsive performance for apwigs basically such a propulsor at the larger oscillating frequency tends to produce higher forward thrust and require more input power while the optimal efficiency shows a consistent drop with the increase of reduced frequency the vortex evolution and shedding over one periodic cycle for apwigs with three reduced frequencies are presented in fig 16 for each situation the stiffness coefficient is selected as the value that produces the highest propulsive efficiency since the reduced frequency is a direct measurement for the ratio of oscillating velocity along the vertical direction over forward advance speed a smaller value of reduced frequency indicates lower effective aoa during the operation of apwigs consequently the high attachment of surrounding flow for both leading edge and trailing edge can be seen for the case of k 0 31 due to the maximum effective aoa that is below the dynamic stall angle with respect to the reduced frequencies of 0 63 and 0 94 the vortex shedding around both leading edge and trailing edge can be captured in the current simulations based on the results shown in fig 15 it is reasonable to conclude that the massive leading edge vortex shedding as well as the corresponding interaction of vortices between leading edge and trailing edge will change the pressure distribution along the body surface and cause some energy loss which thus are unfavourable to the propulsive performance of apwigs a typical process of vortex shedding for apwigs was clearly recorded by the calculation with a reduced frequency of 0 94 as shown in fig 16 c during the upstroke of the first periodic quarter the leading edge vortices starts to grow along the inside surface of each oscillating foil then the generated vortices tend to arrive at mid chord position when each foil reaches the maximum displacement after that the oscillating foils begin to perform downstroke motion in which the produced vortices move further towards downstream and finally shed into wake from the trailing edge as the elastic pitching axis of each foil reaches equilibrium position again when two foils cross the equilibrium plane to move further towards each other the leading edge vortices start to appear at the outside surface of each foil in the same manner these vortices will move towards the downstream during the upstroke of the last periodic quarter and shed into wake from the trailing edge when the oscillating foils return to the initial position in the current simulations the red and blue colours denote the vortices with anticlockwise and clockwise directions respectively considering the upper oscillating foil it can be seen that an anticlockwise vortex was generated during the first half periodic cycle while the motion in the second half cycle produces a clockwise vortex the vortex behaviours of the lower foil can be considered as the mirror image of the upper foil with respect to the resulting ground plane more importantly the reverse kármán vortex street can be obtained for each oscillating foil of apwigs which is characterized as the combination of a row of anticlockwise vortices above the symmetry plane and a row of clockwise vortices below the symmetry plane such a vortices pattern can induce a velocity surplus along the centreline of each foil indicating a thrust production 3 3 parametric study to investigate the effect of various parameters on the propulsive performance of apwigs we perform a comprehensive parametric study with different advance speeds it should be noted that the definition of advance coefficient includes multiple geometry and motion parameters for convenience we directly use the advance speed with the unit of m s to indicate the flow condition in the current section three flow speeds of 1 m s 2 m s and 3 m s are taken into consideration which produce the corresponding reynolds number of 100 000 200 000 and 300 000 respectively considered parameters include heaving amplitude position of elastic pitching axis and mean distance between two foils fig 17 presents the time history of flow induced pitching angle with different heaving amplitudes it can be seen that the maximum pitching angle consistently increase when the heaving amplitude becomes larger the sinusoidal like profile for the passive pitch motion was constantly maintained with the variation of heaving amplitude in addition the heaving amplitude has no influence on the phase difference between the induced pitch and the prescribed heave for apwigs the propulsive characteristics of apwigs with the variation of heaving amplitude are presented in fig 18 as the results show the time averaged thrust shows a continuous increase with the rise of non dimensional heaving amplitude with all three advance speeds especially the apwigs tends to produce drag with extremely low heaving amplitude as shown in cases of 1 m s and 2 m s using the heaving amplitude of 0 1c the propulsive efficiency shows a more complicated trend with respect to the effect of heaving amplitude it should be noted that the cases that generate drag are not presented in fig 18 b due to the corresponding negative efficiency for the advance speeds of 1 m s and 2 m s propulsive efficiency shows a trend that first increase and then decrease with the increase of heaving amplitude within the current parametric range the efficiency at advance velocity of 3 m s tends to continuously increase when the apwigs has a higher heaving amplitude the highest propulsive efficiency of apwigs for three advance speeds is 54 3 64 7 and 68 9 which are produced by the heaving amplitudes of 0 3c 0 4c and 0 5c respectively it is reasonable to conclude that an optimal heaving amplitude can be found for the apwigs producing the highest propulsive efficiency with a given flow condition in addition the optimal heaving amplitude tends to increase with a larger advance speed the time variation of flow induced pitching angle with different positions of elastic pitching axis at advance speed of 3 m s was presented in fig 19 it can be seen that the elastic axis position has an influence on both passive pitching angle and pitch leading phase difference here we consider five chord positions from the leading edge including 0 1c 0 15c 0 2c 0 25c and 1 3c the comprehensive results with respect to the maximum pitching angle and phase difference for apwigs with the variation of elastic axis position at three advance speeds are presented in table 4 as the results show the peak of flow induced pitching angle tends to firstly increase and then decrease with the rise of distance between the leading edge and the elastic pitching axis for all three advance speeds however the pitch leading phase difference shows a generally increasing trend with a larger elastic axis distance from leading edge overall the flow induced pitch motion tends to produce a lowest peak of pitching angle at the 0 25 chord position from leading edge which thus has a significant effect on the maximum effective aoa as indicated in previous section the pitch leading phase angle within the range of 85 110 for apwigs tends to produce higher propulsive efficiency it can be seen that the elastic axis position from leading edge within the range of 1 4c to 1 3c tends to result in a desired phase difference the effect of elastic axis position on the propulsive performance of apwigs is presented in fig 20 basically the apwigs at advance speeds of 1 m s and 2 m s tends to produce the drag when the distance of elastic pitching axis from the leading edge is below 0 2c with the further movement of pivot axis towards the mid chord position the time averaged thrust at the advance speed of 1 m s shows a continuously increasing trend while the case of 2 m s produces the maximum thrust with an elastic pitching axis of 0 25 chord position from leading edge with respect to the advance velocity of 3 m s a general increase in time averaged thrust can be seen when the elastic pitching axis becomes farther to the leading edge it should be noted that the flow induced pitch motion tends to be chaotic and aperiodic for the speed of 3 m s when the elastic axis position from leading edge is beyond 0 25c therefore the numerical results at speed of 3 m s with the elastic pitching axis of 0 3 and 1 3 chord positions from leading edge were not presented with respect to propulsive efficiency its trend of first increase and then drop with the increase of elastic axis distance from leading is shown in fig 20 b as can be seen from the numerical results the propulsive efficiency at advance speed of 2 m s with an elastic pitching axis of 0 20 chord position from leading edge shows a sudden drop fig 21 presents the comparison of time variation of flow induced pitching angle with two positions of elastic pitching axis at advance speed of 2 m s it was found that the aperiodic and consistently declining pitch motion is the main reason for the sudden drop of propulsive performance with elastic pitching axis of 0 20c current calculations indicate that the flow induced pitch motion of apwigs tends to be unstable with an extremely close position of elastic pitching axis from leading edge depending on advance speed the maximum efficiencies for the three advance speeds are 47 2 63 1 and 70 1 which are obtained by the elastic pitching axis of 0 2 and 0 25 chord position from leading edge generally the elastic pitching axis around 0 25 chord position from leading edge tends to produce a satisfactory performance at the low speeds as to a relatively high advance velocity the elastic pitching axis around 0 2 chord position from leading edge should be considered to provide an optimal efficiency for apwigs with respect to effect of mean distance between two foils we perform a direct comparison of propulsive performance of apwigs with the single auto pitch configuration a medium heaving amplitude of 0 3c is employed for this part of the calculation fig 22 shows the time history of passive pitching angle with different mean distances between two foils at the advance speed of 3 m s as the results show the pitch motion of apwigs tends to be consistent with that of single auto pitch configuration when the equilibrium distance is relatively large the wing in ground effect produced by anti phase oscillating biplane arrangement on the flow induced pitch motion becomes more obvious as a relatively short mean distance between two foils is used compared with the pitching variation of single auto pitch oscillating foil the resulting wing in ground effect tends to increase the flow induced pitching angle during the upstroke and decrease the value at the downstroke it can also be observed that the variation of mean distance has no apparent influence on the pitch leading phase difference for apwigs the influence of equilibrium distance between two foils on the propulsive performance of apwigs is presented in fig 23 the blue dashed lines denote the results of single auto pitch configuration note that the thrust coefficient of apwigs is the average of that for each foil as the results show the time averaged thrust tends to consistently increase with the decrease of mean distance between two foils when the mean distance is larger than 5c the generated thrust agrees to a fixed value which is still larger than that of the single oscillating foil the maximum time averaged thrust generated by each foil of apwigs is approximately 1 5 times that of the single oscillating foil within the current parametric space a similar trend was found in the characteristics of propulsive efficiency as shown in fig 23 b a higher efficiency can be obtained for apwigs when one foil is set closer to another one the propulsive efficiency of apwigs finally converges to around 53 with the mean distance over 5c it can be seen that there is a constant increase of 2 in propulsive efficiency for apwigs over the single auto pitch configuration even though the mean distance between two foils is considerably large the maximum increase around 12 in propulsive efficiency was obtained by the produced wing in ground effect in which the apwigs employs a mean distance of 1 2c 4 conclusions a parametric study on the propulsive performance of apwig was conducted numerically in this paper the apwigs has a biplane arrangement in which the kinematics are characterized as an actively prescribed heave motion in counterphase and passively flow induced pitch motion after the comprehensive verification and validation of numerical model a comparative investigation into the propulsive characteristics between apwigs and dual foil fully imposed configuration was performed it was found that the apwigs can maintain a satisfactory efficiency within a wider range of advance speed over fully imposed system with a rigid shaft by attaching a torsional spring to the pivot axis of each foil the apwigs can adjust the maximum pitching angle to adapt different loaded conditions which will reduce the effective aoa and thus decrease the flow separation during the operation based on the time averaged wake profile in downstream it was confirmed that the apwigs can produce a momentum surplus over an oscillating periodic cycle inherently indicating the thrust production the investigation into the effect of oscillating frequency on the propulsive characteristics provides us with more insights into the thrust producing mechanism of apwigs the flow separation around the oscillating foils tends to be mild at a low reduced frequency which is attributed to the relatively small effective aoa with respect to a high reduced frequency obvious vortex shedding along both leading edge and trailing edge can be captured by the current model a typical reverse kármán vortex street characterizing as a row of anticlockwise vortices above the symmetry plane and a row of clockwise vortices below the symmetry plane was obtained in the wake of each oscillating foil for apwigs it was believed that such a vortex pattern induces a momentum surplus in the downstream appearing as a jet like wake profile in general the propulsive efficiency of apwigs shows a decreasing trend with an increase of reduced frequency with a fixed oscillating frequency and a given flow condition an optimal torsional spring stiffness can be found to produce the highest propulsive efficiency for the apwigs the major interest of the current study lies in the influence of various parameters on the propulsive performance of apwigs the numerical results demonstrated that heaving amplitude and mean distance only have an effect on the peak of the flow induced pitching angle while both the pitch leading phase difference and the maximum passive pitching angle are affected by the position of the elastic pitching axis the propulsive efficiency tends to increase firstly and then decrease with a consistent growth of heaving amplitude which indicates that there is an optimal value generating the best propulsive performance based on the requirement of thrust as to the position of elastic pitching axis results showed that 0 2 to 0 25 chord position from the leading edge tends to produce the satisfactory efficiency depending on the advance speed within the current parametric space it was found that the thrust production by apwigs is 1 5 times that of a single auto pitch configuration and the maximum efficiency improvement due to the wing in ground effect is approximately 12 in summary by employing an appropriate combination of various parameters the apwigs with the self adjusted pitch and resulting wing in ground effect can perform a satisfactory propulsion performance as a marine propulsor credit authorship contribution statement jiadong wang data curation formal analysis writing

21990,a parametric study on the propulsive performance of auto pitch wing in ground effect oscillating foil propulsors apwigs was conducted using an unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes solver the harmonic sinusoidal function is actively imposed to the heave motion of such a configuration which has a passively flow induced pitch motion restrained by torsional springs comparative investigation between apwigs and fully prescribed system was performed indicating that apwigs is capable of producing a satisfactory propulsive efficiency within a wide range of advance speed the jet like profiles implying the time averaged momentum surplus were obtained in the wake of apwigs which is attributed to the produced reverse kármán vortex street behind each oscillating foil obvious vortex shedding along both leading edge and trailing edge can be observed at a high reduced frequency while the low oscillating frequency corresponding to a small reduced frequency tends to produce the high efficiency due to the highly attached flow around foil surface furthermore comprehensive computations for the influence of multiple parameters on the hydro elasticity responses and propulsive characteristics of apwigs were conducted in the current study we noted that heaving amplitude and equilibrium distance only affect the maximum flow induced pitching angle nonetheless the position of elastic pitching axis shows a significant effect on both pitch leading phase difference and the maximum pitching angle the maximum increase of propulsive efficiency around 12 due to the wing in ground effect was discovered within the considered parametric space it was found that the apwigs can achieve a high efficiency of over 70 with the appropriate combination of geometry and motion parameters

motivates human beings to pursue more superior propulsion systems for modern marine vehicles with the wide application of autonomous underwater vehicles auvs in the last few decades there is growing interest in the study of oscillating foil propulsors early efforts were mainly devoted into the physical explanation of thrust producing mechanism it was well known that the wake profile is characterized by a reverse kármán vortex street for the flapping wing generating forward thrust recent studies in oscillating foil propulsors tend to focus on the practical application for both auvs and surface ships the parametric combination of pitch and heave producing optimal propulsive efficiency has become a concern among the related works it was well established that oscillating foil propulsor has shown a significant potential in manoeuvrability implementation and efficiency enhancement compared with conventional screw propellers basically the propulsion systems employing the oscillating foils can be divided into two groups in terms of performed kinematics including the fully imposed configuration and semi active configuration the most common configuration for propulsion is the single oscillating foil with a fully imposed motion which can be traced back to early last century garrick 1937 it was revealed that a heaving foil tends to produce thrust over the whole oscillating frequency range while a pitching foil only generates the thrust with the frequency above a certain value extensive studies were conducted to explore the oscillating mechanism corresponding to a high efficiency using both theoretical methods wu 1971 lighthill 1975 cheng and murillo 1984 and model test scherer 1968 delaurier and harris 1982 the effect of flexibility and finite aspect ratio were considered by liu 1991 1996 using the vortex lattice method and panel method to pursue satisfactory propulsive performance for oscillating foil system a set of experiments on thrust producing oscillating foils with harmonically heave and pitch motion were conducted by anderson et al 1998 which reported a high propulsive efficiency of 87 based on the appropriate parameter combination including the range of strouhal number that lies in 0 25 0 4 large heaving amplitude maximum angle of attack aoa between 15 and 20 and the pitch leading phase angle of 75 a similar experimental study was performed by read et al 2003 with variation of multiple parameters indicating that the pitch leading phase angle between 90 and 100 is more likely to produce the best propulsive performance with the development of measuring methods and computational resources the latest studies with respect to the single oscillating foil tend to focus on the more complicated issues including the transition of boundary cavitation and ground effect yang et al 2010 lapointe and dumas 2011 akcabay et al 2014 perkins et al 2017 the biplane arrangement with a symmetric plane is considered to produce a resulting wing in ground effect when two foils oscillate in counterphase such an effect can improve the propulsive performance in both thrust production and efficiency enhancement compared with single foil configuration jones and platzer 1997 performed the first comprehensive computation on biplane arrangement with the consideration of both heave only motion and combined heave pitch motion after that jones and platzer 1999 and jones et al 2002 conducted a series of measurements in hydrodynamic forces and flow visualization which showed that the propulsive characteristics with a dual mode motion combined pitch and heave has an apparent dependency on the reynolds number a similar numerical study was performed by tuncer and kaya 2005 indicating that the biplane configuration can produce 20 40 more thrust over a single oscillating foil a wing in ground effect propulsor with an anti phase heave only motion was investigated by liu 2005b using a three dimensional panel method systematic calculations with the consideration of various parameters were conducted in his study which confirmed that a small distance between two oscillating foils can enhance the wing in ground effect and thus improve the efficiency to a large extent a direct comparison of propulsive performance between heave only biplane configuration and screw propeller was performed by liu et al 2010 based on a parametric similitude frame it was found that the wing in ground effect propulsor has an independence of advance speed under the assumption of ideal fluid the open water characteristics of dual foil configuration with combined heave pitch motion was studied numerically by politis and tsarsitalidis 2013 which reported a higher thrust coefficient over conventional propellers especially it was found that such a configuration can operate at an optimal efficiency without the cavitation issue more recently wang and xuan 2016 performed a numerical study on the wing in ground effect propulsor in dual mode motion using an unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes solver an increase of around 8 in propulsive efficiency was obtained by the biplane configuration over the single oscillating foil in this study the semi active configuration can be found in extensive studies on the energy harvester young et al 2014 xiao and zhu 2014 characterizing as the prescribed pitch and damping based heave however investigations into oscillating foil with an elastic support as a propulsor are still rare up to now since the heave motion of oscillating foil propulsor generates most of the thrust the semi active configuration usually employs an actively imposed heave motion and the spring restricted pitch motion such a flow adjusted pitching motion is expected to decrease the instantaneous flow separation and simplify the controlling mechanism it should be noted that unlike the configuration with a rigid shaft in the unsteady flow an oscillating foil using an elastic pitching axis introduces the issue of hydro elasticity and fluid structure coupling a multi fidelity study on a semi active propulsor was carried out by willis et al 2007 in which a torsional spring is attached to the leading edge of the oscillating foil the main focus of the research was lied in the construction of the computational frame while the detailed demonstration for the propulsive performance of oscillating foil with a passive pitch was not performed the locomotion of a passively flapping flat plate was numerically studied by zhang et al 2010 using a multiblock lattice boltzmann method indicating that there are two dynamic responses for the passively pitching plate depending on the ratio of natural frequency over heaving frequency especially it was found that the corresponding propulsive performance at the forward movement regime was remarkably improved by the torsional flexibility a similar numerical study on the passively flapping wing that generates a forward or backward motion regime was performed by xiao et al 2014 the frequency of passive pitch was found to be identical to that of prescribed heave when the flapping wing reaches the stable periodic state a systematic calculation with respect to the effect of torsional stiffness on the propulsive performance of semi active oscillating foil propulsor was conducted by thaweewat et al 2018 using the boundary element method satisfactory efficiency was obtained within a wide range of flow conditions for such a configuration which was considered to have analogical open water characteristics with a variable pitch propeller it should be mentioned that the configuration of interest in these studies is restricted to the single oscillating foil the oscillating foil propulsor with a biplane arrangement and the flow induced pitch based on attached torsional springs first appeared at a technical patent by liu 2005a the original intention of this design is to improve the start up thrust and propulsive efficiency of wing in ground effect oscillating foil propulsor by introducing an elastic pitching axis it was expected that the apwigs can adapt the different loaded conditions compared with the biplane configuration with the rigid shaft the effect of torsional spring stiffness on the hydrodynamic behaviours of apwigs has been studied numerically by our previous work wang et al 2019 which seems to be the first evaluation on such a configuration as per the knowledge of authors in the current study we conduct a two dimensional investigation into the influence of multiple motion and geometry parameters on the propulsive characteristics of apwigs which aims to provide the essential implications and guidance for marine applications the rest of this paper is organized as follows the basic methodology verification and validation of numerical model are described in the second section then we present our main computational results and corresponding discussion in the third section the conclusions and major findings are summarized in the last section 2 computational methodology 2 1 motion description in the current study the considered configuration of apwigs experiences an active harmonic heave motion in counterphase and a hydrodynamic induced pitch motion as shown in the left schematic of fig 1 the heave motion is defined by a simple sinusoidal function with amplitude of h 0 and angular frequency of ω a torsional spring is attached to the pivot axis of each foil to restore the foil towards the equilibrium position in addition it does not have any other degrees of freedom with the generated ground plane by two anti phase oscillating foils one foil can be considered as the mirror image of another foil during the operation for the apwigs moving at a constant advance speed of u the instantaneous effective aoa at an arbitrary instant can be defined in the right side of fig 1 and the expression as follow 1 α t tan 1 1 u d h t d t θ t where θ t and h t denote the time varying pitching angle and vertical position of elastic pitching axis respectively the non dimensional frequency is one of the most important parameters used to analyse the inherent flow physics of oscillating foils it is usually represented by either the strouhal number st or reduced frequency k st can be extensively found in studies that focus on the specific range of this parameter producing efficient performance for both animals and artificial structures taylor et al 2003 while researchers prefer measuring the ratio of two characteristic speeds for a particular configuration using k platzer et al 2008 we follow the definition of anderson et al 1998 in which these two parameters are given as follows 2 s t f a u 3 k w c 2 u where f denotes the oscillating frequency in hz a is the characteristic width of the created jet flow which is usually determined by the total excursion of the trailing edge of the foil w and c denote the angular frequency w 2πf and chord length respectively since the maximum displacement of the trailing edge is unknown before the simulation we use the reduced frequency to represent the non dimensional frequency of apwigs torsional spring stiffness is another critical parameter that is relevant to the dynamic responses of system and hence affect the propulsive performance of apwigs it can be represented by the frequency ratio as follows 4 r f f n f 5 f n 1 2 π k i a x i s where f n denotes the natural frequency k and i axis are stiffness of system and moment of inertia respectively the non dimensional torsional spring stiffness can be alternatively defined as follow 6 k k ρ u 2 a 0 c where ρ is the fluid density and a 0 denotes the foil planform area in the current study we employ eq 6 to define the non dimensional torsional spring stiffness of apwigs based on the transform method by floc h et al 2012 an advance coefficient for oscillating foil configuration can be defined as follow which imitates the advance number of traditional propellers 7 j u f d f o i l 8 d f o i l 8 h 0 a 0 π c where h 0 is the heaving amplitude of the oscillating foil and d foil denotes the equivalent diameter of the foil therefore we can present the propulsive performance of apwigs as a function of advance coefficient similar to the open water characteristics of marine propellers the propulsive performance of apwigs is characterized as the time averaged thrust f and input power p over one periodic cycle t as follows 9 f 1 t t t t x t d t 10 p 1 t t t t y t d h t d t d t where x t and y t denote the time varying forces in forward and vertical directions respectively the propulsive efficiency can be defined as the ratio of useful power over input power 11 η f u p the non dimensional coefficients of thrust and power can be defined as follows 12 c t f 0 5 ρ u 2 a 0 13 c p p 0 5 ρ u 3 a 0 alternatively the propulsive efficiency can be expressed as the ratio of thrust coefficient over power coefficient η c t c p 2 2 fluid solver the unsteady flow around the oscillating foils is simulated by the open source cfd code openfoam the finite volume method is used to solve the incompressible navier stokes equations arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method and sliding mesh technique are two efficient approaches to solve the mesh motion of fluid structure interaction and moving boundary a continuous adaptation of mesh without modifying the topology is involved in an ale model while a sliding interface dividing the moving zone and stationary zone is introduced in the sliding mesh model since the mesh motion is moderate in the current simulations the calculation of mass and momentum equations is performed in the moving grid domain using ale method ferziger and peric 2012 the governing equations of fluid can be expressed as the integral form for an arbitrary moving volume v bounded by a closed surface s 14 d d t v ρ u d v s d s ρ u u b u s d s p i ρ υ u where u is the fluid velocity u b denotes the boundary velocity of a finite volume p and ν are the pressure and kinematic viscosity respectively commonly used turbulence models include unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans detached eddy simulation des large eddy simulation les as a hybrid turbulence model of statistical and scale resolving methods the des is more computationally economic than les usta and korkut 2018 although des can provide more insight into the details of flow behaviours compared with urans its requirements of mesh density and computational cost are still extremely high for a large scale parametric computation it is well known that urans can provide a satisfactory prediction for the attached flow and simple geometry with the relatively cheap computational sources for the highly complex separated flow simulations based on urans is not able to distinguish the turbulent chaotic and quasi periodic features of flow field for the most cases breuer et al 2003 since the geometry and flow phenomena in the current simulations are less complicated in addition the flow separation is moderate for the most of situations therefore the turbulence effect is simulated by the urans model in this study which is believed to provide a satisfactory prediction in the hydrodynamic characteristics of oscillating foil configuration the two equation sst k ω turbulence model menter 1993 is used to close the resulting system of fluid equations the minimum y plus at near wall region is set as 45 to ensure that the first mesh cell centre is placed in the log law region the flow behaviours in the viscous layer are modelled by the introduced approximation of wall functions as for the boundary conditions the constant and uniform velocity is imposed at the inlet of the computational domain the boundary condition of downstream outlet is set as the constant static pressure the foil boundary is implemented as the moving wall with no flux normal to the body surface in the current numerical model time discretization is performed by the first order implicit euler scheme for space discretization a second order linear upwind scheme and a second order scheme based on linear interpolation are used to discretise the convection terms and diffusion terms respectively the pressure velocity coupling is solved by the pimple scheme which is a combination of pressure implicit split operator piso algorithm and semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple algorithm with respect to the discretised equations the generalised geometric algebraic multi grid gamg method is employed to calculate the pressure equations the calculation of velocity and turbulence equations is conducted by the preconditioned bi conjugate gradient pbicg method the fluid structure coupling is another issue in terms of auto pitch configuration the heave motion of apwigs is actively prescribed by an actuating system while the pitch motion is determined by the combination of hydrodynamic forces acting on the foils with restoring moment of the attached torsional springs consequently the dynamic responses are governed by following equations 15 h t h 0 sin ω t 16 m a x i s i a x i s θ d p i t c h θ k p i t c h θ where m axis denotes the hydrodynamic moment d pitch and k pitch are the viscous damping coefficient and torsional spring stiffness coefficient respectively note that the viscous damping coefficient is set as zero in this study in the current numerical model a six degree of freedom 6 dof solver in openfoam is modified to perform the kinematics of apwigs and solve the fluid structure interaction the solution of eq 16 is conducted using a second order explicit scheme symplectic splitting method dullweber et al 1997 based on the initial position and speed of foils the velocity and pressure fields of the whole computational domain will be calculated by fluid solver then the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the foils can be determined by the integral of pressure fields along with body boundaries and thus the new position and velocity of each foil can be updated by eqs 15 and 16 once the convergence criteria are satisfied the iteration loop will move on to next time step 2 3 verification and validation the schematic of computational domain is presented in fig 2 which has a horizontal length of 50c and a vertical height of 40c fig 3 shows the mesh resolution and division details around each foil for the apwigs which is generated by the software package of icem cfd the typical time histories of flow induced pitching angle and force coefficients for apwigs are shown in fig 4 numerical results show that both the pitching angles of two foils and force coefficients of each foil tend to present the periodic characteristics after the fourth periodic cycle especially the pitching angle of the upper foil has the same value and opposite direction with that of the lower foil which indicates that the dynamic responses of the two foils are symmetric with respect to the generated ground plane if not particularly indicated the rest of the numerical simulations are monitored with five periodic cycles to make sure that each case reaches a periodic state moreover all time averaged results are obtained based on the calculation of the last periodic cycle a verification study with respect to both the time step and grid size was carried out using the correlation factor method stern et al 2001 wilson et al 2001 in order to evaluate the numerical uncertainties three solutions with systematically refined time step or grid size were conducted when the convergence study of one input parameter was performed all other input parameters were kept constant the numerical setup for the convergence study is shown in table 1 in which the uniform refinement ratio of 2 and 2 for the time step and grid size are used respectively satisfactory independence of time and space can be obtained in fig 5 which presents the variation of thrust coefficients over one periodic cycle it should be noted that time step in the current simulations is limited by the maximum courant number of 0 9 which ensure the maximum time increment is less than 8 10 5 the current study follows the procedure by stern et al 2006 to estimate the numerical uncertainties with respect to the time step and grid size time averaged thrust and power coefficients are selected as the integral variables to perform the uncertainty calculation it is assumed that iterative errors are negligible compared with the time step and grid size convergence errors in this study therefore the numerical errors are decomposed into the contributions from the time step and grid size the variations of thrust and power coefficients between fine medium and coarse solutions for kth input parameter can be calculated as 17 ε k 21 s 2 s 1 18 ε k 32 s 3 s 2 the convergence ratio is defined as the changes between the medium fine and coarse medium solutions 19 r k ε k 21 ε k 32 where s 1 s 2 and s 3 denote the solution from the fine medium and coarse input parameter respectively convergence ratio is employed to determine the convergence conditions which include i monotonic convergence 0 r k 1 ii oscillatory convergence r k 0 r k 1 iii monotonic divergence r k 1 iv oscillatory divergence r k 0 r k 1 for the condition ii numerical uncertainties are predicted by bounding the error based on oscillation with maximum and minimum solutions the errors and uncertainties cannot be estimated for condition iii and iv with respect to the condition i numerical errors and uncertainties are estimated by generalised richardson extrapolation which provides the estimate for one term numerical error and order of accuracy as following equations 20 δ r e k 1 ε k 21 r k p k 1 21 p k ln ε k 32 ε k 21 ln r k where r k is the uniform refinement ratio for kth input parameter a correction factor is employed to account for the effect of higher order terms for the error and uncertainty estimates defined as 22 c k r k p k 1 r k p k e s t 1 where p kest is an estimate for the limiting order of accuracy an improved error estimate can be obtained based on the multiplication of eq 20 by the correction factor 23 δ k c k δ r e k 1 the uncorrected uncertainty u k and corrected uncertainty u kc are estimated by following equations depending on the distance of solutions to the asymptotic range 24 u k 9 6 1 c k 2 1 1 δ r e k 1 1 c k 0 125 2 1 c k 1 δ r e k 1 1 c k 0 125 25 u k c 2 4 1 c k 2 0 1 δ r e k 1 1 c k 0 25 1 c k δ r e k 1 1 c k 0 25 numerical uncertainty with respect to time step and grid size are presented in tables 2 and 3 respectively results indicate that time averaged thrust coefficient has a certain sensitivity for the time step resolution while time averaged power coefficient tends to be more sensitive to the grid size resolution reasonably low level of uncertainty referring to both the time step and grid size was obtained for two integral coefficients the maximum uncertainty level of 3 19 was lied in the time averaged thrust coefficient in time step convergence calculation the current numerical model was validated by comparing with experimental data for the actively prescribed configurations the first benchmark experiment is selected to be the study conducted by anderson et al 1998 which measured propulsive characteristics of a single oscillating foil with fully imposed heave and pitch motion fig 6 presents the comparison of time averaged thrust and power coefficients between current simulations and experimental measurements the configuration has a heaving amplitude of 0 75c and the pitch leading phase angle of 90 the effective aoa is set as a constant value of 15 by adjusting the pitching amplitude and oscillating frequency it can be seen that the major discrepancy between the current results and experimental data was lied in the thrust calculation satisfactory agreement for the power coefficient was obtained indicating that tip vortex shedding due to three dimensional effect is not the major contribution to the disagreement in the current simulations the thrust calculation was also performed using the spalart allmaras turbulence model spalart and allmaras 1992 and k epsilon turbulence model launder and spalding 1983 as shown in fig 6 a the negligible difference between the three numerical models indicates that turbulent effect is not the dominant cause to the discrepancy the disagreement of the thrust coefficient between the current calculations and experimental measurements is mainly attributed to the mismatched baseline of zero horizontal force along the advance speed according to read et al 2003 the data was initialized to zero after the carriage starts to move before oscillation of foil in the measurements by anderson et al 1998 it leads to an artificially high value of mean thrust due to the exclusion of drag in contrast the current results were set as zero value before any motion of carriage and foil starts which ensures that the drag acting on the foil will be included in the thrust calculation for the biplane arrangement our previous study wang et al 2019 performed a validation test with respect to the prescribed heave only configuration which shows an acceptable agreement between the simulation and the experiment here we considered a biplane configuration with dual mode motion combined heave and pitch which has been studied by jones and platzer 1999 experimentally the prescribed pitching and heaving amplitudes of this propulsive system are 5 and 0 335c respectively the pivot axis is set at mid chord position with pitch leading phase angle of 90 detailed geometry and motion parameters of this dual foil configuration can be found in jones and platzer 1999 the comparison of time averaged thrust coefficient between the current calculations and experimental measurements is presented in fig 7 which also presents the numerical results by jones and platzer 1999 using two dimensional panel method the results showed that both the current model and panel method tend to underestimate the thrust at relatively high advance speeds for the heavily loaded conditions with lower speeds satisfactory agreement between the numerical results and experimental measurements can be seen especially current thrust predictions have a remarkably great agreement with the calculations using two dimensional panel method jones and platzer 1999 which indicates that the three dimensional effect and resulting tip vortex behaviour are partly responsible for the thrust underestimation of numerical calculations in addition another likely reason causing such a discrepancy is the flexibility of wings in the experiment a relatively high aspect ratio of 20 was used in the measurements due to the effect of flexibility the heaving amplitude in the wing tip should be higher than the value in the wing root as a result the averaged heaving amplitude of the whole wing in the experiment was supposed to be larger than the initial set value however the assumption of rigid body was implemented in both the current numerical model and calculations by panel method it is reasonable to conjecture that the heaving amplitude in experiment is larger than the input value of numerical calculations which results in the thrust underestimation by both numerical models over experimental measurements 3 results and discussion in this section a comprehensive demonstration of propulsive characteristics for apwigs with various parameters is performed the foil section is taken as naca0012 with a chord length of 0 1 m the density ratio of structure over fluid is set as 15 to ensure numerical stability if not particularly specified typical set of parameters are set as following description the heaving amplitude and mean distance between two foils are 0 5c and 2c respectively the elastic pitching axis is fixed at 0 25 chord position from the leading edge non dimensional torsional stiffness of each foil for apwigs is set as 0 195 with the advance speed of 2 m s the considered range of reynolds number is between 100 000 and 500 000 for the whole parametric space 3 1 propulsive performance of apwigs to see the credibility of apwigs as a marine propulsor we perform a direct comparison between the current configuration and the fully prescribed biplane arrangement the kinematics of the latter system is characterized by both imposed pitch and heave motions using harmonic functions which can be found in several studies jones and platzer 1999 politis and tsarsitalidis 2013 in the current calculations the pitch leading phase angle for the fully prescribed system is fixed at 90 the oscillating frequency is set as 4 hz for all simulations corresponding to the reduced frequency that depends on advance speed since the maximum flow induced pitching angle for apwigs is less than 30 within the current parametric space we broadly test three pitching amplitudes for rigid foil configuration including 10 20 and 30 in addition all other geometry and motion parameters for two configurations are kept consistent fig 8 presents the comparison of propulsive efficiency as the function of advance coefficient between apwigs and the fully imposed configuration with a rigid shaft as the results show the maximum efficiency of apwigs is 68 9 at the advance ratio of 5 87 while the peak of efficiency for the fully prescribed system are 72 9 69 0 56 4 with pitching amplitude of 10 20 30 respectively for the rigid foil configuration the propulsive performance tends to drop rapidly after the advance number is larger than a certain value depending on pitching amplitude however by adding a spring based pitching elasticity the apwigs achieves the propulsive efficiency over 60 within a much wider range of advance coefficient compared with the fully imposed mechanism in addition it can be seen that the efficiency curve of apwigs tends to connect all the peaks of rigid foil configuration with different pitching amplitudes which was also numerically reported by thaweewat et al 2018 using a single oscillating foil such a propulsive characteristic is mainly attributed to the different responding mechanisms to flow separation and resulting stall by two propulsion systems basically the instantaneous effective aoa of the fully prescribed configuration is determined by the given kinematic parameters since the surrounding flow has no influence on the foil motion in contrast the time varying pitching angle of apwigs is adjusted by the flow conditions around the oscillating foils which can substantially reduce the maximum effective aoa and hence the flow separation during the operation fig 9 presents the time variation of flow induced pitching angle and corresponding effective aoa over five periodic cycles for apwigs it can be seen that the maximum pitching angle of apwigs show a decreasing trend with an increase of advance coefficient the peaks of effective aoa at the advance number of 1 96 3 92 5 87 7 83 are 27 0 16 4 12 0 10 9 respectively normally the stall angle for unsteady oscillating foil will be delayed to approximately 20 25 depending on the kinematics of configuration akbari and price 2003 consequently the severe flow separation can be avoided by the self controlled pitch motion of apwigs within a relatively wide range of advance number considering the rigid foil configuration with the pitching amplitude of 10 the maximum effective aoa at four advance numbers are 41 5 22 1 12 7 and 7 4 respectively obviously the severe flow separation is inevitable at the advance coefficient of 1 96 due to the extremely large effective aoa of 41 5 which produces a relatively poor propulsive performance as shown in fig 8 therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the limitation of applicable speed range for the fully prescribed configuration can be greatly improved by current apwigs with a proper spring stiffness to further investigate the inherent thrust producing mechanism for apwigs fig 10 presents the velocity contours in m s over one periodic cycle at three advance speeds the velocity surplus can be seen along the wake of each case such a jet like region of velocity field along the wake of each foil are mainly attributed to the generated reverse kármán vortex streets by oscillating foils which will be discussed in the following section for the low advance speed flow separation along both leading edge and trailing edge can be found due to the high instantaneous effective aoa which results in the relatively low efficiency of 47 4 for apwigs when the apwigs operates at a high advance number the highly attached flow along the leading edge of foils was found only slight flow separation along the trailing edge can be seen previous studies have indicated that the leading edge vortex behaviours have a significant effect on the thrust producing characteristics of oscillating foils platzer et al 2008 therefore constantly high propulsive efficiency can be obtained for apwigs operating at relatively high advance speed due to low flow separation and plain vortex behaviours along the leading edge the time averaged wake profiles for horizontal velocity corresponding to fig 10 are presented in fig 11 in which the cross section probes are set at one and half chord length downstream of the trailing edge it can be seen that a narrow profile of wake jet is generated along the downstream of each foil while the equilibrium plane between two foils appears a velocity deficit the wake profile of one foil is symmetric to that of another foil with respect to the produced ground plane in addition the wake jet of each oscillating foil tends to be more slender with the increase of advance coefficient such a wake profile of u velocity provides a much more straightforward demonstration towards the physical mechanism of thrust generation for apwigs the stable operation of the propulsion system at a given flow condition can always produce a momentum surplus over an oscillating periodic cycle which inherently leads to the forward thrust production 3 2 effect of oscillating frequency the effect of torsional spring stiffness using a fixed oscillating frequency on the propulsive performance of apwigs was studied previously wang et al 2019 in the current study we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the influence of oscillating frequency on the propulsive characteristics of apwigs the various stiffness coefficients are also considered in the calculations here we use three oscillating frequencies including 2 hz 4 hz 6 hz which produce the corresponding reduced frequencies of 0 31 0 63 0 94 the time history of flow induced pitching angle and effective aoa with different reduced frequencies are presented in fig 12 when using a relatively high spring stiffness at the medium reduced frequency the time variation of flow induced pitching angle tends to be chaotic due to the imbalance between hydrodynamic moments by the surrounding flow and restoring moments by the attached spring it can be seen that dynamic responses of apwigs are more sensitive to the attached torsional spring at a low oscillating frequency while much larger spring stiffness should be employed in the situation of high reduced frequency to produce the reasonable kinematics fig 13 presents the time variation of force coefficients for apwigs with different oscillating frequencies two peaks of time varying thrust over one periodic cycle can be seen for all cases in which the second peak is lower than the first one with respect to the lift coefficient there is a single peak in the time series over one periodic cycle both maximum thrust and lift coefficient show an increasing trend with a higher oscillating frequency in addition the time series of force coefficients present more complicated features when the reduced frequency is higher due to the corresponding evident vortex shedding it should be noted that the torsional spring stiffness plays an extremely important role in the hydro elasticity characteristics of apwigs at all three oscillating frequencies therefore it is necessary to perform an in depth study on the propulsive performance of apwigs based on the different oscillating frequencies as the function of stiffness coefficient the peak of flow induced pitching angle maximum effective aoa and pitch leading phase difference for apwigs at three reduced frequencies are presented in fig 14 as the results show the maximum pitching angle shows an increasing trend with a larger spring stiffness while it starts to drop with the further increase of stiffness coefficient the maximum pitching angle of apwigs at three reduced frequencies are 11 1 15 2 and 20 9 respectively the corresponding peak of effective aoa at reduced frequencies of 0 63 and 0 94 show an opposite trend with respect to the pitching angle after a rapid decrease with an increase of stiffness coefficient the peak of effective aoa starts to increase consistently when the spring stiffness is larger than a critical value in contrast the maximum effective aoa at the reduced frequency of 0 31 shows a consistently increasing trend with the stiffer torsional spring the peak of resulting effective aoa at three oscillating frequencies are 11 5 33 6 and 39 5 respectively it indicates that the flow separation and corresponding stall are inevitable for some cases at a relatively high reduced frequency in addition the sustained growth in the phase angle between the flow induced pitch and actively imposed heave can be seen with an increase of spring stiffness this is attributed to that the attached torsional spring with a larger stiffness tends to restore the oscillating foil towards the equilibrium position within a shorter period of time in general both the flow induced pitching angle and corresponding effective aoa tends to become larger when the reduced frequency is higher however the pitch leading phase difference shows a low sensitivity towards the oscillating frequency it varies within a relatively wide range between 60 and 160 depending on the torsional spring stiffness propulsive performance of apwigs with different oscillating frequencies as the function of stiffness coefficient is presented in fig 15 at the low reduced frequency both time averaged thrust and power coefficients show an increasing trend with an increase of spring stiffness however the propulsive efficiency tends to decrease consistently when the stiffness coefficient becomes larger due to the maximum effective aoa being below 15 at the reduced frequency of 0 31 a satisfactory propulsive performance with the efficiency over 60 was obtained for the considered range of spring stiffness with respect to the relatively high reduced frequency an initial rise in time averaged thrust with an increase of spring stiffness can be seen which is followed by a rapid drop when the stiffness coefficient further increases in contrast the time averaged power follows the trend that decrease firstly but then rise rapidly when the stiffness coefficient continues to increase as a result an obvious peak in propulsive efficiency at the reduced frequencies of 0 63 and 0 94 can be found in fig 15 in other words an optimal torsional spring stiffness that produces the highest propulsive efficiency can be found for the apwigs at a given oscillating frequency the maximum efficiency for the reduced frequencies of 0 31 0 63 0 94 are 65 9 63 1 and 54 8 respectively the corresponding stiffness coefficients are 0 06 0 18 and 0 39 which occurred at a pitch leading phase angle of 107 6 89 0 and 85 1 combined with our previous work wang et al 2019 a torsional spring stiffness that produces the pitch leading phase difference of 85 110 depending on advance speed tends to provide a satisfactory propulsive performance for apwigs it should be noted that all the maximum effective aoa for the highest efficiency at three reduced frequencies are below 25 which indicates that an attached flow around the foil surface is one of the crucial factors to ensure the satisfactory propulsive performance for apwigs basically such a propulsor at the larger oscillating frequency tends to produce higher forward thrust and require more input power while the optimal efficiency shows a consistent drop with the increase of reduced frequency the vortex evolution and shedding over one periodic cycle for apwigs with three reduced frequencies are presented in fig 16 for each situation the stiffness coefficient is selected as the value that produces the highest propulsive efficiency since the reduced frequency is a direct measurement for the ratio of oscillating velocity along the vertical direction over forward advance speed a smaller value of reduced frequency indicates lower effective aoa during the operation of apwigs consequently the high attachment of surrounding flow for both leading edge and trailing edge can be seen for the case of k 0 31 due to the maximum effective aoa that is below the dynamic stall angle with respect to the reduced frequencies of 0 63 and 0 94 the vortex shedding around both leading edge and trailing edge can be captured in the current simulations based on the results shown in fig 15 it is reasonable to conclude that the massive leading edge vortex shedding as well as the corresponding interaction of vortices between leading edge and trailing edge will change the pressure distribution along the body surface and cause some energy loss which thus are unfavourable to the propulsive performance of apwigs a typical process of vortex shedding for apwigs was clearly recorded by the calculation with a reduced frequency of 0 94 as shown in fig 16 c during the upstroke of the first periodic quarter the leading edge vortices starts to grow along the inside surface of each oscillating foil then the generated vortices tend to arrive at mid chord position when each foil reaches the maximum displacement after that the oscillating foils begin to perform downstroke motion in which the produced vortices move further towards downstream and finally shed into wake from the trailing edge as the elastic pitching axis of each foil reaches equilibrium position again when two foils cross the equilibrium plane to move further towards each other the leading edge vortices start to appear at the outside surface of each foil in the same manner these vortices will move towards the downstream during the upstroke of the last periodic quarter and shed into wake from the trailing edge when the oscillating foils return to the initial position in the current simulations the red and blue colours denote the vortices with anticlockwise and clockwise directions respectively considering the upper oscillating foil it can be seen that an anticlockwise vortex was generated during the first half periodic cycle while the motion in the second half cycle produces a clockwise vortex the vortex behaviours of the lower foil can be considered as the mirror image of the upper foil with respect to the resulting ground plane more importantly the reverse kármán vortex street can be obtained for each oscillating foil of apwigs which is characterized as the combination of a row of anticlockwise vortices above the symmetry plane and a row of clockwise vortices below the symmetry plane such a vortices pattern can induce a velocity surplus along the centreline of each foil indicating a thrust production 3 3 parametric study to investigate the effect of various parameters on the propulsive performance of apwigs we perform a comprehensive parametric study with different advance speeds it should be noted that the definition of advance coefficient includes multiple geometry and motion parameters for convenience we directly use the advance speed with the unit of m s to indicate the flow condition in the current section three flow speeds of 1 m s 2 m s and 3 m s are taken into consideration which produce the corresponding reynolds number of 100 000 200 000 and 300 000 respectively considered parameters include heaving amplitude position of elastic pitching axis and mean distance between two foils fig 17 presents the time history of flow induced pitching angle with different heaving amplitudes it can be seen that the maximum pitching angle consistently increase when the heaving amplitude becomes larger the sinusoidal like profile for the passive pitch motion was constantly maintained with the variation of heaving amplitude in addition the heaving amplitude has no influence on the phase difference between the induced pitch and the prescribed heave for apwigs the propulsive characteristics of apwigs with the variation of heaving amplitude are presented in fig 18 as the results show the time averaged thrust shows a continuous increase with the rise of non dimensional heaving amplitude with all three advance speeds especially the apwigs tends to produce drag with extremely low heaving amplitude as shown in cases of 1 m s and 2 m s using the heaving amplitude of 0 1c the propulsive efficiency shows a more complicated trend with respect to the effect of heaving amplitude it should be noted that the cases that generate drag are not presented in fig 18 b due to the corresponding negative efficiency for the advance speeds of 1 m s and 2 m s propulsive efficiency shows a trend that first increase and then decrease with the increase of heaving amplitude within the current parametric range the efficiency at advance velocity of 3 m s tends to continuously increase when the apwigs has a higher heaving amplitude the highest propulsive efficiency of apwigs for three advance speeds is 54 3 64 7 and 68 9 which are produced by the heaving amplitudes of 0 3c 0 4c and 0 5c respectively it is reasonable to conclude that an optimal heaving amplitude can be found for the apwigs producing the highest propulsive efficiency with a given flow condition in addition the optimal heaving amplitude tends to increase with a larger advance speed the time variation of flow induced pitching angle with different positions of elastic pitching axis at advance speed of 3 m s was presented in fig 19 it can be seen that the elastic axis position has an influence on both passive pitching angle and pitch leading phase difference here we consider five chord positions from the leading edge including 0 1c 0 15c 0 2c 0 25c and 1 3c the comprehensive results with respect to the maximum pitching angle and phase difference for apwigs with the variation of elastic axis position at three advance speeds are presented in table 4 as the results show the peak of flow induced pitching angle tends to firstly increase and then decrease with the rise of distance between the leading edge and the elastic pitching axis for all three advance speeds however the pitch leading phase difference shows a generally increasing trend with a larger elastic axis distance from leading edge overall the flow induced pitch motion tends to produce a lowest peak of pitching angle at the 0 25 chord position from leading edge which thus has a significant effect on the maximum effective aoa as indicated in previous section the pitch leading phase angle within the range of 85 110 for apwigs tends to produce higher propulsive efficiency it can be seen that the elastic axis position from leading edge within the range of 1 4c to 1 3c tends to result in a desired phase difference the effect of elastic axis position on the propulsive performance of apwigs is presented in fig 20 basically the apwigs at advance speeds of 1 m s and 2 m s tends to produce the drag when the distance of elastic pitching axis from the leading edge is below 0 2c with the further movement of pivot axis towards the mid chord position the time averaged thrust at the advance speed of 1 m s shows a continuously increasing trend while the case of 2 m s produces the maximum thrust with an elastic pitching axis of 0 25 chord position from leading edge with respect to the advance velocity of 3 m s a general increase in time averaged thrust can be seen when the elastic pitching axis becomes farther to the leading edge it should be noted that the flow induced pitch motion tends to be chaotic and aperiodic for the speed of 3 m s when the elastic axis position from leading edge is beyond 0 25c therefore the numerical results at speed of 3 m s with the elastic pitching axis of 0 3 and 1 3 chord positions from leading edge were not presented with respect to propulsive efficiency its trend of first increase and then drop with the increase of elastic axis distance from leading is shown in fig 20 b as can be seen from the numerical results the propulsive efficiency at advance speed of 2 m s with an elastic pitching axis of 0 20 chord position from leading edge shows a sudden drop fig 21 presents the comparison of time variation of flow induced pitching angle with two positions of elastic pitching axis at advance speed of 2 m s it was found that the aperiodic and consistently declining pitch motion is the main reason for the sudden drop of propulsive performance with elastic pitching axis of 0 20c current calculations indicate that the flow induced pitch motion of apwigs tends to be unstable with an extremely close position of elastic pitching axis from leading edge depending on advance speed the maximum efficiencies for the three advance speeds are 47 2 63 1 and 70 1 which are obtained by the elastic pitching axis of 0 2 and 0 25 chord position from leading edge generally the elastic pitching axis around 0 25 chord position from leading edge tends to produce a satisfactory performance at the low speeds as to a relatively high advance velocity the elastic pitching axis around 0 2 chord position from leading edge should be considered to provide an optimal efficiency for apwigs with respect to effect of mean distance between two foils we perform a direct comparison of propulsive performance of apwigs with the single auto pitch configuration a medium heaving amplitude of 0 3c is employed for this part of the calculation fig 22 shows the time history of passive pitching angle with different mean distances between two foils at the advance speed of 3 m s as the results show the pitch motion of apwigs tends to be consistent with that of single auto pitch configuration when the equilibrium distance is relatively large the wing in ground effect produced by anti phase oscillating biplane arrangement on the flow induced pitch motion becomes more obvious as a relatively short mean distance between two foils is used compared with the pitching variation of single auto pitch oscillating foil the resulting wing in ground effect tends to increase the flow induced pitching angle during the upstroke and decrease the value at the downstroke it can also be observed that the variation of mean distance has no apparent influence on the pitch leading phase difference for apwigs the influence of equilibrium distance between two foils on the propulsive performance of apwigs is presented in fig 23 the blue dashed lines denote the results of single auto pitch configuration note that the thrust coefficient of apwigs is the average of that for each foil as the results show the time averaged thrust tends to consistently increase with the decrease of mean distance between two foils when the mean distance is larger than 5c the generated thrust agrees to a fixed value which is still larger than that of the single oscillating foil the maximum time averaged thrust generated by each foil of apwigs is approximately 1 5 times that of the single oscillating foil within the current parametric space a similar trend was found in the characteristics of propulsive efficiency as shown in fig 23 b a higher efficiency can be obtained for apwigs when one foil is set closer to another one the propulsive efficiency of apwigs finally converges to around 53 with the mean distance over 5c it can be seen that there is a constant increase of 2 in propulsive efficiency for apwigs over the single auto pitch configuration even though the mean distance between two foils is considerably large the maximum increase around 12 in propulsive efficiency was obtained by the produced wing in ground effect in which the apwigs employs a mean distance of 1 2c 4 conclusions a parametric study on the propulsive performance of apwig was conducted numerically in this paper the apwigs has a biplane arrangement in which the kinematics are characterized as an actively prescribed heave motion in counterphase and passively flow induced pitch motion after the comprehensive verification and validation of numerical model a comparative investigation into the propulsive characteristics between apwigs and dual foil fully imposed configuration was performed it was found that the apwigs can maintain a satisfactory efficiency within a wider range of advance speed over fully imposed system with a rigid shaft by attaching a torsional spring to the pivot axis of each foil the apwigs can adjust the maximum pitching angle to adapt different loaded conditions which will reduce the effective aoa and thus decrease the flow separation during the operation based on the time averaged wake profile in downstream it was confirmed that the apwigs can produce a momentum surplus over an oscillating periodic cycle inherently indicating the thrust production the investigation into the effect of oscillating frequency on the propulsive characteristics provides us with more insights into the thrust producing mechanism of apwigs the flow separation around the oscillating foils tends to be mild at a low reduced frequency which is attributed to the relatively small effective aoa with respect to a high reduced frequency obvious vortex shedding along both leading edge and trailing edge can be captured by the current model a typical reverse kármán vortex street characterizing as a row of anticlockwise vortices above the symmetry plane and a row of clockwise vortices below the symmetry plane was obtained in the wake of each oscillating foil for apwigs it was believed that such a vortex pattern induces a momentum surplus in the downstream appearing as a jet like wake profile in general the propulsive efficiency of apwigs shows a decreasing trend with an increase of reduced frequency with a fixed oscillating frequency and a given flow condition an optimal torsional spring stiffness can be found to produce the highest propulsive efficiency for the apwigs the major interest of the current study lies in the influence of various parameters on the propulsive performance of apwigs the numerical results demonstrated that heaving amplitude and mean distance only have an effect on the peak of the flow induced pitching angle while both the pitch leading phase difference and the maximum passive pitching angle are affected by the position of the elastic pitching axis the propulsive efficiency tends to increase firstly and then decrease with a consistent growth of heaving amplitude which indicates that there is an optimal value generating the best propulsive performance based on the requirement of thrust as to the position of elastic pitching axis results showed that 0 2 to 0 25 chord position from the leading edge tends to produce the satisfactory efficiency depending on the advance speed within the current parametric space it was found that the thrust production by apwigs is 1 5 times that of a single auto pitch configuration and the maximum efficiency improvement due to the wing in ground effect is approximately 12 in summary by employing an appropriate combination of various parameters the apwigs with the self adjusted pitch and resulting wing in ground effect can perform a satisfactory propulsion performance as a marine propulsor credit authorship contribution statement jiadong wang data curation formal analysis writing

ultra large container ships has gradually adopted the form of external lashing which affects the design of ultra large container ship lashing bridges as well as the container stowage and securing the forces caused by the ship motion e g roll and pitch wind and green water are ultimately delivered to the hull structure via the lashing bridge structure simultaneously the displacement of the container stack induced by the elastic behavior of the hull will impose additional load to the lashing system the lashing bridge structure exhibits a high aspect ratio and relatively low stiffness under abnormal expansion such as parametric rolling not expansion or extreme sea conditions the lashing bridge will operate under deteriorated conditions affecting the structural integrity of the container stack stored on the deck accordingly it is urgent to explore the mechanical behavior of the lashing bridge under dynamic conditions which helps to investigate the causes of container loss a question still remains why the dynamic response problem of the lashing system and container stack cannot be solved under the influence of ship motion ship vibration wind load and wave load what is confusing is that even many containers are lost the security protocols and standards of most securing systems only imply dynamic effects aguiar de souza et al 2012 aguiar de souza et al 2013 kirkayak et al 2011 however this behavior is not considered when calculating the lashing bridge strength li and wang 2018 the larger the container ship in size the taller and wider the lashing bridge structure will be the lashing points are distributed on different heights of the lashing bridge and the overall stiffness is lower than the hull structure because the stiffness of the support structure at the end of the lashing bridge is not high enough the lashing bridge base cannot be simply considered as a fixed constraint when performing numerical simulation while a more realistic boundary condition should be considered i e the coupling effect of the lashing bridge and hull structure however this effect has been ignored by most studies the laws of similarity for fluids and structures have been applied extensively oshiro et al 2017 neuberger et al 2007 the experiment of the scaled model can effectively address the limited capabilities of the test equipment and reduce the high experimental cost of the prototype structure test thus a scaled model can be constructed by similarity theory which is a crucial method for the structural analysis and optimal design torkamani et al 2009 to design a new lashing bridge of ultra large container ships full physical simulation experiments are required to investigate its mechanical behavior and validate the numerical model to fill this gap this study proposes the following approach first the static and modal analysis was conducted using the finite element analysis with the consideration of the coupling effect of the lashing bridge and hull structure second according to buckingham s theorem the lashing bridge scaled model was built moreover the static and modal test of the structure was performed finally the 20 ft container scaled model was designed by the froude scaling laws and an 11 tier container stack was constructed a series of tests and numerical simulations were performed for the dynamic response of the lashing bridge influenced by container stack inertial loads due to ship pitching motions 1 2 literature review the design of lashing bridges is one of the core technologies of large container ships it not only relates to the actual number of containers and flexibility of the container placement but also affects the determination of main dimensions and general layout of the ship the linear static fe analysis is a common practice in the early design stage of the lashing bridge the classification society helps designers streamline the design process through different design guidelines and perform structural verification of the proposed design structural modeling aspects are well defined and established however there are still no unified approaches regarding the modeling of how and where dynamic loads e g wind green water gravity ship motions etc in the fe model the strength of the lashing bridge should be assessed by the maximum lashing force in container securing arrangements csa according to a previous report gl 2012 a force equal to 61 of the safe working load swl of each lashing rod was applied on each position of a lashing plate connected to the bay containers according to the ccs specification ccs 2015 the lashing force is taken as 60 of the swl based on the lr specification lr 2016 the lashing rod forces are taken as follows if lashing rods are connected to the top level of the lashing bridge 75 of the swl of each lashing rod if lashing rods are connected to the height below the top of the lashing bridge 55 of the swl of each lashing rod these two rules are employed in this study li and wang 2018 combined knowledge engineering and multi objective optimization design methods to successfully design the lashing bridge structure they also optimized the vibration response of the lashing bridge while reducing the lashing bridge weight li and wang 2019 intelligently designed and optimized the lashing bridge structure based on the knowledge engineering method the lashing bridge structure was improved based on the framework of the functionally graded tube moreover the vibration response of the structure was reduced some examples of real accidents reveal that significant ship movements may result in serious or catastrophic consequences bulian et al 2015 most loads on the lashing bridge structure are attributed to the inertial forces generated by the stack of containers recently due to the increased loss of containers in shipping the dynamic factors during the transportation process may affect the lashing system more negatively wolf et al 2011 introduced the latest technology on container stowage on decks kirkayak et al 2011 built a 1 4 scaled model of a 20 ft shipping container based on the froude scaling laws and conducted dynamic tests and numerical simulations of the 2 tier container stack aguiar de souza et al 2012 studied the basic mechanical behavior of a 7 tier stack under the heave motion using a 1 4 scaled model of the container aguiar de souza et al 2013 simulated the dynamic response of containers with different conditions for multiple stacks and obtained the corresponding dynamic mechanical behavior via a finite element method in order to decrease the computational cost of the container stack dynamic simulations a simplified finite element model procedure of the stack was proposed by brocco et al 2015 based on this model the stack actual deformation can be accurately simulated moro et al 2015 performed extensive calculations on the simplified model of the container stack the inertial forces acting on the stack were determined and diagrams that show the failure occurrence of container structures or lashing equipment were presented these studies are vital for understanding the dynamic behavior of the container stack though these studies were based on a simple lashing system with a low container stack and cross lashing internal lashing they also can be used to understand the dynamic behavior of the lashing system of a high tier container stack similarity theory is a branch of engineering science and has been applied in different fields e g structural engineering vibration and shock problems as shown in fig 1 the scaling results obtained from scaled model tests can facilitate engineers to accurately predict the behavior of large prototypes coutinho et al 2016 ramu et al 2013 koning and boom 2009 conducted the dynamic research under heave motion for 2 tier and 4 tier container stacks using the 1 4 scaled model wolf and rathje 2008 the result revealed that the dynamic response of the scaled model is similar to that of a full scale model therefore the scaled model can be employed to assess the behavior of the prototype zhang et al 2015 investigated the prototype 27 m2 large linear vibrating screen and 1 10 scaled similar model based on experimental modal analysis it suggested that the inherent characteristic parameters of the linear vibrating screen can be obtained intuitively and effectively using the modal analysis method the validity of the experimental modal analysis was confirmed using the scaled down similar test model and the consistency and reliability of the test data of the similar model and the prototype were verified in reality due to limitations of the manufacturing technology the geometric distortion does not match the exact similarity requirements of the buckingham s theorem whereas the consistency between the scaled model and prototype still exists cho et al 2005 oshiro and alves 2012 presented a method to consider the geometric distortion and analyzed the dynamic response of the distorted scaled model under impact loading the results indicated that the distortion model is capable of predicting the prototype structure behavior accurately in fact there are many other methods like similarity theory and finite element methods which can be used to create similar models coutinho et al 2016 so far the research about developing similarities in complex structures is attractive in this study the similarity theory finite element method and modern intelligent optimization design method were combined which can construct similar models of complex structures effectively the lashing bridge is the most important equipment in the securing system of ultra large container ships therefore the investigation of the mechanical behavior of lashing bridges can facilitate to understand the causes of lashing failures during maritime transport to achieve this goal this article carried out a series of tests static strength modal and dynamic and numerical simulation of the lashing bridge then section 2 introduces the construction of the distortion scaled model and numerical model the selection of test parameters and data processing method based on the similarity principle section 3 analyzes the results of experimental and numerical simulation for the lashing bridge section 4 discusses the main features and limitations of the proposed method section 5 draws the main conclusion and summarizes the observations of this study 2 methodology 2 1 objects of study the lashing bridge structure studied in this paper is designed for a 20000teu ultra large container ship of shanghai waigaoqiao shipbuilding sws co ltd the main hull can be loaded with 24 rows of containers of different tiers each row of up to 21 arranged containers stacking up to 12 tiers the main deck can also be arranged in 24 rows of containers each row of up to arrange 23 rows of containers stacking up to 11 tiers stacked the main dimensions of the hull are listed in table 1 the research object is the aftermost lashing bridge of the hull table 2 shows the stowage plan for the aftermost bay of the 20000 teu ultra large container ship the three dimension 3 d model of the lashing bridge is shown in fig 2 and the characteristic parameters are listed in table 3 the third fourth and fifth tier platforms all engage in securing the dynamic study of the lashing bridge structure includes the aftermost and the second aftermost lashing bridge and the container stack between them p i protection and indemnity insurance clubs recommended the use of a system based on twist locks lashing rods and turnbuckles twist lock is designed to connect adjacent containers in the stack or to combine the base container to the base socket lashing assemblies are utilized to resist the overturning moment of the stack in particular they consist of a lashing rod and turnbuckle a steel rod is typically performed as the tension element in modern container lashing assemblies abs 2010 as shown in fig 3 there are two different arrangements of the lashing system which is the internal lashing and external lashing for container stacks under lateral loads the internal lashing secures the stack compressed side thus the compressive load acting on container posts is increased by the vertical component of the lashing force which limits the allowable stack weight for the external lashing the acting lashing rods are fixed to the stack lifted side with tension reaction forces which allows higher stack weights higher container capacity and better cargo distribution the lashing force will be higher than the internal lashing especially when the high vertical clearance is allowed on the locks in this study the external lashing is the securing method of the container stack furthermore the fifth and sixth tiers of the container stack are involved in the securing 2 2 similarity parameters selected for model construction the inertial force generated by the container stack is transferred to the lashing bridge by the lashing rod which is the main part of the external load it is known that structural stiffness changes directly affect the structural dynamic response and force aguiar de souza et al 2012 aguiar de souza et al 2013 kirkayak et al 2011 in this study some forces like the inertial force gravity and elastic force were believed to perform an essential part in the dynamics of container stack thus the selection of the scaled model parameters is to choose either the ratio between gravity force and inertia force or between elastic force and inertia force aguiar de souza et al 2012 aguiar de souza et al 2013 when a scaled model is constructed under the laboratory condition it is almost impossible for two systems to match all similar parameters the degree of the effect of each similar parameter on the overall system error is also different consequently ignoring the parameters that express secondary phenomena does not significantly affect the mechanical behavior of the structure coutinho et al 2016 section 2 3 and 2 4 describe details about the construction of the container and lashing bridge scaled model the vital parameters in the design of the container scaled model include mass moments of inertia transversal racking stiffness of front open end frames transversal racking stiffness of rear closed end frames longitudinal racking stiffness torsional stiffness lateral stiffness modal analysis the critical parameters in the design process of the lashing bridge scaled model include mass average stiffness transversal stiffness longitudinal stiffness strain brackets manoeuvring holes etc as shown in fig 21 a modal analysis 2 3 scaled container model design this study employed 11 scaled models of a 20 ft iso freight container with a 1 10 length scale factor the research investigates all csc standards csc 1996 shipping container manufacturer data and iso container standards 668 iso 1995 830 iso 1999 1496 1 iso 1990 and 3874 iso 1997 the two systems had a strict numerical relationship in terms of geometric features such as length width and height in other words geometric similarities can be achieved based on froude scaling laws the similarity of velocity and acceleration can be guaranteed that is kinematic similarity the dynamic similarity was reached when the force applied to the system was set at a fixed ratio the design process of the container scale model follows the scaling laws which is summarized in table 4 a method combining similarity theory finite element and optimization design method is proposed in this study to achieve the construction of the scaled model the specific workflow is shown in fig 4 according to the scaling laws the first step is to obtain the characteristic parameters of the scaled model the second step is to determine the structural form of the scaled model by the finite element analysis considering the construction of the model standard profiles like rectangular steel steel pipe and l section steel are selected in the design process the simplified geometry representation of scaled container model is shown in fig 5 the final step is to construct a multi objective optimized mathematical model and select the appropriate optimized algorithm to obtain remarkable design results to obtain optimal design parameters a mathematical model for the model update is proposed the design variable is the thickness of the structural component the overall structure weight mode frequency and stiffness are adopted as the objective function the optimized problems are presented in the following form find x x 1 x 2 x n t min δ m a s s x 1 x 2 x n δ m o d e x 1 x 2 x n δ s t i f f n e s s x 1 x 2 x n s t x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 x n x n g 1 x 1 x 2 x n 0 g 2 x 1 x 2 x n 0 g m x 1 x 2 x n 0 where mass denotes the structure weight mode represents the frequencies from the first to the fifth mode of the structure x 1 x 2 x n t represents the thickness of the structural component δ is the difference between the target value and numerical simulation result constraints of the structural optimization include the moment of inertia and strength of the structure along with the manufacturability of the local structure etc the multi island genetic algorithm miga based on the random weighting method was employed to optimize the structure in each iteration the multi objective issue can be transformed into a single objective optimization problem by randomly selecting weight coefficients the basic parameter settings in this study are displayed in table 5 the optimization process is conducted by the isight software after optimization the obtained detailed geometric dimensions of the scaled model are listed in table 6 the scaled structural variation curves in the optimization process are plotted in fig 6 and fig 7 the static strength analysis of the structure was conducted to estimate the model stiffness fig 8 shows the results of the finite element analysis for the longitudinal stiffness the values of geometry and structural stiffness obtained from scaling laws are listed in table 7 2 4 scaled lashing bridge model design as shown in fig 9 a finite element model of the coupling of the lashing bridge with the hull structure is built and the transverse bulkhead height is 3 0 m the finite element model includes the main structural members of the lashing bridge such as pillars shear walls walkway boards and connecting brackets attachments with no effect on the overall strength such as lashing eye plates pillar guide plates etc are not considered fig 2 demonstrates the dimensions of the finite element model of the lashing bridge pillars 1 6 are rectangular steel tubes with a cross section of 250 300 mm short pillars are square steel tubes with a cross section of 200 200 mm the first platform is not applied in the model because it is designed as a grid and has no effect on the overall strength the stiffeners on the shear wall are modeled using beam elements brackets and manoeuvring holes are fine mesh regions in local stress concentrated areas the shell plate decks bulkheads etc are simulated by plate elements and beam elements are used to simulate longitudinals and stiffeners if it is a longitudinal girder and beam with a web height greater than 400 mm the web is modeled with a plate element and the panel is modeled as a beam element the bulb bar in stiffener is modeled using the equivalent beam element the detailed model has been created by only low order quadrilateral and triangular plate 2d elements with four or three nodes respectively the standard fe model mesh size is 100 100 mm ccs 2015 the boundary condition and lashing force are revealed in fig 9 the lashing force direction is determined according to the container bay arrangements and the lashing bridge location as shown in table 8 the lashing force on each lashing rod is set as 175 kn at the preliminary design stage ccs 2015 the models and structural fe analysis have been carried out using the msc patran nastran suite the strength analysis results reveal that the von mises stress and the maximum shearing stress is 227 and 115 n mm2 respectively the maximum resultant stress and maximum shearing stress are less than the allowable values von mises stress 314 2 n mm2 shear stress 142 n mm2 ccs 2015 thus the strength of the lashing bridge meets the requirements fig 10 shows the von mises and shear stresses of the lashing bridge structure the first order mode frequency and mode shape of the prototype are shown in fig 11 the finite element analysis of the lashing bridge structure shows that the stress concentration is mainly distributed in the bracket and manoeuvring hole positions the scale model also indicates similar stress in these areas the lashing bridge structure has a large aspect ratio if the length scale factor λ is too large it will not only increase the design cost but also result in the absence of modality due to insufficient excitation energy during the modal testing the length scale factor with an extremely small size will increase the processing difficulty consequently the length scale factor of the lashing bridge is set as 1 10 the scale model includes the main structures of the lashing bridge such as the pillar bracket connecting plate aisle plate and shear wall the l section steel of the first tier and the stiffeners of the shear wall are not considered in the scaled model accessories without the impact on the overall strength like column oriented slabs ladders etc are not considered the overall structure is mainly welded by the rectangular steel square steel and plate structure to simulate the relationship between the lashing bridge and transverse bulkhead the lashing bridge scaled model was fixed on a steel plate as shown in fig 12 the 30 mm thickness steel plate was fixed to the ground with 6 pairs of anchor bolts with a diameter of 150 mm according to buckingham s theorem the prototype and scaled models should meet the following similarity criteria geometric similarity stress strain similarity mass and gravity similarity initial conditions as well as boundary condition similarity zhang et al 2013 2015 ramu et al 2013 the general similarity relations for an elastic model are formulated in table 9 the method of constructing the scaled model proposed in section 2 3 is applied to the lashing bridge structure optimization objectives include the average stiffness critical position strain brackets manoeuvring holes etc deformation transversal longitudinal mode frequencies and mode shapes the average stiffness of the bridge structure is calculated by ccs 2015 1 k b y 1 n i 1 n f y i δ y i where k by is average stiffness f y refers to the transversal component of lashing rod force δ y denotes the lashing rod eye transversal displacement n is the number of lashing rod forces the values for the geometric shapes and structural features obtained from the law of proportionality in table 9 are listed in table 10 the dimensional cloud map and photo of the scaled lashing bridge are shown in fig 12 the fe model of the scaled lashing bridge has been constructed using only low order quadrilateral and triangular plate 2d elements with four or three nodes respectively the scaled model is made of plain carbon steel isotropic linear elastic material young s modulus e 210 gpa poisson ratio ν 0 30 and density ρ 7850 kg m3 the transversal displacement of the lashing bridge scaled model is illustrated in fig 13 2 5 experimental investigation it is difficult to simulate and understand all variables involved in the dynamics of container stack and lashing systems hence the main factors that affect the dynamic response should be carefully considered this study primarily focuses on the impact behavior of the container stack on the lashing system under large dip and high frequency pitching motion a sinusoidal driving excitation was applied to the system via a three degrees shaking table the magnitude and frequency of the driving excitation were performed as input variables the investigation focuses on the deformation of the top of the column support point 1 in the securing fig 14 displays the physical position of this point this point was chosen for its highest values for the dynamic response in the longitudinal direction the investigation also focused on the stress of the column support base and bracket referred to point 2 5 in fig 14 the strain rosettes were used to obtain the dynamic response of these points for all cases several physical variables were idealized as control parameters to understand their effects on the dynamic response two of the variables affect the driving excitation the other three are physical features that directly relate to th10e physical characteristics of the system namely the amplitude and frequency of the driving excitation this is the first factor that influences the dynamic response of the system elastic deformation of the container in the actual securing system the stack height of the container on the deck can reach 20 m moreover elastic deformation is a vital physical phenomenon worthy of considering container cargo configuration fig 15 b though the container load is a simple variable its effect has not been not fully understood yet the weight of the container cargo significantly affects the lashing force which is widely recognized in the industry lashing rod stiffness the load is transmitted between the container stack and lashing bridge by the lashing rod the effect of different stiffnesses of the lashing rod on the system has not been fully understood yet twist lock mechanical behavior it is highlighted that the twist lock gap remarkably affects the dynamics of the container stack aguiar de souza et al 2012 aguiar de souza et al 2013 kirkayak et al 2011 this phenomenon is also known as the gap effect during the test in addition the forces in the column support and brackets were used as additional variables these areas point 2 to 5 in fig 14 were chosen due to their higher load values under all studied conditions furthermore this choice is based on the practical applications of this study that is to say load values are more practical for the maritime transportation industry than deformation ones for the container stack the deformation of the top corner of the open end of the highest container expressed as point 6 was evaluated those points were selected for their highest dynamic response values in all studies the longitudinal deformation of the point 1 and 6 were recorded by a displacement sensor micrometer the data presented is the result of the subtraction between the deformation time dynamic response and the driving excitation obtained after proper filtering i e the relative displacement data the time history and fourier series expansion and rms values were used to analyze data which can explore how the structure responds to the control variables it is a critical step to denoise the signal obtained by the test before analysis since the excitation frequency of each dynamic test is constant the low pass filter chebyshev filter is the best choice for eliminating signal noise the simple and fast harmonic analysis was conducted to determine the cutoff frequency 2 6 experimental system parameter selection a lashing bridge dynamic behavior testing system contains a shaking table two lashing bridge scaled models eight lashing rods and a single row of eleven container scaled models as shown in fig 15 the adjacent upper and lower container models are connected by bolts in the corner castings full load conditions were simulated by configuring weights in the stack this configuration mimics similar conditions during maritime transportation according to the ccs specification the maximum pitch angle does not exceed 8 0250 while the pitch frequency cannot exceed 0 2850 hz the amplitudes of the predefined drive excitations in this study were 5 8 and 12 respectively the maximum value of the predefined drive excitation frequency was 0 40 hz table 11 displays a quantitative list of experimental control variables the fifth and sixth tier containers are secured using lashing rods to reduce transversal forces acting on the lower containers in the stack the lashing rod is a cylindrical steel tube with an outer diameter of 10 mm the wall thickness 1 mm and 2 mm was used to indicate a different stiffness this study used an external lashing scheme that was popular in recent years each lashing rod reacts to a tensile force whose line of action is the rod axis while it is ineffective when a compression load is applied the lashing rod is connected to the corner casting by an l section part with a rotating shaft as shown in fig 16 the l section part is connected to the container corner casting by a bolt one end of the lashing rod is connected to the eye plate and the other end is tightened by a bolt this design ensures that the lashing rod is only subjected to tension the gravitational and inertial loads strictly depend on the payload carried within the containers steel plates are placed on each tier of the stack to simulate full load conditions as shown in fig 15 b the container weights configuration is shown in table 12 this configuration is closer to real conditions the containers loaded on the deck are stacked and connected one to the other via twist locks the gap effect caused by the twist lock is considered to be one of the important factors that influence loads in the container stack and lashing systems however its effect is not fully understood in fig 17 according to the actual characteristics of the button lock a 1 5 mm gap is placed between the containers of adjacent tiers which aims to explore its influence on the dynamic response 2 7 dynamic system numerical investigation the dynamic finite element analysis system of the lashing bridge is constructed as shown in fig 18 all structural analyses have been carried out using the commercial software ansys workbench 18 0 by extracting the mid surface of models the number of meshes can be greatly reduced and the computational efficiency can be improved the detailed model has been created using only low order quadrilateral and triangular plate 2d elements with four or three nodes respectively there are two points that should be declared for the simplification of the finite element model firstly eye plates and columns that are not involved in the securing are not considered secondly a node is placed at the geometric center of the each container to adjust moments of inertia and mass to properly simulate the connection between containers a nonlinear spring was used here to simulate the performance of the twist lock kirkayak and suzuki 2008 developed an optimal function relationship to simulate twist locks via a series of experiments though this nonlinear mathematical relationship is too simple it is sufficient to describe the dynamic behavior of the twist lock more information can be found in the research of kirkayak and suzuki 2008 the stiffness of the twist lock is shown in table 13 in this test bolts of m5 25 mm were used instead of twist locks as shown in fig 17 b twist locks were modeled using the mathematical relationship depicted in fig 19 a this non linear behavior is basically consistent with the bolt stiffness in the experimental test and the gap can be adjusted by the bolt damping elements and contact elements were added between corner castings to represent the frictional effect between containers and the coefficient of friction is 0 25 because the lashing rod is only subjected to the tensile load during the work it can be replaced with a spring having equal stiffness the spring unit connects the corner casting to the eye plate which realizes the load transfer between the container stack and lashing bridge as shown in fig 19 b in the software ansys workbench 18 0 the behavior of the spring element was set to a beam which was consistent with the size of the lashing rod in the test bonded constraints are defined between the lashing bridge bottom plate and shaking table as shown in fig 20 a simplified model of the shaking table is constructed to facilitate the application of different drive excitations during the numerical simulation the shacking table was considered as a rigid body finally the dynamic numerical analysis considers the geometric nonlinearity in the implicit integration scheme 3 experimental and numerical simulation results 3 1 model validation based on static and dynamic characteristics the magnitude of the lashing force is listed in table 13 the third fourth and fifth tier lashing points were all loaded with a force of 178 5 kg according to the requirements of the china classification society specification ccs 2015 the third tier was loaded with a force of 166 kg and the fourth and fifth tiers were loaded with a force of 255 kg according to the lr specification lr 2016 hydraulic oil pump and hydraulic cylinders were used as a source of force during the experimental the direction of the lashing force is determined by the position of the c beam and the pulley one end of the wire rope is connected to the hydraulic cylinder and the tension sensor as shown in fig 21 a the load is applied to the lashing eye plate by a wire rope as displayed in fig 21 b according to the static strength analysis result in section 2 4 the arrangement of measuring points of the critical position strain is demonstrated in fig 21 d the corresponding strain values were obtained by arranging strain rosettes at different measuring points the stress values of some measuring points are listed in table 14 the maximum difference is 19 5 in fig 21 c the lateral and longitudinal maximum deformations were recorded by a displacement sensor in table 15 the experimental results of the deformation are compared with the values obtained by similarity theory the maximum difference in the data is 6 51 the applied excitation position of the exciter is shown in fig 21 a the excitation frequency ranges from 20 to 200 hz and a total of 38 acceleration sensors are arranged in the lashing bridge structure the history output signal during the excitation process was recorded by an accelerometer the frequency domain curve was obtained by fast fourier transform fft the modal test is illustrated in fig 22 a fig 22 b presents the frequency response function curve and fig 23 shows the mode shape the experimental results are consistent with the target values calculated by scaling laws the mode shape clearly shows the side plate bending and the column support bending the main causes are the large area steel plate side plate aisle plate and shear wall and elongated structural features of the column owing to the shell structure the lashing bridges at the aft end of the hull are more likely to vibrate because they are closer to the propeller and main machinery li and wang 2018 it is recommended to increase the stiffness in a longitudinal direction the difference between the experimental measurement results and target values calculated by the scaling laws is shown in table 16 the maximum difference of the data is 4 12 and the mode shape is consistent therefore the finite element model of the lashing bridge was validated with acceptable deviation and the similitude relation used in the previous section was also validated 3 2 dynamic study under typical motion excitation most current specifications for the lashing equipment correspond to static conditions in this research a more realistic approach with the consideration of dynamic effects was proposed how to solve this problem with a more reasonable method is also one of the important goals in this study consequently this experiment explores the dynamics of the lashing bridge under the high stack large dip and high frequency pitching conditions the control parameters in the system are described in detail in sections 2 5 and 2 6 to compare results the dynamic response of point 1 and point 3 are considered in each case because these positions will experience the highest value of deformation and stress on the lashing bridge structure thus it is expected that these areas will exhibit the largest dynamic response on the structure to visualize the nature of the system fourier expansion is applied to calculate the magnitude of the dynamic response additionally the effects of each parameter are discussed separately using rms values and time history comparison given that the driving excitation is a strictly sinusoidal excitation the deformation in the lateral direction is neglected in other words for the comparison between the experimental and numerical data the result related to the lateral motion is not considered 3 2 1 driving excitation amplitude fig 24 a and b compare the dynamic response of the system at different excitation amplitudes the corresponding values of the experimental data rms are 0 3115 0 1921 and 0 1353 mm respectively further the finite element numerical simulation predictions are 0 2922 0 1900 and 0 1403 mm respectively the differences between the data are 6 20 1 09 and 3 70 respectively the numerical data are consistent with the experimental data with the increased magnitude of the driving excitation the amplitude of the dynamic response at the measurement point also increases whereas its increase is not rigorously consistent with a fixed ratio a similar trend is observed in the stress measurement at point 3 fig 24 c the larger the amplitude of the excitation motion the more obvious the nonlinear dynamic response of the system will be though the examples herein correspond to the case of 0 40 hz this effect is observed in all experimental and numerical cases over the studied frequency range as shown in fig 24 d the dynamic response amplitude was asymmetric about the zero lines which is attributed to the different stiffness between the open end and closed end of containers the dynamic response of the similar features of the lashing bridge was not obvious fig 24 a the lashing bridge exhibited greater stiffness than the container stack 3 2 2 driving excitation frequency fig 25 a and b compare the dynamic response of the system at different excitation frequencies the corresponding values of the experimental data rms are 0 3115 0 1649 and 0 1080 mm respectively these measurements are consistent with the finite element prediction the numerical simulation results are 0 2922 0 1765 and 0 1103 mm respectively in addition the maximum difference between the data is 7 03 as a result there is a positive correlation between the driving frequency and dynamic response amplitude as shown in fig 25 c the test data of the container stack point 2 were 1 4943 0 7172 and 0 3508 mm respectively the numerical simulation results were 1 5631 0 8021 and 0 3782 mm respectively obviously the system had a positive effect based on the frequency fig 26 shows the dynamic response of a system with gaps at different driving excitation frequencies at the excitation frequency of 0 25 hz and amplitude of 12 the corresponding value of the experimental data and numerical simulation is 0 2029 and 0 2120 mm respectively indicating a difference of 4 49 at the excitation frequency of 0 40 hz and amplitude of 8 the corresponding values of the experimental data and numerical simulation are 0 2207 and 0 2303 mm respectively showing a difference of 4 34 the effect of the excitation frequency on the system dynamic response is greater than that of the magnitude of the excitation amplitude which is identified in all experimental and numerical cases 3 2 3 vertical gap effect the vertical gap between the container corner connections needs to be considered during the dynamic response analysis of the container stack for the excitation frequency of 0 25 hz the time history curve for the gap size of 0 0 mm and 1 5 mm cases fig 27 a and the numerical simulation results rms were 0 5408 mm and 0 8021 mm respectively the corresponding values for the experimental data are 0 4806 mm and 0 7172 mm respectively the differences between the numerical data were 12 53 and 11 84 respectively for the excitation frequency of 0 4 hz the time history curve for the gap size of 0 mm and 1 5 mm cases fig 27 b and the test results rms were 0 8051 and 1 4943 mm respectively the increased gap size would enhance the amplitude observed in the deformation measuring and the stress measuring of the lashing bridge and container stack this effect was observed in all experimental and numerical cases the time history curves in fig 27 are asymmetrical based on the zero lines the increased pitching excitation frequency gives rise to more obvious asymmetry of the curve this interesting phenomenon is ascribed to the inconsistent stiffness of the open and closed ends of the container the open end door of the container was more resilient than the closed end wall fig 28 a shows a comparison between systems with different gaps at the excitation frequency of 0 25 hz and amplitude of 12 the corresponding values of the 0 and 1 5 mm gap test data are 0 1649 and 0 1902 mm respectively at the excitation frequency of 0 4 hz and amplitude of 8 the corresponding values of the 0 mm gap and 1 5 mm gap test data are 0 1921 and 0 2190 mm respectively the effect of the gap on the system dynamic response is greater than that of the magnitude of the excitation amplitude fig 28 b and c indicate that the gap exerts a positive effect on the dynamic response that is to say an increase in the gap can enhance the dynamic response this is an interesting finding because the simple physical application is designed to reduce the observed peaks it can be inferred that the gap directly affects the dynamic response of the container stack and then influences the lashing bridge structure accordingly reducing the gap of the twist lock by a more rational design can effectively decrease the dynamic response the corresponding values of the experimental data at the excitation frequency of 0 40 hz are 0 3015 and 0 3401 mm respectively and the maximum difference reaches 12 80 as shown in fig 28 c it can be explained that the gap increases the nonlinearity of the system dynamic response a similar trend is also observed in the stress measurement at point 3 fig 28 d the corresponding values of the experimental data at the excitation frequency of 0 40 hz are 12 72 and 10 42 mpa respectively and the maximum difference reaches 22 07 3 2 4 lashing rod stiffness fig 29 shows the dynamic response of a system with different lashing rod stiffness at 8 and 12 conditions the results indicate that the dynamics response is not affected by the lashing rod stiffness the lashing rods selected in the test were hollow cylindrical steel tubes their wall thickness was 1 and 2 mm respectively and their outer diameters were 10 mm though the choice of this value is largely arbitrary its effects are insignificant as long as the value itself is not extremely small or large undoubtedly this is one of the critical research results in this study 3 2 5 payload in fig 30 the difference between the experimental data and numerical value rms data is nearly 10 further analysis reveals that the structural difference between the numerical model and actual experimental model is the underlying cause of error in the rms value for the experiments that involve loads the configuration of the payload was simulated as a set of steel plates for the inertia force estimation in the finite element calculation the vertical position of the center of gravity of the cargo on each container was estimated at 45 of the container height accordingly both configurations led to different torque distributions in the system thereby increasing the difference between experimental and numerical results thus how to achieve the optimal distribution of payloads in the stack is worth studying 4 discussion the lashing bridge technology is one of the core technologies of the ultra large container ship it significantly affects the main dimensions of the hull structure design the quantity and arrangement of the cargo and container safety during transportation this study aims to develop a systematic approach to analyze the mechanical behavior of the lashing bridge structure in this final section a shortlist of subjects for discussion is presented 1 during the coupling research of the lashing bridge and hull structure the key research object is the lashing bridge structure the transverse bulkhead structure of 3 0 m height was replaced by a steel plate with a thickness of 30 mm under laboratory conditions according to the experimental and numerical simulation results with the consideration of both static and dynamic conditions this simplification is appropriate for simulating the boundary conditions of the lashing bridge in addition the longitudinal stiffness of the lashing bridge is low and the root supported by the elongated column and bracket is prone to stress concentration it is highlighted that this location is more likely to suffer fatigue damage yuan et al 2018 which is consistent with our findings thus in the future design stages attention should be paid to the part where the lashing bridge is coupled with the hull structure 2 the largest limitation for the dynamic test of the lashing bridge structure is that only a few cases were investigated moreover the research was based on the case of single stack pitching motion therefore the number of cases in the research are necessary to be enlarged the dynamic response of lashing bridges under various motions e g the form of combined motion of pitch roll and heave must be addressed in future studies which can help to understand the situation during the maritime transport 3 the true lashing system during maritime transportation is affected by many physical parameters which are sometimes difficult to simulate in an experiment thus the optimal method is to select the main physical effects as parameters e g payload stiffness twist lock gap etc some important parameters were excluded in some stages e g only the effects of a single stack on the system were considered among them the payload is a very valuable variable and the distribution of the payload significantly affects both the system dynamic response and ship stability the optimal placement of the weight of the cargo in the stack of containers can be achieved by optimization whereas placing the heavy boxes at the lowest level should be considered the large angle of inclination and high frequency of the driving force can improve the appearance of additional lateral force components gravity which facilitates the system to exceed the friction acting on the corner casting and thus increases the dynamic response this confirms our understanding of the effect of this variable in the dynamic response the gap size must be included in any further study because it is identified as the primary source of nonlinearity in the system dynamic response this has a more realistic impact on the container stack dynamic response during shipping 4 during the actual shipping process the position of the axis of the pitch motion is not fixed and the stack away from the axis might generate a higher dynamic response the driving excitation is a rigorously sinusoidal driving with the center of rotation just below the center of gravity of the stack however this method facilitates to understand the effect of different control parameters on the mechanical behavior of the lashing bridge in general the results and predictions of the numerical models are reasonable however it must be noted that the numerical simulation results are valid within a limited frequency range 5 conclusions this study aims to develop a systematic method to analyze the mechanical behavior of ultra large container ship lashing bridge structure e g static dynamic scaled distortion model construction structural coupling and dynamic effects given that the similarity principle finite element method and multi objective intelligent optimization are combined to build a scaled distortion model of 1 10 narrowing lashing bridge and 20 ft shipping dry cargo container in addition a series of experiments and numerical simulations were performed the results of the research are concluded as follows 1 the consistency of the scaled model and prototype of the lashing bridge in structural stiffness such as average stiffness and lateral stiffness is verified by the static strength test and numerical simulation the modal experimental results show that the frequency response functions mode frequencies and mode shapes conform to the similarity criteria experimental results reveal that a reasonable scaled model can replace the prototype lashing bridge for static and modal experimental analysis which provides a shortcut for the structural modification and substructure coupling analysis of large lashing bridge prototypes 2 combining the finite element method with intelligent optimization algorithm and model update the multi objective optimization mathematical model was constructed moreover the optimal design of the lashing bridge and container distortion similar model was achieved these can significantly improve the design efficiency and accuracy this method has certain versatility and can be applied to other structures 3 the effects of various control parameters on the dynamic response of the lashing bridge were studied under the high stack large dip and high frequency pitching the correlation of dynamic characteristics depends on many factors such as the amplitude frequency lashing rod stiffness container load and the size of the twist lock gap it solves the problem of how simple changes in basic variables affect the force and dynamic response of the lashing bridge it also provides useful advice to the industry and minimizes the complexity of the problem 4 the coupling effect produced by the transverse bulkhead renders the lower longitudinal stiffness of the lashing bridge structure based on previous experience the lashing bridge structure showed a high vibration response in the longitudinal direction under full load and ballast conditions the experimental results indicate that the top end of the column support has a large deformation response the bottom end of the column support and brackets exhibit a large strain sufficient evidence in this study can support that the dynamic response of the system is linear under small loads while for large loads the system becomes unstable and non linear therefore the shape of the column support and bracket needs to be optimized to improve the service life of the lashing bridge an important objective of the study is to assess the sufficiency of the experimental design method in providing basic mechanical behavior for the lashing bridge structure considering the coupling effects and dynamic effects of the lashing bridge and hull this may be the first step of a more reliable method to determine the reliability degree of the lashing system in operation credit authorship

21991,most existing studies and standards for containers and lashing equipment correspond to static conditions which stresses current imperfections in the design specifications of the lashing bridge structure and gaps in experimental research in this paper an approach is proposed to study the mechanical behavior of the ultra large containership lashing bridge structure based on buckingham s theorem and the froude scaling laws a scaled model test system with a container stack and twist lock is developed for a systematic experimental study of the lashing bridge additionally the numerical analysis of the static modal and dynamic response were carried out under the typical motion of the lashing bridge also the coupling effect of the lashing bridge and hull structure is considered to design the system the physical size mass and moment of inertia and structural characteristics longitudinal lateral and torsional stiffness of the proportional model are determined by two dimensionless numbers froude s number and cauchy s number the results suggest that the mechanical behavior of the ultra large containership lashing bridge structure can be easily obtained from the reduced model this can help to achieve the structural design and optimization and the substructure coupling analysis of ultra large lashing bridges keywords lashing bridge container stack dynamics csd scaling distorted geometry pitching 1 introduction 1 1 objectives and significance in the industry of container transportation many containers are lost or damaged each year which results in huge economic losses and brings risks to the navigation and the environment aguiar de souza et al 2013 aguiar de souza et al 2012 kirkayak et al 2011 meanwhile for large and ultra large container ships a 12 tier stack has been stacked on the deck taking up more than 60 of the total number of containers this significantly increases the load on the stack and lashing system in addition the container securing of ultra large container ships has gradually adopted the form of external lashing which affects the design of ultra large container ship lashing bridges as well as the container stowage and securing the forces caused by the ship motion e g roll and pitch wind and green water are ultimately delivered to the hull structure via the lashing bridge structure simultaneously the displacement of the container stack induced by the elastic behavior of the hull will impose additional load to the lashing system the lashing bridge structure exhibits a high aspect ratio and relatively low stiffness under abnormal expansion such as parametric rolling not expansion or extreme sea conditions the lashing bridge will operate under deteriorated conditions affecting the structural integrity of the container stack stored on the deck accordingly it is urgent to explore the mechanical behavior of the lashing bridge under dynamic conditions which helps to investigate the causes of container loss a question still remains why the dynamic response problem of the lashing system and container stack cannot be solved under the influence of ship motion ship vibration wind load and wave load what is confusing is that even many containers are lost the security protocols and standards of most securing systems only imply dynamic effects aguiar de souza et al 2012 aguiar de souza et al 2013 kirkayak et al 2011 however this behavior is not considered when calculating the lashing bridge strength li and wang 2018 the larger the container ship in size the taller and wider the lashing bridge structure will be the lashing points are distributed on different heights of the lashing bridge and the overall stiffness is lower than the hull structure because the stiffness of the support structure at the end of the lashing bridge is not high enough the lashing bridge base cannot be simply considered as a fixed constraint when performing numerical simulation while a more realistic boundary condition should be considered i e the coupling effect of the lashing bridge and hull structure however this effect has been ignored by most studies the laws of similarity for fluids and structures have been applied extensively oshiro et al 2017 neuberger et al 2007 the experiment of the scaled model can effectively address the limited capabilities of the test equipment and reduce the high experimental cost of the prototype structure test thus a scaled model can be constructed by similarity theory which is a crucial method for the structural analysis and optimal design torkamani et al 2009 to design a new lashing bridge of ultra large container ships full physical simulation experiments are required to investigate its mechanical behavior and validate the numerical model to fill this gap this study proposes the following approach first the static and modal analysis was conducted using the finite element analysis with the consideration of the coupling effect of the lashing bridge and hull structure second according to buckingham s theorem the lashing bridge scaled model was built moreover the static and modal test of the structure was performed finally the 20 ft container scaled model was designed by the froude scaling laws and an 11 tier container stack was constructed a series of tests and numerical simulations were performed for the dynamic response of the lashing bridge influenced by container stack inertial loads due to ship pitching motions 1 2 literature review the design of lashing bridges is one of the core technologies of large container ships it not only relates to the actual number of containers and flexibility of the container placement but also affects the determination of main dimensions and general layout of the ship the linear static fe analysis is a common practice in the early design stage of the lashing bridge the classification society helps designers streamline the design process through different design guidelines and perform structural verification of the proposed design structural modeling aspects are well defined and established however there are still no unified approaches regarding the modeling of how and where dynamic loads e g wind green water gravity ship motions etc in the fe model the strength of the lashing bridge should be assessed by the maximum lashing force in container securing arrangements csa according to a previous report gl 2012 a force equal to 61 of the safe working load swl of each lashing rod was applied on each position of a lashing plate connected to the bay containers according to the ccs specification ccs 2015 the lashing force is taken as 60 of the swl based on the lr specification lr 2016 the lashing rod forces are taken as follows if lashing rods are connected to the top level of the lashing bridge 75 of the swl of each lashing rod if lashing rods are connected to the height below the top of the lashing bridge 55 of the swl of each lashing rod these two rules are employed in this study li and wang 2018 combined knowledge engineering and multi objective optimization design methods to successfully design the lashing bridge structure they also optimized the vibration response of the lashing bridge while reducing the lashing bridge weight li and wang 2019 intelligently designed and optimized the lashing bridge structure based on the knowledge engineering method the lashing bridge structure was improved based on the framework of the functionally graded tube moreover the vibration response of the structure was reduced some examples of real accidents reveal that significant ship movements may result in serious or catastrophic consequences bulian et al 2015 most loads on the lashing bridge structure are attributed to the inertial forces generated by the stack of containers recently due to the increased loss of containers in shipping the dynamic factors during the transportation process may affect the lashing system more negatively wolf et al 2011 introduced the latest technology on container stowage on decks kirkayak et al 2011 built a 1 4 scaled model of a 20 ft shipping container based on the froude scaling laws and conducted dynamic tests and numerical simulations of the 2 tier container stack aguiar de souza et al 2012 studied the basic mechanical behavior of a 7 tier stack under the heave motion using a 1 4 scaled model of the container aguiar de souza et al 2013 simulated the dynamic response of containers with different conditions for multiple stacks and obtained the corresponding dynamic mechanical behavior via a finite element method in order to decrease the computational cost of the container stack dynamic simulations a simplified finite element model procedure of the stack was proposed by brocco et al 2015 based on this model the stack actual deformation can be accurately simulated moro et al 2015 performed extensive calculations on the simplified model of the container stack the inertial forces acting on the stack were determined and diagrams that show the failure occurrence of container structures or lashing equipment were presented these studies are vital for understanding the dynamic behavior of the container stack though these studies were based on a simple lashing system with a low container stack and cross lashing internal lashing they also can be used to understand the dynamic behavior of the lashing system of a high tier container stack similarity theory is a branch of engineering science and has been applied in different fields e g structural engineering vibration and shock problems as shown in fig 1 the scaling results obtained from scaled model tests can facilitate engineers to accurately predict the behavior of large prototypes coutinho et al 2016 ramu et al 2013 koning and boom 2009 conducted the dynamic research under heave motion for 2 tier and 4 tier container stacks using the 1 4 scaled model wolf and rathje 2008 the result revealed that the dynamic response of the scaled model is similar to that of a full scale model therefore the scaled model can be employed to assess the behavior of the prototype zhang et al 2015 investigated the prototype 27 m2 large linear vibrating screen and 1 10 scaled similar model based on experimental modal analysis it suggested that the inherent characteristic parameters of the linear vibrating screen can be obtained intuitively and effectively using the modal analysis method the validity of the experimental modal analysis was confirmed using the scaled down similar test model and the consistency and reliability of the test data of the similar model and the prototype were verified in reality due to limitations of the manufacturing technology the geometric distortion does not match the exact similarity requirements of the buckingham s theorem whereas the consistency between the scaled model and prototype still exists cho et al 2005 oshiro and alves 2012 presented a method to consider the geometric distortion and analyzed the dynamic response of the distorted scaled model under impact loading the results indicated that the distortion model is capable of predicting the prototype structure behavior accurately in fact there are many other methods like similarity theory and finite element methods which can be used to create similar models coutinho et al 2016 so far the research about developing similarities in complex structures is attractive in this study the similarity theory finite element method and modern intelligent optimization design method were combined which can construct similar models of complex structures effectively the lashing bridge is the most important equipment in the securing system of ultra large container ships therefore the investigation of the mechanical behavior of lashing bridges can facilitate to understand the causes of lashing failures during maritime transport to achieve this goal this article carried out a series of tests static strength modal and dynamic and numerical simulation of the lashing bridge then section 2 introduces the construction of the distortion scaled model and numerical model the selection of test parameters and data processing method based on the similarity principle section 3 analyzes the results of experimental and numerical simulation for the lashing bridge section 4 discusses the main features and limitations of the proposed method section 5 draws the main conclusion and summarizes the observations of this study 2 methodology 2 1 objects of study the lashing bridge structure studied in this paper is designed for a 20000teu ultra large container ship of shanghai waigaoqiao shipbuilding sws co ltd the main hull can be loaded with 24 rows of containers of different tiers each row of up to 21 arranged containers stacking up to 12 tiers the main deck can also be arranged in 24 rows of containers each row of up to arrange 23 rows of containers stacking up to 11 tiers stacked the main dimensions of the hull are listed in table 1 the research object is the aftermost lashing bridge of the hull table 2 shows the stowage plan for the aftermost bay of the 20000 teu ultra large container ship the three dimension 3 d model of the lashing bridge is shown in fig 2 and the characteristic parameters are listed in table 3 the third fourth and fifth tier platforms all engage in securing the dynamic study of the lashing bridge structure includes the aftermost and the second aftermost lashing bridge and the container stack between them p i protection and indemnity insurance clubs recommended the use of a system based on twist locks lashing rods and turnbuckles twist lock is designed to connect adjacent containers in the stack or to combine the base container to the base socket lashing assemblies are utilized to resist the overturning moment of the stack in particular they consist of a lashing rod and turnbuckle a steel rod is typically performed as the tension element in modern container lashing assemblies abs 2010 as shown in fig 3 there are two different arrangements of the lashing system which is the internal lashing and external lashing for container stacks under lateral loads the internal lashing secures the stack compressed side thus the compressive load acting on container posts is increased by the vertical component of the lashing force which limits the allowable stack weight for the external lashing the acting lashing rods are fixed to the stack lifted side with tension reaction forces which allows higher stack weights higher container capacity and better cargo distribution the lashing force will be higher than the internal lashing especially when the high vertical clearance is allowed on the locks in this study the external lashing is the securing method of the container stack furthermore the fifth and sixth tiers of the container stack are involved in the securing 2 2 similarity parameters selected for model construction the inertial force generated by the container stack is transferred to the lashing bridge by the lashing rod which is the main part of the external load it is known that structural stiffness changes directly affect the structural dynamic response and force aguiar de souza et al 2012 aguiar de souza et al 2013 kirkayak et al 2011 in this study some forces like the inertial force gravity and elastic force were believed to perform an essential part in the dynamics of container stack thus the selection of the scaled model parameters is to choose either the ratio between gravity force and inertia force or between elastic force and inertia force aguiar de souza et al 2012 aguiar de souza et al 2013 when a scaled model is constructed under the laboratory condition it is almost impossible for two systems to match all similar parameters the degree of the effect of each similar parameter on the overall system error is also different consequently ignoring the parameters that express secondary phenomena does not significantly affect the mechanical behavior of the structure coutinho et al 2016 section 2 3 and 2 4 describe details about the construction of the container and lashing bridge scaled model the vital parameters in the design of the container scaled model include mass moments of inertia transversal racking stiffness of front open end frames transversal racking stiffness of rear closed end frames longitudinal racking stiffness torsional stiffness lateral stiffness modal analysis the critical parameters in the design process of the lashing bridge scaled model include mass average stiffness transversal stiffness longitudinal stiffness strain brackets manoeuvring holes etc as shown in fig 21 a modal analysis 2 3 scaled container model design this study employed 11 scaled models of a 20 ft iso freight container with a 1 10 length scale factor the research investigates all csc standards csc 1996 shipping container manufacturer data and iso container standards 668 iso 1995 830 iso 1999 1496 1 iso 1990 and 3874 iso 1997 the two systems had a strict numerical relationship in terms of geometric features such as length width and height in other words geometric similarities can be achieved based on froude scaling laws the similarity of velocity and acceleration can be guaranteed that is kinematic similarity the dynamic similarity was reached when the force applied to the system was set at a fixed ratio the design process of the container scale model follows the scaling laws which is summarized in table 4 a method combining similarity theory finite element and optimization design method is proposed in this study to achieve the construction of the scaled model the specific workflow is shown in fig 4 according to the scaling laws the first step is to obtain the characteristic parameters of the scaled model the second step is to determine the structural form of the scaled model by the finite element analysis considering the construction of the model standard profiles like rectangular steel steel pipe and l section steel are selected in the design process the simplified geometry representation of scaled container model is shown in fig 5 the final step is to construct a multi objective optimized mathematical model and select the appropriate optimized algorithm to obtain remarkable design results to obtain optimal design parameters a mathematical model for the model update is proposed the design variable is the thickness of the structural component the overall structure weight mode frequency and stiffness are adopted as the objective function the optimized problems are presented in the following form find x x 1 x 2 x n t min δ m a s s x 1 x 2 x n δ m o d e x 1 x 2 x n δ s t i f f n e s s x 1 x 2 x n s t x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 x n x n g 1 x 1 x 2 x n 0 g 2 x 1 x 2 x n 0 g m x 1 x 2 x n 0 where mass denotes the structure weight mode represents the frequencies from the first to the fifth mode of the structure x 1 x 2 x n t represents the thickness of the structural component δ is the difference between the target value and numerical simulation result constraints of the structural optimization include the moment of inertia and strength of the structure along with the manufacturability of the local structure etc the multi island genetic algorithm miga based on the random weighting method was employed to optimize the structure in each iteration the multi objective issue can be transformed into a single objective optimization problem by randomly selecting weight coefficients the basic parameter settings in this study are displayed in table 5 the optimization process is conducted by the isight software after optimization the obtained detailed geometric dimensions of the scaled model are listed in table 6 the scaled structural variation curves in the optimization process are plotted in fig 6 and fig 7 the static strength analysis of the structure was conducted to estimate the model stiffness fig 8 shows the results of the finite element analysis for the longitudinal stiffness the values of geometry and structural stiffness obtained from scaling laws are listed in table 7 2 4 scaled lashing bridge model design as shown in fig 9 a finite element model of the coupling of the lashing bridge with the hull structure is built and the transverse bulkhead height is 3 0 m the finite element model includes the main structural members of the lashing bridge such as pillars shear walls walkway boards and connecting brackets attachments with no effect on the overall strength such as lashing eye plates pillar guide plates etc are not considered fig 2 demonstrates the dimensions of the finite element model of the lashing bridge pillars 1 6 are rectangular steel tubes with a cross section of 250 300 mm short pillars are square steel tubes with a cross section of 200 200 mm the first platform is not applied in the model because it is designed as a grid and has no effect on the overall strength the stiffeners on the shear wall are modeled using beam elements brackets and manoeuvring holes are fine mesh regions in local stress concentrated areas the shell plate decks bulkheads etc are simulated by plate elements and beam elements are used to simulate longitudinals and stiffeners if it is a longitudinal girder and beam with a web height greater than 400 mm the web is modeled with a plate element and the panel is modeled as a beam element the bulb bar in stiffener is modeled using the equivalent beam element the detailed model has been created by only low order quadrilateral and triangular plate 2d elements with four or three nodes respectively the standard fe model mesh size is 100 100 mm ccs 2015 the boundary condition and lashing force are revealed in fig 9 the lashing force direction is determined according to the container bay arrangements and the lashing bridge location as shown in table 8 the lashing force on each lashing rod is set as 175 kn at the preliminary design stage ccs 2015 the models and structural fe analysis have been carried out using the msc patran nastran suite the strength analysis results reveal that the von mises stress and the maximum shearing stress is 227 and 115 n mm2 respectively the maximum resultant stress and maximum shearing stress are less than the allowable values von mises stress 314 2 n mm2 shear stress 142 n mm2 ccs 2015 thus the strength of the lashing bridge meets the requirements fig 10 shows the von mises and shear stresses of the lashing bridge structure the first order mode frequency and mode shape of the prototype are shown in fig 11 the finite element analysis of the lashing bridge structure shows that the stress concentration is mainly distributed in the bracket and manoeuvring hole positions the scale model also indicates similar stress in these areas the lashing bridge structure has a large aspect ratio if the length scale factor λ is too large it will not only increase the design cost but also result in the absence of modality due to insufficient excitation energy during the modal testing the length scale factor with an extremely small size will increase the processing difficulty consequently the length scale factor of the lashing bridge is set as 1 10 the scale model includes the main structures of the lashing bridge such as the pillar bracket connecting plate aisle plate and shear wall the l section steel of the first tier and the stiffeners of the shear wall are not considered in the scaled model accessories without the impact on the overall strength like column oriented slabs ladders etc are not considered the overall structure is mainly welded by the rectangular steel square steel and plate structure to simulate the relationship between the lashing bridge and transverse bulkhead the lashing bridge scaled model was fixed on a steel plate as shown in fig 12 the 30 mm thickness steel plate was fixed to the ground with 6 pairs of anchor bolts with a diameter of 150 mm according to buckingham s theorem the prototype and scaled models should meet the following similarity criteria geometric similarity stress strain similarity mass and gravity similarity initial conditions as well as boundary condition similarity zhang et al 2013 2015 ramu et al 2013 the general similarity relations for an elastic model are formulated in table 9 the method of constructing the scaled model proposed in section 2 3 is applied to the lashing bridge structure optimization objectives include the average stiffness critical position strain brackets manoeuvring holes etc deformation transversal longitudinal mode frequencies and mode shapes the average stiffness of the bridge structure is calculated by ccs 2015 1 k b y 1 n i 1 n f y i δ y i where k by is average stiffness f y refers to the transversal component of lashing rod force δ y denotes the lashing rod eye transversal displacement n is the number of lashing rod forces the values for the geometric shapes and structural features obtained from the law of proportionality in table 9 are listed in table 10 the dimensional cloud map and photo of the scaled lashing bridge are shown in fig 12 the fe model of the scaled lashing bridge has been constructed using only low order quadrilateral and triangular plate 2d elements with four or three nodes respectively the scaled model is made of plain carbon steel isotropic linear elastic material young s modulus e 210 gpa poisson ratio ν 0 30 and density ρ 7850 kg m3 the transversal displacement of the lashing bridge scaled model is illustrated in fig 13 2 5 experimental investigation it is difficult to simulate and understand all variables involved in the dynamics of container stack and lashing systems hence the main factors that affect the dynamic response should be carefully considered this study primarily focuses on the impact behavior of the container stack on the lashing system under large dip and high frequency pitching motion a sinusoidal driving excitation was applied to the system via a three degrees shaking table the magnitude and frequency of the driving excitation were performed as input variables the investigation focuses on the deformation of the top of the column support point 1 in the securing fig 14 displays the physical position of this point this point was chosen for its highest values for the dynamic response in the longitudinal direction the investigation also focused on the stress of the column support base and bracket referred to point 2 5 in fig 14 the strain rosettes were used to obtain the dynamic response of these points for all cases several physical variables were idealized as control parameters to understand their effects on the dynamic response two of the variables affect the driving excitation the other three are physical features that directly relate to th10e physical characteristics of the system namely the amplitude and frequency of the driving excitation this is the first factor that influences the dynamic response of the system elastic deformation of the container in the actual securing system the stack height of the container on the deck can reach 20 m moreover elastic deformation is a vital physical phenomenon worthy of considering container cargo configuration fig 15 b though the container load is a simple variable its effect has not been not fully understood yet the weight of the container cargo significantly affects the lashing force which is widely recognized in the industry lashing rod stiffness the load is transmitted between the container stack and lashing bridge by the lashing rod the effect of different stiffnesses of the lashing rod on the system has not been fully understood yet twist lock mechanical behavior it is highlighted that the twist lock gap remarkably affects the dynamics of the container stack aguiar de souza et al 2012 aguiar de souza et al 2013 kirkayak et al 2011 this phenomenon is also known as the gap effect during the test in addition the forces in the column support and brackets were used as additional variables these areas point 2 to 5 in fig 14 were chosen due to their higher load values under all studied conditions furthermore this choice is based on the practical applications of this study that is to say load values are more practical for the maritime transportation industry than deformation ones for the container stack the deformation of the top corner of the open end of the highest container expressed as point 6 was evaluated those points were selected for their highest dynamic response values in all studies the longitudinal deformation of the point 1 and 6 were recorded by a displacement sensor micrometer the data presented is the result of the subtraction between the deformation time dynamic response and the driving excitation obtained after proper filtering i e the relative displacement data the time history and fourier series expansion and rms values were used to analyze data which can explore how the structure responds to the control variables it is a critical step to denoise the signal obtained by the test before analysis since the excitation frequency of each dynamic test is constant the low pass filter chebyshev filter is the best choice for eliminating signal noise the simple and fast harmonic analysis was conducted to determine the cutoff frequency 2 6 experimental system parameter selection a lashing bridge dynamic behavior testing system contains a shaking table two lashing bridge scaled models eight lashing rods and a single row of eleven container scaled models as shown in fig 15 the adjacent upper and lower container models are connected by bolts in the corner castings full load conditions were simulated by configuring weights in the stack this configuration mimics similar conditions during maritime transportation according to the ccs specification the maximum pitch angle does not exceed 8 0250 while the pitch frequency cannot exceed 0 2850 hz the amplitudes of the predefined drive excitations in this study were 5 8 and 12 respectively the maximum value of the predefined drive excitation frequency was 0 40 hz table 11 displays a quantitative list of experimental control variables the fifth and sixth tier containers are secured using lashing rods to reduce transversal forces acting on the lower containers in the stack the lashing rod is a cylindrical steel tube with an outer diameter of 10 mm the wall thickness 1 mm and 2 mm was used to indicate a different stiffness this study used an external lashing scheme that was popular in recent years each lashing rod reacts to a tensile force whose line of action is the rod axis while it is ineffective when a compression load is applied the lashing rod is connected to the corner casting by an l section part with a rotating shaft as shown in fig 16 the l section part is connected to the container corner casting by a bolt one end of the lashing rod is connected to the eye plate and the other end is tightened by a bolt this design ensures that the lashing rod is only subjected to tension the gravitational and inertial loads strictly depend on the payload carried within the containers steel plates are placed on each tier of the stack to simulate full load conditions as shown in fig 15 b the container weights configuration is shown in table 12 this configuration is closer to real conditions the containers loaded on the deck are stacked and connected one to the other via twist locks the gap effect caused by the twist lock is considered to be one of the important factors that influence loads in the container stack and lashing systems however its effect is not fully understood in fig 17 according to the actual characteristics of the button lock a 1 5 mm gap is placed between the containers of adjacent tiers which aims to explore its influence on the dynamic response 2 7 dynamic system numerical investigation the dynamic finite element analysis system of the lashing bridge is constructed as shown in fig 18 all structural analyses have been carried out using the commercial software ansys workbench 18 0 by extracting the mid surface of models the number of meshes can be greatly reduced and the computational efficiency can be improved the detailed model has been created using only low order quadrilateral and triangular plate 2d elements with four or three nodes respectively there are two points that should be declared for the simplification of the finite element model firstly eye plates and columns that are not involved in the securing are not considered secondly a node is placed at the geometric center of the each container to adjust moments of inertia and mass to properly simulate the connection between containers a nonlinear spring was used here to simulate the performance of the twist lock kirkayak and suzuki 2008 developed an optimal function relationship to simulate twist locks via a series of experiments though this nonlinear mathematical relationship is too simple it is sufficient to describe the dynamic behavior of the twist lock more information can be found in the research of kirkayak and suzuki 2008 the stiffness of the twist lock is shown in table 13 in this test bolts of m5 25 mm were used instead of twist locks as shown in fig 17 b twist locks were modeled using the mathematical relationship depicted in fig 19 a this non linear behavior is basically consistent with the bolt stiffness in the experimental test and the gap can be adjusted by the bolt damping elements and contact elements were added between corner castings to represent the frictional effect between containers and the coefficient of friction is 0 25 because the lashing rod is only subjected to the tensile load during the work it can be replaced with a spring having equal stiffness the spring unit connects the corner casting to the eye plate which realizes the load transfer between the container stack and lashing bridge as shown in fig 19 b in the software ansys workbench 18 0 the behavior of the spring element was set to a beam which was consistent with the size of the lashing rod in the test bonded constraints are defined between the lashing bridge bottom plate and shaking table as shown in fig 20 a simplified model of the shaking table is constructed to facilitate the application of different drive excitations during the numerical simulation the shacking table was considered as a rigid body finally the dynamic numerical analysis considers the geometric nonlinearity in the implicit integration scheme 3 experimental and numerical simulation results 3 1 model validation based on static and dynamic characteristics the magnitude of the lashing force is listed in table 13 the third fourth and fifth tier lashing points were all loaded with a force of 178 5 kg according to the requirements of the china classification society specification ccs 2015 the third tier was loaded with a force of 166 kg and the fourth and fifth tiers were loaded with a force of 255 kg according to the lr specification lr 2016 hydraulic oil pump and hydraulic cylinders were used as a source of force during the experimental the direction of the lashing force is determined by the position of the c beam and the pulley one end of the wire rope is connected to the hydraulic cylinder and the tension sensor as shown in fig 21 a the load is applied to the lashing eye plate by a wire rope as displayed in fig 21 b according to the static strength analysis result in section 2 4 the arrangement of measuring points of the critical position strain is demonstrated in fig 21 d the corresponding strain values were obtained by arranging strain rosettes at different measuring points the stress values of some measuring points are listed in table 14 the maximum difference is 19 5 in fig 21 c the lateral and longitudinal maximum deformations were recorded by a displacement sensor in table 15 the experimental results of the deformation are compared with the values obtained by similarity theory the maximum difference in the data is 6 51 the applied excitation position of the exciter is shown in fig 21 a the excitation frequency ranges from 20 to 200 hz and a total of 38 acceleration sensors are arranged in the lashing bridge structure the history output signal during the excitation process was recorded by an accelerometer the frequency domain curve was obtained by fast fourier transform fft the modal test is illustrated in fig 22 a fig 22 b presents the frequency response function curve and fig 23 shows the mode shape the experimental results are consistent with the target values calculated by scaling laws the mode shape clearly shows the side plate bending and the column support bending the main causes are the large area steel plate side plate aisle plate and shear wall and elongated structural features of the column owing to the shell structure the lashing bridges at the aft end of the hull are more likely to vibrate because they are closer to the propeller and main machinery li and wang 2018 it is recommended to increase the stiffness in a longitudinal direction the difference between the experimental measurement results and target values calculated by the scaling laws is shown in table 16 the maximum difference of the data is 4 12 and the mode shape is consistent therefore the finite element model of the lashing bridge was validated with acceptable deviation and the similitude relation used in the previous section was also validated 3 2 dynamic study under typical motion excitation most current specifications for the lashing equipment correspond to static conditions in this research a more realistic approach with the consideration of dynamic effects was proposed how to solve this problem with a more reasonable method is also one of the important goals in this study consequently this experiment explores the dynamics of the lashing bridge under the high stack large dip and high frequency pitching conditions the control parameters in the system are described in detail in sections 2 5 and 2 6 to compare results the dynamic response of point 1 and point 3 are considered in each case because these positions will experience the highest value of deformation and stress on the lashing bridge structure thus it is expected that these areas will exhibit the largest dynamic response on the structure to visualize the nature of the system fourier expansion is applied to calculate the magnitude of the dynamic response additionally the effects of each parameter are discussed separately using rms values and time history comparison given that the driving excitation is a strictly sinusoidal excitation the deformation in the lateral direction is neglected in other words for the comparison between the experimental and numerical data the result related to the lateral motion is not considered 3 2 1 driving excitation amplitude fig 24 a and b compare the dynamic response of the system at different excitation amplitudes the corresponding values of the experimental data rms are 0 3115 0 1921 and 0 1353 mm respectively further the finite element numerical simulation predictions are 0 2922 0 1900 and 0 1403 mm respectively the differences between the data are 6 20 1 09 and 3 70 respectively the numerical data are consistent with the experimental data with the increased magnitude of the driving excitation the amplitude of the dynamic response at the measurement point also increases whereas its increase is not rigorously consistent with a fixed ratio a similar trend is observed in the stress measurement at point 3 fig 24 c the larger the amplitude of the excitation motion the more obvious the nonlinear dynamic response of the system will be though the examples herein correspond to the case of 0 40 hz this effect is observed in all experimental and numerical cases over the studied frequency range as shown in fig 24 d the dynamic response amplitude was asymmetric about the zero lines which is attributed to the different stiffness between the open end and closed end of containers the dynamic response of the similar features of the lashing bridge was not obvious fig 24 a the lashing bridge exhibited greater stiffness than the container stack 3 2 2 driving excitation frequency fig 25 a and b compare the dynamic response of the system at different excitation frequencies the corresponding values of the experimental data rms are 0 3115 0 1649 and 0 1080 mm respectively these measurements are consistent with the finite element prediction the numerical simulation results are 0 2922 0 1765 and 0 1103 mm respectively in addition the maximum difference between the data is 7 03 as a result there is a positive correlation between the driving frequency and dynamic response amplitude as shown in fig 25 c the test data of the container stack point 2 were 1 4943 0 7172 and 0 3508 mm respectively the numerical simulation results were 1 5631 0 8021 and 0 3782 mm respectively obviously the system had a positive effect based on the frequency fig 26 shows the dynamic response of a system with gaps at different driving excitation frequencies at the excitation frequency of 0 25 hz and amplitude of 12 the corresponding value of the experimental data and numerical simulation is 0 2029 and 0 2120 mm respectively indicating a difference of 4 49 at the excitation frequency of 0 40 hz and amplitude of 8 the corresponding values of the experimental data and numerical simulation are 0 2207 and 0 2303 mm respectively showing a difference of 4 34 the effect of the excitation frequency on the system dynamic response is greater than that of the magnitude of the excitation amplitude which is identified in all experimental and numerical cases 3 2 3 vertical gap effect the vertical gap between the container corner connections needs to be considered during the dynamic response analysis of the container stack for the excitation frequency of 0 25 hz the time history curve for the gap size of 0 0 mm and 1 5 mm cases fig 27 a and the numerical simulation results rms were 0 5408 mm and 0 8021 mm respectively the corresponding values for the experimental data are 0 4806 mm and 0 7172 mm respectively the differences between the numerical data were 12 53 and 11 84 respectively for the excitation frequency of 0 4 hz the time history curve for the gap size of 0 mm and 1 5 mm cases fig 27 b and the test results rms were 0 8051 and 1 4943 mm respectively the increased gap size would enhance the amplitude observed in the deformation measuring and the stress measuring of the lashing bridge and container stack this effect was observed in all experimental and numerical cases the time history curves in fig 27 are asymmetrical based on the zero lines the increased pitching excitation frequency gives rise to more obvious asymmetry of the curve this interesting phenomenon is ascribed to the inconsistent stiffness of the open and closed ends of the container the open end door of the container was more resilient than the closed end wall fig 28 a shows a comparison between systems with different gaps at the excitation frequency of 0 25 hz and amplitude of 12 the corresponding values of the 0 and 1 5 mm gap test data are 0 1649 and 0 1902 mm respectively at the excitation frequency of 0 4 hz and amplitude of 8 the corresponding values of the 0 mm gap and 1 5 mm gap test data are 0 1921 and 0 2190 mm respectively the effect of the gap on the system dynamic response is greater than that of the magnitude of the excitation amplitude fig 28 b and c indicate that the gap exerts a positive effect on the dynamic response that is to say an increase in the gap can enhance the dynamic response this is an interesting finding because the simple physical application is designed to reduce the observed peaks it can be inferred that the gap directly affects the dynamic response of the container stack and then influences the lashing bridge structure accordingly reducing the gap of the twist lock by a more rational design can effectively decrease the dynamic response the corresponding values of the experimental data at the excitation frequency of 0 40 hz are 0 3015 and 0 3401 mm respectively and the maximum difference reaches 12 80 as shown in fig 28 c it can be explained that the gap increases the nonlinearity of the system dynamic response a similar trend is also observed in the stress measurement at point 3 fig 28 d the corresponding values of the experimental data at the excitation frequency of 0 40 hz are 12 72 and 10 42 mpa respectively and the maximum difference reaches 22 07 3 2 4 lashing rod stiffness fig 29 shows the dynamic response of a system with different lashing rod stiffness at 8 and 12 conditions the results indicate that the dynamics response is not affected by the lashing rod stiffness the lashing rods selected in the test were hollow cylindrical steel tubes their wall thickness was 1 and 2 mm respectively and their outer diameters were 10 mm though the choice of this value is largely arbitrary its effects are insignificant as long as the value itself is not extremely small or large undoubtedly this is one of the critical research results in this study 3 2 5 payload in fig 30 the difference between the experimental data and numerical value rms data is nearly 10 further analysis reveals that the structural difference between the numerical model and actual experimental model is the underlying cause of error in the rms value for the experiments that involve loads the configuration of the payload was simulated as a set of steel plates for the inertia force estimation in the finite element calculation the vertical position of the center of gravity of the cargo on each container was estimated at 45 of the container height accordingly both configurations led to different torque distributions in the system thereby increasing the difference between experimental and numerical results thus how to achieve the optimal distribution of payloads in the stack is worth studying 4 discussion the lashing bridge technology is one of the core technologies of the ultra large container ship it significantly affects the main dimensions of the hull structure design the quantity and arrangement of the cargo and container safety during transportation this study aims to develop a systematic approach to analyze the mechanical behavior of the lashing bridge structure in this final section a shortlist of subjects for discussion is presented 1 during the coupling research of the lashing bridge and hull structure the key research object is the lashing bridge structure the transverse bulkhead structure of 3 0 m height was replaced by a steel plate with a thickness of 30 mm under laboratory conditions according to the experimental and numerical simulation results with the consideration of both static and dynamic conditions this simplification is appropriate for simulating the boundary conditions of the lashing bridge in addition the longitudinal stiffness of the lashing bridge is low and the root supported by the elongated column and bracket is prone to stress concentration it is highlighted that this location is more likely to suffer fatigue damage yuan et al 2018 which is consistent with our findings thus in the future design stages attention should be paid to the part where the lashing bridge is coupled with the hull structure 2 the largest limitation for the dynamic test of the lashing bridge structure is that only a few cases were investigated moreover the research was based on the case of single stack pitching motion therefore the number of cases in the research are necessary to be enlarged the dynamic response of lashing bridges under various motions e g the form of combined motion of pitch roll and heave must be addressed in future studies which can help to understand the situation during the maritime transport 3 the true lashing system during maritime transportation is affected by many physical parameters which are sometimes difficult to simulate in an experiment thus the optimal method is to select the main physical effects as parameters e g payload stiffness twist lock gap etc some important parameters were excluded in some stages e g only the effects of a single stack on the system were considered among them the payload is a very valuable variable and the distribution of the payload significantly affects both the system dynamic response and ship stability the optimal placement of the weight of the cargo in the stack of containers can be achieved by optimization whereas placing the heavy boxes at the lowest level should be considered the large angle of inclination and high frequency of the driving force can improve the appearance of additional lateral force components gravity which facilitates the system to exceed the friction acting on the corner casting and thus increases the dynamic response this confirms our understanding of the effect of this variable in the dynamic response the gap size must be included in any further study because it is identified as the primary source of nonlinearity in the system dynamic response this has a more realistic impact on the container stack dynamic response during shipping 4 during the actual shipping process the position of the axis of the pitch motion is not fixed and the stack away from the axis might generate a higher dynamic response the driving excitation is a rigorously sinusoidal driving with the center of rotation just below the center of gravity of the stack however this method facilitates to understand the effect of different control parameters on the mechanical behavior of the lashing bridge in general the results and predictions of the numerical models are reasonable however it must be noted that the numerical simulation results are valid within a limited frequency range 5 conclusions this study aims to develop a systematic method to analyze the mechanical behavior of ultra large container ship lashing bridge structure e g static dynamic scaled distortion model construction structural coupling and dynamic effects given that the similarity principle finite element method and multi objective intelligent optimization are combined to build a scaled distortion model of 1 10 narrowing lashing bridge and 20 ft shipping dry cargo container in addition a series of experiments and numerical simulations were performed the results of the research are concluded as follows 1 the consistency of the scaled model and prototype of the lashing bridge in structural stiffness such as average stiffness and lateral stiffness is verified by the static strength test and numerical simulation the modal experimental results show that the frequency response functions mode frequencies and mode shapes conform to the similarity criteria experimental results reveal that a reasonable scaled model can replace the prototype lashing bridge for static and modal experimental analysis which provides a shortcut for the structural modification and substructure coupling analysis of large lashing bridge prototypes 2 combining the finite element method with intelligent optimization algorithm and model update the multi objective optimization mathematical model was constructed moreover the optimal design of the lashing bridge and container distortion similar model was achieved these can significantly improve the design efficiency and accuracy this method has certain versatility and can be applied to other structures 3 the effects of various control parameters on the dynamic response of the lashing bridge were studied under the high stack large dip and high frequency pitching the correlation of dynamic characteristics depends on many factors such as the amplitude frequency lashing rod stiffness container load and the size of the twist lock gap it solves the problem of how simple changes in basic variables affect the force and dynamic response of the lashing bridge it also provides useful advice to the industry and minimizes the complexity of the problem 4 the coupling effect produced by the transverse bulkhead renders the lower longitudinal stiffness of the lashing bridge structure based on previous experience the lashing bridge structure showed a high vibration response in the longitudinal direction under full load and ballast conditions the experimental results indicate that the top end of the column support has a large deformation response the bottom end of the column support and brackets exhibit a large strain sufficient evidence in this study can support that the dynamic response of the system is linear under small loads while for large loads the system becomes unstable and non linear therefore the shape of the column support and bracket needs to be optimized to improve the service life of the lashing bridge an important objective of the study is to assess the sufficiency of the experimental design method in providing basic mechanical behavior for the lashing bridge structure considering the coupling effects and dynamic effects of the lashing bridge and hull this may be the first step of a more reliable method to determine the reliability degree of the lashing system in operation credit authorship

21992,most marine structures are commonly subjected to two various random loads two dynamic responses are generally performed in two different domains time domain or frequency domain separately the induced stress responses may be a combination of two stress time series or a combination of a stress time series and a stress spectrum or a combination of two stress spectra fatigue damage can be predicted through different methods non linear time domain method is accurate but time consuming the classical frequency domain method is convenient only for the third combination case but is limited for the first two combination case since some spectral parameters are not easily available this paper proposes an equivalent pseudo spectral method to evaluate fatigue damage under the first two combination case the new method is proven to be an efficient alternative approach that avoids the cumbersome procedure of simulation and cycle counting the reliability of the new method is first demonstrated by a sensitivity study that the effect of spectral shape on fatigue damage and bandwidth parameter then accuracy of the new method is second verified by comparing fatigue damages from various models with rainflow fatigue damages which is obtained from equivalent triangular bimodal stress spectra keywords fatigue damage two random loads pseudo spectrum triangular bimodal spectrum 1 introduction steel structures in ship and ocean engineering field are commonly subjected to two random fatigue loads karimirad and moan 2011 one example is the low frequency load and wave frequency load in mooring and riser systems low 2008 low 2011 api 2005 iso 2005 wang and ji 2017 another example is aerodynamic load and wave load in offshore wind turbine kuhn 2003 temple 2006 yeter et al 2016 considering some restrictive conditions two dynamic responses are performed in two different domains time domain or frequency domain separately the induced stress responses may be a combination of two stress time series or a combination of a stress time series and a stress spectrum or a combination of two stress spectra after establishing two different responses the question arises how to combine the results of separate fatigue analyses the third combination case can be dealt with the classical frequency method thus this paper focuses on solving the first two combination case different techniques for combining the results of two separate fatigue damages have been addressed by many researchers the first option is combination of fatigue damages from two separate responses kuhn 2003 after obtaining the individual fatigue damage the total fatigue damage can be computed through some combination of fatigue damage method including simple summation method dnv rp f204 2010 b dnv method lotsberg 2005 dnv rp c203 2012 huang moan method huang and moan 2006 and han ma method han and ma 2016 the second option is to extract the spectral parameters such as individual zero order spectral moment and the average zero up crossing rate ma and han 2018 after that some available methods such as jiao moan method jiao and moan 1990 fu cebon method fu and cebon 2000 low s bimodal method low 2010 and low 2014 method low 2014 can be used to estimate fatigue damage since these methods only need the individual zero order spectral moment and the mean zero up crossing frequency as input however these methods are based on the assumption that two gaussian processes are narrow banded while two time domain stress processes may be non narrowband a further study should be carried out the third option is to transform the individual stress time domain process into a stress power spectral density function with fast fourier transformation fft technique the combine spectrum can be summed with the individual stress pdf then some general wideband spectral methods such as wirsching light method wirsching and light 1980 ortiz chen method ortiz and chen 1987 lutes larsen method lutes and larsen 1990 benasciutti tovo method benasciutti and tovo 2005 zhao baker method zhao and baker 1992 dirlik method dirlik 1985 and park method park and choung 2014 can be adopted to predict fatigue damage in these methods benasciutti tovo method dirlik method and park method have been proven to give quite accurate fatigue damage estimation ma and han 2018 the solution is convenient for predicting fatigue damage however for obtaining an accurate spectrum which matches with a time series the researchers need to constantly adjust parameters to meet with the requirement of fft technique which is obviously too complex for engineering practice this paper aims at developing an equivalent pseudo spectrum method for evaluation of fatigue damage under a combination of two stress time series or a combination of a stress time series and a stress spectrum the proposed method does not need to use fft technique and can achieve fatigue damage prediction only based on knowledge of a few characteristic parameters the reliability of the new method is validated by investigating the effect of geometric shapes of the equivalent pseudo spectrum on fatigue damage numerical simulations based on separated and overlapped pseudo spectrum are carried out to predict fatigue damage it is validated that the proposed method performs very well compared with rainflow counting fatigue damage astm 2005 2 background of spectral method assuming g ω represents the power spectral density function of s stationary random process x t a general family of spectral moments can be defined as 1 λ i 0 ω i g ω d ω where subscript i can usually take an integral value such as i 0 1 2 4 which corresponds to the i th order spectral moment in the time domain λ 0 λ 2 and λ 4 have the specific physical meaning λ 0 represents the variance of random process x t λ 2 represents the variance of random process x t which is the first derivative of x t λ 4 represents the variance of random process x t which is the second derivative of x t as can be seen from the above λ 0 λ 2 and λ 4 can be obtained from the stress time series or the stress power spectral density function however λ 1 has no the specific physical meaning and can hardly be gained from finite stress time series it can only be obtained from the stress power spectral density function two most commonly used bandwidth parameters is given as 2 α 1 λ 1 λ 0 λ 2 α 2 λ 2 λ 0 λ 4 α 1 and α 2 are also known as whirching bandwidth parameter wirsching and light 1980 and vanmarcke parameter vanmarcke 1972 another expression of bandwidth parameters corresponding to α 1 and α 2 3 e 1 1 α 1 2 e 2 1 α 2 2 the rate of mean zero up crossing corresponding to x t is 4 ν 0 1 2 π λ 2 λ 0 the rate of mean peak of y t can be expressed as 5 ν p 1 2 π λ 4 λ 2 fatigue damage is usually calculated based on s n curve which reflects the material resistance to fatigue failure the curve equation is 6 n k s m where s denotes the stress level k is the fatigue strength coefficient m is the fatigue strength exponent for general wide band stress process fatigue damage can be calculated by multiplying a narrowband approximation result by a bandwidth correction as 7 d w b ρ d n b ρ is a damage or bandwidth correction factor it is reported that ρ falls in the range of 0 1 rychlik 1993 which can be obtained based on the dirlik model and benasciutti tovo model applying the rayleigh approximation bendat 1964 and the palmgren miner hypothesis miner 1945 fatigue damage of a narrowband approximation can be given as 8 d n b ν 0 t k 2 λ 0 m γ m 2 1 3 proposed method an equivalent pseudo spectrum eps method 3 1 theoretical basis of the proposed method spectral methods are very attractive for many practical situations including offshore structures the new method is proposed based on spectral methods and such methods for predicting damage don t have the necessity of any time history based only on knowledge of a few parameters herein two common spectral methods are called dirlik dk method and benasciutti tovo bt method which have been proved to give currently the best stress pdf and be the best frequency domain approach for broad banded processes a subsequent section discusses these two methods including calculation of a bandwidth correction that is generally applied 1 a damage correction factor based on dirlik model a damage correction factor based on dirlik model can be defined as follow 9 ρ d k 1 α 2 γ m 1 2 m γ 1 m 2 g 1 q m g 2 r m g 3 in which 10 x m α 1 α 2 q 1 25 α 2 g 3 g 2 r g 1 γ α 2 x m g 1 2 1 α 2 g 1 g 1 2 11 g 1 2 x m α 2 2 1 α 2 2 g 2 1 α 2 g 1 g 1 2 1 r g 3 1 g 1 g 2 2 a damage correction factor based on bt model a damage correction factor based on bt model can be given as follow 12 ρ b t b 1 b α 2 m 1 in which 13 b α 1 α 2 1 112 1 α 1 α 2 α 1 α 2 exp 2 11 α 2 α 1 α 2 α 2 1 2 according to eq 9 and eq 12 we can conclude that there is a strong correlation between damage correction factor and spectral bandwidth parameters α 1 α 2 it has been proven that dk model and bt model can give accurate fatigue damage estimations thus it can be inferred that accurate fatigue damage can be obtained for combination of a time domain stress response and a frequency domain stress response or combination of a time domain stress response and a time domain stress response as long as the spectral parameter α 1 and α 2 of the combined process can be given in addition some other investigations also show that precious fatigue damage predictions can be still obtained although the shape of stress psd is not in accordance with rainflow stress range distribution sarkani 1990 wang and chen 2016 two typical examples can be shown in fig 1 it is presented that park pdf and dirlik pdf appear not to be a perfect match with rainflow stress range distribution however these two models still give accurate fatigue damage estimations from the above study we can conclude that fatigue damage under two random loads can be evaluated well based only on knowledge of a few characteristic parameters α 1 and α 2 this significant research result is the theoretical basis of the proposed equivalent pseudo spectral method the development of the new proposed method will be detailed in the next section 3 2 development of equivalent pseudo spectrum method 3 2 1 the proposed of equivalent pseudo spectrum method in real engineering practice the separated analysis under two gaussian random loading is generally carried out two typical examples are as follow 1 the separation of the low frequency response and the wave frequency response in the dynamic analysis design of riser systems 2 the separation of the wind response and the wave response in the dynamic analysis design of offshore wind turbine for short term fatigue damage calculation of riser systems dnv os f201 2010 a gives a recommended procedure as in table 1 where fd frequency domain analysis td time domain analysis nb narrowband approximation rfc rainflow cycle counting from table 1 we can see that the fatigue damage will generally have contributions from wave frequency wf as well as low frequency lf stress cycles the wf floater motions as well as direct wave loading on the riser govern wf fatigue damage while the lf floater motions govern lf fatigue damage in addition different combined analysis methods can be observed in summarization methods for separation of two random processes can be split up into three cases 1 a combination of two stress time series as seen in fig 2 it should be noted that s 1 t is a stress time series which is obtained in the time domain under the lf floater motions or wind loading g 1 t is a stress spectrum based on a spectral analysis method under the lf floater motions or wind loading s 2 t is a stress time series which is obtained in the time domain under wave loading g 2 t is a stress spectrum based on a spectral analysis method under wave loading some common spectral parameters λ 0 ν 0 and ν p can be always extracted conveniently no matter a random stress process is a stress time series or a stress response spectrum for a stress time history as shown in fig 5 the above spectral parameters can be obtained with wafo toolbox wafo 2011 or self compiled program λ 0 the zero order spectral moment it denotes the variance of x t ν 0 the average zero up crossing rate it means the number of zero up crossing in the unit time t 0 the average zero up crossing period it means the average value of all zero up crossing periods in the time t ν p the average peak rate it means the number of peak in the unit time t p the average peak period it means the average value of all peak periods in the time t another expression form of bandwidth parameter α 2 can be the ratio between the average peak period and the average zero up crossing period as follow 14 α 2 t p t 0 for a stress response spectrum the above spectral parameters can also be approximated from the integration of the estimated stress response spectrum according to eq 1 eq 5 in order to establish relationship between two random stress responses some new variables are defined as follow 15 b λ 0 2 λ 0 1 r ν 0 2 ν 0 1

process can be seen as table 2 y represents that the parameter in table 1 can be acquired n denotes that the parameter in table 2 cannot be obtained directly for case 3 all the spectral parameters can be calculated then dk method and bt method can be used for predicting fatigue damage for case 1 and 2 α 2 c can be obtained according to eq 19 however α 1 c cannot be calculated from a stress time series since the first spectral moment associated with α 1 c can hardly be gained from finite stress time series therefore how to calculate α 1 c becomes a key issue for evaluating fatigue damage under two random stress processes in order to solve the above problem an equivalent spectral method is proposed i e two independent stress processes can be transformed into two simplified stress psds with the eps method respectively then the combined stress spectrum can be summed with two simplified psds in this paper two triangular bimodal spectra are adopted fatigue damage can be calculated through two frequency domain methods bt method and dk method 3 2 2 basic principle and detailed process of executing eps method the procedure for performing the eps method should meet the requirements that some spectral parameters i e b r α 2 1 α 2 2 and α 2 c extracted from real combined stress process should be as possible as equal to the parameters obtained from equivalent pseudo spectrum in real engineering practice the frequency of two random stress processes may be either separated or overlapped thus two random stress processes can be equivalent to a separated triangular equivalent pseudo spectrum and an overlapped triangular equivalent pseudo spectrum as shown in fig 6 fig 7 for a separated triangular equivalent pseudo spectrum two dimensionless parameters are defined as follow

spectrum 1 and spectrum 2 respectively and are equal to the zero order moment herein assuming that a 1 a 2 1 overlapped triangular bimodal spectra can be produced by adjusting the variable r of separated triangular bimodal spectra to ensure that spectrum 1 and spectrum 2 are overlapped a limited condition should be met 27 1 r c 1 1 c 2 1 c 1 the schematic view of an overlapped triangular

c from the equivalent triangular pseudo spectrum however whether α 1 c is equal to α 1 c should be validated with a further study detailed derivation of eq 28 and 29 can be seen in appendix a it can be seen that α 2 c is a function of b r α 2 1 and α 2 2 thus an assumption can be made that α 1 c may also be calculated only using b r α 2 1 and α 2 2 31 α 1 c f b r α 2 1 α 2 2 if this assumption is valid it can be infer that α 1 c is equal to α 1 c in the following section the reliability of the eps method will be validated with a further investigation the detailed process of the executing eps method can be seen in fig 8 the proposed eps method can start from step 1 to step 5 as follow step 1 firstly extracting six parameters λ 0 1 ν 0 1 ν p 1 λ 0 2 ν 0 2 ν p 2 from two independent stress responses then calculating narrowband assumption fatigue damage according to eq 8 step 2 introducing new variables b r α 2 1 α 2 2 α 2 c according to the known six parameters step 1 step 3 transforming two real stress responses into a triangular bimodal spectrum deriving c 1 and c 2 by eq 25 and eq 26 computing another key bandwidth parameter α 1 c according to eq 28 step 4 calculating the bandwidth correction factor based on dirlik model or bt model step 5 calculating fatigue damage by multiplying a narrowband approximation result step 1 by a bandwidth correction factor step 4 4 reliability demonstration of the equivalent pseudo spectrum method in order to validate the feasibility of the proposed eps method a sensitivity analysis should be performed to investigate the influence of the geometric shape of pseudo spectra on the bandwidth parameter and fatigue damage in a considered bandwidth the real stress spectrum may be produced from arbitrary combination of stress spectra with simple shapes in this paper 10 types of typical unimodal spectra as shown in fig 9 are chosen for reliability analysis of the proposed eps method the curve equation of fig 9 b is given in

idft technique han and ma 2016 are used to carry out the research considering the influence of bandwidth simulations are divided into 16 groups which are different combinations of bandwidth as shown in table 1 all bimodal spectra in every group have the same parameters b and r α 2 1 and α 2 2 for simplicity the total spectral moment of each bimodal spectrum is set to a constant ω a is taken as to be 5 rad s 4 1 sensitivity analysis of bandwidth parameter for different spectral combination in order to carry out the sensitivity analysis of bandwidth parameter some parameters are set as the main variables α 2 1 is the bandwidth parameter of unimodal spectrum 1 α 2 2 is the bandwidth parameter of unimodal spectrum 2 α 1 c α 2 c is the bandwidth parameter of equivalent bimodal spectrum e α 1 c is the expected value of bandwidth parameter α 1 c for every combination case which can be calculated as 33 e α 1 c i 1 n α 1 c i n the value of n depends on the combination case for case 1 n 100 for case 2 n 90 which is seen in table 2 d α 1 c is the variance of bandwidth parameter α 1 c for every combination case which can be computed as 34 d α 1 c i 1 n α 1 c i e α 1 c 2 n α 1 c is the bandwidth parameter of the equivalent triangular bimodal pseudo spectrum e r r o r α 1 c is the error of bandwidth parameter from the equivalent triangular bimodal pseudo spectrum as defined as 35 e r r o r α 1 c α 1 c e α 1 c e α 1 c 100 the results are shown in table 3 for all the combination cases studied in this paper d α 1 c is very small it shows that all the bandwidth parameters of different combined bimodal spectra are consistent and stable the errors induced by the equivalent triangular bimodal spectrum are also quite small with a maximum error never exceeds 2 on the basis of the above research a helpful conclusion can be drawn i e the bandwidth parameter α 1 c is insensitive to the geometric shapes of stress psd which reflects the reliability of the proposed eps method from an aspect a more comprehensive justification needs to be conducted by assessing the error of fatigue damage produced from the eps method 4 2 reliability analysis of fatigue damage for different spectral combination in this section the effect of the geometric shapes of stress psd on fatigue damage is investigated the bandwidth correction factor based on dirlik model as in eq 9 will be used to compare the fatigue damage from different combined spectra ρ is the damage correction factor of equivalent bimodal spectrum e ρ is the expected value of damage correction factor ρ for every combination case which can be calculated as 36 e ρ i 1 n ρ i n d ρ is the variance of damage correction factor ρ for every combination case which can be computed as 37 d ρ i 1 n ρ i e ρ 2 n ρ is the damage correction factor ρ of the equivalent triangular bimodal pseudo spectrum e r r o r ρ is the error of damage correction factor ρ from the equivalent triangular bimodal pseudo spectrum as defined as 38 e r r o r ρ ρ e ρ e ρ 100 the results are plotted in table 4 for all the combination cases studied in this paper as shown in table 3 good agreement between the triangular bimodal spectrum and other combined bimodal spectra can be observed the maximum variance is about 0 011 and the maximum error is 4 045 for m 3 corresponding to case 16 in general fatigue damage is insensitive to the geometric shapes of stress psd thus it is reasonable to carry out numerical simulations by adopting rectangular bimodal spectra in addition for a unimodal process sarkani has proven that the detailed shape of the simplified psd has minimal influence on the fatigue damage sarkani 1990 for a broad frequency band wang and chen validated that the simplification by replacing a real complex stress process with a constant stress psd does not introduce a large error wang and chen 2016 5 fatigue analysis based on the equivalent pseudo spectrum method in this section the accuracy of the equivalent pseudo spectrum method will be further validated based on dirlik model and bt model a separated triangular bimodal spectrum and an overlapped triangular bimodal spectrum will be constructed to perform numerical simulations 5 1 results of fatigue analysis based on separated triangular bimodal spectra the parameters of separated triangular bimodal spectra are shown in table 5 b is set from 0 01 0 1 0 2 to 10 including 20 values r varies with an increment of 1 the results of numerical simulations can be seen in figs 11 14 the abscissa is damage correction factor ρ r f c based on rainflow counting the ordinate represents damage correction factor ρ s p e c t r a calculated by the eps method as can be seen from figs 11 14 in four combination cases for m 3 bt model based on the eps method gives the most accurate fatigue damage predictions with a maximum error of 5 dk model based on the eps method underestimates fatigue damage with a maximum of 12 for m 5 the errors from all the proposed methods are bigger than that for m 3 but fatigue results are acceptable and the maximum error is approximately 20 5 2 results of fatigue analysis in overlapped rectangular bimodal spectra the parameters of overlapped rectangular bimodal spectra are shown in table 6 b is set from 0 01 0 1 0 2 to 10 including 20 values for combination 1 r varies from 5 to 7 2 with an increment of 0 2 for combination 2 r varies from 1 2 to 2 4 with an increment of 0 2 for combination 3 r varies from 1 4 to 2 with an increment of 0 1 for combination 4 r varies from 2 to 9 with an increment of 1 the results of fatigue analysis based on the eps method for overlapped triangular bimodal spectra can be seen in figs 15 18 for m 3 bt method and dk method give accurate fatigue damage evaluation with a maximum of about 10 for m 5 the error is bigger but the maximum error only reaches about 20 in a word the eps method proposed in this paper may produce some errors these errors are produced because of two factors one is that replacing real stress process into the simplified pseudo spectrum will introduce some errors but the maximum error never exceeds 5 another factor is that that bt model and dirlik model can produce some errors overall the eps method can give acceptable fatigue damage predictions above all the proposed method is very convenient and practical in engineering application if these methods are adopted the maximum error of fatigue damage reaches about 20 6 conclusion this paper studied fatigue assessment method under two random processes and proposed an equivalent pseudo spectrum method for predicting fatigue damage some conclusions are obtained 1 the bandwidth parameters are insensitive to the geometric shapes of stress psds 2 fatigue damage is insensitive to the geometric shapes of stress psds 3 the developed equivalent pseudo spectrum method is proved to be reliable with theoretical and numerical means credit authorship contribution statement chaoshuai han formal analysis

21992,most marine structures are commonly subjected to two various random loads two dynamic responses are generally performed in two different domains time domain or frequency domain separately the induced stress responses may be a combination of two stress time series or a combination of a stress time series and a stress spectrum or a combination of two stress spectra fatigue damage can be predicted through different methods non linear time domain method is accurate but time consuming the classical frequency domain method is convenient only for the third combination case but is limited for the first two combination case since some spectral parameters are not easily available this paper proposes an equivalent pseudo spectral method to evaluate fatigue damage under the first two combination case the new method is proven to be an efficient alternative approach that avoids the cumbersome procedure of simulation and cycle counting the reliability of the new method is first demonstrated by a sensitivity study that the effect of spectral shape on fatigue damage and bandwidth parameter then accuracy of the new method is second verified by comparing fatigue damages from various models with rainflow fatigue damages which is obtained from equivalent triangular bimodal stress spectra keywords fatigue damage two random loads pseudo spectrum triangular bimodal spectrum 1 introduction steel structures in ship and ocean engineering field are commonly subjected to two random fatigue loads karimirad and moan 2011 one example is the low frequency load and wave frequency load in mooring and riser systems low 2008 low 2011 api 2005 iso 2005 wang and ji 2017 another example is aerodynamic load and wave load in offshore wind turbine kuhn 2003 temple 2006 yeter et al 2016 considering some restrictive conditions two dynamic responses are performed in two different domains time domain or frequency domain separately the induced stress responses may be a combination of two stress time series or a combination of a stress time series and a stress spectrum or a combination of two stress spectra after establishing two different responses the question arises how to combine the results of separate fatigue analyses the third combination case can be dealt with the classical frequency method thus this paper focuses on solving the first two combination case different techniques for combining the results of two separate fatigue damages have been addressed by many researchers the first option is combination of fatigue damages from two separate responses kuhn 2003 after obtaining the individual fatigue damage the total fatigue damage can be computed through some combination of fatigue damage method including simple summation method dnv rp f204 2010 b dnv method lotsberg 2005 dnv rp c203 2012 huang moan method huang and moan 2006 and han ma method han and ma 2016 the second option is to extract the spectral parameters such as individual zero order spectral moment and the average zero up crossing rate ma and han 2018 after that some available methods such as jiao moan method jiao and moan 1990 fu cebon method fu and cebon 2000 low s bimodal method low 2010 and low 2014 method low 2014 can be used to estimate fatigue damage since these methods only need the individual zero order spectral moment and the mean zero up crossing frequency as input however these methods are based on the assumption that two gaussian processes are narrow banded while two time domain stress processes may be non narrowband a further study should be carried out the third option is to transform the individual stress time domain process into a stress power spectral density function with fast fourier transformation fft technique the combine spectrum can be summed with the individual stress pdf then some general wideband spectral methods such as wirsching light method wirsching and light 1980 ortiz chen method ortiz and chen 1987 lutes larsen method lutes and larsen 1990 benasciutti tovo method benasciutti and tovo 2005 zhao baker method zhao and baker 1992 dirlik method dirlik 1985 and park method park and choung 2014 can be adopted to predict fatigue damage in these methods benasciutti tovo method dirlik method and park method have been proven to give quite accurate fatigue damage estimation ma and han 2018 the solution is convenient for predicting fatigue damage however for obtaining an accurate spectrum which matches with a time series the researchers need to constantly adjust parameters to meet with the requirement of fft technique which is obviously too complex for engineering practice this paper aims at developing an equivalent pseudo spectrum method for evaluation of fatigue damage under a combination of two stress time series or a combination of a stress time series and a stress spectrum the proposed method does not need to use fft technique and can achieve fatigue damage prediction only based on knowledge of a few characteristic parameters the reliability of the new method is validated by investigating the effect of geometric shapes of the equivalent pseudo spectrum on fatigue damage numerical simulations based on separated and overlapped pseudo spectrum are carried out to predict fatigue damage it is validated that the proposed method performs very well compared with rainflow counting fatigue damage astm 2005 2 background of spectral method assuming g ω represents the power spectral density function of s stationary random process x t a general family of spectral moments can be defined as 1 λ i 0 ω i g ω d ω where subscript i can usually take an integral value such as i 0 1 2 4 which corresponds to the i th order spectral moment in the time domain λ 0 λ 2 and λ 4 have the specific physical meaning λ 0 represents the variance of random process x t λ 2 represents the variance of random process x t which is the first derivative of x t λ 4 represents the variance of random process x t which is the second derivative of x t as can be seen from the above λ 0 λ 2 and λ 4 can be obtained from the stress time series or the stress power spectral density function however λ 1 has no the specific physical meaning and can hardly be gained from finite stress time series it can only be obtained from the stress power spectral density function two most commonly used bandwidth parameters is given as 2 α 1 λ 1 λ 0 λ 2 α 2 λ 2 λ 0 λ 4 α 1 and α 2 are also known as whirching bandwidth parameter wirsching and light 1980 and vanmarcke parameter vanmarcke 1972 another expression of bandwidth parameters corresponding to α 1 and α 2 3 e 1 1 α 1 2 e 2 1 α 2 2 the rate of mean zero up crossing corresponding to x t is 4 ν 0 1 2 π λ 2 λ 0 the rate of mean peak of y t can be expressed as 5 ν p 1 2 π λ 4 λ 2 fatigue damage is usually calculated based on s n curve which reflects the material resistance to fatigue failure the curve equation is 6 n k s m where s denotes the stress level k is the fatigue strength coefficient m is the fatigue strength exponent for general wide band stress process fatigue damage can be calculated by multiplying a narrowband approximation result by a bandwidth correction as 7 d w b ρ d n b ρ is a damage or bandwidth correction factor it is reported that ρ falls in the range of 0 1 rychlik 1993 which can be obtained based on the dirlik model and benasciutti tovo model applying the rayleigh approximation bendat 1964 and the palmgren miner hypothesis miner 1945 fatigue damage of a narrowband approximation can be given as 8 d n b ν 0 t k 2 λ 0 m γ m 2 1 3 proposed method an equivalent pseudo spectrum eps method 3 1 theoretical basis of the proposed method spectral methods are very attractive for many practical situations including offshore structures the new method is proposed based on spectral methods and such methods for predicting damage don t have the necessity of any time history based only on knowledge of a few parameters herein two common spectral methods are called dirlik dk method and benasciutti tovo bt method which have been proved to give currently the best stress pdf and be the best frequency domain approach for broad banded processes a subsequent section discusses these two methods including calculation of a bandwidth correction that is generally applied 1 a damage correction factor based on dirlik model a damage correction factor based on dirlik model can be defined as follow 9 ρ d k 1 α 2 γ m 1 2 m γ 1 m 2 g 1 q m g 2 r m g 3 in which 10 x m α 1 α 2 q 1 25 α 2 g 3 g 2 r g 1 γ α 2 x m g 1 2 1 α 2 g 1 g 1 2 11 g 1 2 x m α 2 2 1 α 2 2 g 2 1 α 2 g 1 g 1 2 1 r g 3 1 g 1 g 2 2 a damage correction factor based on bt model a damage correction factor based on bt model can be given as follow 12 ρ b t b 1 b α 2 m 1 in which 13 b α 1 α 2 1 112 1 α 1 α 2 α 1 α 2 exp 2 11 α 2 α 1 α 2 α 2 1 2 according to eq 9 and eq 12 we can conclude that there is a strong correlation between damage correction factor and spectral bandwidth parameters α 1 α 2 it has been proven that dk model and bt model can give accurate fatigue damage estimations thus it can be inferred that accurate fatigue damage can be obtained for combination of a time domain stress response and a frequency domain stress response or combination of a time domain stress response and a time domain stress response as long as the spectral parameter α 1 and α 2 of the combined process can be given in addition some other investigations also show that precious fatigue damage predictions can be still obtained although the shape of stress psd is not in accordance with rainflow stress range distribution sarkani 1990 wang and chen 2016 two typical examples can be shown in fig 1 it is presented that park pdf and dirlik pdf appear not to be a perfect match with rainflow stress range distribution however these two models still give accurate fatigue damage estimations from the above study we can conclude that fatigue damage under two random loads can be evaluated well based only on knowledge of a few characteristic parameters α 1 and α 2 this significant research result is the theoretical basis of the proposed equivalent pseudo spectral method the development of the new proposed method will be detailed in the next section 3 2 development of equivalent pseudo spectrum method 3 2 1 the proposed of equivalent pseudo spectrum method in real engineering practice the separated analysis under two gaussian random loading is generally carried out two typical examples are as follow 1 the separation of the low frequency response and the wave frequency response in the dynamic analysis design of riser systems 2 the separation of the wind response and the wave response in the dynamic analysis design of offshore wind turbine for short term fatigue damage calculation of riser systems dnv os f201 2010 a gives a recommended procedure as in table 1 where fd frequency domain analysis td time domain analysis nb narrowband approximation rfc rainflow cycle counting from table 1 we can see that the fatigue damage will generally have contributions from wave frequency wf as well as low frequency lf stress cycles the wf floater motions as well as direct wave loading on the riser govern wf fatigue damage while the lf floater motions govern lf fatigue damage in addition different combined analysis methods can be observed in summarization methods for separation of two random processes can be split up into three cases 1 a combination of two stress time series as seen in fig 2 it should be noted that s 1 t is a stress time series which is obtained in the time domain under the lf floater motions or wind loading g 1 t is a stress spectrum based on a spectral analysis method under the lf floater motions or wind loading s 2 t is a stress time series which is obtained in the time domain under wave loading g 2 t is a stress spectrum based on a spectral analysis method under wave loading some common spectral parameters λ 0 ν 0 and ν p can be always extracted conveniently no matter a random stress process is a stress time series or a stress response spectrum for a stress time history as shown in fig 5 the above spectral parameters can be obtained with wafo toolbox wafo 2011 or self compiled program λ 0 the zero order spectral moment it denotes the variance of x t ν 0 the average zero up crossing rate it means the number of zero up crossing in the unit time t 0 the average zero up crossing period it means the average value of all zero up crossing periods in the time t ν p the average peak rate it means the number of peak in the unit time t p the average peak period it means the average value of all peak periods in the time t another expression form of bandwidth parameter α 2 can be the ratio between the average peak period and the average zero up crossing period as follow 14 α 2 t p t 0 for a stress response spectrum the above spectral parameters can also be approximated from the integration of the estimated stress response spectrum according to eq 1 eq 5 in order to establish relationship between two random stress responses some new variables are defined as follow 15 b λ 0 2 λ 0 1 r ν 0 2 ν 0 1 r ν p 2 ν p 1 the bandwidth parameters associated with two processes can be expressed as a ratio between the mean zero up crossing frequency and the peak frequency 16 α 2 1 λ 2 1 λ 0 1 λ 4 1 ν 0 1 ν p 1 α 2 2 λ 2 2 λ 0 2 λ 4 2 ν 0 2 ν p 2 the relationship of spectral moments between two dynamic stress processes is as follow 17 α 2 2 α 2 1 r r 1 b λ 2 2 λ 2 1 λ 4 1 λ 4 2 spectral parameters of the combined process can be derived as 18 λ 0 c λ 0 1 λ 0 2 λ 0 1 1 b 19 α 2 c λ 2 c λ 0 c λ 4 c α 2 1 1 b r 2 1 b 1 b r 2 r 2 20 ν 0 c 1 2 π λ 2 c λ 0 c ν 0 1 1 b r 2 1 b 21 ν 0 p 1 2 π λ 4 c λ 2 c ν p 1 1 b r 2 r 2 1 b r 2 subscript c represents the combined process detailed derivation of α 2 c can be seen in appendix b according to the above derivation spectral parameters of the combined stress process can be seen as table 2 y represents that the parameter in table 1 can be acquired n denotes that the parameter in table 2 cannot be obtained directly for case 3 all the spectral parameters can be calculated then dk method and bt method can be used for predicting fatigue damage for case 1 and 2 α 2 c can be obtained according to eq 19 however α 1 c cannot be calculated from a stress time series since the first spectral moment associated with α 1 c can hardly be gained from finite stress time series therefore how to calculate α 1 c becomes a key issue for evaluating fatigue damage under two random stress processes in order to solve the above problem an equivalent spectral method is proposed i e two independent stress processes can be transformed into two simplified stress psds with the eps method respectively then the combined stress spectrum can be summed with two simplified psds in this paper two triangular bimodal spectra are adopted fatigue damage can be calculated through two frequency domain methods bt method and dk method 3 2 2 basic principle and detailed process of executing eps method the procedure for performing the eps method should meet the requirements that some spectral parameters i e b r α 2 1 α 2 2 and α 2 c extracted from real combined stress process should be as possible as equal to the parameters obtained from equivalent pseudo spectrum in real engineering practice the frequency of two random stress processes may be either separated or overlapped thus two random stress processes can be equivalent to a separated triangular equivalent pseudo spectrum and an overlapped triangular equivalent pseudo spectrum as shown in fig 6 fig 7 for a separated triangular equivalent pseudo spectrum two dimensionless parameters are defined as follow

superscript indicates the parameters obtained from constructed triangular pseudo spectrum detailed derivation of eq 25 and 26 can be seen in appendix a where a 1 and a 2 represent the areas of spectrum 1 and spectrum 2 respectively and are equal to the zero order moment herein assuming that a 1 a 2 1 overlapped triangular bimodal spectra can be produced by adjusting the variable r of separated triangular bimodal spectra to ensure that spectrum 1 and spectrum 2 are overlapped a limited condition should be met 27 1 r c 1 1 c 2 1 c 1 the schematic view of an overlapped triangular bimodal spectrum is shown in fig 7 all variables of an overlapped triangular bimodal spectrum are defined as eqs 22 24 for two real stress processes b r α 2 1 and α 2 2 can be given as eq 15 and 16 a unique pseudo spectrum can be determined subsequently the total bandwidth parameter α 1 c and α 2 c can be calculated conveniently as eq 28 and eq 29 28 α 1 c α 1 1 1 b r 1 b 1 b r 2 1 c 1 2 1 c 2 2 7

c from the equivalent triangular pseudo spectrum however whether α 1 c is equal to α 1 c should be validated with a further study detailed derivation of eq 28 and 29 can be seen in appendix a it can be seen that α 2 c is a function of b r α 2 1 and α 2 2 thus an assumption can be made that α 1 c may also be calculated only using b r α 2 1 and α 2 2 31 α 1 c f b r α 2 1 α 2 2 if this assumption is valid it can be infer that α 1 c is equal to α 1 c in the following section the reliability of the eps method will be validated with a further investigation the detailed process of the executing eps method can be seen in fig 8 the proposed eps method can start from step 1 to step 5 as follow step 1 firstly extracting six parameters λ 0 1 ν 0 1 ν p 1 λ 0 2 ν 0 2 ν p 2 from two independent stress responses then calculating narrowband assumption fatigue damage according to eq 8 step 2 introducing new variables b r α 2 1 α 2 2 α 2 c according to the known six parameters step 1 step 3 transforming two real stress responses into a triangular bimodal spectrum deriving c 1 and c 2 by eq 25 and eq 26 computing another key bandwidth parameter α 1 c according to eq 28 step 4 calculating the bandwidth correction factor based on dirlik model or bt model step 5 calculating fatigue damage by multiplying a narrowband approximation result step 1 by a bandwidth correction factor step 4 4 reliability demonstration of the equivalent pseudo spectrum method in order to validate the feasibility of the proposed eps method a sensitivity analysis should be performed to investigate the influence of the geometric shape of pseudo spectra on the bandwidth parameter and fatigue damage in a considered bandwidth the real stress spectrum may be produced from arbitrary combination of stress spectra with simple shapes in this paper 10 types of typical unimodal spectra as shown in fig 9 are chosen for reliability analysis of the proposed eps method the curve equation of fig 9 b is given in eq 32 the other curves have similar expressions which are not listed for brevity 32 s ω s 0 ω a ω b 2 ω a ω ω a ω a ω ω a ω b 2 s 0 ω a ω b 2 ω b ω ω b ω a ω b 2 ω ω b fig 10 shows the bandwidth of unimodal psd in fig 9 a j varies with parameter c with an increase of c the bandwidth becomes broader and reaches an upper bound numerical simulations based on the inverse discrete fourier transform idft technique han and ma 2016 are used to carry out the research considering the influence of bandwidth simulations are divided into 16 groups which are different combinations of bandwidth as shown in table 1 all bimodal spectra in every group have the same parameters b and r α 2 1 and α 2 2 for simplicity the total spectral moment of each bimodal spectrum is set to a constant ω a is taken as to be 5 rad s 4 1 sensitivity analysis of bandwidth parameter for different spectral combination in order to carry out the sensitivity analysis of bandwidth parameter some parameters are set as the main variables α 2 1 is the bandwidth parameter of unimodal spectrum 1 α 2 2 is the bandwidth parameter of unimodal spectrum 2 α 1 c α 2 c is the bandwidth parameter of equivalent bimodal spectrum e α 1 c is the expected value of bandwidth parameter α 1 c for every combination case which can be calculated as 33 e α 1 c i 1 n α 1 c i n the value of n depends on the combination case for case 1 n 100 for case 2 n 90 which is seen in table 2 d α 1 c is the variance of bandwidth parameter α 1 c for every combination case which can be computed as 34 d α 1 c i 1 n α 1 c i e α 1 c 2 n α 1 c is the bandwidth parameter of the equivalent triangular bimodal pseudo spectrum e r r o r α 1 c is the error of bandwidth parameter from the equivalent triangular bimodal pseudo spectrum as defined as 35 e r r o r α 1 c α 1 c e α 1 c e α 1 c 100 the results are shown in table 3 for all the combination cases studied in this paper d α 1 c is very small it shows that all the bandwidth parameters of different combined bimodal spectra are consistent and stable the errors induced by the equivalent triangular bimodal spectrum are also quite small with a maximum error never exceeds 2 on the basis of the above research a helpful conclusion can be drawn i e the bandwidth parameter α 1 c is insensitive to the geometric shapes of stress psd which reflects the reliability of the proposed eps method from an aspect a more comprehensive justification needs to be conducted by assessing the error of fatigue damage produced from the eps method 4 2 reliability analysis of fatigue damage for different spectral combination in this section the effect of the geometric shapes of stress psd on fatigue damage is investigated the bandwidth correction factor based on dirlik model as in eq 9 will be used to compare the fatigue damage from different combined spectra ρ is the damage correction factor of equivalent bimodal spectrum e ρ is the expected value of damage correction factor ρ for every combination case which can be calculated as 36 e ρ i 1 n ρ i n d ρ is the variance of damage correction factor ρ for every combination case which can be computed as 37 d ρ i 1 n ρ i e ρ 2 n ρ is the damage correction factor ρ of the equivalent triangular bimodal pseudo spectrum e r r o r ρ is the error of damage correction factor ρ from the equivalent triangular bimodal pseudo spectrum as defined as 38 e r r o r ρ ρ e ρ e ρ 100 the results are plotted in table 4 for all the combination cases studied in this paper as shown in table 3 good agreement between the triangular bimodal spectrum and other combined bimodal spectra can be observed the maximum variance is about 0 011 and the maximum error is 4 045 for m 3 corresponding to case 16 in general fatigue damage is insensitive to the geometric shapes of stress psd thus it is reasonable to carry out numerical simulations by adopting rectangular bimodal spectra in addition for a unimodal process sarkani has proven that the detailed shape of the simplified psd has minimal influence on the fatigue damage sarkani 1990 for a broad frequency band wang and chen validated that the simplification by replacing a real complex stress process with a constant stress psd does not introduce a large error wang and chen 2016 5 fatigue analysis based on the equivalent pseudo spectrum method in this section the accuracy of the equivalent pseudo spectrum method will be further validated based on dirlik model and bt model a separated triangular bimodal spectrum and an overlapped triangular bimodal spectrum will be constructed to perform numerical simulations 5 1 results of fatigue analysis based on separated triangular bimodal spectra the parameters of separated triangular bimodal spectra are shown in table 5 b is set from 0 01 0 1 0 2 to 10 including 20 values r varies with an increment of 1 the results of numerical simulations can be seen in figs 11 14 the abscissa is damage correction factor ρ r f c based on rainflow counting the ordinate represents damage correction factor ρ s p e c t r a calculated by the eps method as can be seen from figs 11 14 in four combination cases for m 3 bt model based on the eps method gives the most accurate fatigue damage predictions with a maximum error of 5 dk model based on the eps method underestimates fatigue damage with a maximum of 12 for m 5 the errors from all the proposed methods are bigger than that for m 3 but fatigue results are acceptable and the maximum error is approximately 20 5 2 results of fatigue analysis in overlapped rectangular bimodal spectra the parameters of overlapped rectangular bimodal spectra are shown in table 6 b is set from 0 01 0 1 0 2 to 10 including 20 values for combination 1 r varies from 5 to 7 2 with an increment of 0 2 for combination 2 r varies from 1 2 to 2 4 with an increment of 0 2 for combination 3 r varies from 1 4 to 2 with an increment of 0 1 for combination 4 r varies from 2 to 9 with an increment of 1 the results of fatigue analysis based on the eps method for overlapped triangular bimodal spectra can be seen in figs 15 18 for m 3 bt method and dk method give accurate fatigue damage evaluation with a maximum of about 10 for m 5 the error is bigger but the maximum error only reaches about 20 in a word the eps method proposed in this paper may produce some errors these errors are produced because of two factors one is that replacing real stress process into the simplified pseudo spectrum will introduce some errors but the maximum error never exceeds 5 another factor is that that bt model and dirlik model can produce some errors overall the eps method can give acceptable fatigue damage predictions above all the proposed method is very convenient and practical in engineering application if these methods are adopted the maximum error of fatigue damage reaches about 20 6 conclusion this paper studied fatigue assessment method under two random processes and proposed an equivalent pseudo spectrum method for predicting fatigue damage some conclusions are obtained 1 the bandwidth parameters are insensitive to the geometric shapes of stress psds 2 fatigue damage is insensitive to the geometric shapes of stress psds 3 the developed equivalent pseudo spectrum method is proved to be reliable with theoretical and numerical means credit authorship contribution statement chaoshuai han formal analysis

21993,this paper reports an investigation of a flow over and through offshore fish cages using computational fluid dynamics cfd as the cages are working in open seas exposed to bio fouling phenomena which can block the flow and possibly to violent current wave conditions it is therefore important to investigate the water exchange between the inside and the outside of the cages and the hydrodynamic load on them different scenarios involving either a single cage or multiple cages in a certain arrangement are analyzed in this work the cage is of a spherical type submersible and assumed to be working under the water surface totally submerged it is modeled as a hollow sphere with its wall being a thin porous layer representing the net and the mechanical frame the characteristic parameters of the porous medium are determined by fitting the numerical results with data available in the literature various flow characteristics are presented and discussed it is found that the bio fouling phenomena can drastically reduce the exchange of well oxygenated water and the staggered arrangement of four identical cages is superior than the square one keywords computational fluid dynamics cfd porous medium fish cage aquaculture 1 introduction seafood demand has been dramatically increased in the recent years leading to a development of an offshore aquaculture offshore aquaculture is known to possess various advantages over traditional inland one for example being away from contaminant sources providing a healthy environment for fish and in return less harmful to the aquatic ecosystem thanks to strong currents in open seas however in order for an offshore fish cage to operate properly under violent conditions such as strong currents high waves and storms its mechanical frame and mooring system must be able to sustain the hydrodynamic load additionally bio fouling phenomena occurring on the net and frame can also be a problem as they block the exchange of well oxygenated water between the inside and outside of the cage therefore it is indispensable to investigate in detail the flow over and through it and the load acting on it there have been a few studies on this topic using both experimental and numerical approaches in the last decade regarding the former approach zhan et al 2006 studied influences of the reynolds number re and the net solidity on the drag acting on the net the results indicated that the drag coefficient decreases with re and increases with the solidity huang et al 2007 investigated the current reduction by a square net cage and found that the velocity behind the cage reduces from 20 to 45 of the incoming velocity harendza et al 2008 measured the flow field around and inside a cylinder shaped fish cage using piv technique and investigated impacts of the cage inclination and porosity on the flow field in addition zhao et al 2015 measured mooring loads of a multi cage system in a laboratory scale the cages consisted of a floating collar a cylindrical net and sinkers attached to the net s bottom they were arranged in either single or double columns each consisting of up to four cages it was found that the tension in the upstream anchor lines was significantly greater than that in the side and downstream lines velocity magnitude at several points was measured using acoustic doppler velocimetry and a velocity reduction was found to be 11 13 inside and 32 in the downstream of a single cage with the use of the computational fluid dynamics cfd approach shim et al 2009 studied the flow through and around a circular cylinder cage in which a porous jump boundary condition was utilized to represent its net and frame effects of the bio fouling on the load and the flushing of the cage were analyzed it was stated that the drag coefficient increases when porosity decreases patursson et al 2010 developed a porous media model in which the net was described as a thin volume and good agreement with measurement data was reported recently zhao et al 2013a carried out a numerical study on the flow through a net panel modeled as a porous layer at different attack angles and inclinations and then the flow through a net cage made of multiple net panels zhao et al 2013b it was argued that the flow velocity inside the cage reduces by approximately 10 17 of the incoming velocity bi et al 2014 studied the hydrodynamic characteristics of a net cage using both numerical and experimental approaches the net cage was of cylindrical shape and composed of a flexible net a velocity reduction of about 8 3 with little deviation was found inside the cage for different incoming velocities furthermore bi et al 2017 investigated wave attenuation inside and around an array of 16 identical cages arranged in a square pattern i e 4 by 4 the cage was modeled as inzhao et al 2013b it was stated that the damping effect of the cage array on the wave transmission coefficient increases with increasing the bio fouling amount represented by the solidity in a more recent work considering the bio fouling problem bi et al 2018 drag on and flow through bio fouled nets were examined measurement of the drag and the velocity magnitude was performed on the nets collected from real sea where they were submerged to accumulate hydroid a common fouling organism the drag was found to increase over 10 folds when the solidity increases from 0 185 to 0 79 i e from no fouling to extremely heavy fouling accordingly a velocity reduction was up to 21 4 in the downstream it is noted that the examined nets were of plane and square shape and always normal to the flow direction the cage in this work is of a spherical type and submersible however at this stage it is assumed to be totally submersed in the water the cage is modeled as a hollow sphere and its wall as a porous layer consisting of uniform particles i e a packed bed the thickness and the packing particle size are determined by fitting the simulation flow field with that available in the open literature various characteristics of the flow over and through a single fish cage and a series of cages are presented and discussed this work would help in optimizing the design of the cage and its arrangement in a fish farm so that the water exchange can be maximized the rest of the paper is organized as follows section2 presents the methodology including the governing equations and simulation implementation in section3 a solid sphere of the same diameter with the cage is modeled it is considered to be equivalent to the case when the porosity approaches zero flow over and through a single cage is presented in section4 and multiple cages in section5 finally in section6 some concluding remarks are made and future work is discussed 2 methodology 2 1 governing equations the fluid flow is governed by a continuity equation and a momentum equation which can be written

drag force and drag coefficient the drag and lift forces acting on a solid sphere by a fluid flow are made available in ansys fluent however it is non trivial for the fish cage as there is no solid wall here they can instead be determined via the momentum law whose integral form is written as 9 t v ρ u d v s ρ u ds u f s u r f a c e f b o d y here u is the velocity vector v is the control volume the cage s is the closed surface of v and ds is the surface area vector the first term on the lhs is zero in a steady flow on the rhs f b o d y is the body force constituting possibly the gravity which is neglected here and a resistance force the latter is denoted by f c a g e and assumed to be uniformly distributed in the whole control volume as it resists the flow it points to the opposite direction of the flow or f b o d y f c a g e f s u r f a c e is the force acting on the surface of the control volume it has a pressure component and a viscous one the viscous one is neglected owing to the fact that the shear strain rate is small it is noted that the velocity on the surface of the cage is not necessarily zero it is therefore f s u r f a c e s p ds eq 9 hence becomes 10 s ρ u ds u s p ds f c a g e projecting eq 10 on the streamwise x direction results in the drag force acting on the cage as 11 f d c a g e s ρ u i d s i u j x s p d s j x where d s i is the i component of the surface area vector the drag coefficient c d is thus determined as c d 2 f d ρ u 2 a with a π r 2 being the reference area and r the radius of the cage 2 3 simulation implementation for the purpose of verification of the numerical approach simulation of a flow over a solid sphere in addition to the cage and or cages is carried out the simulation geometry for the sphere and a single cage is shown in fig 2 this is a three dimensional 3d domain in which the distance from the center of the sphere cage to all the lateral planes is identical the size of the domain has been tested showing that it is sufficient the boundary conditions can be found therein in addition a non slip boundary condition is applied on the solid sphere s surface while a fluid interior condition is used for the porous layer it is noted that the gravity and influence of the free surface are neglected here an unstructured mesh is generated for the solid sphere three layers of computational elements with height ratio of 1 2 are built around the sphere for the fish cage it is three layers in the outer fluid zone another three in the inner zone adjacent to the porous layer and at least two across the layer s thickness examples of the mesh are shown in fig 3 it is noted that mesh convergence study is carried out for the cage at ε p 0 75 as a result a mesh consisting of 0 72m elements is found to be sufficient details about this are presented in section4 3 as the flow is strongly turbulent a standard k ε turbulence model is utilized and transient simulation is realized for all the cases 3 flow over a solid sphere the flow in this case is at re 1 0 6 i e ρ 1000 kg m 3 μ 1 0 3 pas d 2 m and the incoming velocity u 0 0 5 m s it is noteworthy that this flow would resemble the one over the fish cage at an extreme condition when total bio fouling happens i e ε p 0 results for the velocity field and the streamline pattern are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively the latter is seen to agree well with that ofyen et al 2017 in which re ranged from 3 1 0 5 to 6 1 0 5 in addition the drag coefficient is found to be c d 0 154 in a work using large eddy simulation les byjindal et al 2004 c d was reported to be 0 149 when a mesh consisting of 0 9m elements was utilized and 0 141 when a finer one consisting of 2 5m elements was used re 1 1 1 0 6 the latter approaches the experimental data ofachenbach 1972 i e c d 0 12 0 14 for re 1 0 1 1 1 0 6 apparently the k ϵ model slightly overestimates the drag coefficient and les could give a better prediction however the deviation is reasonably small it is good to note that les simulation is extremely computationally expensive it was indeed reported to take 2 weeks for a simulation to be done with the coarse mesh jindal et al 2004 the k ε turbulence model is hence chosen for the cages 4 flow over and through a single cage 4 1 characterization of the porous layer for a typical fish cage of spherical type the porosity is estimated to be ε p 0 75 the porous layer s thickness is assumed to be l 0 05 m accounting for 2 5 d with d 2 m in most of the simulations the flow is at re 1 0 6 corresponding to u 0 0 5 m s simulations are carried out for different values of d p ranging from 0 1 to 1 m results for the velocity reduction along the x centerline are shown in fig 6 for d p 0 25 m the velocity reduction once across the layer is found to be 15 5 well in line withzhao et al 2013b who found it to be 10 17 andfredriksson 2001 be 10 it is hence chosen to constitute the porous layer in this work it is noteworthy that d p is a modeling parameter and does not necessarily represent any physical dimension furthermore in what follows an analysis of the influence of l on the flow reduction is presented the energy equation for a flow from points 0 to 1 in fig 7 is expressed as 12 p 0 1 2 ρ u 0 2 p 1 1 2 ρ u 1 2 h f here the subscript 0 represents the area near the inlet and 1 the area behind the layer h f is the head loss due to friction the pressure drop is hence δ p p 0 p 1 and the velocity reduction is δ u u 0 u 1 or δ u u 0 1 u 1 u 0 it is assumed that h f k f δ p with k f 1 solving eq 12 for δ u u 0 one obtains 13 δ u u 0 1 1 2 δ p k f 1 ρ u 0 2 it is noted that 2 δ p k f 1 ρ u 0 2 1 as h f δ p ρ u 0 2 2 according to eq 12 in eq 6 for the pressure drop the viscous term contains a factor of μ 10 3 while the inertial one contains ρ 1 0 3 making the latter a dominant role over the former it is thereby approximated as 14 δ p 1 75 ρ 1 ε p d p ε p 3 u 0 2 l the velocity reduction can then be written as 15 δ u u 0 1 1 3 5 1 ε p k f 1 ε p 3 l d p eq 15 implies that the velocity reduction does not depend on d and u 0 but rather on the ratio of l d p providing that k f does not vary significantly with d and u 0 with δ u u 0 15 5 and the chosen parameters k f is found to be 1 67 simulations with various values of d are performed in which l d p is kept constant either by changing both l and d p or non of them the results for u u 0 along the x centerline are shown in fig 8 obviously the curves are seen to be indeed almost identical it is good to note that u 0 is varied accordingly in these simulations in order to maintain re i e re 1 0 6 moreover another set of simulations in which only u 0 and thus re are varied are carried out the result for δ u u 0 is found to be nearly the same for re 1 0 4 1 0 5 and 1 0 6 this is in line with the early argument and withbi et al 2014 4 2 influence of the bio fouling phenomena bio fouling on the net and frame structure can seriously affect the living environment of aquatic species in the cage i e decreasing the flowability and circulation of well oxygenated water and nutrients in this study the bio fouling is associated with the porosity i e a dense bio fouling corresponds to a low porosity simulations with different values of ε p are performed and analyzed results for the velocity field in the x y center plane are shown in fig 9 and the velocity magnitude along the x centerline in fig 10 it is obvious that the porosity has a great influence on the flow field significantly low velocity is found at low values of porosity especially at ε p 0 25 flow recirculation is seen to exist behind the cage making it resembling to the case of the solid sphere at re 1 0 6 the velocity reduction inside the cage can reach up to 50 and 80 at ε p 0 5 and 0 25 respectively this would correspond to a dense bio fouling severely blocking the flow through it moreover it is noticed that the velocity magnitude behind the cage is greater than that right inside the cage at ε p 0 25 this can be attributed to the flow recirculation 4 3 drag on the spherical fish cage based on the velocity and pressure distributions on the outer surface of the cage the drag force acting on the cage can be determined using eq 11 results for the drag coefficient at different values of ε p are presented in fig 11 as can be seen the drag coefficient at ε p 0 agrees well with that on the solid sphere moreover at ε p 0 5 c d is found to increase with ε p this trend is reserved at larger values of ε p and c d approaches zero at ε p 1 corresponding to a case where the fluid goes through the cage without any resistance a similar trend was obtained byshim et al 2009 at large values of ε p the mesh convergence study is carried out for the case of ε p 0 75 information about the mesh size and the corresponding computational time is presented in table1 the medium mesh consisting of 7 2 1 0 5 elements is utilized for other cases of ε p 5 flow over and through multiple cages it is common that in a fish farm multiple cages can be employed they should be arranged in a certain pattern so that the cost of maintenance and surveillance is minimal and the water exchange is maximal it is therefore necessary to evaluate the flow recovery in the wake of a single cage for this a simulation using an extended computational domain behind the cage is carried out results for the cross sectional velocity profiles at various positions behind the cage and in the x z center plane are shown in fig 12 the profiles are found to be symmetrical with respect to the x centerline along this centerline the velocity is found to be 37 of u 0 at a distance of 5 d it recovers gradually further downstream reaching a value of 10 at 45 d full recovery is expected to happen after 50 d this is a long distance providing that the diameter of a practical cage can be of 10 20 m however the wake or the reduction zone is narrow as can be observed in fig 13 it spans from 1 d at a distance of 5 d to 3 d at 50 d 5 1 two cages in tandem in this subsection two identical cages arranged in tandem and spaced by a distance s are investigated it is foreseen that the flow reduction inside the rear one would be worse according to the discussion presented previously results for velocity distribution over and through the two cages with different spacing distances are shown in fig 14 the flow pattern is observed to be similar for all the cases in addition fig 15 presents the velocity magnitude along the x centerline crossing the two cages it is found that the flow reduction inside the front and the rear cages is quite similar for all the simulated values of s i e it is 15 20 in the front and 41 45 in the rear one the latter is found to be slightly higher than that ofzhao et al 2013b who reported it to be 33 37 the deviation can be attributed to the difference in the cage type which is a rigid spherical structure here as compared to a flexible cylindrical one inzhao et al 2013b the flexibility of a cage allows it to deform with the current possibly alleviating the resistance to the flow however the cage s volume and thus the living environment of fish can be affected the velocity decreases further behind the rear cage it then recovers gradually downstream 5 2 four cages in square staggered arrangement four identical cages are arranged in either a square or a staggered manner the computational geometry for the two arrangements is presented infigs 16 and 17 results for the velocity field over and through the cages in the square arrangement are shown in fig 18 this setup consists of two rows of cages each with two tandem ones as can be observed the flow over each row is similar with that over the tandem cages presented in the previous subsection the two rows are found not to affect each other at least for this particular case where the distance between them is 3 d in addition fig 19 presents the velocity magnitude along the x centerline of the cages the flow reduction inside the rear cage of each row is found to be 44 45 about three folds worse than that inside the front cages where it is still 15 5 for the staggered arrangement fig 20 shows the velocity field in the x z center plane and fig 21 the velocity magnitude along the x centerline of the cages the flow over and through each cage is similar to that presented in section4 for a single and isolated cage influence between them is seemingly insignificant it is noted that the lateral distance between the cages here is relatively large 2 7 d indeed the velocity reduction is found to be almost the same for all the cages as for the mentioned single one that is 15 5 6 concluding remarks and future work a numerical study of a flow over and through a single fish cage and multiple ones arranged in different manners has been carried out in this work the cage was of spherical type and assumed to be totally submerged in the water it was modeled as a hollow sphere with the outer layer being considered as a porous layer its porosity was estimated as ε p 0 75 for a typical cage of the spherical design other characteristic parameters of this layer such as the thickness l and the packing particles diameter d p were determined by fitting the simulation flow field with that ofzhao et al 2013b andfredriksson 2001 the flow reduction inside a single cage at ε p 0 75 was 15 5 it was found not to be affected by the incoming velocity the cage size and hence re however it was strongly affected by the porosity which was used to represent the bio fouling phenomena indeed it was 80 at ε p 0 25 the drag coefficient c d on the cage was evaluated and found to vary with ε p increasing with ε p when ε p 0 5 and decreasing with the increasing ε p when it is larger at ε p 0 75 c d 0 62 the critical porosity at which c d changed its trend and the mechanism governing this need further investigation though in addition when cages were arranged in tandem or square pattern the velocity reduction in the rear ones was found to be 41 45 nearly three folds worse than that in the front ones in a staggered pattern however the reduction was found to be almost the same for all the cages it was 15 5 as for a single isolated one the staggered pattern is obviously better than the square one in terms of the water exchange it is noteworthy that in open seas the current direction can constantly vary which can turn one pattern to another and vice versa it is therefore advisable to thoroughly examine the sites identifying principal directions of the current before deploying the cages within this work a porous media model has been built and various characteristics of the flow over and through a single cage and multiple cages have been studied in the future work besides the aforementioned aspect focus would be on the interaction between the current wave and the cages partially submerged and structural analysis of the frame and mooring system credit authorship

21993,this paper reports an investigation of a flow over and through offshore fish cages using computational fluid dynamics cfd as the cages are working in open seas exposed to bio fouling phenomena which can block the flow and possibly to violent current wave conditions it is therefore important to investigate the water exchange between the inside and the outside of the cages and the hydrodynamic load on them different scenarios involving either a single cage or multiple cages in a certain arrangement are analyzed in this work the cage is of a spherical type submersible and assumed to be working under the water surface totally submerged it is modeled as a hollow sphere with its wall being a thin porous layer representing the net and the mechanical frame the characteristic parameters of the porous medium are determined by fitting the numerical results with data available in the literature various flow characteristics are presented and discussed it is found that the bio fouling phenomena can drastically reduce the exchange of well oxygenated water and the staggered arrangement of four identical cages is superior than the square one keywords computational fluid dynamics cfd porous medium fish cage aquaculture 1 introduction seafood demand has been dramatically increased in the recent years leading to a development of an offshore aquaculture offshore aquaculture is known to possess various advantages over traditional inland one for example being away from contaminant sources providing a healthy environment for fish and in return less harmful to the aquatic ecosystem thanks to strong currents in open seas however in order for an offshore fish cage to operate properly under violent conditions such as strong currents high waves and storms its mechanical frame and mooring system must be able to sustain the hydrodynamic load additionally bio fouling phenomena occurring on the net and frame can also be a problem as they block the exchange of well oxygenated water between the inside and outside of the cage therefore it is indispensable to investigate in detail the flow over and through it and the load acting on it there have been a few studies on this topic using both experimental and numerical approaches in the last decade regarding the former approach zhan et al 2006 studied influences of the reynolds number re and the net solidity on the drag acting on the net the results indicated that the drag coefficient decreases with re and increases with the solidity huang et al 2007 investigated the current reduction by a square net cage and found that the velocity behind the cage reduces from 20 to 45 of the incoming velocity harendza et al 2008 measured the flow field around and inside a cylinder shaped fish cage using piv technique and investigated impacts of the cage inclination and porosity on the flow field in addition zhao et al 2015 measured mooring loads of a multi cage system in a laboratory scale the cages consisted of a floating collar a cylindrical net and sinkers attached to the net s bottom they were arranged in either single or double columns each consisting of up to four cages it was found that the tension in the upstream anchor lines was significantly greater than that in the side and downstream lines velocity magnitude at several points was measured using acoustic doppler velocimetry and a velocity reduction was found to be 11 13 inside and 32 in the downstream of a single cage with the use of the computational fluid dynamics cfd approach shim et al 2009 studied the flow through and around a circular cylinder cage in which a porous jump boundary condition was utilized to represent its net and frame effects of the bio fouling on the load and the flushing of the cage were analyzed it was stated that the drag coefficient increases when porosity decreases patursson et al 2010 developed a porous media model in which the net was described as a thin volume and good agreement with measurement data was reported recently zhao et al 2013a carried out a numerical study on the flow through a net panel modeled as a porous layer at different attack angles and inclinations and then the flow through a net cage made of multiple net panels zhao et al 2013b it was argued that the flow velocity inside the cage reduces by approximately 10 17 of the incoming velocity bi et al 2014 studied the hydrodynamic characteristics of a net cage using both numerical and experimental approaches the net cage was of cylindrical shape and composed of a flexible net a velocity reduction of about 8 3 with little deviation was found inside the cage for different incoming velocities furthermore bi et al 2017 investigated wave attenuation inside and around an array of 16 identical cages arranged in a square pattern i e 4 by 4 the cage was modeled as inzhao et al 2013b it was stated that the damping effect of the cage array on the wave transmission coefficient increases with increasing the bio fouling amount represented by the solidity in a more recent work considering the bio fouling problem bi et al 2018 drag on and flow through bio fouled nets were examined measurement of the drag and the velocity magnitude was performed on the nets collected from real sea where they were submerged to accumulate hydroid a common fouling organism the drag was found to increase over 10 folds when the solidity increases from 0 185 to 0 79 i e from no fouling to extremely heavy fouling accordingly a velocity reduction was up to 21 4 in the downstream it is noted that the examined nets were of plane and square shape and always normal to the flow direction the cage in this work is of a spherical type and submersible however at this stage it is assumed to be totally submersed in the water the cage is modeled as a hollow sphere and its wall as a porous layer consisting of uniform particles i e a packed bed the thickness and the packing particle size are determined by fitting the simulation flow field with that available in the open literature various characteristics of the flow over and through a single fish cage and a series of cages are presented and discussed this work would help in optimizing the design of the cage and its arrangement in a fish farm so that the water exchange can be maximized the rest of the paper is organized as follows section2 presents the methodology including the governing equations and simulation implementation in section3 a solid sphere of the same diameter with the cage is modeled it is considered to be equivalent to the case when the porosity approaches zero flow over and through a single cage is presented in section4 and multiple cages in section5 finally in section6 some concluding remarks are made and future work is discussed 2 methodology 2 1 governing equations the fluid flow is governed by a continuity equation and a momentum equation which can be written

drag force and drag coefficient the drag and lift forces acting on a solid sphere by a fluid flow are made available in ansys fluent however it is non trivial for the fish cage as there is no solid

the cage s is the closed surface of v and ds is the surface area vector the first term on the lhs is zero in a steady flow on the rhs f b o d y is the body force constituting possibly the gravity

direction of the flow or f b o d y f c a g e f s u r f a c e is the force acting on the surface of the control volume it has a pressure component and a viscous one the viscous one is neglected owing to the fact that the shear strain rate is small it is noted that the velocity on the surface of the cage is not necessarily zero it is therefore f s u r f a c e s p ds eq 9 hence becomes 10 s ρ u ds u

verification of the numerical approach simulation of a flow over a solid sphere in addition to the cage and or cages is carried out the simulation geometry for the sphere and a single cage is shown in fig 2 this is a three dimensional 3d domain in which the distance from the center of the sphere cage to all the lateral planes is identical the size of the domain has been tested showing that it is sufficient the boundary conditions can be found therein in addition a non slip boundary condition is applied on the solid sphere s surface while a fluid interior condition is used for the porous layer it is noted that the gravity and influence of the free surface are neglected here an unstructured mesh is generated for the solid sphere three layers of computational elements with height ratio of 1 2 are built around the sphere for the fish cage it is three layers in the outer fluid zone another three in the inner zone adjacent to the porous layer and at least two across the layer s thickness examples of the mesh are shown in fig 3 it is noted that mesh convergence study is carried out for the cage at ε p 0 75 as a result a mesh consisting of 0 72m elements is found to be sufficient details about this are presented in section4 3 as the flow is strongly turbulent a standard k ε turbulence model is utilized and transient simulation is realized for all the cases 3 flow over a solid sphere the flow in this case is at re 1 0 6 i e ρ 1000 kg m 3 μ 1 0 3 pas d 2 m and the incoming velocity u 0 0 5 m s it is noteworthy that this flow would resemble the one over the fish cage at an extreme condition when total bio fouling happens i e ε p 0 results for the velocity field and the streamline pattern are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively the latter is seen to agree well with that ofyen et al 2017 in which re ranged from 3 1 0 5 to 6 1 0 5 in addition the drag coefficient is found to be c d 0 154 in a work using large eddy simulation les byjindal et al 2004 c d was reported to be 0 149 when a mesh consisting of 0 9m elements was utilized and 0 141 when a finer one consisting of 2 5m elements was used re 1 1 1 0 6 the latter approaches the experimental data ofachenbach 1972 i e c d 0 12 0 14 for re 1 0 1 1 1 0 6 apparently the k ϵ model slightly overestimates the drag coefficient and les could give a better prediction however the deviation is reasonably small it is good to note that les simulation is extremely computationally expensive it was indeed reported to take 2 weeks for a simulation to be done with the coarse mesh jindal et al 2004 the k ε turbulence model is hence chosen for the cages 4 flow over and through a single cage 4 1 characterization of the porous layer for a typical fish cage of spherical type the porosity is estimated to be ε p 0 75 the porous layer s thickness is assumed to be l 0 05 m accounting for 2 5 d with d 2 m in most of the simulations the flow is at re 1 0 6 corresponding to u 0 0 5 m s simulations are carried out for different values of d p ranging from 0 1 to 1 m results for the velocity reduction along the x centerline are shown in fig 6 for d p 0 25 m the velocity reduction once across the layer is found to be 15 5 well in line withzhao et al 2013b who found it to be 10 17 andfredriksson 2001 be 10 it is hence chosen to constitute the porous layer in this work it is noteworthy that d p is a modeling parameter and does not necessarily represent any physical dimension furthermore in what follows an analysis of the influence of l on the flow reduction is presented the energy equation for a flow from points 0 to 1 in fig 7 is expressed as 12 p 0 1 2 ρ u 0 2 p 1 1 2 ρ u 1 2 h f here the subscript 0 represents the area near the inlet and 1 the area behind the layer h f is the head loss due to friction the pressure drop is hence δ p p 0 p 1 and the velocity reduction is δ u u 0 u 1 or δ u u 0 1 u 1 u 0 it is assumed that h f k f δ p with k f 1 solving eq 12 for δ u u 0 one obtains 13 δ u u 0 1 1 2 δ p k f 1 ρ u 0 2 it is noted that 2 δ p k f 1 ρ u 0 2 1 as h f δ p ρ u 0 2 2 according to eq 12 in eq 6 for the pressure drop the viscous term contains a factor of μ 10 3 while the inertial one contains ρ

ε p 3 l d p eq 15 implies that the velocity reduction does not depend on d and u 0 but rather on the ratio of l d p providing that k f does not vary significantly with d and u 0 with δ u u 0 15 5 and the chosen parameters k f is found to be 1 67 simulations with various values of d are performed in which l d p is kept constant either by changing both l and d p or non of them the results for u u 0 along the x centerline are shown in fig 8 obviously the curves are seen to be indeed almost identical it is good to note that u 0 is varied accordingly in these simulations in order to maintain re i e re 1 0 6 moreover another set of simulations in which only u 0 and thus re are varied are carried out the result for δ u u 0 is found to be nearly the same for re 1 0 4 1 0 5 and 1 0 6 this is in line with the early argument and withbi et al 2014 4 2 influence of the bio fouling phenomena bio fouling on the net and frame structure can seriously affect the living environment of aquatic species in the cage i e decreasing the flowability and circulation of well oxygenated water and nutrients in this study the bio fouling is associated with the porosity i e a dense bio fouling corresponds to a low porosity simulations with different values of ε p are performed and analyzed results for the velocity field in the x y center plane are shown in fig 9 and the velocity magnitude along the x

seen to exist behind the cage making it resembling to the case of the solid sphere at re 1 0 6 the velocity reduction inside the cage can reach up to 50 and 80 at ε p 0 5 and 0 25 respectively this would correspond to a dense bio fouling severely blocking the flow through it moreover it is noticed that the velocity magnitude behind the cage is greater than that right inside the cage at ε p 0 25 this can be attributed to the flow recirculation 4 3 drag on the spherical fish cage based on the velocity and pressure distributions on the outer surface of the cage the drag force acting on the cage can be determined using eq 11 results for the drag coefficient at different values of ε p are presented in fig 11 as can be seen the drag coefficient at ε p 0 agrees well with that on the solid sphere moreover at ε p 0 5 c d is found to increase with ε p this trend is reserved at larger values of ε p and c d approaches zero at ε p 1 corresponding to a case where the fluid goes through the cage without any resistance a similar trend was obtained byshim et al 2009 at large values of ε p the mesh convergence study is carried out for the case of ε p 0 75 information about the mesh size and the corresponding computational time is presented in table1 the medium mesh consisting of 7 2 1 0 5 elements is utilized for other cases of ε p 5 flow over and through multiple cages it is common that in a fish farm multiple cages can be employed they should be arranged in a certain pattern so that the cost of maintenance and surveillance is minimal and the water exchange is maximal it is therefore necessary to evaluate the flow recovery in the wake of a single cage for this a simulation using an extended computational domain behind the cage is carried out results for the cross sectional velocity profiles at various positions behind the cage and in the x z center plane are shown in fig 12 the profiles are found to be symmetrical with respect to the x centerline along this centerline the velocity is found to be 37 of u 0 at a distance of 5 d it recovers gradually further downstream reaching a value of 10 at 45 d full recovery is expected to happen after 50 d this is a long distance providing that the diameter of a practical cage can be of 10 20 m however the wake or the reduction zone is narrow as can be observed in fig 13 it spans from 1 d at a distance of 5 d to 3 d at 50 d 5 1 two cages in tandem in this subsection two identical cages arranged in tandem and spaced by a distance s are investigated it is foreseen that the flow reduction inside the rear one would be worse according to the discussion presented previously results for velocity distribution over and through the two cages with different spacing distances are shown in fig 14 the flow pattern is observed to be similar for all the cases in addition fig 15 presents the velocity magnitude along the x centerline crossing the two cages it is found that the flow reduction inside the front and the rear cages is quite similar for all the simulated values of s i e it is 15 20 in the front and 41 45 in the rear one the latter is found to be slightly higher than that ofzhao et al 2013b who reported it to be 33 37 the deviation can be attributed to the difference in the cage type which is a rigid spherical structure here as compared to a flexible cylindrical one inzhao et al 2013b the flexibility of a cage allows it to deform with the current possibly alleviating the resistance to the flow however the cage s volume and thus the living environment of fish can be affected the velocity decreases further behind the rear cage it then recovers gradually downstream 5 2 four cages in square staggered arrangement four identical cages are arranged in either a square or a staggered manner the computational geometry for the two arrangements is presented infigs 16 and 17 results for the velocity field over and through the cages in the square arrangement are shown in fig 18 this setup consists of two rows of cages each with two tandem ones as can be observed the flow over each row is similar with that over the tandem cages presented in the previous subsection the two rows are found not to affect each other at least for this particular case where the distance between them is 3 d in addition fig 19 presents the velocity magnitude along the x centerline of the cages the flow reduction inside the rear cage of each row is found to be 44 45 about three folds worse than that inside the front cages where it is still 15 5 for the staggered arrangement fig 20 shows the velocity field in the x z center plane and fig 21 the velocity magnitude along the x centerline of the cages the flow over and through each cage is similar to that presented in section4 for a single and isolated cage influence between them is seemingly insignificant it is noted that the lateral distance between the cages here is relatively large 2 7 d indeed the velocity reduction is found to be almost the same for all the cages as for the mentioned single one that is 15 5 6 concluding remarks and future work a numerical study of a flow over and through a single fish cage and multiple ones arranged in different manners has been carried out in this work the cage was of spherical type and assumed to be totally submerged in the water it was modeled as a hollow sphere with the outer layer being considered as a porous layer its porosity was estimated as ε p 0 75 for a typical cage of the spherical design other characteristic parameters of this layer such as the thickness l and the packing particles diameter d p were determined by fitting the simulation flow field with that ofzhao et al 2013b andfredriksson 2001 the flow reduction inside a single cage at ε p 0 75 was 15 5 it was found not to be affected by the incoming velocity the cage size and hence re however it was strongly affected by the porosity which was used to represent the bio fouling phenomena indeed it was 80 at ε p 0 25 the drag coefficient c d on the cage was evaluated and found to vary with ε p increasing with ε p when ε p 0 5 and decreasing with the increasing ε p when it is larger at ε p 0 75 c d 0 62 the critical porosity at which c d changed its trend and the mechanism governing this need further investigation though in addition when cages were arranged in tandem or square pattern the velocity reduction in the rear ones was found to be 41 45 nearly three folds worse than that in the front ones in a staggered pattern however the reduction was found to be almost the same for all the cages it was 15 5 as for a single isolated one the staggered pattern is obviously better than the square one in terms of the water exchange it is noteworthy that in open seas the current direction can constantly vary which can turn one pattern to another and vice versa it is therefore advisable to thoroughly examine the sites identifying principal directions of the current before deploying the cages within this work a porous media model has been built and various characteristics of the flow over and through a single cage and multiple cages have been studied in the future work besides the aforementioned aspect focus would be on the interaction between the current wave and the cages partially submerged and structural analysis of the frame and mooring system credit authorship

21994,in the paper a robust controller using the back stepping approach and the time delay estimation tde is proposed for the trajectory tracking of torpedo shape autonomous underwater vehicles auvs the auv has several difficult issues to design accurate tracking control unsatisfaction of matching condition and highly nonlinear dynamics including external disturbances to overcome the matching condition issues the proposed controller is designed based on the back stepping approach which is a well known method handling unmatched disturbances effectively and having well established design procedure to estimate nonlinear vehicle dynamics including sea currents and external disturbances the tde an efficient estimation method using previous system information is adopted owing simplicity of the tde the proposed controller does not need whole vehicle dynamics while requiring only the determination of control gains the stability analysis of the proposed controller is studied conducting the guidelines for selection of control gains through the simulation results using remus model it is demonstrated that the proposed controller has accurate and robust tracking performance even when a vehicle moves under sea currents and external disturbing forces graphical abstract keywords back stepping control time delay estimation autonomous underwater vehicle auv trajectory tracking robust control 1 introduction nowadays torpedo type autonomous underwater vehicles auvs have been used intensively for exploring the subsea world peymani and fossen 2015 sahoo et al 2019 as explained in li and lee 2009 however it is not easy to design a trajectory tracking controller for auvs because the vehicles have only three control inputs surge force pitch and yaw moment for six degree of freedom dof motion due to the lack of control inputs one cannot control every state variables directly the vehicles have nonholonomic constraints between state variables the effects of disturbances on the uncontrollable states or conditions are not easy to be compensated either and the system does not satisfy so called matching condition khalil 2002 the nonlinear vehicle dynamics induces another difficulty to design the controller because the vehicle dynamics involves not only the rigid dynamics but also hydraulic dynamics it is time consuming to get dynamic model and to estimate the dynamic model coefficients moreover there are external disturbances as sea currents which are not easy to be measured accurately thus model based controllers are easy to suffer performance degradation caused by the modeling error since last couple of decades there have been several research works to design trajectory tracking controller for auvs many of the works employed the back stepping controller bc to resolve the matching condition problem li and lee 2009 repoulias and papadopoulos 2007 liang et al 2017 juan et al 2015 there are several research works to overcome underactuated characteristics by using hierarchical design of controller e g feedback design of desired velocity and terminal sliding mode control elmokadem et al 2017 guidance and fuzzy control yu et al 2017 lapierre and soetanto 2007 shows that the concurrent feedback design of dynamic control and target position update can vanish tracking error in the liapunov sense by designing kinematics level controller with consideration of underactuated problem the approaches tried to decouple the matching condition issue from dynamics controller design nowadays the research works tend to be focused on the robustness against dynamic modeling errors or external disturbances there are several research works employing the sliding mode control smc in xu et al 2015 and karkoub et al 2017 the bc and the smc are employed to obtain robustness against systematic uncertainties and external disturbances yang et al 2019 proposes finite time controller by applying nonsingular fast terminal smc elmokadem et al 2019 applied the smc on dynamics positioning problem and way point tracking problem under disturbed environments yan et al 2019 utilized the adaptive neural network and the smc to improve robustness against disturbances in many research works adaptive control scheme was used to resolve model uncertainties and external disturbances tabataba i nasab et al 2019 li et al 2019 in wang et al 2018 the neural networks and the adaptive control are combined for the robust path following in liu et al 2019 and xia et al 2019 adaptive line of sight was suggested for robust way point tracking neural network based approaches are also studied for the robustness tracking of the vehicle elhaki and shojaei 2018 shojaei and arefi 2015 zheng et al 2019 another research works tried to resolve the robust tracking problem combination of bio inspired velocity control and adaptive smc jiang et al 2018 ocean current observer liang et al 2018 extended state observer peng et al 2018 fuzzy adaptive command filtered bc wang et al 2019 adaptive nussbaum function based control wadi et al 2019 li et al 2018 handles stabilization of the vehicles in three dimensional motion by analyzing the nonlinear dynamics in yan and yu 2018 quantization error problem during measuring state and transmitting control signals to the actuators was resolved by introducing the bound of quantization error into the switching terms of the sliding mode control yet these controllers required substantial computational time due to relatively complex derivations and decision making process moreover most of research works require the vehicle model it is burden and time consuming process to identify the dynamic model parameters in this paper a trajectory tracking control scheme named as the back stepping control with time delay estimation bctde for horizontal plane motion of the vehicles is proposed first it is shown that the tracking error dynamics of the vehicles having nonholonomic constraint can be arranged into strict feedback form using the error dynamics the bc is designed to overcome the matching condition issue for the robustness against nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances the time delay estimation tde is adopted the tde is simple and effective scheme to estimate nonlinear dynamics indirectly by utilizing previous system inputs and outputs youcef toumi and ito 1990 hsia and gao 1990 cho et al 2009 thus the proposed controller can be designed without knowing whole vehicle model and is relatively easy to be applied the performance of the tde for auv systems has been verified through several applications kumar et al 2007 2009 kim et al 2016 in those applications however the vehicles have thrusters for every dof and do not suffer nonholonomic constraint issue or matching condition problem which are treated in this paper the stability of the proposed controller is also discussed by analyzing the tracking error dynamics and the model estimation errors based on the stability analysis results the characteristics of the closed loop system an error dynamics including the tde error and tuning guideline of control gains are addressed the tracking performance of the proposed controller is demonstrated through numerical simulations using remus model 2 controller design for auv 2 1 motion governing equations of auv for the simplicity let us consider the control problem of the vehicles having three dof surge sway yaw motion in xy plane fig 1 shows the conceptual diagram including coordinate systems the dynamics of the vehicles in horizontal plane is described as follows fossen 1994 1 m ν c ν d ν g d o s τ τ e where ν u v r t denotes a vector of the velocities surge sway yaw in body fixed coordinate b m m r b m a with m r b inertia matrix of rigid body dynamics and m a added inertia matrix due to hydrodynamics c c r b c a with c r b rigid body coriolis and centripetal matrix and c a hydrodynamic coriolis and centripetal matrix d damping matrix g restoring forces τ control inputs τ e environmental disturbances d o s coupled dynamics with other states heave roll pitch the detailed dynamics description of the auvs especially for the case of remus can be found in prestero 2001 note that in 1 we only take into account the states in horizontal plane as states to be controlled and dynamics due to the other states d o s is assumed to be negligible the control input τ for horizontal plane are generated by thrusting force and rudder and can be described as follow 2 τ τ u τ v τ r x p r o p y u u δ r u 2 δ r n u u δ r u 2 δ r where x p r o p denotes thrusting force δ r rudder angle y u u δ r and n u u δ r are coefficients for sway force and yaw moment due to the rudder angle note that in 2 the rudder angle δ r decides the two control inputs τ v and τ r it means that τ v and τ r cannot be determined independently if τ r is designed to control r τ v is determined accordingly and vice versa commonly the motion of rudder is used to control yaw angle of the vehicle in the case the control input can be divided as follows 3 τ τ u 0 τ r τ c 0 τ v 0 τ d where τ c denotes available control input τ d the control input which is treated as disturbance note that from 1 and 3 only two independent control input variables τ u and τ r are available for the three independent state variables u v r finally we can rearrange the vehicle dynamics in horizontal plane as follows 4 m u m v m r m u v r ν n u n v n r n τ u 0 τ r τ c τ e u τ e v τ e r τ e where m u m v m r are 1 3 vectors of inertia matrix n c ν d ν g d o s τ d note that the state variable u and r are controllable with individual input by introducing positive constants m u and m r the dynamics of those variables can be represented as follows 5 m u u h u τ u m r r h r τ r where m u and m r are the gains which represent as known ranges of inertia h u and h r are nonlinear terms defined as 6 h u m u ν m u u n u τ e u h r m r ν m r r n r τ e r the kinematics of the vehicles can be expressed as following li and lee 2009 7 x y ψ c ψ 0 s ψ 0 0 1 u r s ψ c ψ 0 v v c x v c y 0 where x y ψ denote the position state variables of auv in world coordinate w v c x and v c y sea currents in x and y direction respectively c cos and s sin note that in the rhs of 7 the term related on v is described separately it is because as shown in 4 there is no independent control input for v thus the effect of v can be treated as a disturbance in the vehicle kinematics the motion governing equations of the vehicles in 4 and 7 reveal several issues which are hard to be dealt with for controller design the issues can be addressed as the following three aspects matching condition issue if uncertain terms enter the state equation at the same point as the control input the state equation satisfies the matching condition khalil 2002 in the vehicle dynamics in 4 however the lack of independent control input violates the matching condition the state equation related on v includes uncertain terms but there is not any independent control input to compensate such uncertainties as a result the state v cannot be controlled directly and can be drifted by following the motion governing equation nonholonomic constraint issue as shown in 7 only two state variables u and r can be utilized to determine the three state variables x y ψ in w thus the states x y and ψ cannot be determined independently and there exists a constraint among the states by ignoring the effect of the lateral motion and sea currents one can find the constraint easily from 7 as x 2 y 2 u 2 moreover the states are affected by v which acts like a disturbance because of the lack of matching condition v is hard to be controlled directly while disturbing the states x and y in w to be determined in the desired position nonlinear dynamics issue like other underwater vehicles auvs have highly nonlinear dynamics as explained in 1 the vehicle dynamics includes not only rigid body dynamics but also hydrodynamics moreover the dynamics of each state is strongly coupled to each other as a result it is hard and time consuming to identify the mathematical model of dynamics as well as essential coefficients for the model practically the modeling error is unavoidable and may degrade tracking performance when the controller is designed based on the model that is not perfect 2 2 problem definition due to the underactuated characteristics only two trajectory variables in the plane having three dofs can be designed independently we can set the independent trajectory variables as x y in w the trajectories can be given as the following continuous time functions 8 x d x d t y d y d t as illustrated in fig 1 the desired yaw angle ψ d in w is dependently derived from 8 as follows 9 ψ d a t a n 2 y d x d from 8 and 9 regarding 7 the desired trajectories for the state variables in b are given as follows 1 1 note that ψ d d d t a t a n 2 y d x d y d x d 2 y d 2 x d x d x d 2 y d 2 y d 10 u d x d 2 y d 2 r d ψ d note that the derivatives of the desired trajectories in 8 satisfying 9 and 10 are given as follows 11 x d u d c ψ d y d u d s ψ d the tracking problem to be treated in the paper is to design a controller for a auv system expressed in 4 and 7 so as to track the desired trajectories in 8 10 in details the tracking error along x d and y d are firstly dealt with by using the control input τ c note that if there are lateral disturbances like sea currents the yaw angle error may be required intentionally to generate lateral force for overcoming the disturbances 2 3 error dynamics formulation in the subsection the tracking error dynamics of the vehicle having nonholonomic constraint is arranged as strict feedback form in the desired trajectory coordinate d the coordinate d is a moving coordinate which follows the desired trajectory as shown in fig 1 the origin of d is x d y d and the rotation angle of d with respect to w is ψ d by describing the error dynamics in d one can attenuate the relationship changes between variables in different coordinates xia et al 2019 peng et al 2018 if there is no tracking error u affects d x for every ψ the transform can be easily accomplished as follows craig 1989 12 d x d y t w d r x y t w d r x d y d t where w d r denotes the rotation matrix of w with respect to d which is obtained as 13 w d r d w r t c ψ d s ψ d s ψ d c ψ d by using 12 the desired trajectories in 8 can be transformed to those in d as follows 14 d x d d y d 0 note that the tracking problem in d is identical with that in w it is because the convergence of the tracking error in d guarantees that in w from 12 and 14 one can obtain the following relationship 15 d x e d y e t w d r x e y e t where e d note that w d r is a rotation matrix which cannot be singular thus the convergence of the tracking errors in d guarantees that in w which can be easily shown by using the norm operation as follows 16 x e y e w d r t d x e d y e d w r d x e d y e using the desired trajectories and motion governing equations given in sections 2 1 2 2 and the coordinate transform in 12 one can derive the error dynamics of auv as a strict feedback form lemma 1 let us consider the auv system of which the motion governing equations are given in 4 7 and 12 let the desired trajectories for the auv be given as 14 10 and 11 then the error dynamics of the vehicle can be expressed as the following strict feedback form 17 d x e α u u e λ x u e u d m u 1 h u m u 1 τ u and 18 d y e α ψ ψ e λ y ψ e r e r e r d m r 1 h r m r 1 τ r where 19 λ x u d c ψ e u α u u e d y e r d s ψ e v c ψ d v c x s ψ d v c y λ y u s ψ e α ψ ψ e d x e r d c ψ e v s ψ d v c x c ψ d v c y and α u and α ψ are positive constants proof see appendix a 2 4 design of back stepping controller as shown in 17 and 18 the error dynamics of the vehicle is represented in the strict feedback form thus the controller can be designed based on the back stepping approach the design procedure of the back stepping control is straight forward in the liapunov sense khalil 2002 krstic et al 1995 the design results are arranged in the following theorem theorem 1 let us consider the auv system having error dynamics in 17 and 18 let the back stepping controller for the vehicle be designed as follows 20 τ u h u m u η u 21 τ r h r m r η r where 22 η u α u 1 α u u d λ x k x d x e d x e k u u e η r α ψ 1 α ψ r d λ y k y d y e d y e k ψ ψ e ψ e k r r e and 23 u e α u u e d u e ψ e α ψ ψ e d ψ e r e α ψ r e d r e and 24 u e d α u 1 λ x k x d x e ψ e d α ψ 1 λ y k y d y e r e d α ψ 1 λ y k y d y e d y e k ψ ψ e and denotes the estimated value of k x k u k y k ψ k r 0 the control gains let us set the liapuov function as follows 25 v x 1 2 d x e 2 1 2 u e 2 v y 1 2 d y e 2 1 2 ψ e 2 1 2 r e 2 assume that there is no modeling error i e then the derivatives of the liapunov functions are derived as the following negative definite forms 26 v x k x d x e 2 k u u e 2 v y k y d y e 2 k ψ ψ e 2 k r r e 2 proof see appendix b note that the stability analysis with the liapunov functions in 25 guarantees the asymptotic convergence of d x e and d y e but not that of u e ψ e and r e instead the convergence of u e ψ e and r e is guaranteed it means that u e ψ e and r e are converged to u e d ψ e d and r e d which are the fictitious control inputs of the bc as given in 24 as explained in section 2 2 it is desirable result to accomplish the goal of the paper to reduce the tracking error of d x and d y or x and y it is because the fictitious control inputs are designed to compensate the unmatched disturbances when the controlled system stays at steady state i e v x v y 0 in 26 and accordingly v x v y 0 in 25 the fictitious inputs in 24 are derived as follows 27 u e d v x 0 α u 1 λ x ψ e d v y 0 α ψ 1 λ y r e d v y 0 α ψ 1 λ y note that u e d and ψ e d in 27 are converged to the estimates of the unmatched disturbances λ x of d x e dynamics in 17 and λ y of d y e dynamics in 18 respectively if there is no unmatched disturbance the fictitious control inputs in 27 are converged to zero i e u e ψ e r e 0 at steady state and the states u ψ r are converged to their desired values in 9 and 10 if there are non zero unmatched disturbances whereas u e ψ e r e are converged to estimated values of the unmatched disturbances to compensate for the effect of the disturbances in the dynamics of d x e and d y e 2 5 time delay estimation to implement the controller in theorem 1 one needs to obtain h u and h r the estimated values of 6 and λ x and λ y those of 19 for robust and efficient estimation we employ the tde youcef toumi and ito 1990 hsia and gao 1990 cho et al 2009 the key idea behind the tde is that if the system dynamics is given as a continuous or piece wise continuous function the variation of the dynamics during very short time can be negligible thus the value of the dynamics in the current time can be estimated by using that in short time before based on the idea the system dynamics can be estimated indirectly by utilizing previous information of system input and output from 5 the dynamics can be estimated as follows 28 h u t h u t l τ u t l m u u t l h r t h r t l τ r t l m r r t l where l denotes short time delay which is commonly set as the sampling time of the control system the unmatched dynamics in 19 can be also estimated by using the tde from the first equation of 17 and the first equation of 18 one can obtain the estimated values as follows 29 λ x t λ x t l d x e t l α u u e t l λ y t λ y t l d y e t l α ψ ψ e t l by applying 28 into 20 and 21 the final form of the proposed controller named the back stepping control with time delay estimation bctde is obtained as follows 30 τ u τ u t l m u u t l m u η u τ r τ r t l m r r t l m r η r where η u and η r are described in 22 with 23 24 and 29 note that λ in 22 and 24 can be obtained by the tde in 29 in 22 and 24 the derivatives of λ are also included which can be obtained practically by applying numerical differentiation e g euler backward method chapra and canale 1998 t t t l l in the proposed controller the nonholonomic constraint issue and the matching condition issue are handled by the back stepping approach the nonlinear dynamics issue is overcome by the tde note that the tde does not require whole model of the vehicle dynamics one can design the proposed controller by only choosing the inertial gains m u m r α u and α ψ and the feedback gains k x k u k y k ψ and k r 3 analysis of proposed controller if there is no modeling error i e the proposed controller is asymptotically stable in the liapunov sense if there is modeling error however the stability and the performance can be degraded due to the modeling error by removing the assumption of and by following the procedure in proof of theorem 1 one can derive the derivatives of the liapunov function in 25 as the following form including modeling errors 31 v x k x d x e 2 k u u e 2 d x e ϵ λ x u e ϵ h u v y k y d y e 2 k ψ ψ e 2 k r r e 2 d y e ϵ λ y r e ϵ h r where 32 ϵ λ x λ x λ x ϵ h u α u m u 1 h u h u ϵ λ y λ y λ y ϵ h r α ψ m r 1 h r h r from 31 one can recognize that the derivatives of the liapunov functions may not be negative definite due to the modeling errors in the section thus the stability of the proposed controller is analyzed by investigating the tracking error dynamics containing the modeling errors ϵ λ x ϵ h u ϵ λ y and ϵ h r 3 1 stability analysis as explained in 31 stability of the proposed controller is dependent on the dynamics of the modeling errors for the stability analysis thus the dynamics of the modeling errors are investigated of which the results are arranged as follows lemma 2 let us consider that the auv system in 4 is controlled by the bctde in 20 21 with 23 28 and 29 to track the desired trajectories in 8 then the dynamics of the modeling errors is obtained as follows 33 ϵ h u t 1 m u t 1 m u ϵ h u t l γ h u 1 t γ h u 2 t w h e r e γ h u 1

l c y t c y t l u t u t l ψ e t l proof see appendix c by using the result of lemma 2 and by investigating the relationship between the tracking error and the modeling error the stability condition of the proposed controller is analyzed the main result of the stability analysis is arranged as the following theorem theorem 2 let us consider that the auv system having error dynamics in 17 and 18 is controlled by the bctde in 20 21 with 23 28 and 29 then the dynamics of the tracking errors is obtained as follows 37 d x e u e k x 1 1 k u a x d x e u e ϵ λ x ϵ h u 38 d y e ψ e r e k y 1 0 1 k ψ 1 0 1 k r a y d y e ψ e r e ϵ λ y 0 ϵ h r for the stability assume that the forcing functions γ in 33 36 are bounded then the tracking errors are bounded if the matrices a x and a y are hurwitz and the following conditions are satisfied 39 1 m u t 1 m u 1 40 1 α u 1 c ψ e t 1 41 1 m r t 1 m r 1 42 1 α ψ 1 u t 1 proof see appendix d remark when the sampling time l is sufficiently short the assumption of the boundedness of γ can be accepted in the practical manner it is because λ include the dynamic variation during a sampling time and the vehicle has continuous or piecewise continuous dynamics fossen 1994 of which variation during a sampling time can be bounded if l 0 jin et al 2009 when the sampling time is relatively long however the boundedness of γ may not be guaranteed in such case the proposed conditions 39 42 are not sufficient for the stability and rigorous stability analysis with consideration of finite sampling time is required jung et al 2011 investigated the stability of the time delay control a controller using the tde including the sampling time and their results can apply for the extended stability of the proposed controller in this paper however we deal with conservative stability analysis as the paper focuses on the controller design and the demonstration of its performance 3 2 control gain selection the proposed controller in 20 and 21 with 22 23 24 28 and 29 can be designed by choosing inertial gains m u m r α u and α ψ and the feedback gains k u k x k r k ψ and k y the result of theorem 2 can be utilized to design the gains the feedback gains can be designed by using the hurwitz condition of a x and a y in 37 and 38 as shown in 37 and 38 the dynamics of the tracking error are determined by the gains k only thus one can make a x and a y hurwitz by adjusting the gains in details characteristic equations can be obtained from 37 and 38 as follows 43 s i a x s 2 k x k u s k x k u 1 s i a y s 3 k y k ψ k r s 2 k y k ψ k ψ k r k r k y 2 s k y k ψ k r k y k r where s denotes the laplace operator by choosing k appropriately one can locate all poles of 43 in the left half plane lhp when choosing k x 5 0 k u 0 1 k y 1 0 k ψ 5 0 and k r 0 2 for example the poles for a x are located in s x 4 79 0 31 and those for a y are s y 4 48 1 36 0 36 which are all in the lhp the inertial gains can be designed by using the stability condition in 39 42 which can be rearranged as the following corollary corollary 1 for the gains m u m r α u and α ψ 0 the conditions satisfying 39 42 are rearranged as follows 44 f o r m u m u 2 m u t 45 f o r m r m r 2

designed to satisfy the conditions in corollary 1 note that the conditions for m u and m r include the parameters of the vehicle dynamics which are not easy to be identified if the real values of the dynamic parameters are not available m u and m r can be tuned by trial and error by following the gain tuning guidelines of the time delay control to increase gradually from a small value until satisfactory performance obtained chang and jung 2009 cho et al 2009 by following aforementioned design procedure one can design the proposed controller by tuning only the gains without any information of the vehicle dynamics the procedure is relatively easy in comparison with those of the conventional schemes e g pid control needs to tune three gains for each actuation axis and the computed torque control needs a whole model of the system dynamics remark the stability conditions in corollary 1 also include the vehicle status conditions for the stability in details 48 means that the vehicle should move forward to guarantee the stability the condition is physically reasonable because if the vehicle moves backward the direction of control input due to rudder angle should be reversed thus the controller cannot generate the control input to appropriate direction the condition in 49 can be accepted by similar physical reason if the heading error ψ e t exceeds π 2 or π 2 in negative direction the vehicle should be headed opposite direction with the desired trajectory in the case the directions between the control inputs and the tracking errors are reversed it means that although the controller calculates the control inputs to reduce the tracking errors in reality the generated control inputs increase tracking errors 4 simulation in the section the performance of the proposed controller is verified through the simulation study the purpose of the simulation is to verify tracking performance along time varying trajectory under disturbed environments two types of disturbances are included sea currents in velocity level and external disturbances in force level the performance of the proposed controller bctde is compared with the bc using the explicit nominal model the bc is designed as 20 and 21 with 23 and 24 which is the same as the back stepping control part of the proposed controller differently from the proposed controller the dynamic models for the bc are estimated based on 6 and 19 as follows 50 h u m u ν m u u n u h r m r ν m r r n r λ x u d c ψ e u α u u e d y e r d s ψ e v λ y u s ψ e α ψ ψ e d x e r d c ψ e v where m u n u m r and n r denote nominal models of m u n u m r and n r respectively for the bc it is assumed that the sea currents and the external disturbances are not measurable the assumption is reasonable because there is seldom method to measure the external effects note that in the nominal models in 50 the effects of external disturbance and sea currents are omitted the model of remus in xy plane is used for the simulation prestero 2001 the coefficients of nominal models for the bc are set as the values in prestero 2001 and uncertainties in the dynamic coefficients for vehicle simulation are set randomly under 10 of each nominal value as shown in fig 2 the desired trajectory is set as combination of linear motion and 8 motion with constant velocity of u d 1 0 m s linear motion during 0 t 50 s 8 motion during 50 s t 250 s and linear motion again during 250 s t 300 s the feedback gains for the both controllers are designed as k x 5 0 k u 0 1 k y 1 0 k ψ 5 0 k r 0 1 to make a x and a y in 37 hurwitz in the case the poles for a x are s x 4 79 0 31 and those for a y are s y 4 49 1 35 0 26 which are all in the lhp the inertial gains are set as m u 10 0 kg m r m r n u u δ r u 2 0 5 s 2 α u 1 0 α ψ 1 0 m s by tuning the control input saturation for x p r o p and δ r in 2 is set as 0 x p r o p 9 25 n and 13 6 deg δ r 13 6 deg as described in prestero 2001 to compare the performance against disturbances two cases of simulation are performed in the first case the sea currents and external disturbances are set as zero in the other case the sea currents in 7 are set as v c x v c m a x 2 v c y v c m a x 2 where v c m a x 0 2 m s and the external disturbing forces in 4 are set as τ e u τ e m a x sin 2 π ω t 2 τ e v τ e m a x cos 2 π ω t 2 and τ e r 0 where τ e m a x 2 n and ω 0 05 hz in the both cases the initial errors are set as x 0 y 0 ψ 0 t 0 m 0 m 60 deg t figs 2 7 show the simulation results of the case where zero sea currents and external disturbances are applied as shown in figs 2 6 the responses of the both controllers converge to the desired trajectory asymptotically which means that the both controllers successfully compensate for the initial error in table 1 the rms errors are arranged separately according to motion types the first linear motion during 0 t 50 s the 8 motion during 50 s t 250 s and the last linear motion during 250 s t 300 s table 1 shows that in the first linear motion the both controller has similar rms errors which is because the both controllers has large tracking errors due to the initial errors in the 8 motion and the last linear motion the rms errors of the bc become relatively large due to the uncertainties in the nominal model whereas those of the bctde approach near zero more than 89 of rms errors are reduced in comparison with the bc the results show that the tde estimates accurately the vehicle dynamics including uncertainties figs 8 13 show the simulation results of the case where non zero sea currents and external disturbances are applied as shown in figs 8 12 the tracking errors in x y directions are converged asymptotically from figs 10 and 12 whereas one can find that the tracking errors of u r ψ become large in some cases it is because in the both controllers designed based on back stepping control u e r e and ψ e are to designed to converge to their own desired values according to the unmatched disturbances table 2 shows the rms errors for each motion from table 2 one can observe that the bctde during the 8 motion and the last linear motion has dramatically small tracking errors in comparison with the bc more than 98 of rms errors are reduced it is because the bc cannot compensate for the effects of sea currents and external disturbances whereas in the case of bctde those external effects are compensated by the tde note that the tde in 28 and 29 an indirect estimation technique using the previous information of system inputs and outputs can estimate any dynamics which affects to the system outputs including sea currents and external disturbances as presented in tables 1 2 and figs 6 and 12 the proposed controller has robust and accurate tracking performance against model uncertainties disturbing forces and sea currents accurate tracking of vehicles is crucial in various applications including inspections of subsea pipelines underwater structures ocean accidents and so on sahoo et al 2019 especially there are some tasks that require highly accurate tracking e g underwater docking to a subsea station or submarines teo et al 2012 of which success rate is expected to rise when the proposed controller is utilized 5 conclusion in this paper a robust trajectory tracking controller using the bc and the tde was proposed for the torpedo like underactuated auvs at first it was shown that using appropriate coordinate transform the tracking error dynamics of the vehicle having nonholonomic constraint can be expressed in the strict feedback form based on the error dynamics a tracking controller was designed using the back stepping approach which is an effective method to compensate for unmatched disturbances to estimate the vehicle dynamics and the unmatched disturbances the tde was adopted the tde provides an efficient and effective method to estimate the dynamics indirectly using previous system inputs and outputs owing simplicity of the tde the proposed controller can be designed by determining the control gains only not requiring whole vehicle dynamics by investigating the dynamics of the model estimation errors and the tracking errors the stability of the proposed controller was analyzed based on the results the guidelines for the control gains selection were addressed through the simulation results using remus model the tracking performance of the proposed controller was compared with the bc using the nominal vehicle model the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller has accurate and robust tracking performance under modeling uncertainties and external disturbances thanks to its simple and effective compensation based on the tde while the paper addresses the control of surface motion of vehicles for the application of the proposed controller to actual systems including underactuated auvs its extension to space motion is inevitable it will involve the control of heave and pitch motion resulting in a high dof system although such involvement increases the complexity of the equations their derivations will be straight forward because the formulations described in the paper can be applied regardless of the dof of the systems for example the design process of the bc can straight forwardly apply to high dof error dynamics in the strict feedback form khalil 2002 krstic et al 1995 while the dynamic compensator using the tde can be easily designed in high dof systems expressed by strict feedback form as proposed in this paper as future works in this context the extension of the proposed controller in space motion will be studied then the controller proposed in this paper and the extended version will be verified through experiments in order to examine applicability of the controllers in actual vehicle currently an auv platform is under development and the experimental verifications will be performed in a few months credit authorship contribution statement gun rae cho

21994,in the paper a robust controller using the back stepping approach and the time delay estimation tde is proposed for the trajectory tracking of torpedo shape autonomous underwater vehicles auvs the auv has several difficult issues to design accurate tracking control unsatisfaction of matching condition and highly nonlinear dynamics including external disturbances to overcome the matching condition issues the proposed controller is designed based on the back stepping approach which is a well known method handling unmatched disturbances effectively and having well established design procedure to estimate nonlinear vehicle dynamics including sea currents and external disturbances the tde an efficient estimation method using previous system information is adopted owing simplicity of the tde the proposed controller does not need whole vehicle dynamics while requiring only the determination of control gains the stability analysis of the proposed controller is studied conducting the guidelines for selection of control gains through the simulation results using remus model it is demonstrated that the proposed controller has accurate and robust tracking performance even when a vehicle moves under sea currents and external disturbing forces graphical abstract keywords back stepping control time delay estimation autonomous underwater vehicle auv trajectory tracking robust control 1 introduction nowadays torpedo type autonomous underwater vehicles auvs have been used intensively for exploring the subsea world peymani and fossen 2015 sahoo et al 2019 as explained in li and lee 2009 however it is not easy to design a trajectory tracking controller for auvs because the vehicles have only three control inputs surge force pitch and yaw moment for six degree of freedom dof motion due to the lack of control inputs one cannot control every state variables directly the vehicles have nonholonomic constraints between state variables the effects of disturbances on the uncontrollable states or conditions are not easy to be compensated either and the system does not satisfy so called matching condition khalil 2002 the nonlinear vehicle dynamics induces another difficulty to design the controller because the vehicle dynamics involves not only the rigid dynamics but also hydraulic dynamics it is time consuming to get dynamic model and to estimate the dynamic model coefficients moreover there are external disturbances as sea currents which are not easy to be measured accurately thus model based controllers are easy to suffer performance degradation caused by the modeling error since last couple of decades there have been several research works to design trajectory tracking controller for auvs many of the works employed the back stepping controller bc to resolve the matching condition problem li and lee 2009 repoulias and papadopoulos 2007 liang et al 2017 juan et al 2015 there are several research works to overcome underactuated characteristics by using hierarchical design of controller e g feedback design of desired velocity and terminal sliding mode control elmokadem et al 2017 guidance and fuzzy control yu et al 2017 lapierre and soetanto 2007 shows that the concurrent feedback design of dynamic control and target position update can vanish tracking error in the liapunov sense by designing kinematics level controller with consideration of underactuated problem the approaches tried to decouple the matching condition issue from dynamics controller design nowadays the research works tend to be focused on the robustness against dynamic modeling errors or external disturbances there are several research works employing the sliding mode control smc in xu et al 2015 and karkoub et al 2017 the bc and the smc are employed to obtain robustness against systematic uncertainties and external disturbances yang et al 2019 proposes finite time controller by applying nonsingular fast terminal smc elmokadem et al 2019 applied the smc on dynamics positioning problem and way point tracking problem under disturbed environments yan et al 2019 utilized the adaptive neural network and the smc to improve robustness against disturbances in many research works adaptive control scheme was used to resolve model uncertainties and external disturbances tabataba i nasab et al 2019 li et al 2019 in wang et al 2018 the neural networks and the adaptive control are combined for the robust path following in liu et al 2019 and xia et al 2019 adaptive line of sight was suggested for robust way point tracking neural network based approaches are also studied for the robustness tracking of the vehicle elhaki and shojaei 2018 shojaei and arefi 2015 zheng et al 2019 another research works tried to resolve the robust tracking problem combination of bio inspired velocity control and adaptive smc jiang et al 2018 ocean current observer liang et al 2018 extended state observer peng et al 2018 fuzzy adaptive command filtered bc wang et al 2019 adaptive nussbaum function based control wadi et al 2019 li et al 2018 handles stabilization of the vehicles in three dimensional motion by analyzing the nonlinear dynamics in yan and yu 2018 quantization error problem during measuring state and transmitting control signals to the actuators was resolved by introducing the bound of quantization error into the switching terms of the sliding mode control yet these controllers required substantial computational time due to relatively complex derivations and decision making process moreover most of research works require the vehicle model it is burden and time consuming process to identify the dynamic model parameters in this paper a trajectory tracking control scheme named as the back stepping control with time delay estimation bctde for horizontal plane motion of the vehicles is proposed first it is shown that the tracking error dynamics of the vehicles having nonholonomic constraint can be arranged into strict feedback form using the error dynamics the bc is designed to overcome the matching condition issue for the robustness against nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances the time delay estimation tde is adopted the tde is simple and effective scheme to estimate nonlinear dynamics indirectly by utilizing previous system inputs and outputs youcef toumi and ito 1990 hsia and gao 1990 cho et al 2009 thus the proposed controller can be designed without knowing whole vehicle model and is relatively easy to be applied the performance of the tde for auv systems has been verified through several applications kumar et al 2007 2009 kim et al 2016 in those applications however the vehicles have thrusters for every dof and do not suffer nonholonomic constraint issue or matching condition problem which are treated in this paper the stability of the proposed controller is also discussed by analyzing the tracking error dynamics and the model estimation errors based on the stability analysis results the characteristics of the closed loop system an error dynamics including the tde error and tuning guideline of control gains are addressed the tracking performance of the proposed controller is demonstrated through numerical simulations using remus model 2 controller design for auv 2 1 motion governing equations of auv for the simplicity let us consider the control problem of the vehicles having three dof surge sway yaw motion in xy plane fig 1 shows the conceptual diagram including coordinate systems the dynamics of the vehicles in horizontal plane is described as follows fossen 1994 1 m ν c ν d ν g d o s τ τ e where ν u v r t denotes a vector of the velocities surge sway yaw in body fixed coordinate b m m r b m a with m r b inertia matrix of rigid body dynamics and m a added inertia matrix due to hydrodynamics c c r b c a with c r b rigid body coriolis and centripetal matrix and c a hydrodynamic coriolis and centripetal matrix d damping matrix g restoring forces τ control inputs τ e environmental disturbances d o s coupled dynamics with other states heave roll pitch the detailed dynamics description of the auvs especially for the case of remus can be found in prestero 2001 note that in 1 we only take into account the states in horizontal plane as states to be controlled and dynamics due to the other states d o s is assumed to be negligible the control input τ for horizontal plane are generated by thrusting force and rudder and can be described as follow 2 τ τ u τ v τ r x p r o p y u u δ r u 2 δ r n u u δ r u 2 δ r where x p r o p denotes thrusting force δ r rudder angle y u u δ r and n u u δ r are coefficients for sway force and yaw moment due to the rudder angle note that in 2 the rudder angle δ r decides the two control inputs τ v and τ r it means that τ v and τ r cannot be determined independently if τ r is designed to control r τ v is determined accordingly and vice versa commonly the motion of rudder is used to control yaw angle of the vehicle in the case the control input can be divided as follows 3 τ τ u 0 τ r τ c 0 τ v 0 τ d where τ c denotes available control input τ d the control input which is treated as disturbance note that from 1 and 3 only two independent control input variables τ u and τ r are available for the three independent state variables u v r finally we can rearrange the vehicle dynamics in horizontal plane as follows 4 m u m v m r m u v r ν n u n v n r n τ u 0 τ r τ c τ e u τ e v τ e r τ e where m u m v m r are 1 3 vectors of inertia matrix n c ν d ν g d o s τ d note that the state variable u and r are controllable with individual input by introducing positive constants m u and m r the dynamics of those variables can be represented as follows 5 m u u h u τ u m r r h r τ r where m u and m r are the gains which represent as known ranges of inertia h u and h r are nonlinear terms defined as 6 h u m u ν m u u n u τ e u h r m r ν m r r n r τ e r the kinematics of the vehicles can be expressed as following li and lee 2009 7 x y ψ c ψ 0 s ψ 0 0 1 u r s ψ c ψ 0 v v c x v c y 0 where x y ψ denote the position state variables of auv in world coordinate w v c x and v c y sea currents in x and y direction respectively c cos and s sin note that in the rhs of 7 the term related on v is described separately it is because as shown in 4 there is no independent control input for v thus the effect of v can be treated as a disturbance in the vehicle kinematics the motion governing equations of the vehicles in 4 and 7 reveal several issues which are hard to be dealt with for controller design the issues can be addressed as the following three aspects matching condition issue if uncertain terms enter the state equation at the same point as the control input the state equation satisfies the matching condition khalil 2002 in the vehicle dynamics in 4 however the lack of independent control input violates the matching condition the state equation related on v includes uncertain terms but there is not any independent control input to compensate such uncertainties as a result the state v cannot be controlled directly and can be drifted by following the motion governing equation nonholonomic constraint issue as shown in 7 only two state variables u and r can be utilized to determine the three state variables x y ψ in w thus the states x y and ψ cannot be determined independently and there exists a constraint among the states by ignoring the effect of the lateral motion and sea currents one can find the constraint easily from 7 as x 2 y 2 u 2 moreover the states are affected by v which acts like a disturbance because of the lack of matching condition v is hard to be controlled directly while disturbing the states x and y in w to be determined in the desired position nonlinear dynamics issue like other underwater vehicles auvs have highly nonlinear dynamics as explained in 1 the vehicle dynamics includes not only rigid body dynamics but also hydrodynamics moreover the dynamics of each state is strongly coupled to each other as a result it is hard and time consuming to identify the mathematical model of dynamics as well as essential coefficients for the model practically the modeling error is unavoidable and may degrade tracking performance when the controller is designed based on the model that is not perfect 2 2 problem definition due to the underactuated characteristics only two trajectory variables in the plane having three dofs can be designed independently we can set the independent trajectory variables as x y in w the trajectories can be given as the following continuous time functions 8 x d x d t y d y d t as illustrated in fig 1 the desired yaw angle ψ d in w is dependently derived from 8 as follows 9 ψ d a t a n 2 y d x d from 8 and 9 regarding 7 the desired trajectories for the state variables in b are given as follows 1 1 note that ψ d d d t a t a n 2 y d x d y d x d 2 y d 2 x d x d x d 2 y d 2 y d 10 u d x d 2 y d 2 r d ψ d note that the derivatives of the desired trajectories in 8 satisfying 9 and 10 are given as follows 11 x d u d c ψ d y d u d s ψ d the tracking problem to be treated in the paper is to design a controller for a auv system expressed in 4 and 7 so as to track the desired trajectories in 8 10 in details the tracking error along x d and y d are firstly dealt with by using the control input τ c note that if there are lateral disturbances like sea currents the yaw angle error may be required intentionally to generate lateral force for overcoming the disturbances 2 3 error dynamics formulation in the subsection the tracking error dynamics of the vehicle having nonholonomic constraint is arranged as strict feedback form in the desired trajectory coordinate d the coordinate d is a moving coordinate which follows the desired trajectory as shown in fig 1 the origin of d is x d y d and the rotation angle of d with respect to w is ψ d by describing the error dynamics in d one can attenuate the relationship changes between variables in different coordinates xia et al 2019 peng et al 2018 if there is no tracking error u affects d x for every ψ the transform can be easily accomplished as follows craig 1989 12 d x d y t w d r x y t w d r x d y d t where w d r denotes the rotation matrix of w with respect to d which is obtained as 13 w d r d w r t c ψ d s ψ d s ψ d c ψ d by using 12 the desired trajectories in 8 can be transformed to those in d as follows 14 d x d d y d 0 note that the tracking problem in d is identical with that in w it is because the convergence of the tracking error in d guarantees that in w from 12 and 14 one can obtain the following relationship 15 d x e d y e t w d r x e y e t where e d note that w d r is a rotation matrix which cannot be singular thus the convergence of the tracking errors in d guarantees that in w which can be easily shown by using the norm operation as follows 16 x e y e w d r t d x e d y e d w r d x e d y e using the desired trajectories and motion governing equations given in sections 2 1 2 2 and the coordinate transform in 12 one can derive the error dynamics of auv as a strict feedback form lemma 1 let us consider the auv system of which the motion governing equations are given in 4 7 and 12 let the desired trajectories for the auv be given as 14 10 and 11 then the error dynamics of the vehicle can be expressed as the following strict feedback form 17 d x e α u u e λ x u e u d m u 1 h u m u 1 τ u and 18 d y e α ψ ψ e λ y ψ e r e r e r d m r 1 h r m r 1 τ r where 19 λ x u d c ψ e u α u u e d y e r d s ψ e v c ψ d v c x s ψ d v c y λ y u s ψ e α ψ ψ e d x e r d c ψ e v s ψ d v c x c ψ d v c y and α u and α ψ are positive constants proof see appendix a 2 4 design of back stepping controller as shown in 17 and 18 the error dynamics of the vehicle is represented in the strict feedback form thus the controller can be designed based on the back stepping approach the design procedure of the back stepping control is straight forward in the liapunov sense khalil 2002 krstic et al 1995 the design results are arranged in the following theorem theorem 1 let us consider the auv system having error dynamics in 17 and 18 let the back stepping controller for the vehicle be designed as follows 20 τ u h u m u η u 21 τ r h r m r η r where 22 η u α u 1 α u u d λ x k x d x e d x e k u u e η r α ψ 1 α ψ r d λ y k y d y e d y e k ψ ψ e ψ e k r r e and 23 u e α u u e d u e ψ e α ψ ψ e d ψ e r e α ψ r e d r e and 24 u e d α u 1 λ x k x d x e ψ e d α ψ 1 λ y k y d y e r e d α ψ 1 λ y k y d y e d y e k ψ ψ e and denotes the estimated value of k x k u k y k ψ k r 0 the control gains let us set the liapuov function as follows 25 v x 1 2 d x e 2 1 2 u e 2 v y 1 2 d y e 2 1 2 ψ e 2 1 2 r e 2 assume that there is no modeling error i e then the derivatives of the liapunov functions are derived as the following negative definite forms 26 v x k x d x e 2 k u u e 2 v y k y d y e 2 k ψ ψ e 2 k r r e 2 proof see appendix b note that the stability analysis with the liapunov functions in 25 guarantees the asymptotic convergence of d x e and d y e but not that of u e ψ e and r e instead the convergence of u e ψ e and r e is guaranteed it means that u e ψ e and r e are converged to u e d ψ e d and r e d which are the fictitious control inputs of the bc as given in 24 as explained in section 2 2 it is desirable result to accomplish the goal of the paper to reduce the tracking error of d x and d y or x and y it is because the fictitious control inputs are designed to compensate the unmatched disturbances when the controlled system stays at steady state i e v x v y 0 in 26 and accordingly v x v y 0 in 25 the fictitious inputs in 24 are derived as follows 27 u e d v x 0 α u 1 λ x ψ e d v y 0 α ψ 1 λ y r e d v y 0 α ψ 1 λ y note that u e d and ψ e d in 27 are converged to the estimates of the unmatched disturbances λ x of d x e dynamics in 17 and λ y of d y e dynamics in 18 respectively if there is no unmatched disturbance the fictitious control inputs in 27 are converged to zero i e u e ψ e r e 0 at steady state and the states u ψ r are converged to their desired values in 9 and 10 if there are non zero unmatched disturbances whereas u e ψ e r e are converged to estimated values of the unmatched disturbances to compensate for the effect of the disturbances in the dynamics of d x e and d y e 2 5 time delay estimation to implement the controller in theorem 1 one needs to obtain h u and h r the estimated values of 6 and λ x and λ y those of 19 for robust and efficient estimation we employ the tde youcef toumi and ito 1990 hsia and gao 1990 cho et al 2009 the key idea behind the tde is that if the system dynamics is given as a continuous or piece wise continuous function the variation of the dynamics during very short time can be negligible thus the value of the dynamics in the current time can be estimated by using that in short time before based on the idea the system dynamics can be estimated indirectly by utilizing previous information of system input and output from 5 the dynamics can be estimated as follows 28 h u t h u t l τ u t l m u u t l h r t h r t l τ r t l m r r t l where l denotes short time delay which is commonly set as the sampling time of the control system the unmatched dynamics in 19 can be also estimated by using the tde from the first equation of 17 and the first equation of 18 one can obtain the estimated values as follows 29 λ x t λ x t l d x e t l α u u e t l λ y t λ y t l d y e t l α ψ ψ e t l by applying 28 into 20 and 21 the final form of the proposed controller named the back stepping control with time delay estimation bctde is obtained as follows 30 τ u τ u t l m u u t l m u η u τ r τ r t l m r r t l m r η r where η u and η r are described in 22 with 23 24 and 29 note that λ in 22 and 24 can be obtained by the tde in 29 in 22 and 24 the derivatives of λ are also included which can be obtained practically by applying numerical differentiation e g euler backward method chapra and canale 1998 t t t l l in the proposed controller the nonholonomic constraint issue and the matching condition issue are handled by the back stepping approach the nonlinear dynamics issue is overcome by the tde note that the tde does not require whole model of the vehicle dynamics one can design the proposed controller by only choosing the inertial gains m u m r α u and α ψ and the feedback gains k x k u k y k ψ and k r 3 analysis of proposed controller if there is no modeling error i e the proposed controller is asymptotically stable in the liapunov sense if there is modeling error however the stability and the performance can be degraded due to the modeling error by removing the assumption of and by following the procedure in proof of theorem 1 one can derive the derivatives of the liapunov function in 25 as the following form including modeling errors 31 v x k x d x e 2 k u u e 2 d x e ϵ λ x u e ϵ h u v y k y d y e 2 k ψ ψ e 2 k r r e 2 d y e ϵ λ y r e ϵ h r where 32 ϵ λ x λ x λ x ϵ h u α u m u 1 h u h u ϵ λ y λ y λ y ϵ h r α ψ m r 1 h r h r from 31 one can recognize that the derivatives of the liapunov functions may not be negative definite due to the modeling errors in the section thus the stability of the proposed controller is analyzed by investigating the tracking error dynamics containing the modeling errors ϵ λ x ϵ h u ϵ λ y and ϵ h r 3 1 stability analysis as explained in 31 stability of the proposed controller is dependent on the dynamics of the modeling errors for the stability analysis thus the dynamics of the modeling errors are investigated of which the results are arranged as follows lemma 2 let us consider that the auv system in 4 is controlled by the bctde in 20 21 with 23 28 and 29 to track the desired trajectories in 8 then the dynamics of the modeling errors is obtained as follows 33 ϵ h u t 1 m u t 1 m u ϵ h u t l γ h u 1 t γ h u 2 t w h e r e γ h u 1

l c y t c y t l u t u t l ψ e t l proof see appendix c by using the result of lemma 2 and by investigating the relationship between the tracking error and the modeling error the stability condition of the proposed controller is analyzed the main result of the stability analysis is arranged as the following theorem theorem 2 let us consider that the auv system having error dynamics in 17 and 18 is controlled by the bctde in 20 21 with 23 28 and 29 then the dynamics of the tracking errors is obtained as follows 37 d x e u e k x 1 1 k u a x d x e u e ϵ λ x ϵ h u 38 d y e ψ e r e k y 1 0 1 k ψ 1 0 1 k r a y d y e ψ e r e ϵ λ y 0 ϵ h r for the stability assume that the forcing functions γ in 33 36 are bounded then the tracking errors are bounded if the matrices a x and a y are hurwitz and the following conditions are satisfied 39 1 m u t 1 m u 1 40 1 α u 1 c ψ e t 1 41 1 m r t 1 m r 1 42 1 α ψ 1 u t 1 proof see appendix d remark when the sampling time l is sufficiently short the assumption of the boundedness of γ can be accepted in the practical manner it is because λ include the dynamic variation during a sampling time and the vehicle has continuous or piecewise continuous dynamics fossen 1994 of which variation during a sampling time can be bounded if l 0 jin et al 2009 when the sampling time is relatively long however the boundedness of γ may not be guaranteed in such case the proposed conditions 39 42 are not sufficient for the stability and rigorous stability analysis with consideration of finite sampling time is required jung et al 2011 investigated the stability of the time delay control a controller using the tde including the sampling time and their results can apply for the extended stability of the proposed controller in this paper however we deal with conservative stability analysis as the paper focuses on the controller design and the demonstration of its performance 3 2 control gain selection the proposed controller in 20 and 21 with 22 23 24 28 and 29 can be designed by choosing inertial gains m u m r α u and α ψ and the feedback gains k u k x k r k ψ and k y the result of theorem 2 can be utilized to design the gains the feedback gains can be designed by using the hurwitz condition of a x and a y in 37 and 38 as shown in 37 and 38 the dynamics of the tracking error are determined by the gains k only thus one can make a x and a y hurwitz by adjusting the gains in details characteristic equations can be obtained from 37 and 38 as follows 43 s i a x s 2 k x k u s k x k u 1 s i a y s 3 k y k ψ k r s 2 k y k ψ k ψ k r k r k y 2 s k y k ψ k r k y k r where s denotes the laplace operator by choosing k appropriately one can locate all poles of 43 in the left half plane lhp when choosing k x 5 0 k u 0 1 k y 1 0 k ψ 5 0 and k r 0 2 for example the poles for a x are located in s x 4 79 0 31 and those for a y are s y 4 48 1 36 0 36 which are all in the lhp the inertial gains can be designed by using the stability condition in 39 42 which can be rearranged as the following corollary corollary 1 for the gains m u m r α u and α ψ 0 the conditions satisfying 39 42 are rearranged as follows 44 f o r m u m u 2 m u t 45 f o r m r m r 2 m r t 46 f o r α u α u 1 2 c ψ e t 47 f o r α ψ α ψ 1 2 u t 48 o t h e r s u t 0 49 c ψ e t 0 o r π 2 2 n π ψ e t π 2 2 n π proof see appendix e the inertial gains m u m r α u and α ψ have to be designed to satisfy the conditions in corollary 1 note that the conditions for m u and m r include the parameters of the vehicle dynamics which are not easy to be identified if the real values of the dynamic parameters are not available m u and m r can be tuned by trial and error by following the gain tuning guidelines of the time delay control to increase gradually from a small value until satisfactory performance obtained chang and jung 2009 cho et al 2009 by following aforementioned design procedure one can design the proposed controller by tuning only the gains without any information of the vehicle dynamics the procedure is relatively easy in comparison with those of the conventional schemes e g pid control needs to tune three gains for each actuation axis and the computed torque control needs a whole model of the system dynamics remark the stability conditions in corollary 1 also include the vehicle status conditions for the stability in details 48 means that the vehicle should move forward to guarantee the stability the condition is physically reasonable because if the vehicle moves backward the direction of control input due to rudder angle should be reversed thus the controller cannot generate the control input to appropriate direction the condition in 49 can be accepted by similar physical reason if the heading error ψ e t exceeds π 2 or π 2 in negative direction the vehicle should be headed opposite direction with the desired trajectory in the case the directions between the control inputs and the tracking errors are reversed it means that although the controller calculates the control inputs to reduce the tracking errors in reality the generated control inputs increase tracking errors 4 simulation in the section the performance of the proposed controller is verified through the simulation study the purpose of the simulation is to verify tracking performance along time varying trajectory under disturbed environments two types of disturbances are included sea currents in velocity level and external disturbances in force level the performance of the proposed controller bctde is compared with the bc using the explicit nominal model the bc is designed as 20 and 21 with 23 and 24 which is the same as the back stepping control part of the proposed controller differently from the proposed controller the dynamic models for the bc are estimated based on 6 and 19 as follows 50 h u m u ν m u u n u h r m r ν m r r n r λ x u d c ψ e u α u u e d y e r d s ψ e v λ y u s ψ e α ψ ψ e d x e r d c ψ e v where m u n u m r and n r denote nominal models of m u n u m r and n r respectively for the bc it is assumed that the sea currents and the external disturbances are not measurable the assumption is reasonable because there is seldom method to measure the external effects note that in the nominal models in 50 the effects of external disturbance and sea currents are omitted the model of remus in xy plane is used for the simulation prestero 2001 the coefficients of nominal models for the bc are set as the values in prestero 2001 and uncertainties in the dynamic coefficients for vehicle simulation are set randomly under 10 of each nominal value as shown in fig 2 the desired trajectory is set as combination of linear motion and 8 motion with constant velocity of u d 1 0 m s linear motion during 0 t 50 s 8 motion during 50 s t 250 s and linear motion again during 250 s t 300 s the feedback gains for the both controllers are designed as k x 5 0 k u 0 1 k y 1 0 k ψ 5 0 k r 0 1 to make a x and a y in 37 hurwitz in the case the poles for a x are s x 4 79 0 31 and those for a y are s y 4 49 1 35 0 26 which are all in the lhp the inertial gains are set as m u 10 0 kg m r m r n u u δ r u 2 0 5 s 2 α u 1 0 α ψ 1 0 m s by tuning the control input saturation for x p r o p and δ r in 2 is set as 0 x p r o p 9 25 n and 13 6 deg δ r 13 6 deg as described in prestero 2001 to compare the performance against disturbances two cases of simulation are performed in the first case the sea currents and external disturbances are set as zero in the other case the sea currents in 7 are set as v c x v c m a x 2 v c y v c m a x 2 where v c m a x 0 2 m s and the external disturbing forces in 4 are set as τ e u τ e m a x sin 2 π ω t 2 τ e v τ e m a x cos 2 π ω t 2 and τ e r 0 where τ e m a x 2 n and ω 0 05 hz in the both cases the initial errors are set as x 0 y 0 ψ 0 t 0 m 0 m 60 deg t figs 2 7 show the simulation results of the case where zero sea currents and external disturbances are applied as shown in figs 2 6 the responses of the both controllers converge to the desired trajectory asymptotically which means that the both controllers successfully compensate for the initial error in table 1 the rms errors are arranged separately according to motion types the first linear motion during 0 t 50 s the 8 motion during 50 s t 250 s and the last linear motion during 250 s t 300 s table 1 shows that in the first linear motion the both controller has similar rms errors which is because the both controllers has large tracking errors due to the initial errors in the 8 motion and the last linear motion the rms errors of the bc become relatively large due to the uncertainties in the nominal model whereas those of the bctde approach near zero more than 89 of rms errors are reduced in comparison with the bc the results show that the tde estimates accurately the vehicle dynamics including uncertainties figs 8 13 show the simulation results of the case where non zero sea currents and external disturbances are applied as shown in figs 8 12 the tracking errors in x y directions are converged asymptotically from figs 10 and 12 whereas one can find that the tracking errors of u r ψ become large in some cases it is because in the both controllers designed based on back stepping control u e r e and ψ e are to designed to converge to their own desired values according to the unmatched disturbances table 2 shows the rms errors for each motion from table 2 one can observe that the bctde during the 8 motion and the last linear motion has dramatically small tracking errors in comparison with the bc more than 98 of rms errors are reduced it is because the bc cannot compensate for the effects of sea currents and external disturbances whereas in the case of bctde those external effects are compensated by the tde note that the tde in 28 and 29 an indirect estimation technique using the previous information of system inputs and outputs can estimate any dynamics which affects to the system outputs including sea currents and external disturbances as presented in tables 1 2 and figs 6 and 12 the proposed controller has robust and accurate tracking performance against model uncertainties disturbing forces and sea currents accurate tracking of vehicles is crucial in various applications including inspections of subsea pipelines underwater structures ocean accidents and so on sahoo et al 2019 especially there are some tasks that require highly accurate tracking e g underwater docking to a subsea station or submarines teo et al 2012 of which success rate is expected to rise when the proposed controller is utilized 5 conclusion in this paper a robust trajectory tracking controller using the bc and the tde was proposed for the torpedo like underactuated auvs at first it was shown that using appropriate coordinate transform the tracking error dynamics of the vehicle having nonholonomic constraint can be expressed in the strict feedback form based on the error dynamics a tracking controller was designed using the back stepping approach which is an effective method to compensate for unmatched disturbances to estimate the vehicle dynamics and the unmatched disturbances the tde was adopted the tde provides an efficient and effective method to estimate the dynamics indirectly using previous system inputs and outputs owing simplicity of the tde the proposed controller can be designed by determining the control gains only not requiring whole vehicle dynamics by investigating the dynamics of the model estimation errors and the tracking errors the stability of the proposed controller was analyzed based on the results the guidelines for the control gains selection were addressed through the simulation results using remus model the tracking performance of the proposed controller was compared with the bc using the nominal vehicle model the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller has accurate and robust tracking performance under modeling uncertainties and external disturbances thanks to its simple and effective compensation based on the tde while the paper addresses the control of surface motion of vehicles for the application of the proposed controller to actual systems including underactuated auvs its extension to space motion is inevitable it will involve the control of heave and pitch motion resulting in a high dof system although such involvement increases the complexity of the equations their derivations will be straight forward because the formulations described in the paper can be applied regardless of the dof of the systems for example the design process of the bc can straight forwardly apply to high dof error dynamics in the strict feedback form khalil 2002 krstic et al 1995 while the dynamic compensator using the tde can be easily designed in high dof systems expressed by strict feedback form as proposed in this paper as future works in this context the extension of the proposed controller in space motion will be studied then the controller proposed in this paper and the extended version will be verified through experiments in order to examine applicability of the controllers in actual vehicle currently an auv platform is under development and the experimental verifications will be performed in a few months credit authorship contribution statement gun rae cho
