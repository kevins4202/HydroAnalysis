8185,study region canadian prairies northern ontario and atlantic canada study focus a method has been developed to evaluate the reservoir volumes based on the concept of drought magnitude dm using annual as well as monthly flow sequences across canada the dm based storage volumes have been evaluated using the standardized annual and monthly flow sequences termed as the standardized hydrological index shi and compared with estimates using the sequent peak algorithm spa utilizing non standardized flow sequences at varying draft levels new hydrological insights for the region it was found that at the annual scale 1μ mean annual flow level of the draft in shi dm based procedure sequences yielded nearly 54 of the reservoir volume based on spa this volume was considered as an adequate estimate of storage as it corresponded to 96 μ of the draft level in terms of spa at the monthly scale and for the variable mean monthly levels of the draft shi sequences yielded reservoir volumes close to 27 of spa at the draft of 1 μ therefore ma3 moving average of consecutive 3 shi values was invoked to ramp up the monthly volume to the level of the annual volume of 54 introducing the ma smoothing concept in the dm based procedure for the estimation of reservoir volumes at the monthly scale is the main contribution of the study keywords draft level drought magnitude extreme number theorem markov chain moving average ma smoothing reservoir volume sequent peak algorithm spa standardized hydrological index shi 1 introduction sizing a reservoir behind a dam is an important hydrological problem and has attracted the attention of hydrologists and water resources engineers since the pioneering work of rippl 1883 rippl graphical procedure since then has been improvised through sequent peak algorithm spa which was first devised by thomas and burden 1963 the spa has been continually refined and is well documented in journal papers parks and gustard 1982 lele 1987 and hydrologic and water resources engineering books mcmahon and mein 1978 loucks et al 1981 mcmahon and mein 1986 linsley et al 1992 mcmahon and adeloye 2005 the spa is widely used for the design of reservoirs and its computational versions such as mass curve residual mass curve methods can easily be programmed in modern day personal computers the river flows chiefly annual flow data and at times monthly flow data at the site of a dam are used in such analyses for estimating design volumes of the reservoir size phien 1993 adeloye et al 2003 mcmahon et al 2007 in tandem with the use of river flow data the hydrological drought analyses have been the subject of considerable investigations since the 1970s with the pioneering work of millan and yevjevich 1971 and salazar and yevjevich 1975 two main parameters of the hydrological drought viz the duration length l and the magnitude m also termed as severity have been the focus of interest the modelling activity has primarily been focused on drought lengths with a less noticeable thrust towards the magnitude severity aspect which is in a true sense of greater importance in terms of management of river waters and consequently to sizing and operation of reservoirs built across rivers a major contribution in the area of drought modelling was made by dracup et al 1980a 1980b in which a linkage relationship was suggested between severity and drought length through the relationship severity magnitude length over the years there has been a change in the nomenclature of terms severity and magnitude in which severity is replaced by magnitude and magnitude by intensity sharma and panu 2013 this new nomenclature has been widely accepted and is reflected in a majority of research papers that have been presently appearing in professional journals sharma and panu 2013 2014 the research work on modelling of the drought magnitude was enhanced by sen 1980 zelenhasic and salvai 1987 guven 1983 sharma 1997 kendall and dracup 1992 tallaksen et al 1997 tallaksen and van lenen 2004 salas et al 2005 sharma and panu 2010 2013 2014 akyuz et al 2012 among others adopting the linkage relationship advanced by dracup et al 1980a 1980b sharma and panu 2013 2014 have used a simple model for predicting the drought magnitude by coupling it with the drought length through a third parameter namely the drought intensity and thus drought magnitude m drought intensity i drought duration l they have carried out analyses by standardizing the flow sequences in the respective time scales annual monthly and weekly which are named shi standardized hydrological index sequences in brief shi is an entity with a mean equal to zero and a standard deviation equal to 1 while retaining the probabilistic structure of the flow sequence under consideration the use of shi has performed well in modelling the drought length and magnitude on canadian river flow sequences at the annual monthly and weekly time scales sharma and panu 2010 2014 despite a large number of research efforts on the hydrologic drought models very few studies such as by sharma and panu 2020 have endeavoured to link the drought magnitude with the reservoir volume vr determined using the spa based analysis the focus of this study is to present a comparative assessment of the drought magnitude dm based approach to the spa to evaluate the reservoir size while using annual and monthly flow sequences from rivers across canada the spa has been chosen as the standard reference as it is widely used for calculations of the reservoir volumes and comparing with other estimates mcmahon et al 2007 adeloye et al 2003 the familiarity of the spa is well evidenced by its inscription in the textbooks on water resources engineering loucks et al 1981 linsley et al 1992 and popular books on reservoir storage and yield mcmahon and mein 1978 1986 mcmahon and adeloye 2005 the demand or the draft level has been set equal to the respective mean flows in terms of the shi month by month standardization sequences at the monthly scale as it is statistically tractable however at the annual scale the draft levels other than the mean level can also be treated statistically because of the approximate stationary nature of river flow sequences the draft levels are expressed as the ratio α to the mean annual flow maf level such as 90 0 9μ 75 60 etc where μ is the mean annual flow it should be borne in mind that μ has the same value at the annual or monthly overall mean scales however at the monthly scale the draft levels are expressed as αμm where μm is the mean flow of individual month with subscript m ranging from 1 to 12 2 sequent peak algorithm spa and drought magnitude dm based procedures the most popular method for sizing reservoirs is the spa the method requires historical or synthesized river flow data as inflows and demand or draft levels as outflows and the flow data are analyzed without standardization it means that the computations can proceed on the nonstationary monthly flow sequences in addition to the annual flow sequences which are perceived to be stationary the calculations are conducted numerically using the mass curve or the residual mass curve method involving inflows and demand flows to assess the reservoir volume vr the procedure is fully amenable to computerized computations to arrive at the required vr for a given situation although the spa adores the advantage of treating the stationary and non stationary flow data in a likewise manner it suffers from the disadvantage that no return period can be attached to the estimated vr values for instance in a data set of annual flows of the lepreau river table 1 for 100 years 1919 2018 the vr at 1μ level of the draft was computed as 6 45 108 m3 whereas the estimate based on the 50 years of the sample 1969 2018 turned out to be 7 35 108 m3 this discrepancy can be attributed to the differing estimates of μ mean σ standard deviation and ρ lag 1 autocorrelation in a flow sequence from these samples therefore attaching a return period t 50 or 100 to these estimates is not devoid of uncertainty in the drought magnitude dm based procedure it is imperative that flow sequences must be stationary therefore standardization of the annual and monthly month by month sequences is completed and the resultant sequences are known as shi sequences which turn out to be weakly stationary the second order stationarity at the annual scale the demand is set at 1 μ 0 9 μ 0 8 μ 0 7 μ etc levels to represent the draft the shi sequences are truncated at these draft levels to carry out the analyses in the dm based procedure for example in the case of the bow river table 1 μ 39 10 m3 s and cv 0 13 cv stands for coefficient of variation at the draft corresponding to the mean level draft 1 μ the truncation shi0 level in the shi sequence can be determined by the relationship shi0 αμ μ σ α 1 cv 0 1 1 0 13 where α is the ratio of the draft level to the mean flow μ at the draft equal to 0 90 μ the truncation level shi0 shall turn out as 0 77 0 90 1 0 13 at the monthly scale shi sequences were chopped at shi0 0 to correspond to variable monthly means in original non stationary monthly flows the shi sequence thus obtained has a uniform mean 0 and a standard deviation 1 across the months such a sequence is construed as stationary and is tractable using the known methods of stochastic analysis however at 90 of the respective monthly mean or 0 90 μm there shall emerge 12 values of shi0 to truncate the shi sequence for example in the case of the bow river 3 table 1 at the draft level of 0 90 μm the 12 values of cv are 0 14 0 14 0 12 0 30 0 41 0 25 0 25 0 20 0 19 0 20 0 18 and 0 18 with the corresponding shi0 values as 0 71 0 90 1 0 14 0 71 0 83 0 33 0 24 0 40 0 40 0 50 0 53 0 50 0 56 and 0 56 thus the shi sequence is truncated by the variable shi0 values or a curve vis a vis a horizontal line with shi0 0 for the truncation at 1 μm such a truncation operation represents a complex scenario that is difficult to treat by the known methods of statistical analysis for the estimation of drought magnitude it is further noted that there is a significant variation among the shi0 values so a mean value of shi0 s as a truncation level would hardly justify a reasonable statistical analysis in short at the monthly scale the dm based analysis is tractable at the truncation level equal to 100 of the mean or 1 μm of the individual months only at other levels of truncation representing the draft the dm based analysis for the evaluation of the vr appears to be intractable unlike the annual scale which can handle all the draft levels i e 1 μ 0 9 μ 0 8 μ 0 7 μ because of the stationarity of annual flows the shis below the truncation level shi0 level are referred to as the drought dubbed as d whereas above the level are referred to as the wet dubbed as w in a historical record of n t years there shall emerge several spells of drought and wet conditions and the length of the longest drought spell denoted as lt is of paramount importance it should be noted that subscript t denotes the return period the negative or deficit spikes can be perceived to be drought intensities i and the sum of deficit spikes can be construed as the drought magnitude m the negative values in the longest spell are added to represent the largest drought magnitude mt the sum of the negative values is taken as the absolute value representing mt as a positive quantity the largest deficit volume dt during a drought spell is computed as dt σ mt for the annual flow sequences and dt σav mt for the monthly flow sequences where σav is arithmetic average of 12 monthly σ s it should be noted that the unit of dt is the same as that of σ because mt is a dimensionless entity for example for the bow river at the annual scale there is only one value of σ μ cv such as 1 60 108 m3 year or 5 08 m3 s 39 10 0 13 whereas at the monthly time scale σav is taken as 9 38 m3 s 24 31 106 m3 month as an appropriate value for calculation of vr when lt mt and dt are abstracted from the historical or observed data they are denoted as lt o mt o and dt o i e subscript o stands for the observed the procedure for abstracting the aforesaid entities is named the counting procedure one noteworthy feature of the spa is that it can handle the uniform flow level as the draft across the 12 months for instance if the overall monthly mean flow 1μ or 90 of the overall monthly mean flow 0 9μ is the draft uniformly throughout 12 months then the spa can estimate the vr with no stationarity constraints the dm based procedure handles such scenarios by use of other techniques such as the moving average smoothing of the shi sequences and in turn truncating them at the mean level of individual months 2 1 estimation of deficit volumes dt by the dm based models for a given return period t the longest drought period lt and the corresponding drought magnitude mt can be estimated by the drought models using the historical flow data in the modelling approach the probabilistic relationship for mt can be obtained by applying the extreme number theorem todorovic and woolhiser 1975 sen 1980 one can expect 1 2 3 n drought spells in a period of t year month which are perceived to follow the poisson law of probability each drought spell has a length l equal to 1 2 3 4 year month and the corresponding magnitude m equal to y1 y2 y3 y 4 with y being a non integer variable such as 1 1 4 5 8 8 etc over a period t time units it is imperative to obtain for design purposes the longest drought duration lt and the corresponding largest drought magnitude mt a sample size of t time units year or month t 30 50 100 1000 etc can be regarded equivalent to the return period of t time units sharma and panu 2014 for example in a river with a flow record of 50 years t assumes a value equal to 50 year or 600 month when droughts are being analyzed at the annual or monthly time scales based on the above notions the following probability based relationship from the first principles can be used to estimate the expected value of the largest drought magnitude e mt 1 e m t j 0 m t y j p m t y j the notation p stands for the cumulative probability whereas p stands for the simple probability since mt is a continuous random variable therefore mt has a continuous probability density function pdf so p mt yj can be evaluated as p mt yj 1 p mt yj with mt yj replaced by the mean value yj 1 yj 2 eq 1 can therefore be expressed as 2 e m t j 0 n 1 y j 1 y j 2 p m t y j 1 p m t y j the upper limit of integration in eq 1 is replaced by some finite number n1 the general equation for evaluating p mt yj based on the extreme number theorem sen 1980 can be expressed as 3 p m t y j e x p t q 1 q q 1 p m y j in which m takes on non integer values represented by yj since y s such as y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 correspond to values of m thus the largest of them will correspond to mt it is noted that m is the sum of several drought deficit spikes encountered in a drought spell each has a negative sign because it is derived by truncating shi sequences that lay below negative side of the cutoff level the deficit spikes can be construed to obey a truncated normal distribution which encompasses values of a random variable drought intensity here from to z0 standard normal number thus the standard normal pdf is truncated at various levels of z0 corresponding to counterpart values of the probability q for example a standard normal pdf respectively can be truncated at z0 0 0 and z0 0 52 with the corresponding probability of drought q equal to 0 5 and 0 3 the truncated normal pdf version will have a mean and variance respectively different from 0 and 1 applying the basic axioms for the evaluation of moments expressions for the mean denoted by μd and variance denoted as σ d 2 of the truncated normal pdf version can be deduced sen 1977 sharma 1997 as expressed below 4 μ d exp 0 5 z 0 2 q 2 π z 0 5 σ d 2 1 z 0 exp 0 5 z 0 2 q 2 π exp z 0 2 q 2 2 π because drought episodes lay below i e in the negative domain the desired truncation level therefore an absolute value of the term μd is an estimator of the mean value of drought intensity i as it represents the mean of several deficit spikes likewise the term σ d 2 is an estimator of the variance of drought intensity whose value remains unaffected by the sign for example at the cutoff level corresponding to q equal to 0 5 the value of z0 0 0 and upon substitution of these values in eqs 4 and 5 yield μd equal to 0 80 and σ d 2 equal to 0 36 as explained earlier the absolute value of μd will be taken as the mean value of drought intensity i which in this case equals 0 80 given the central limit theorem and since m is the sum of deficit spikes its probability structure can be approximated by the normal pdf with mean μ m and variance σ m 2 such a consideration reduces the expression for the term p m yj in eq 3 as follows 6 p m y j 1 σ m 2 π 0 y j e x p 0 5 m μ m σ m 2 d m sharma and panu 2013 noted that the parameters μ m and σ m are related to the extreme drought length lt and the mean drought length l m such a representative drought length is named herein as the characteristic drought length lc thus the expressions for μ m and σ m 2 can be shown to be related as follows kotz and neumann 1963 7 μ m l c μ d 8 σ m 2 l c σ d 2 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ l c l c 1 ρ 2 where ρ is the lag 1 autocorrelation in the shi sequence and can be computed using an algorithm cited in haan 1977 the expression for the expected value of lt denoted by e lt of the first order dependence in drought periods can be obtained using the markov chain of order 1 mc1 sharma and panu 2010 as follows 9 e l t 1 l o g f t 1 q q p l o g q q where f is the factor to account for the plotting position in the empirical estimation of the exceedance probability that is in the hazen plotting position formula the exceedance probability 0 5 t t sample size so the return period is equal to t 0 5 2t or f 2 likewise in the weibull plotting position formula f 1 in this analysis the plotting position formula adamowski 1981 developed for the canadian rivers has been used the formula evaluates the exceedance probability 0 75 t 0 25 so f 1 33 1 0 25 t 1 33 as t is generally large the term qq stands for the conditional probability of the present period being drought given the previous period was also a drought and likewise qp stands for the present period being drought given the previous period was wet the simple probabilities of drought q and wet p conditions add to 1 that is q p 1 likewise qq pq 1 pp qp 1 where the conditional probabilities qq and qp can be interpreted in sync with qq and qp for the mc1 situation the mean length e l lm can be expressed sen 1977 as follows 10 e l l m 1 1 q q the conditional probabilities qq and qp can be computed from the following relationship due to cramer and leadbetter 1967 and these terms are elaborated further in sharma and panu 2010 11 q q q 1 2 π q 0 ρ e x p z 0 2 1 ϑ 1 ϑ 2 0 5 d ϑ where ϑ is a dummy variable of integration and ρ is the lag 1 autocorrelation as defined earlier the integral in eq 11 can be evaluated by a numerical procedure and the values of qq for a given ρ and z0 can be computed it is noted that for an independent or random shi sequence qq q eq 11 can also be used to estimate pp by replacing qq by pp and q by p 1 q therefore an estimate of qp can be found as qp 1 pp which can be used in eq 9 for the estimation of the longest drought lengths e lt it should be noted that for the mc0 situation such as the case for annual shi sequences qq qp q the characteristic length lc can be expressed as follows 12 lc ɸ e l 1 ɸ e lt the parameter ɸ can be designated as the weighing parameter as it weighs the mean drought length e l and the longest drought length e lt the value of ɸ varies from 0 to 1 and is determined either through optimization or trial and error procedure once a proper value of lc has been determined the eq 6 is integrated numerically to evaluate p m yj and then the value of integrand is inserted in eq 3 to yield an estimate of p mt yj letting these values of yj as y0 j 0 0 y1 j 1 0 05 y2 j 2 0 10 y3 j 3 0 15 yn1 30 for the annual time scale with an increment δ 0 05 e mt can be computed using eq 3 it is noted that the upper limit of summation n1 will vary from annual to monthly time scales for the annual scale the maximum value of yj 30 was found to be sufficient whereas for the monthly time scale the maximum value of yj 150 was found to be adequate for integration purposes the yj values were broken down into small intervals with a step δ of 0 05 so n1 was found to be 600 30 0 05 at the annual scale and 3000 at the monthly scale the integration of the normal probability function eq 6 is also performed numerically to compute p mt yj 1 mt yj and additional details are presented in sharma and panu 2013 a simplified version for the estimation of e mt can be developed based on the mean of the drought intensity i in combination with eqs 7 and 12 as follows 13 e m t l c μ d from eq 13 it is apparent that e mt is based on the mean μ d of the drought intensity i only and is independent of the variance of drought intensity whereas eq 2 involves both mean and variance of the drought intensity i implicitly for the estimation of e mt in the estimation process the entities e lt e mt and e dt are designated as lt e mt e and dt e respectively in summary the dm based methodology entails the counting and modelling procedures the counting procedure works on the observed historical data of flow sequences without the use of equations or models in the modelling procedure the extreme number theorem and the assumption of a normal pdf of drought magnitudes m the probability based relationships are used to estimate mt e and dt e σav mt e for the monthly time scale or σ mt e for the annual time scale the statistics μ σ ρ in the aforesaid relationships are derived from the historical data on flow sequences at the monthly time scale it was noted by sharma and panu 2013 that in canadian rivers shi sequences tend to follow the gamma pdf vis à vis the normal pdf for annual shi sequences therefore at the mean level of truncation with z0 0 the drought probability q would be greater than 0 5 in this situation firstly the gamma distributed shi value at the truncation level equal to the mean denoted as shi0 0 is transformed into its equivalent standard normal value z0 using the following wilson hilferty viessman and lewis 2003 equation 14 z 0 3 c v c v s h i 0 1 0 333 1 0 333 c v the drought probability q is determined using the following polynomial equation chow et al 1988 or by consulting the standard normal probability tables 15 b 0 5 1 0 196854 z 0 0 115194 z 0 2 0 000344 z 0 3 0 019527 z 0 4 4 where b q for z0 0 1 b q for z0 0 and z0 represents the absolute value of z0 the error evaluated by this formula is less than 0 00025 it can further be stated that for z0 0 q 0 5 1 b 1 0 5 which is exactly the value from the standard normal probability tables found in statistical textbooks for the gamma pdf the value of z0 at the mean level i e shi0 0 would turn out 0 and its corresponding q would be 0 5 at the monthly time scale for example in the case of the bow river with shi0 0 and cv 0 24 z0 and q respectively would work out to be 0 08 and 0 53 for the normal pdf of shi z0 shall take on the value of 0 and q 0 5 in the dm based procedure dt e or dt o should correspond to vr obtained from the spa which forms the objective criterion for refining the dm based estimates once the dm based estimates i e appropriate values of the entities lt and mt have been evaluated either by the counting or a modelling procedure then these values are used for the estimation of reservoir volumes 3 data acquisition and calculations of reservoir volumes spa and dm based methods twenty three rivers across canada table 1 and fig 1 were involved in the analysis the rivers encompassed drainage areas ranging from 97 to 74 600 km2 with the data bank spanning from 44 to 106 years the flow data for these 23 rivers were extracted from the canadian hydrological database environment canada 2018 the first step in the analysis was to assess the reservoir volumes vr employing the spa with the use of the annual and monthly streamflow data in the non standardized format at the draft level 1 μ appropriate for the desired time scale in this format the draft level was taken uniformly at 1 μ across all the 12 months the procedure documented in linsley et al 1992 was used and the calculations were accomplished by writing macros in visual basic and coupling them with associated data sets in the microsoft excel framework further the values of vr were calculated using the non standardized flow sequences with the draft at corresponding mean levels of respective months non uniform draft the standardized vr denoted as vr was also computed using shi sequences while truncating at level 0 uniform draft such a computational procedure was found meaningful for the estimation of actual σ denoted as σact and discussed below it should be noted that to increase the number of samples the rivers with large data size such as the bow english lepreau beaurivage bevearbank and north margaree were also analyzed by forming two additional subsamples with the data size of 40 years or more tables 2 and 3 this type of analysis created 30 33 samples from 23 rivers to obtain robust and reliable estimates of the performance statistics for example for the bow river 3 these subsamples are named as 3a from 1911 2016 3b from 11911 1973 and 3c from 1955 to 2016 and likewise for other rivers at the annual level however some such subsamples such as river 5 and 21 table 2 yielded abnormal values of mt o and therefore were discarded from further consideration in the dm based counting procedure the standardized annual and monthly flow sequences shi sequences were utilized for the abstraction of mt o and dt o values the values of drought probability q were obtained by the counting procedure in which the shi sequences were chopped at level z 0 0 representing the mean at the mean level the probability of drought q may not be equal to 0 5 because of the non normal pdf of the flow sequences and also due to sampling variations in general the annual flows tend to follow the normal pdf in canadian settings sharma and panu 2014 such that at the mean level the values of q cluster around 0 50 table 2 column 2 at the monthly time scale such values are significantly greater than 0 50 because of the gamma pdf of the flow sequences sharma and panu 2010 2014 the standardized values of the drought magnitudes i e mt o were converted to dt 0 by involving a suitable value of σ at the annual time scale there is only one set of the mean μ and standard deviation σ whereas there are respectively 12 such sets at the monthly time scale a simple choice would be to use the average denoted as σav of 12 values of σ s i e the monthly case in the present paper actual values of σ denoted as σact were worked out by comparing the values of vr using standardized and non standardized monthly flow sequences that is if the vr involving non standardized sequences variable draft at the mean level for the respective month is denoted as v and that is by shi sequences as v then v σact v the value of σact was found to vary from σav as is evident from the ratios of σact to σav shown in column 4 of table 1 the ratio denoted by r σ ranged from 0 68 to 1 39 with the mean value equal to 1 01 1 and a standard deviation 0 20 in other words σav can be taken as a reasonable estimator of the standard deviation for the calculation of drought volumes i e dt o σav mt o at the monthly scale it is noted that dt is a general term which takes the notation as dt o for the observed or counted values and as dt e for the estimated values likewise mt is a general term that takes the notation as mt o for the observed or counted values and as mt e for the estimated values henceforth vr refers to the spa based and dt the deficiency volume refers to the dm based reservoir volumes a major consideration for comparative analysis between vr and dt requires an appropriate selection of the draft level since the evaluation of dt is tractable at the 1μm level in monthly shi sequences so this level was chosen for assessment and comparison with vr 4 results the reservoirs across the rivers can be sized using the annual flow or the monthly flow sequences the sizing based on annual flow sequences is simpler as the annual flows can be easily synthesized based on the existing stochastic or deterministic methods of streamflow simulation however to improve upon the accuracy and robustness of the reservoir size it is imperative to involve the monthly flow sequences the techniques of monthly streamflow synthesis are also reasonably developed and can be used when required grygier and stedinger 1987 kendall and dracup 1991 ideally there is no substitute for the gauged data at the proposed site of the reservoir but in absence of any such gauged data the streamflow synthesis is an attractive alternative in the present study since the gauged data are available so both annual and monthly flow sequences were involved in the evaluation of vr and dt for the sake of convenience and uniformity in the analysis the vr and dt were standardized that is vr is divided by σ at the annual time scale denoted as vr vr σ and by σav at the monthly time scale i e vr σav the standardized term for dt is mt which has been discussed in the foregoing sections 4 1 analysis of reservoir volumes by the spa and the dm based procedure at the annual scale the annual shi sequences were truncated at shi0 0 level 1μ level of the draft and values of mt o were recorded table 2 at the same time vr values were obtained at 1μ level of the draft in the annual flow sequences using the spa and then converted into vr table 2 a review of these values indicates that there exists a considerable difference between these two estimates where values of vr are much larger than mt o intuitively if the draft level is lowered to say αμ level the values of vr thus computed would turn out to be comparable to the values of mt o so the draft levels were lowered and α values turned out in the range of 0 90 1 with a mean equals to 0 955 0 96 and a standard deviation equals 0 028 table 2 stated in another way the draft level of 0 96 μ for vr the spa based estimate corresponds to 1μ level for mt o the dm based estimate to elucidate this point for the bow river 3a table 2 mt o at 1μ level of the draft is 5 76 which equals to vr 5 76 at 0 965 μ level of the draft table 2 this finding is of significance since draft levels less than 1μ and specifically 0 75μ level has been used in the operation of a majority of reservoirs across worldwide rivers involving the spa mcmahon et al 2007 so instead of using the spa one could use the dm procedure to estimate the storage volume of a reservoir another interesting finding is that at the draft levels αμ both vr and mt o converge to the same value for example in the bow river at the draft level 0 905 μ vr mt o table 2 in this study the mean value for such compatibility was found to be 0 892 μ with a standard deviation of 0 083 further at all draft levels less than αμ the vr and mt o are equal with a caveat that α less than a specific value may yield zero value of vr and mt o to elucidate the point consider the case of the bow river where at 1μ vr 14 82 mt o 5 76 at 0 90 μ vr 2 08 mt o 2 08 at 0 72μ vr 0 03 mt o 0 03 and below 0 72 μ both vr and mt o turn out to be 0 thus at the annual scale the minimum draft level is 0 72 μ for the assessment of reservoir volumes in the case of the bow river below this draft level the reservoir sizing at the annual scale is infeasible and thus warranting the consideration of the monthly flow sequences for the analysis of reservoir volume in the estimation process for mt e eqs 2 to 13 were used and the values of mt e so computed are summarized in table 2 both versions of the estimation of mt e were used a eq 13 i e with the mean value of i only and b eq 2 i e with both mean and variance of i it is noted that the crucial parameter in the variance based eq 2 is ɸ whose value needs some degree of calibration by a trial and error procedure in the calibration process therefore ɸ 0 0 0 25 0 50 and 0 75 were attempted and based on an efficiency criterion nash and sutcliffe 1970 a value resulting in the best match between mt o and mt e was chosen for example in the bow river with input parameters t 106 z0 0 ρ 0 because the shi sequences are treated as normal independent sequences the output results are q 0 5 qq qp 0 5 e lt 6 15 e l 2 the value of lc worked out 6 15 for ɸ 0 5 11 for ɸ 0 25 4 08 for ɸ 0 5 and 3 04 for ɸ 0 75 the corresponding values of mt e were computed as 7 88 6 79 5 67 and 4 51 these values were compared to mt o 5 76 and the closest mt e to mt 0 was found 5 67 for all rivers under consideration 4 sets of mt e were evaluated and compared on a 1 1 basis with corresponding mt o the deviations between mt e and mt o were used to evolve the performance parameters viz the nse nash sutcliffe efficiency and the mer mean error and are shown in table 2 it is apparent from this table that values of the nse are low and in some cases negative indicating that the match is weak it is noteworthy to mention that the range of mt e and mt o is small 3 49 6 79 for the annual shi sequences therefore the variance of errors mt e mt o is nearly the same or at times that of mt o however a better 1 1 correspondence should at least render the variance of the errors smaller than mt o that means nse should be a positive quantity with mer close to zero it was noted that for ɸ 0 and 0 25 the mt e values were overestimated mer 31 59 and 15 03 respectively with negative values of nse table 2 for ɸ 0 75 they were underestimated mer 19 95 though with positive value of nse the best value of ɸ was found 0 50 with nse 7 81 and mer 1 62 0 it can also be deduced from table 2 that the simple model eq 13 involving only the mean of drought intensity for mt e resulted in considerable underestimation mer 14 43 even though nse was 4 81 therefore at the annual scale the model with the inclusion of mean and variance of drought intensity eq 2 was found more suitable with the value of ɸ 0 50 based on ɸ 0 5 and using eq 2 it was observed that the deviation between mt o and mt e ranged from 26 to 33 concerning mt o with a mean value of 1 62 for example in the case of the bow river 3a table 2 mt o was observed as 5 76 while the estimated value was 5 67 resulting in a marginal deviation of 1 35 5 76 5 67 5 76 in terms of storage volume it amounts to dt o mt o σ 0 95 109 m3 compared to the estimated value of 0 93 109 m3 the reservoir can be designed at 1 μ level of the draft with the dm based procedure which is equivalent to 0 95 μ draft of the spa however at 1 μ level of the draft the spa yields the reservoir volume of 2 43 109 m3 which is about 250 larger than the dm based estimate such a higher value can be construed as an overdesign and may not be justifiable due to environmental considerations as large areas get submerged and excessive costs involved in the construction of the reservoir system it is noted that this is a typical estimate for the bow river this value could be quite different in other rivers such as for the upper humber river 22 table 2 where vr 2 23 109 m3 and dt o 2 10 109 m3 happen to be very close to each other the overall mean value of vr was found to be 1 85 times of dt table 2 the inverse of which is 0 54 in short on average the spa based volumes are 185 larger than the dm based estimates at the draft level of mean annual flow should a need arise to design the storage equivalent to vr at the draft level equal to 1μ the dm based procedure with the moving average ma smoothing should be considered for the design of reservoir volume sharma and panu 2020 4 2 analysis of reservoir volumes by the spa and the dm based procedure at the monthly scale it was stated in the aforesaid sections that the dm procedure applies to stationary flow sequences which were obtained by standardizing the monthly flows in turn termed as shi sequences at the 1 μm level of the draft the shi sequences were truncated at shi0 0 and mt o were obtained by the counting procedure table 3 likewise at the 1μ level vr values were obtained and compared to mt o table 3 it was found that values of vr were much larger than mt o by iteratively adjusting the draft level to α μ values of vr became comparable to the mt o it is apparent from table 3 that the value of α ranges from 0 71 to 0 89 with a mean of 0 81 for example in the bow river 3a in table 3 α 0 81 or the draft level at 0 81 μ vr mt o 21 87 in the volumetric units 21 87 translates to 0 54 109 m3 mt o σav in tandem with the counting procedure mt e values were estimated using eq 2 or 13 the computation of mt e began by recognizing the fact that monthly shi sequences follow the gamma pdf sharma and panu 2014 therefore at the mean level of shi i e shi0 0 z0 was evaluated through eq 14 and the corresponding value of q was obtained by using eq 15 for example for the bow river at shio 0 z0 was found to be 0 08 column 9 table 3 and the corresponding q 0 53 plugging these values in eq 11 the values of qq and qp were determined as 0 69 and 0 31 column 9 table 3 using the values of qq and qp in eqs 9 and 10 e lt and e l were computed to obtain the value of lc eq 12 an optimal value of ɸ was required at the annual time scale an optimal value of ɸ was found as 0 5 therefore this value was attempted at the monthly time scale as well plugging ɸ 0 5 and using eqs 3 and 2 the value of mt e was found as 16 57 which is smaller than mt o 21 87 as shown in table 3 for all the rivers under consideration the above procedure was used for obtaining the values of mt e the nse and mer were also computed by comparing mt o and mt e values on a 1 1 basis such a comparative analysis yielded nse as 56 95 with mer 11 95 fig 2 a suggesting a poor fit and an underestimation of mt e at this stage ɸ 0 was attempted and it resulted in nse 73 33 but excessive overestimation to the tune of 29 76 an interesting part of this analysis indicated that rivers 1 through 5 provided a good fit table 3 with ɸ 0 whereas the rivers in northern ontario and atlantic canada tended to yield a good fit with ɸ 0 5 further the best criterion for choosing a desired value of ɸ tended to be the ratio qq q and the critical value was found to be 1 22 table 3 last value in column 9 shown in italics the rivers with qq q 1 22 were assigned the ɸ 0 and those with the qq q 1 22 were assigned ɸ 0 5 except for the batchawana river 11 in table 3 in the case of the batchawana river despite qq q being lesser than 1 22 ɸ 0 yielded a better match between mt e and mt o table 3 given the regional hydrologic behavior of the rivers this river was also assigned the ɸ value 0 5 using the above criterion of discrimination the mt e were chosen from table 3 with corresponding ɸ 0 5 or 0 with these values of mt e the 1 1 correspondence between mt o and mt e turned out to be encouraging fig 2b with nse 88 08 and mer 4 with a mild overestimation therefore at the monthly time scale a differential value of ɸ for a region played a crucial role in arriving at the desired value of mt e at this point eq 13 based on the mean of the drought intensity i was used to evaluate mt e the mean value i μd was computed from eq 4 by substituting the values of the z0 and q for example in the bow river 3a table 3 plugging z0 0 08 and q 0 53 in eq 4 resulted in μd 0 83 since drought intensity is treated as a positive quantity therefore the absolute value of μd 0 83 was taken as the mean drought intensity i a value of the mt e was computed using the relationship mt e 0 83 e lt e plugging the needed values in eq 9 one can obtain e lt e equal to 16 integer number and subsequently mt e 13 28 0 83 16 the values of mt e were obtained for all rivers table 3 and compared with mt o on a 1 1 basis in this comparative analysis the performance statistics nse and mer were respectively found as 39 88 and 25 69 suggesting a poor fit but more remarkably acute underestimation succinctly for the estimation of mt e the trivial model eq 13 was found to be inadequate and therefore the mean and variance based eq 2 was necessary for obtaining the robust and reliable values of mt e at the draft level of 1μ table 3 it can be discerned that dt values are larger at the annual scale compared to the monthly scale at the annual scale dt o vr mt o vr denoted as rm was found as 0 54 table 2 and dt e vr mt e vr as 0 55 whereas these ratios were found to be close to 0 27 at the monthly scale table 3 it means that at the monthly scale dt values are too small compared to vr even though at the annual scale the dt is about 54 of the vr it may be justified since this value corresponds to the 0 95 μ level of the draft table 2 furthermore at 89 0 89μ of the draft level table 2 vr and dt o converge to the same value in brevity the annual analysis provides a good guideline to proceed to the monthly scale where the monthly dt values should match at least 54 of the vr in view of the foregoing observation there is a need to find a mechanism to ramp up the values of dt or mt at the monthly scale among other methods a simple mechanism involving the moving average ma smoothing procedure was chosen for example when a monthly shi sequence is used without any moving average smoothing then such a sequence is designated as moving average 1 ma1 sequence and likewise when two consecutive shi values are averaged out it is named as ma2 and with 3 consecutive shi values it is known as ma3 in the process of ma smoothing the mean in the resultant smoothed sequences remains zero though the standard deviation decreases less than 1 and ρ increases i e greater than that for ma1 table 4 column 2 however z0 and q do not change as shi0 0 and cv of the original flow sequences remain unchanged the ma2 or ma3 smoothed sequences are further standardized to conform to the shi sequences mean 0 standard deviation 1 with the value of z0 q and a new value of ρ dt o by the counting procedure and values of dt e were evaluated using relevant equations it is noted that in the process of converting mt o mt e to dt o dt e at each of the ma smoothing σav is used as the multiplier sharma and panu 2020 as noted earlier that these dt o mo or dt e mo values should approximately match the corresponding values at the annual scale i e dt o an or dt e an put it other way mt o mo σav mt o an σ and likewise mt e mo σav mt e an σ note that the subscript an stands for the annual and subscript mo for the month it can thus be worked out mt e mo mt o an σ σav 12 17 mt o an cv cvav and after adjusting the units on annual and monthly bases the ma smoothing ma2 ma3 or ma4 at which the above correspondence is achieved is regarded as the best ma smoothing for example in the case of the bow river 3a in table 2 the mt o an 5 76 cv 0 13 and cvav 0 24 and after plugging these values in the aforesaid relationships and adjusting for the annual and monthly units mt o mo 37 97 and mt e mo 37 38 a review of table 3 river 3a column 3 shows that ma1 based value of mt o mo 21 87 by the counting procedure and likewise the value of mt e mo 24 75 by estimation since the expectation is that the smaller of the mt o mo or mt e mo value must be greater than the desired value of 37 97 but in the ma1 smoothing both of the values are smaller and thus implying that ma1 smoothing is not adequate and one must move to the next i e ma2 smoothing in the ma2 smoothing mt o mo and mt e mo were found as 26 97 and 38 44 table 4 since the smaller value 26 97 is less than 37 97 the desired value therefore ma2 smoothing is also inadequate for the bow river consequently there is a need to proceed to the next i e ma3 smoothing for which case mt o mo was found 38 99 and mt e mo as 51 19 table 4 since the smaller value i e mt o mo is greater than the desired 37 97 value the ma3 smoothing was considered as an appropriate smoothing with the mt value of 38 99 in some situations the ma2 smoothing may prove adequate such as in the case of river 4 i e the south saskatchewan river in which case the desired mt is 40 61 whereas for the ma2 smoothing the value of mt o mo is 57 06 and mt e mo is 45 55 since both values are greater than the desired value so smaller of them should be chosen i e 45 55 the ma2 smoothing also was found to be satisfactory for three rivers viz 4 5 and 18 although ma3 smoothing was found satisfactory for 17 rivers yet three rivers viz 2 13 and 22 required the ma4 smoothing for elucidation the river 2 the athabasca river is chosen in which case mt e mo was found as 37 85 and mt o mo as 51 19 since the smaller value does not yet meet the desired value so one must move to the next i e the ma4 smoothing where mt o mo and mt e mo were respectively found as 64 55 and 59 59 since the smaller value 59 59 was greater than the desired value i e 43 50 therefore the ma4 smoothing was regarded as adequate in short mt o mo and mt e mo both should be the desired value for the chosen ma smoothing and finally smaller between mt o mo and mt e mo should be used for estimation of dt as a counterpart of vr the plots of accepted mt e values against the desired mt with ma2 smoothing generally show under estimation with mer 15 fig 3 a such a plot fig 3b for ma3 smoothing performed better though with mild overestimation mer 10 succinctly the ma3 smoothing can be construed as satisfactory for providing the estimate of dt as a counterpart of vr at the monthly scale based on the above norm of the selection of the desired smoothing i e ma2 ma3 and ma4 all the rivers were re analyzed table 3 the ratio of dt vr was determined and was found to range from 0 33 to 1 06 with an average of 0 57 table 3 based on the results of the ma smoothing a majority of rivers 77 were found to fit the ma3 smoothing for brevity and simplicity therefore the ma3 smoothing can be used for all rivers and the smaller numerical quantity between mt o mo and mt e mo should be used for comparison with the desired value for the ma3 smoothing the mean value of rm dt vr mt vr was found as 0 57 with a range of 0 32 to 0 84 table 4 the value of rm at the monthly scale is slightly higher when compared to 0 54 at the annual scale which is in sync with the general observation that the storage volume at the monthly scale must be higher due to the higher value of cv and ρ than the storage volume at the annual scale 5 discussion it was noted that vr at the draft level of 1 μ or α μ α 1 increases from the annual time scale to the monthly time scale table 5 for example in the case of the bow river at 1 μ draft level the vr is 2 44 109 m3 at the annual scale whereas it is 2 88 109 m3 based on the monthly scale for further comparative purposes the vr values were also computed at the weekly scale table 5 for 3 rivers representing 3 typical regions canadian prairies northern ontario and atlantic canada in general at any draft level αμ the vr increases from the annual up to the weekly scale which concurs with the increase in cv and ρ from the annual up to the weekly flow sequences it was noted earlier that annual analysis may provide the vr estimates only up to a certain level of the draft such as for the bow river it was 0 72 μ table 5 below this level the vr turned out to be 0 under this situation the monthly analysis provides improved estimates of vr table 5 one can easily interpret from table 5 that vr can be computed at the draft as low as 0 20 μ level however the corresponding dt e estimates cannot be worked out by using the dm procedure because of the stationarity limitation it is also apparent from table 5 that vr values level off from the monthly to the weekly time scale whereas there is a sharp increase from the annual to the monthly scale such an observation signifies that the storage requirement computed based on the annual and monthly scales is adequate whereas the weekly analysis adds only marginal benefit also the simulation of the weekly flow sequences is relatively challenging and hence practically limiting the analysis up to the monthly scale it was found that at the monthly scale hydrologic characteristics of canadian rivers translate at 1 μ level of the draft in shi sequences to 0 70 0 90 μ of the uniform cutoff flow level across the 12 months in terms of the vr table 3 this 0 70 0 90 μ level thus hovers around 0 75 μ of the draft level also noted by mcmahon et al 2007 this fact was ascertained by looking at the monthly flow data of the mitta mitta river as published in mcmahon and mein 1978 at the draft of 0 70μ the reservoir volumes by both methods were found almost identical with a value of 878 106 m3 likewise at the annual scale for the draft of 0 77μ the reservoir volumes by the spa and dm converged to the same value i e 860 106 m3 the behavior of dt is just the reverse i e dt decreases from the annual to the monthly time scale table 5 numbers in bold italics it is noted that dt either denotes dt o or dt e for the bow river these values are 0 95 109 m3 and 0 54 109 m3 the monthly based value is 43 smaller than the annual one which are significantly different from each other furthermore similar behavior is exhibited by other rivers table 5 values in bold italics the calculations for vr are linked to the availability of the flow in the river whereas the calculations for dt are hinged on the demand for water due to the deficiency of the flow in a river in the wake of a drought one may be tempted to store as much water as is available though there are constraints on the economic and environmental concerns on the other hand based on the need a volume of 0 54 109 m3 is sufficient there is a vast difference among these values which calls for a need to shore up dt values by the ma smoothing to an appropriate level in canadian rivers the ma3 smoothing exhibits promise in ramping up the dt value while utilizing the monthly shi sequences as elucidated in the foregoing sections it has been noted mcmahon et al 2007 that majority of reservoirs at the global scale are designed to handle the draft at the level of 0 75 μ in that case spa based and dm based estimates converge to the same value likewise on the monthly scale this draft level is 0 81 μ table 3 that means at the draft levels adopted globally the spa and dm based method yield the same estimates for example the estimates for the mitta mitta river by various methods at the draft level of 0 75μ at the monthly scale are shown in table 6 the value based on the dm method is also listed in the last row of this table it is evident from table 6 that dm 9 based method estimate lies between spa 3 gould gamma 6 and behavioral analysis 8 it has been reported in the literature mcmahon and mein 1978 that the gould gamma model and behavioral analysis yield better results in view of the least bias and standard error from this point of view the dm based estimates are relatively closer i e within 14 error from the above two estimates when comparing with the spa based estimates dm is slightly less i e within 10 6 which lends further support to the dm based estimates at the higher draft levels 0 90μ there is divergence in which spa provides much higher estimates relative to the dm procedure for example in the case of the mitta mitta river at 0 90 μ spa yields 2225 106 m3 and dm procedure yields 1225 106 m3 nearly half of spa likewise at 1 μ the estimates are 3430 106 m3 for spa and 1410 106 m3 for dm to bring dm estimates to the level of spa at such high drafts the ma smoothing is needed in the shi sequences for the mitta mitta river for example the ma3 smoothing is adequate to bring up the reservoir volume 3394 106 m3 within 1 margin of error to the level of spa based value 3430 106 m3 likewise at 0 9 μ level ma2 smoothing is adequate to bring the reservoir volume to 2306 106 m3 within 3 5 margin of error when compared to the spa based value 2225 106 m3 at this stage it is imperative that various methods of estimating the reservoir capacity discussed in mcmahon et al 2007 be evaluated at such high draft levels at a monthly scale the methods worthy of consideration are the gould probability matrix method behavioral analysis vogel and stedinger method 1987 adeloye et al 2003 procedure in view of their current use in reservoir design calculations using these methods and in turn comparing them with the dm based method would form the part of another study currently being pursued by the authors it can however be stated that at the draft of 0 75 μ dm based estimates provide compatible values with other promising methods of reservoir sizing the question then arises as to why dm estimates differ from spa based estimates though they are using the same data on flow sequences the answer lies in the assumptions and the methodology used in analyses the dm based methodology is based on the premise of the deficit below a certain draft or threshold level with no concern to the storage content of the reservoir the drought episodes happen randomly or no association between them though within each episode there is persistence between drought periods the analysis provides an estimate of the shortage of water that must be fulfilled during the longest drought period with the assumption that all smaller episodes prior to and after the longest drought period will also be catered to by this computed volume of water during the intervening periods between drought episodes there would be sufficient flow to replenish the water used during the drought periods a reservoir is expected to be built to store the water as dictated by the amount of volume equivalent to this largest shortage and water should come from the surplus periods on the contrary the spa begins with the basic assumption that a reservoir is already in place and it keeps filling and emptying with the interaction of inflow and draft in this process the maximum historical drawdown between full to the minimal water level in the reservoir is taken as the reservoir volume this volume thus would cater for the smaller antecedent droughts while storing enough water for the severe drought to occur if a drought of slightly less severity occurs immediately after this severe drought spa still provides some water which is not the case with the dm procedure in other words the spa computes conservative estimates based on the availability of flow whereas the dm is based on the need for water which should be satisfied during the worst drought period on record 6 conclusions the dm based procedure for reservoir sizing has been developed using flow sequences at the annual and monthly scales in canadian rivers the shi sequences standardized annual and monthly river flow sequences were used to evolve the estimates of drought deficiency volumes dt which were compared with the spa based reservoir volumes vr in the dm based procedure one crucial parameter is the characteristic drought length which is controlled by a parameter ɸ at the annual scale the value of ɸ was found to be 0 5 for all rivers under consideration on the monthly scale ɸ was found 0 5 for rivers in northern ontario and atlantic canada whereas it was found to be 0 for rivers in the canadian prairies at the annual scale it was found that the dt 54 of the vr or spa yields nearly 185 larger volume than that based on the dm procedure at the draft of 1μ mean annual flow in the shi sequences at the monthly scale at the mean level designated as μm m ranging from 1 to 12 of the draft in the individual months the shi sequences yielded much smaller values of dt and were found to be 27 of vr the monthly dt values were ramped up to attain the level of 54 of vr by the moving average smoothing ma3 of 3 shi values at both time scales draft at the mean level in shi sequences corresponds to 0 95 μ average of 0 96 at annual and 0 94 at monthly in terms of spa the dm based method works on the standardized annual and monthly river flow sequences termed shi sequences the annual shi sequences can be analyzed at any level of draft such as 1 μ 0 9 μ 0 8 μ 0 75μ etc however at the monthly scale in the strict statistical sense shi sequences can be analyzed only at respective mean levels μm of draft across months i e the case of a variable draft level in view of the stationarity requirements for statistical analysis the moving average ma procedure can successfully be used to ramp up the dm based deficiency volumes to the level of spa based reservoir volumes the research is presently underway in which the shi sequences can be analyzed at the uniform draft level across all months using the dm based procedure the dm based procedure offers a novel algorithm of design of reservoir capacity which opens a platform for comparison with techniques such as extended deficiency analysis behavioral analysis hardison generalized method phien method vogel and stedinger method

8185,study region canadian prairies northern ontario and atlantic canada study focus a method has been developed to evaluate the reservoir volumes based on the concept of drought magnitude dm using annual as well as monthly flow sequences across canada the dm based storage volumes have been evaluated using the standardized annual and monthly flow sequences termed as the standardized hydrological index shi and compared with estimates using the sequent peak algorithm spa utilizing non standardized flow sequences at varying draft levels new hydrological insights for the region it was found that at the annual scale 1μ mean annual flow level of the draft in shi dm based procedure sequences yielded nearly 54 of the reservoir volume based on spa this volume was considered as an adequate estimate of storage as it corresponded to 96 μ of the draft level in terms of spa at the monthly scale and for the variable mean monthly levels of the draft shi sequences yielded reservoir volumes close to 27 of spa at the draft of 1 μ therefore ma3 moving average of consecutive 3 shi values was invoked to ramp up the monthly volume to the level of the annual volume of 54 introducing the ma smoothing concept in the dm based procedure for the estimation of reservoir volumes at the monthly scale is the main contribution of the study keywords draft level drought magnitude extreme number theorem markov chain moving average ma smoothing reservoir volume sequent peak algorithm spa standardized hydrological index shi 1 introduction sizing a reservoir behind a dam is an important hydrological problem and has attracted the attention of hydrologists and water resources engineers since the pioneering work of rippl 1883 rippl graphical procedure since then has been improvised through sequent peak algorithm spa which was first devised by thomas and burden 1963 the spa has been continually refined and is well documented in journal papers parks and gustard 1982 lele 1987 and hydrologic and water resources engineering books mcmahon and mein 1978 loucks et al 1981 mcmahon and mein 1986 linsley et al 1992 mcmahon and adeloye 2005 the spa is widely used for the design of reservoirs and its computational versions such as mass curve residual mass curve methods can easily be programmed in modern day personal computers the river flows chiefly annual flow data and at times monthly flow data at the site of a dam are used in such analyses for estimating design volumes of the reservoir size phien 1993 adeloye et al 2003 mcmahon et al 2007 in tandem with the use of river flow data the hydrological drought analyses have been the subject of considerable investigations since the 1970s with the pioneering work of millan and yevjevich 1971 and salazar and yevjevich 1975 two main parameters of the hydrological drought viz the duration length l and the magnitude m also termed as severity have been the focus of interest the modelling activity has primarily been focused on drought lengths with a less noticeable thrust towards the magnitude severity aspect which is in a true sense of greater importance in terms of management of river waters and consequently to sizing and operation of reservoirs built across rivers a major contribution in the area of drought modelling was made by dracup et al 1980a 1980b in which a linkage relationship was suggested between severity and drought length through the relationship severity magnitude length over the years there has been a change in the nomenclature of terms severity and magnitude in which severity is replaced by magnitude and magnitude by intensity sharma and panu 2013 this new nomenclature has been widely accepted and is reflected in a majority of research papers that have been presently appearing in professional journals sharma and panu 2013 2014 the research work on modelling of the drought magnitude was enhanced by sen 1980 zelenhasic and salvai 1987 guven 1983 sharma 1997 kendall and dracup 1992 tallaksen et al 1997 tallaksen and van lenen 2004 salas et al 2005 sharma and panu 2010 2013 2014 akyuz et al 2012 among others adopting the linkage relationship advanced by dracup et al 1980a 1980b sharma and panu 2013 2014 have used a simple model for predicting the drought magnitude by coupling it with the drought length through a third parameter namely the drought intensity and thus drought magnitude m drought intensity i drought duration l they have carried out analyses by standardizing the flow sequences in the respective time scales annual monthly and weekly which are named shi standardized hydrological index sequences in brief shi is an entity with a mean equal to zero and a standard deviation equal to 1 while retaining the probabilistic structure of the flow sequence under consideration the use of shi has performed well in modelling the drought length and magnitude on canadian river flow sequences at the annual monthly and weekly time scales sharma and panu 2010 2014 despite a large number of research efforts on the hydrologic drought models very few studies such as by sharma and panu 2020 have endeavoured to link the drought magnitude with the reservoir volume vr determined using the spa based analysis the focus of this study is to present a comparative assessment of the drought magnitude dm based approach to the spa to evaluate the reservoir size while using annual and monthly flow sequences from rivers across canada the spa has been chosen as the standard reference as it is widely used for calculations of the reservoir volumes and comparing with other estimates mcmahon et al 2007 adeloye et al 2003 the familiarity of the spa is well evidenced by its inscription in the textbooks on water resources engineering loucks et al 1981 linsley et al 1992 and popular books on reservoir storage and yield mcmahon and mein 1978 1986 mcmahon and adeloye 2005 the demand or the draft level has been set equal to the respective mean flows in terms of the shi month by month standardization sequences at the monthly scale as it is statistically tractable however at the annual scale the draft levels other than the mean level can also be treated statistically because of the approximate stationary nature of river flow sequences the draft levels are expressed as the ratio α to the mean annual flow maf level such as 90 0 9μ 75 60 etc where μ is the mean annual flow it should be borne in mind that μ has the same value at the annual or monthly overall mean scales however at the monthly scale the draft levels are expressed as αμm where μm is the mean flow of individual month with subscript m ranging from 1 to 12 2 sequent peak algorithm spa and drought magnitude dm based procedures the most popular method for sizing reservoirs is the spa the method requires historical or synthesized river flow data as inflows and demand or draft levels as outflows and the flow data are analyzed without standardization it means that the computations can proceed on the nonstationary monthly flow sequences in addition to the annual flow sequences which are perceived to be stationary the calculations are conducted numerically using the mass curve or the residual mass curve method involving inflows and demand flows to assess the reservoir volume vr the procedure is fully amenable to computerized computations to arrive at the required vr for a given situation although the spa adores the advantage of treating the stationary and non stationary flow data in a likewise manner it suffers from the disadvantage that no return period can be attached to the estimated vr values for instance in a data set of annual flows of the lepreau river table 1 for 100 years 1919 2018 the vr at 1μ level of the draft was computed as 6 45 108 m3 whereas the estimate based on the 50 years of the sample 1969 2018 turned out to be 7 35 108 m3 this discrepancy can be attributed to the differing estimates of μ mean σ standard deviation and ρ lag 1 autocorrelation in a flow sequence from these samples therefore attaching a return period t 50 or 100 to these estimates is not devoid of uncertainty in the drought magnitude dm based procedure it is imperative that flow sequences must be stationary therefore standardization of the annual and monthly month by month sequences is completed and the resultant sequences are known as shi sequences which turn out to be weakly stationary the second order stationarity at the annual scale the demand is set at 1 μ 0 9 μ 0 8 μ 0 7 μ etc levels to represent the draft the shi sequences are truncated at these draft levels to carry out the analyses in the dm based procedure for example in the case of the bow river table 1 μ 39 10 m3 s and cv 0 13 cv stands for coefficient of variation at the draft corresponding to the mean level draft 1 μ the truncation shi0 level in the shi sequence can be determined by the relationship shi0 αμ μ σ α 1 cv 0 1 1 0 13 where α is the ratio of the draft level to the mean flow μ at the draft equal to 0 90 μ the truncation level shi0 shall turn out as 0 77 0 90 1 0 13 at the monthly scale shi sequences were chopped at shi0 0 to correspond to variable monthly means in original non stationary monthly flows the shi sequence thus obtained has a uniform mean 0 and a standard deviation 1 across the months such a sequence is construed as stationary and is tractable using the known methods of stochastic analysis however at 90 of the respective monthly mean or 0 90 μm there shall emerge 12 values of shi0 to truncate the shi sequence for example in the case of the bow river 3 table 1 at the draft level of 0 90 μm the 12 values of cv are 0 14 0 14 0 12 0 30 0 41 0 25 0 25 0 20 0 19 0 20 0 18 and 0 18 with the corresponding shi0 values as 0 71 0 90 1 0 14 0 71 0 83 0 33 0 24 0 40 0 40 0 50 0 53 0 50 0 56 and 0 56 thus the shi sequence is truncated by the variable shi0 values or a curve vis a vis a horizontal line with shi0 0 for the truncation at 1 μm such a truncation operation represents a complex scenario that is difficult to treat by the known methods of statistical analysis for the estimation of drought magnitude it is further noted that there is a significant variation among the shi0 values so a mean value of shi0 s as a truncation level would hardly justify a reasonable statistical analysis in short at the monthly scale the dm based analysis is tractable at the truncation level equal to 100 of the mean or 1 μm of the individual months only at other levels of truncation representing the draft the dm based analysis for the evaluation of the vr appears to be intractable unlike the annual scale which can handle all the draft levels i e 1 μ 0 9 μ 0 8 μ 0 7 μ because of the stationarity of annual flows the shis below the truncation level shi0 level are referred to as the drought dubbed as d whereas above the level are referred to as the wet dubbed as w in a historical record of n t years there shall emerge several spells of drought and wet conditions and the length of the longest drought spell denoted as lt is of paramount importance it should be noted that subscript t denotes the return period the negative or deficit spikes can be perceived to be drought intensities i and the sum of deficit spikes can be construed as the drought magnitude m the negative values in the longest spell are added to represent the largest drought magnitude mt the sum of the negative values is taken as the absolute value representing mt as a positive quantity the largest deficit volume dt during a drought spell is computed as dt σ mt for the annual flow sequences and dt σav mt for the monthly flow sequences where σav is arithmetic average of 12 monthly σ s it should be noted that the unit of dt is the same as that of σ because mt is a dimensionless entity for example for the bow river at the annual scale there is only one value of σ μ cv such as 1 60 108 m3 year or 5 08 m3 s 39 10 0 13 whereas at the monthly time scale σav is taken as 9 38 m3 s 24 31 106 m3 month as an appropriate value for calculation of vr when lt mt and dt are abstracted from the historical or observed data they are denoted as lt o mt o and dt o i e subscript o stands for the observed the procedure for abstracting the aforesaid entities is named the counting procedure one noteworthy feature of the spa is that it can handle the uniform flow level as the draft across the 12 months for instance if the overall monthly mean flow 1μ or 90 of the overall monthly mean flow 0 9μ is the draft uniformly throughout 12 months then the spa can estimate the vr with no stationarity constraints the dm based procedure handles such scenarios by use of other techniques such as the moving average smoothing of the shi sequences and in turn truncating them at the mean level of individual months 2 1 estimation of deficit volumes dt by the dm based models for a given return period t the longest drought period lt and the corresponding drought magnitude mt can be estimated by the drought models using the historical flow data in the modelling approach the probabilistic relationship for mt can be obtained by applying the extreme number theorem todorovic and woolhiser 1975 sen 1980 one can expect 1 2 3 n drought spells in a period of t year month which are perceived to follow the poisson law of probability each drought spell has a length l equal to 1 2 3 4 year month and the corresponding magnitude m equal to y1 y2 y3 y 4 with y being a non integer variable such as 1 1 4 5 8 8 etc over a period t time units it is imperative to obtain for design purposes the longest drought duration lt and the corresponding largest drought magnitude mt a sample size of t time units year or month t 30 50 100 1000 etc can be regarded equivalent to the return period of t time units sharma and panu 2014 for example in a river with a flow record of 50 years t assumes a value equal to 50 year or 600 month when droughts are being analyzed at the annual or monthly time scales based on the above notions the following probability based relationship from the first principles can be used to estimate the expected value of the largest drought magnitude e mt 1 e m t j 0 m t y j p m t y j the notation p stands for the cumulative probability whereas p stands for the simple probability since mt is a continuous random variable therefore mt has a continuous probability density function pdf so p mt yj can be evaluated as p mt yj 1 p mt yj with mt yj replaced by the mean value yj 1 yj 2 eq 1 can therefore be expressed as 2 e m t j 0 n 1 y j 1 y j 2 p m t y j 1 p m t y j the upper limit of integration in eq 1 is replaced by some finite number n1 the general equation for evaluating p mt yj based on the extreme number theorem sen 1980 can be expressed as 3 p m t y j e x p t q 1 q q 1 p m y j in which m takes on non integer values represented by yj since y s such as y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 correspond to values of m thus the largest of them will correspond to mt it is noted that m is the sum of several drought deficit spikes encountered in a drought spell each has a negative sign because it is derived by truncating shi sequences that lay below negative side of the cutoff level the deficit spikes can be construed to obey a truncated normal distribution which encompasses values of a random variable drought intensity here from to z0 standard normal number thus the standard normal pdf is truncated at various levels of z0 corresponding to counterpart values of the probability q for example a standard normal pdf respectively can be truncated at z0 0 0 and z0 0 52 with the corresponding probability of drought q equal to 0 5 and 0 3 the truncated normal pdf version will have a mean and variance respectively different from 0 and 1 applying the basic axioms for the evaluation of moments expressions for the mean denoted by μd and variance denoted as σ d 2 of the truncated normal pdf version can be deduced sen 1977 sharma 1997 as expressed below 4 μ d exp 0 5 z 0 2 q 2 π z 0 5 σ d 2 1 z 0 exp 0 5 z 0 2 q 2 π exp z 0 2 q 2 2 π because drought episodes lay below i e in the negative domain the desired truncation level therefore an absolute value of the term μd is an estimator of the mean value of drought intensity i as it represents the mean of several deficit spikes likewise the term σ d 2 is an estimator of the variance of drought intensity whose value remains unaffected by the sign for example at the cutoff level corresponding to q equal to 0 5 the value of z0 0 0 and upon substitution of these values in eqs 4 and 5 yield μd equal to 0 80 and σ d 2 equal to 0 36 as explained earlier the absolute value of μd will be taken as the mean value of drought intensity i which in this case equals 0 80 given the central limit theorem and since m is the sum of deficit spikes its probability structure can be approximated by the normal pdf with mean μ m and variance σ m 2 such a consideration reduces the expression for the term p m yj in eq 3 as follows 6 p m y j 1 σ m 2 π 0 y j e x p 0 5 m μ m σ m 2 d m sharma and panu 2013 noted that the parameters μ m and σ m are related to the extreme drought length lt and the mean drought length l m such a representative drought length is named herein as the characteristic drought length lc thus the expressions for μ m and σ m 2 can be shown to be related as follows kotz and neumann 1963 7 μ m l c μ d 8 σ m 2 l c σ d 2 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ l c l c 1 ρ 2 where ρ is the lag 1 autocorrelation in the shi sequence and can be computed using an algorithm cited in haan 1977 the expression for the expected value of lt denoted by e lt of the first order dependence in drought periods can be obtained using the markov chain of order 1 mc1 sharma and panu 2010 as follows 9 e l t 1 l o g f t 1 q q p l o g q q where f is the factor to account for the plotting position in the empirical estimation of the exceedance probability that is in the hazen plotting position formula the exceedance probability 0 5 t t sample size so the return period is equal to t 0 5 2t or f 2 likewise in the weibull plotting position formula f 1 in this analysis the plotting position formula adamowski 1981 developed for the canadian rivers has been used the formula evaluates the exceedance probability 0 75 t 0 25 so f 1 33 1 0 25 t 1 33 as t is generally large the term qq stands for the conditional probability of the present period being drought given the previous period was also a drought and likewise qp stands for the present period being drought given the previous period was wet the simple probabilities of drought q and wet p conditions add to 1 that is q p 1 likewise qq pq 1 pp qp 1 where the conditional probabilities qq and qp can be interpreted in sync with qq and qp for the mc1 situation the mean length e l lm can be expressed sen 1977 as follows 10 e l l m 1 1 q q the conditional probabilities qq and qp can be computed from the following relationship due to cramer and leadbetter 1967 and these terms are elaborated further in sharma and panu 2010 11 q q q 1 2 π q 0 ρ e x p z 0 2 1 ϑ 1 ϑ 2 0 5 d ϑ where ϑ is a dummy variable of integration and ρ is the lag 1 autocorrelation as defined earlier the integral in eq 11 can be evaluated by a numerical procedure and the values of qq for a given ρ and z0 can be computed it is noted that for an independent or random shi sequence qq q eq 11 can also be used to estimate pp by replacing qq by pp and q by p 1 q therefore an estimate of qp can be found as qp 1 pp which can be used in eq 9 for the estimation of the longest drought lengths e lt it should be noted that for the mc0 situation such as the case for annual shi sequences qq qp q the characteristic length lc can be expressed as follows 12 lc ɸ e l 1 ɸ e lt the parameter ɸ can be designated as the weighing parameter as it weighs the mean drought length e l and the longest drought length e lt the value of ɸ varies from 0 to 1 and is determined either through optimization or trial and error procedure once a proper value of lc has been determined the eq 6 is integrated numerically to evaluate p m yj and then the value of integrand is inserted in eq 3 to yield an estimate of p mt yj letting these values of yj as y0 j 0 0 y1 j 1 0 05 y2 j 2 0 10 y3 j 3 0 15 yn1 30 for the annual time scale with an increment δ 0 05 e mt can be computed using eq 3 it is noted that the upper limit of summation n1 will vary from annual to monthly time scales for the annual scale the maximum value of yj 30 was found to be sufficient whereas for the monthly time scale the maximum value of yj 150 was found to be adequate for integration purposes the yj values were broken down into small intervals with a step δ of 0 05 so n1 was found to be 600 30 0 05 at the annual scale and 3000 at the monthly scale the integration of the normal probability function eq 6 is also performed numerically to compute p mt yj 1 mt yj and additional details are presented in sharma and panu 2013 a simplified version for the estimation of e mt can be developed based on the mean of the drought intensity i in combination with eqs 7 and 12 as follows 13 e m t l c μ d from eq 13 it is apparent that e mt is based on the mean μ d of the drought intensity i only and is independent of the variance of drought intensity whereas eq 2 involves both mean and variance of the drought intensity i implicitly for the estimation of e mt in the estimation process the entities e lt e mt and e dt are designated as lt e mt e and dt e respectively in summary the dm based methodology entails the counting and modelling procedures the counting procedure works on the observed historical data of flow sequences without the use of equations or models in the modelling procedure the extreme number theorem and the assumption of a normal pdf of drought magnitudes m the probability based relationships are used to estimate mt e and dt e σav mt e for the monthly time scale or σ mt e for the annual time scale the statistics μ σ ρ in the aforesaid relationships are derived from the historical data on flow sequences at the monthly time scale it was noted by sharma and panu 2013 that in canadian rivers shi sequences tend to follow the gamma pdf vis à vis the normal pdf for annual shi sequences therefore at the mean level of truncation with z0 0 the drought probability q would be greater than 0 5 in this situation firstly the gamma distributed shi value at the truncation level equal to the mean denoted as shi0 0 is transformed into its equivalent standard normal value z0 using the following wilson hilferty viessman and lewis 2003 equation 14 z 0 3 c v c v s h i 0 1 0 333 1 0 333 c v the drought probability q is determined using the following polynomial equation chow et al 1988 or by consulting the standard normal probability tables 15 b 0 5 1 0 196854 z 0 0 115194 z 0 2 0 000344 z 0 3 0 019527 z 0 4 4 where b q for z0 0 1 b q for z0 0 and z0 represents the absolute value of z0 the error evaluated by this formula is less than 0 00025 it can further be stated that for z0 0 q 0 5 1 b 1 0 5 which is exactly the value from the standard normal probability tables found in statistical textbooks for the gamma pdf the value of z0 at the mean level i e shi0 0 would turn out 0 and its corresponding q would be 0 5 at the monthly time scale for example in the case of the bow river with shi0 0 and cv 0 24 z0 and q respectively would work out to be 0 08 and 0 53 for the normal pdf of shi z0 shall take on the value of 0 and q 0 5 in the dm based procedure dt e or dt o should correspond to vr obtained from the spa which forms the objective criterion for refining the dm based estimates once the dm based estimates i e appropriate values of the entities lt and mt have been evaluated either by the counting or a modelling procedure then these values are used for the estimation of reservoir volumes 3 data acquisition and calculations of reservoir volumes spa and dm based methods twenty three rivers across canada table 1 and fig 1 were involved in the analysis the rivers encompassed drainage areas ranging from 97 to 74 600 km2 with the data bank spanning from 44 to 106 years the flow data for these 23 rivers were extracted from the canadian hydrological database environment canada 2018 the first step in the analysis was to assess the reservoir volumes vr employing the spa with the use of the annual and monthly streamflow data in the non standardized format at the draft level 1 μ appropriate for the desired time scale in this format the draft level was taken uniformly at 1 μ across all the 12 months the procedure documented in linsley et al 1992 was used and the calculations were accomplished by writing macros in visual basic and coupling them with associated data sets in the microsoft excel framework further the values of vr were calculated using the non standardized flow sequences with the draft at corresponding mean levels of respective months non uniform draft the standardized vr denoted as vr was also computed using shi sequences while truncating at level 0 uniform draft such a computational procedure was found meaningful for the estimation of actual σ denoted as σact and discussed below it should be noted that to increase the number of samples the rivers with large data size such as the bow english lepreau beaurivage bevearbank and north margaree were also analyzed by forming two additional subsamples with the data size of 40 years or more tables 2 and 3 this type of analysis created 30 33 samples from 23 rivers to obtain robust and reliable estimates of the performance statistics for example for the bow river 3 these subsamples are named as 3a from 1911 2016 3b from 11911 1973 and 3c from 1955 to 2016 and likewise for other rivers at the annual level however some such subsamples such as river 5 and 21 table 2 yielded abnormal values of mt o and therefore were discarded from further consideration in the dm based counting procedure the standardized annual and monthly flow sequences shi sequences were utilized for the abstraction of mt o and dt o values the values of drought probability q were obtained by the counting procedure in which the shi sequences were chopped at level z 0 0 representing the mean at the mean level the probability of drought q may not be equal to 0 5 because of the non normal pdf of the flow sequences and also due to sampling variations in general the annual flows tend to follow the normal pdf in canadian settings sharma and panu 2014 such that at the mean level the values of q cluster around 0 50 table 2 column 2 at the monthly time scale such values are significantly greater than 0 50 because of the gamma pdf of the flow sequences sharma and panu 2010 2014 the standardized values of the drought magnitudes i e mt o were converted to dt 0 by involving a suitable value of σ at the annual time scale there is only one set of the mean μ and standard deviation σ whereas there are respectively 12 such sets at the monthly time scale a simple choice would be to use the average denoted as σav of 12 values of σ s i e the monthly case in the present paper actual values of σ denoted as σact were worked out by comparing the values of vr using standardized and non standardized monthly flow sequences that is if the vr involving non standardized sequences variable draft at the mean level for the respective month is denoted as v and that is by shi sequences as v then v σact v the value of σact was found to vary from σav as is evident from the ratios of σact to σav shown in column 4 of table 1 the ratio denoted by r σ ranged from 0 68 to 1 39 with the mean value equal to 1 01 1 and a standard deviation 0 20 in other words σav can be taken as a reasonable estimator of the standard deviation for the calculation of drought volumes i e dt o σav mt o at the monthly scale it is noted that dt is a general term which takes the notation as dt o for the observed or counted values and as dt e for the estimated values likewise mt is a general term that takes the notation as mt o for the observed or counted values and as mt e for the estimated values henceforth vr refers to the spa based and dt the deficiency volume refers to the dm based reservoir volumes a major consideration for comparative analysis between vr and dt requires an appropriate selection of the draft level since the evaluation of dt is tractable at the 1μm level in monthly shi sequences so this level was chosen for assessment and comparison with vr 4 results the reservoirs across the rivers can be sized using the annual flow or the monthly flow sequences the sizing based on annual flow sequences is simpler as the annual flows can be easily synthesized based on the existing stochastic or deterministic methods of streamflow simulation however to improve upon the accuracy and robustness of the reservoir size it is imperative to involve the monthly flow sequences the techniques of monthly streamflow synthesis are also reasonably developed and can be used when required grygier and stedinger 1987 kendall and dracup 1991 ideally there is no substitute for the gauged data at the proposed site of the reservoir but in absence of any such gauged data the streamflow synthesis is an attractive alternative in the present study since the gauged data are available so both annual and monthly flow sequences were involved in the evaluation of vr and dt for the sake of convenience and uniformity in the analysis the vr and dt were standardized that is vr is divided by σ at the annual time scale denoted as vr vr σ and by σav at the monthly time scale i e vr σav the standardized term for dt is mt which has been discussed in the foregoing sections 4 1 analysis of reservoir volumes by the spa and the dm based procedure at the annual scale the annual shi sequences were truncated at shi0 0 level 1μ level of the draft and values of mt o were recorded table 2 at the same time vr values were obtained at 1μ level of the draft in the annual flow sequences using the spa and then converted into vr table 2 a review of these values indicates that there exists a considerable difference between these two estimates where values of vr are much larger than mt o intuitively if the draft level is lowered to say αμ level the values of vr thus computed would turn out to be comparable to the values of mt o so the draft levels were lowered and α values turned out in the range of 0 90 1 with a mean equals to 0 955 0 96 and a standard deviation equals 0 028 table 2 stated in another way the draft level of 0 96 μ for vr the spa based estimate corresponds to 1μ level for mt o the dm based estimate to elucidate this point for the bow river 3a table 2 mt o at 1μ level of the draft is 5 76 which equals to vr 5 76 at 0 965 μ level of the draft table 2 this finding is of significance since draft levels less than 1μ and specifically 0 75μ level has been used in the operation of a majority of reservoirs across worldwide rivers involving the spa mcmahon et al 2007 so instead of using the spa one could use the dm procedure to estimate the storage volume of a reservoir another interesting finding is that at the draft levels αμ both vr and mt o converge to the same value for example in the bow river at the draft level 0 905 μ vr mt o table 2 in this study the mean value for such compatibility was found to be 0 892 μ with a standard deviation of 0 083 further at all draft levels less than αμ the vr and mt o are equal with a caveat that α less than a specific value may yield zero value of vr and mt o to elucidate the point consider the case of the bow river where at 1μ vr 14 82 mt o 5 76 at 0 90 μ vr 2 08 mt o 2 08 at 0 72μ vr 0 03 mt o 0 03 and below 0 72 μ both vr and mt o turn out to be 0 thus at the annual scale the minimum draft level is 0 72 μ for the assessment of reservoir volumes in the case of the bow river below this draft level the reservoir sizing at the annual scale is infeasible and thus warranting the consideration of the monthly flow sequences for the analysis of reservoir volume in the estimation process for mt e eqs 2 to 13 were used and the values of mt e so computed are summarized in table 2 both versions of the estimation of mt e were used a eq 13 i e with the mean value of i only and b eq 2 i e with both mean and variance of i it is noted that the crucial parameter in the variance based eq 2 is ɸ whose value needs some degree of calibration by a trial and error procedure in the calibration process therefore ɸ 0 0 0 25 0 50 and 0 75 were attempted and based on an efficiency criterion nash and sutcliffe 1970 a value resulting in the best match between mt o and mt e was chosen for example in the bow river with input parameters t 106 z0 0 ρ 0 because the shi sequences are treated as normal independent sequences the output results are q 0 5 qq qp 0 5 e lt 6 15 e l 2 the value of lc worked out 6 15 for ɸ 0 5 11 for ɸ 0 25 4 08 for ɸ 0 5 and 3 04 for ɸ 0 75 the corresponding values of mt e were computed as 7 88 6 79 5 67 and 4 51 these values were compared to mt o 5 76 and the closest mt e to mt 0 was found 5 67 for all rivers under consideration 4 sets of mt e were evaluated and compared on a 1 1 basis with corresponding mt o the deviations between mt e and mt o were used to evolve the performance parameters viz the nse nash sutcliffe efficiency and the mer mean error and are shown in table 2 it is apparent from this table that values of the nse are low and in some cases negative indicating that the match is weak it is noteworthy to mention that the range of mt e and mt o is small 3 49 6 79 for the annual shi sequences therefore the variance of errors mt e mt o is nearly the same or at times that of mt o however a better 1 1 correspondence should at least render the variance of the errors smaller than mt o that means nse should be a positive quantity with mer close to zero it was noted that for ɸ 0 and 0 25 the mt e values were overestimated mer 31 59 and 15 03 respectively with negative values of nse table 2 for ɸ 0 75 they were underestimated mer 19 95 though with positive value of nse the best value of ɸ was found 0 50 with nse 7 81 and mer 1 62 0 it can also be deduced from table 2 that the simple model eq 13 involving only the mean of drought intensity for mt e resulted in considerable underestimation mer 14 43 even though nse was 4 81 therefore at the annual scale the model with the inclusion of mean and variance of drought intensity eq 2 was found more suitable with the value of ɸ 0 50 based on ɸ 0 5 and using eq 2 it was observed that the deviation between mt o and mt e ranged from 26 to 33 concerning mt o with a mean value of 1 62 for example in the case of the bow river 3a table 2 mt o was observed as 5 76 while the estimated value was 5 67 resulting in a marginal deviation of 1 35 5 76 5 67 5 76 in terms of storage volume it amounts to dt o mt o σ 0 95 109 m3 compared to the estimated value of 0 93 109 m3 the reservoir can be designed at 1 μ level of the draft with the dm based procedure which is equivalent to 0 95 μ draft of the spa however at 1 μ level of the draft the spa yields the reservoir volume of 2 43 109 m3 which is about 250 larger than the dm based estimate such a higher value can be construed as an overdesign and may not be justifiable due to environmental considerations as large areas get submerged and excessive costs involved in the construction of the reservoir system it is noted that this is a typical estimate for the bow river this value could be quite different in other rivers such as for the upper humber river 22 table 2 where vr 2 23 109 m3 and dt o 2 10 109 m3 happen to be very close to each other the overall mean value of vr was found to be 1 85 times of dt table 2 the inverse of which is 0 54 in short on average the spa based volumes are 185 larger than the dm based estimates at the draft level of mean annual flow should a need arise to design the storage equivalent to vr at the draft level equal to 1μ the dm based procedure with the moving average ma smoothing should be considered for the design of reservoir volume sharma and panu 2020 4 2 analysis of reservoir volumes by the spa and the dm based procedure at the monthly scale it was stated in the aforesaid sections that the dm procedure applies to stationary flow sequences which were obtained by standardizing the monthly flows in turn termed as shi sequences at the 1 μm level of the draft the shi sequences were truncated at shi0 0 and mt o were obtained by the counting procedure table 3 likewise at the 1μ level vr values were obtained and compared to mt o table 3 it was found that values of vr were much larger than mt o by iteratively adjusting the draft level to α μ values of vr became comparable to the mt o it is apparent from table 3 that the value of α ranges from 0 71 to 0 89 with a mean of 0 81 for example in the bow river 3a in table 3 α 0 81 or the draft level at 0 81 μ vr mt o 21 87 in the volumetric units 21 87 translates to 0 54 109 m3 mt o σav in tandem with the counting procedure mt e values were estimated using eq 2 or 13 the computation of mt e began by recognizing the fact that monthly shi sequences follow the gamma pdf sharma and panu 2014 therefore at the mean level of shi i e shi0 0 z0 was evaluated through eq 14 and the corresponding value of q was obtained by using eq 15 for example for the bow river at shio 0 z0 was found to be 0 08 column 9 table 3 and the corresponding q 0 53 plugging these values in eq 11 the values of qq and qp were determined as 0 69 and 0 31 column 9 table 3 using the values of qq and qp in eqs 9 and 10 e lt and e l were computed to obtain the value of lc eq 12 an optimal value of ɸ was required at the annual time scale an optimal value of ɸ was found as 0 5 therefore this value was attempted at the monthly time scale as well plugging ɸ 0 5 and using eqs 3 and 2 the value of mt e was found as 16 57 which is smaller than mt o 21 87 as shown in table 3 for all the rivers under consideration the above procedure was used for obtaining the values of mt e the nse and mer were also computed by comparing mt o and mt e values on a 1 1 basis such a comparative analysis yielded nse as 56 95 with mer 11 95 fig 2 a suggesting a poor fit and an underestimation of mt e at this stage ɸ 0 was attempted and it resulted in nse 73 33 but excessive overestimation to the tune of 29 76 an interesting part of this analysis indicated that rivers 1 through 5 provided a good fit table 3 with ɸ 0 whereas the rivers in northern ontario and atlantic canada tended to yield a good fit with ɸ 0 5 further the best criterion for choosing a desired value of ɸ tended to be the ratio qq q and the critical value was found to be 1 22 table 3 last value in column 9 shown in italics the rivers with qq q 1 22 were assigned the ɸ 0 and those with the qq q 1 22 were assigned ɸ 0 5 except for the batchawana river 11 in table 3 in the case of the batchawana river despite qq q being lesser than 1 22 ɸ 0 yielded a better match between mt e and mt o table 3 given the regional hydrologic behavior of the rivers this river was also assigned the ɸ value 0 5 using the above criterion of discrimination the mt e were chosen from table 3 with corresponding ɸ 0 5 or 0 with these values of mt e the 1 1 correspondence between mt o and mt e turned out to be encouraging fig 2b with nse 88 08 and mer 4 with a mild overestimation therefore at the monthly time scale a differential value of ɸ for a region played a crucial role in arriving at the desired value of mt e at this point eq 13 based on the mean of the drought intensity i was used to evaluate mt e the mean value i μd was computed from eq 4 by substituting the values of the z0 and q for example in the bow river 3a table 3 plugging z0 0 08 and q 0 53 in eq 4 resulted in μd 0 83 since drought intensity is treated as a positive quantity therefore the absolute value of μd 0 83 was taken as the mean drought intensity i a value of the mt e was computed using the relationship mt e 0 83 e lt e plugging the needed values in eq 9 one can obtain e lt e equal to 16 integer number and subsequently mt e 13 28 0 83 16 the values of mt e were obtained for all rivers table 3 and compared with mt o on a 1 1 basis in this comparative analysis the performance statistics nse and mer were respectively found as 39 88 and 25 69 suggesting a poor fit but more remarkably acute underestimation succinctly for the estimation of mt e the trivial model eq 13 was found to be inadequate and therefore the mean and variance based eq 2 was necessary for obtaining the robust and reliable values of mt e at the draft level of 1μ table 3 it can be discerned that dt values are larger at the annual scale compared to the monthly scale at the annual scale dt o vr mt o vr denoted as rm was found as 0 54 table 2 and dt e vr mt e vr as 0 55 whereas these ratios were found to be close to 0 27 at the monthly scale table 3 it means that at the monthly scale dt values are too small compared to vr even though at the annual scale the dt is about 54 of the vr it may be justified since this value corresponds to the 0 95 μ level of the draft table 2 furthermore at 89 0 89μ of the draft level table 2 vr and dt o converge to the same value in brevity the annual analysis provides a good guideline to proceed to the monthly scale where the monthly dt values should match at least 54 of the vr in view of the foregoing observation there is a need to find a mechanism to ramp up the values of dt or mt at the monthly scale among other methods a simple mechanism involving the moving average ma smoothing procedure was chosen for example when a monthly shi sequence is used without any moving average smoothing then such a sequence is designated as moving average 1 ma1 sequence and likewise when two consecutive shi values are averaged out it is named as ma2 and with 3 consecutive shi values it is known as ma3 in the process of ma smoothing the mean in the resultant smoothed sequences remains zero though the standard deviation decreases less than 1 and ρ increases i e greater than that for ma1 table 4 column 2 however z0 and q do not change as shi0 0 and cv of the original flow sequences remain unchanged the ma2 or ma3 smoothed sequences are further standardized to conform to the shi sequences mean 0 standard deviation 1 with the value of z0 q and a new value of ρ dt o by the counting procedure and values of dt e were evaluated using relevant equations it is noted that in the process of converting mt o mt e to dt o dt e at each of the ma smoothing σav is used as the multiplier sharma and panu 2020 as noted earlier that these dt o mo or dt e mo values should approximately match the corresponding values at the annual scale i e dt o an or dt e an put it other way mt o mo σav mt o an σ and likewise mt e mo σav mt e an σ note that the subscript an stands for the annual and subscript mo for the month it can thus be worked out mt e mo mt o an σ σav 12 17 mt o an cv cvav and after adjusting the units on annual and monthly bases the ma smoothing ma2 ma3 or ma4 at which the above correspondence is achieved is regarded as the best ma smoothing for example in the case of the bow river 3a in table 2 the mt o an 5 76 cv 0 13 and cvav 0 24 and after plugging these values in the aforesaid relationships and adjusting for the annual and monthly units mt o mo 37 97 and mt e mo 37 38 a review of table 3 river 3a column 3 shows that ma1 based value of mt o mo 21 87 by the counting procedure and likewise the value of mt e mo 24 75 by estimation since the expectation is that the smaller of the mt o mo or mt e mo value must be greater than the desired value of 37 97 but in the ma1 smoothing both of the values are smaller and thus implying that ma1 smoothing is not adequate and one must move to the next i e ma2 smoothing in the ma2 smoothing mt o mo and mt e mo were found as 26 97 and 38 44 table 4 since the smaller value 26 97 is less than 37 97 the desired value therefore ma2 smoothing is also inadequate for the bow river consequently there is a need to proceed to the next i e ma3 smoothing for which case mt o mo was found 38 99 and mt e mo as 51 19 table 4 since the smaller value i e mt o mo is greater than the desired 37 97 value the ma3 smoothing was considered as an appropriate smoothing with the mt value of 38 99 in some situations the ma2 smoothing may prove adequate such as in the case of river 4 i e the south saskatchewan river in which case the desired mt is 40 61 whereas for the ma2 smoothing the value of mt o mo is 57 06 and mt e mo is 45 55 since both values are greater than the desired value so smaller of them should be chosen i e 45 55 the ma2 smoothing also was found to be satisfactory for three rivers viz 4 5 and 18 although ma3 smoothing was found satisfactory for 17 rivers yet three rivers viz 2 13 and 22 required the ma4 smoothing for elucidation the river 2 the athabasca river is chosen in which case mt e mo was found as 37 85 and mt o mo as 51 19 since the smaller value does not yet meet the desired value so one must move to the next i e the ma4 smoothing where mt o mo and mt e mo were respectively found as 64 55 and 59 59 since the smaller value 59 59 was greater than the desired value i e 43 50 therefore the ma4 smoothing was regarded as adequate in short mt o mo and mt e mo both should be the desired value for the chosen ma smoothing and finally smaller between mt o mo and mt e mo should be used for estimation of dt as a counterpart of vr the plots of accepted mt e values against the desired mt with ma2 smoothing generally show under estimation with mer 15 fig 3 a such a plot fig 3b for ma3 smoothing performed better though with mild overestimation mer 10 succinctly the ma3 smoothing can be construed as satisfactory for providing the estimate of dt as a counterpart of vr at the monthly scale based on the above norm of the selection of the desired smoothing i e ma2 ma3 and ma4 all the rivers were re analyzed table 3 the ratio of dt vr was determined and was found to range from 0 33 to 1 06 with an average of 0 57 table 3 based on the results of the ma smoothing a majority of rivers 77 were found to fit the ma3 smoothing for brevity and simplicity therefore the ma3 smoothing can be used for all rivers and the smaller numerical quantity between mt o mo and mt e mo should be used for comparison with the desired value for the ma3 smoothing the mean value of rm dt vr mt vr was found as 0 57 with a range of 0 32 to 0 84 table 4 the value of rm at the monthly scale is slightly higher when compared to 0 54 at the annual scale which is in sync with the general observation that the storage volume at the monthly scale must be higher due to the higher value of cv and ρ than the storage volume at the annual scale 5 discussion it was noted that vr at the draft level of 1 μ or α μ α 1 increases from the annual time scale to the monthly time scale table 5 for example in the case of the bow river at 1 μ draft level the vr is 2 44 109 m3 at the annual scale whereas it is 2 88 109 m3 based on the monthly scale for further comparative purposes the vr values were also computed at the weekly scale table 5 for 3 rivers representing 3 typical regions canadian prairies northern ontario and atlantic canada in general at any draft level αμ the vr increases from the annual up to the weekly scale which concurs with the increase in cv and ρ from the annual up to the weekly flow sequences it was noted earlier that annual analysis may provide the vr estimates only up to a certain level of the draft such as for the bow river it was 0 72 μ table 5 below this level the vr turned out to be 0 under this situation the monthly analysis provides improved estimates of vr table 5 one can easily interpret from table 5 that vr can be computed at the draft as low as 0 20 μ level however the corresponding dt e estimates cannot be worked out by using the dm procedure because of the stationarity limitation it is also apparent from table 5 that vr values level off from the monthly to the weekly time scale whereas there is a sharp increase from the annual to the monthly scale such an observation signifies that the storage requirement computed based on the annual and monthly scales is adequate whereas the weekly analysis adds only marginal benefit also the simulation of the weekly flow sequences is relatively challenging and hence practically limiting the analysis up to the monthly scale it was found that at the monthly scale hydrologic characteristics of canadian rivers translate at 1 μ level of the draft in shi sequences to 0 70 0 90 μ of the uniform cutoff flow level across the 12 months in terms of the vr table 3 this 0 70 0 90 μ level thus hovers around 0 75 μ of the draft level also noted by mcmahon et al 2007 this fact was ascertained by looking at the monthly flow data of the mitta mitta river as published in mcmahon and mein 1978 at the draft of 0 70μ the reservoir volumes by both methods were found almost identical with a value of 878 106 m3 likewise at the annual scale for the draft of 0 77μ the reservoir volumes by the spa and dm converged to the same value i e 860 106 m3 the behavior of dt is just the reverse i e dt decreases from the annual to the monthly time scale table 5 numbers in bold italics it is noted that dt either denotes dt o or dt e for the bow river these values are 0 95 109 m3 and 0 54 109 m3 the monthly based value is 43 smaller than the annual one which are significantly different from each other furthermore similar behavior is exhibited by other rivers table 5 values in bold italics the calculations for vr are linked to the availability of the flow in the river whereas the calculations for dt are hinged on the demand for water due to the deficiency of the flow in a river in the wake of a drought one may be tempted to store as much water as is available though there are constraints on the economic and environmental concerns on the other hand based on the need a volume of 0 54 109 m3 is sufficient there is a vast difference among these values which calls for a need to shore up dt values by the ma smoothing to an appropriate level in canadian rivers the ma3 smoothing exhibits promise in ramping up the dt value while utilizing the monthly shi sequences as elucidated in the foregoing sections it has been noted mcmahon et al 2007 that majority of reservoirs at the global scale are designed to handle the draft at the level of 0 75 μ in that case spa based and dm based estimates converge to the same value likewise on the monthly scale this draft level is 0 81 μ table 3 that means at the draft levels adopted globally the spa and dm based method yield the same estimates for example the estimates for the mitta mitta river by various methods at the draft level of 0 75μ at the monthly scale are shown in table 6 the value based on the dm method is also listed in the last row of this table it is evident from table 6 that dm 9 based method estimate lies between spa 3 gould gamma 6 and behavioral analysis 8 it has been reported in the literature mcmahon and mein 1978 that the gould gamma model and behavioral analysis yield better results in view of the least bias and standard error from this point of view the dm based estimates are relatively closer i e within 14 error from the above two estimates when comparing with the spa based estimates dm is slightly less i e within 10 6 which lends further support to the dm based estimates at the higher draft levels 0 90μ there is divergence in which spa provides much higher estimates relative to the dm procedure for example in the case of the mitta mitta river at 0 90 μ spa yields 2225 106 m3 and dm procedure yields 1225 106 m3 nearly half of spa likewise at 1 μ the estimates are 3430 106 m3 for spa and 1410 106 m3 for dm to bring dm estimates to the level of spa at such high drafts the ma smoothing is needed in the shi sequences for the mitta mitta river for example the ma3 smoothing is adequate to bring up the reservoir volume 3394 106 m3 within 1 margin of error to the level of spa based value 3430 106 m3 likewise at 0 9 μ level ma2 smoothing is adequate to bring the reservoir volume to 2306 106 m3 within 3 5 margin of error when compared to the spa based value 2225 106 m3 at this stage it is imperative that various methods of estimating the reservoir capacity discussed in mcmahon et al 2007 be evaluated at such high draft levels at a monthly scale the methods worthy of consideration are the gould probability matrix method behavioral analysis vogel and stedinger method 1987 adeloye et al 2003 procedure in view of their current use in reservoir design calculations using these methods and in turn comparing them with the dm based method would form the part of another study currently being pursued by the authors it can however be stated that at the draft of 0 75 μ dm based estimates provide compatible values with other promising methods of reservoir sizing the question then arises as to why dm estimates differ from spa based estimates though they are using the same data on flow sequences the answer lies in the assumptions and the methodology used in analyses the dm based methodology is based on the premise of the deficit below a certain draft or threshold level with no concern to the storage content of the reservoir the drought episodes happen randomly or no association between them though within each episode there is persistence between drought periods the analysis provides an estimate of the shortage of water that must be fulfilled during the longest drought period with the assumption that all smaller episodes prior to and after the longest drought period will also be catered to by this computed volume of water during the intervening periods between drought episodes there would be sufficient flow to replenish the water used during the drought periods a reservoir is expected to be built to store the water as dictated by the amount of volume equivalent to this largest shortage and water should come from the surplus periods on the contrary the spa begins with the basic assumption that a reservoir is already in place and it keeps filling and emptying with the interaction of inflow and draft in this process the maximum historical drawdown between full to the minimal water level in the reservoir is taken as the reservoir volume this volume thus would cater for the smaller antecedent droughts while storing enough water for the severe drought to occur if a drought of slightly less severity occurs immediately after this severe drought spa still provides some water which is not the case with the dm procedure in other words the spa computes conservative estimates based on the availability of flow whereas the dm is based on the need for water which should be satisfied during the worst drought period on record 6 conclusions the dm based procedure for reservoir sizing has been developed using flow sequences at the annual and monthly scales in canadian rivers the shi sequences standardized annual and monthly river flow sequences were used to evolve the estimates of drought deficiency volumes dt which were compared with the spa based reservoir volumes vr in the dm based procedure one crucial parameter is the characteristic drought length which is controlled by a parameter ɸ at the annual scale the value of ɸ was found to be 0 5 for all rivers under consideration on the monthly scale ɸ was found 0 5 for rivers in northern ontario and atlantic canada whereas it was found to be 0 for rivers in the canadian prairies at the annual scale it was found that the dt 54 of the vr or spa yields nearly 185 larger volume than that based on the dm procedure at the draft of 1μ mean annual flow in the shi sequences at the monthly scale at the mean level designated as μm m ranging from 1 to 12 of the draft in the individual months the shi sequences yielded much smaller values of dt and were found to be 27 of vr the monthly dt values were ramped up to attain the level of 54 of vr by the moving average smoothing ma3 of 3 shi values at both time scales draft at the mean level in shi sequences corresponds to 0 95 μ average of 0 96 at annual and 0 94 at monthly in terms of spa the dm based method works on the standardized annual and monthly river flow sequences termed shi sequences the annual shi sequences can be analyzed at any level of draft such as 1 μ 0 9 μ 0 8 μ 0 75μ etc however at the monthly scale in the strict statistical sense shi sequences can be analyzed only at respective mean levels μm of draft across months i e the case of a variable draft level in view of the stationarity requirements for statistical analysis the moving average ma procedure can successfully be used to ramp up the dm based deficiency volumes to the level of spa based reservoir volumes the research is presently underway in which the shi sequences can be analyzed at the uniform draft level across all months using the dm based procedure the dm based procedure offers a novel algorithm of design of reservoir capacity which opens a platform for comparison with techniques such as extended deficiency analysis behavioral analysis hardison generalized method phien method vogel and stedinger method

8186,study region yuanzegou watershed in qingjian wangdonggou watershed in changwu the chinese loess plateau study focus hillslopes are the predominant land form unit on earth and despite its importance in maintaining groundwater supplies in many parts of the world groundwater recharge on hillslopes is poorly understood we hypothesize that groundwater recharge in the deep unsaturated zones of hillslopes is facilitated mainly by soil matrix flow and the recharge rates are much smaller in hillslopes than on flat landscapes to test the hypothesis seven 15 20 m long cores were collected from areas of different land uses to determine the groundwater recharge rates and its controls in deep unsaturated zones of hillslopes at a sub humid and a semi arid watershed located on the chinese loess plateau new hydrologic insights for the region the tritium distribution in each soil profile exhibits a well defined bell shape signifying that soil matrix displacement is the main recharge mechanism the tritium peak was located between depths of 9 33 m 11 01 m at the semiarid watershed and 6 29 m 7 22 m at the sub humid watershed and the recharge rates varied from 24 5 to 33 8 mm yr 1 these recharge rates account for 4 7 of the long term precipitation which is approximately 56 of the recharge typically seen on flat landscapes groundwater recharges were mainly controlled by soil texture and land use changes but exhibited little impact from the climatic difference between the two watersheds keywords groundwater recharge tritium tracer method hillslope the loess plateau soil texture land use change 1 introduction groundwater recharge is defined as the soil water flux that enters groundwater from the overlying soil and is a critical link in the hydrological cycle it is one of the most important hydrogeological considerations in both water resource management and waste disposal in arid and semi arid regions scanlon et al 2006 wood 1999 the groundwater recharge rate is closely linked to the soil water flux leaving the root zone which is the deep drainage rate deep drainage water generally reaches groundwater but there are circumstances which can alter deep drainage such as lateral flow due to an impermeable layer located between the bottom of the root zone and the groundwater table as such deep drainage rates are typically equivalent to groundwater recharge rates and so in most studies the two terms are used interchangeably scanlon et al 2006 groundwater recharge rates are often difficult to measure directly due to the complexity of the vadose zone and its relative inaccessibility de vries and simmers 2002 methods such as water balance groundwater fluctuation and modeling based techniques have often been used to estimate the recharge of groundwater but they are not suitable for the deep loess semi arid area this is because the response of groundwater to precipitation damped remarkably and the errors associated with these methods may exceed the magnitude of the measured recharged rate in these regions allison et al 1994 scanlon et al 2002 due to limitation of the other methods much effort on recharge estimation in arid and semi arid regions has focused on environmental tracers including the chloride mass balance cmb and tritium tracer methods because the attractive feature of tracers approaches is that they can intergrate recharge over a long term gee and hillel 1988 scanlon et al 2002 the boundary conditions required measurements and associated equations for common groundwater recharge determination methods are summarized in table 1 recharge estimates in unsaturated zones are typically based on flat landscapes where all precipitation enters soil however hillslopes are the predominant terrestrial landform and are the fundamental landscape unit that control the processes which partition precipitation into vertical and lateral flow to groundwater and streams on steep slopes a substantial amount of precipitation may be converted to lateral flow resulting in low soil water storage and groundwater recharge considerable attention has been focused on lateral flow processes such as overland flow and subsurface interflow or groundwater flow especially those processes that lead to the rapid movement of water and or effusion of old water into stream flow weiler and mcdonnell 2004 however the groundwater recharge on hillslopes may be different from that of flat landscapes because the controls on groundwater recharge are different groundwater recharge on flat land may be controlled mainly by extreme precipitation events taylor et al 2013 but perhaps less so on sloping landscapes due to the generation of overland flow which arises from intense rainfall weiler and mcdonnell 2004 hillslope hydrology is a complex system and the water movement through hillslopes influences the deep percolation and fast flow through fractures that may contribute to catchment streamflow bronstert 1999 buttle and mcdonald 2002 much effort has been made on the hillslope runoff baumann et al 2008 buttle and mcdonald 2002 or hillslope soil hydrological process on water storage or evapotranspiration geroy et al 2011 lee and kim 2019 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 while less was researched on the deep groundwater recharge groundwater recharge on hillslopes can be small but in some areas it may be the only input to groundwater it also plays an important role in the transit time distribution of precipitation contributing to streamflow allison et al 1994 despite its importance there is a poor understanding of the vertical flow component in groundwater recharge in hillslopes salve et al 2012 previous studies on deep percolation or groundwater recharge in hillslopes were mainly focused on thin unsaturated zone of humid areas with water balance based on hydrometric observations graham et al 2010 lysimeter analysis heppner et al 2007 or modelling bronstert 1999 in these areas event scale groundwater recharge as a percentage of precipitation can be more than 30 buttle and mcdonald 2002 graham et al 2010 kosugi et al 2006 however the recharge ratio is often less than 10 in semiarid areas scanlon et al 2006 due to large uncertainty disqualifying water balance based approach for determining and evaluating the control factor for groundwater recharge of hillslopes further little is known on the relative difference between groundwater recharges of hillslopes and flat land this is because determining groundwater recharge on sloping landscapes is relatively complex and many of the popular methods which are applicable on flat landscapes are not suitable for sloping landscapes for example the cmb method has been widely applied on flat landscapes but on hillslopes has many challenges in terms of fulfilling the prerequisite assumptions of the method wood 1999 in some cases cmb may be directly applicable to a watershed if it is a closed system hayashi et al 1998 or produces a steady outflow with known water flux and chloride concentration guan et al 2010 however for the purposes of soil management we still need to improve our understanding of groundwater recharge on hillslopes at the point scale tritium as an environmental tracer has been used widely in evaluating groundwater recharge dincer et al 1974 unlike many other tracers such as chloride tritium is part of water and thus participates in all hydrological processes therefore tritium is an ideal tracer for water and is particularly suited for the determination of groundwater recharge in the unsaturated zone in arid and semiarid zones two methods have been used for this purpose tritium peak method and total tritium method the total tritium method requires a full record of tritium concentrations in precipitation between the 1960s and the date of sampling because there is large spatial and temporal variability in the tritium concentrations in precipitation the total tritium method can only be applied to the few locations around the globe where a full record is available a few attempts have been made to reconstruct the precipitation tritium records at locations without a full record li and si 2018 however these efforts have been met with limited success due to the sparsity of the long term precipitation tritium records necessary to validate the methods in this regard the tritium peak depth method is particularly attractive because it requires only the peak depth from the measured tritium distribution in the soil profile table 1 however the tritium peak method is not applicable to soil where significant preferential flow occurs allison et al 1994 furthermore tritium has a short half life 12 3 year and consequently the tritium in the soil will become undetectable within a few decades fortunately lin and wei 2006 reported a distinct post bomb tritium peak in the deep unsaturated zone of the chinese loess plateau this tritium peak and its location provide a valuable scientific tool and offer a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of long term groundwater recharge on sloping landscapes therefore the objective of this study is to determine the controls and mechanisms of groundwater recharge in the deep unsaturated zone of the semi arid region of the chinese loess plateau by capitalizing on the radioactive tritium in the deep unsaturated zone we will 1 estimate groundwater recharge rates on hillslopes and 2 identify and compare the local and regional controls of groundwater recharge 2 material and methods 2 1 site description two sites were selected on hillslopes of the chinese loess plateau one site is located in yuanzegou watershed 37 14 n 110 20 e fig 1 in qingjian county shaanxi province the area experiences a semi arid continental climate with a mean annual temperature of 8 6 c the long term 1953 2013 mean annual precipitation is 454 mm 70 of which occurs from august to october yuanzegou watershed has a very rugged hill and gully type topography which is typical for this region of the loess plateau the main stream channel is incised down to the underlying bedrock creating topographic relief of more than 200 m where the main slope gradient lies between 0 and 35 the unsaturated zone is relatively homogeneous in soil texture varying from sandy loam to silt loam with a thickness of 80 300 m the watershed was under rain fed cereal cultivation before 1999 growing predominately corn and wheat since 2000 the land surface has been progressively converted into primarily rain fed red jujube forest and grassland for reducing soil erosion four hillslopes at the yuanzegou watershed were selected for soil coring in 2015 two of the hillslopes contained dwarf jujube trees ziziphus jujuba mill 7 and 16 years old respectively planted in 3 m by 2 m grids the other two hillslopes consisted of grassland which are dominated by grasses such as stipa bungeana and brushwoods such as artemisia gmelini both the grassland and jujube forest sites were cropland prior to conversion to the current land use additional site information for the four hillslopes is included in table 2 the other study site is the wangdonggou watershed 35 14 n 107 41 e fig 1 which is located within the southeastern portion of the loess plateau in changwu county shaanxi province this region has a sub humid continental climate with a long term 51 year mean annual temperature of 9 4 c the long term 1957 2015 mean annual precipitation is 578 mm of which 55 occurs between july and september the soils are predominantly silt loam textured with silt contents greater than 50 the depth from the soil surface to the water table ranges from 30 to 100 m the land uses include rain fed farmlands and orchards on flat upland portions and rain fed grasslands and forests on hillslopes a typical south facing hillslope was selected for the tritium sampling in the wangdonggou watershed the slope was cultivated prior to 1960 and has since been converted to rain fed grassland in 2014 upper middle and lower slope positions were selected for soil coring to avoid the spatial variability and the influence of slope position on groundwater recharge within a watershed and the additional sites information in wangdonggou watershed is included in table 2 the detail profile soil water particle size distributions with soil depth can be referred to li et al 2018 2 2 sampling methods a hand auger with extensions was used to collect the soil cores at sampling intervals of 0 2 m up to depths of 15 20 m each soil core sample was well mixed and then divided into three parts one part was placed immediately into high density polyethylene plastic bottles sealed with parafilm and kept frozen until tritium analysis was performed and the remaining two parts were collected in aluminum and polyethylene containers and later used for the determination of soil water content and particle size distribution respectively the mass based soil water contents were determined using the oven dry method where the soil was dried at 105 c for a minimum of 10 h or until reaching constant mass the soil particle size fractions were measured using the pipette method and characterized according to the usda system which defines soil separates as sand 2 0 05 mm silt 0 05 0 002 mm and clay 0 002 mm due to the relatively homogeneous nature of the loess only samples from the depths which showed substantial changes in soil water contents were used for particle size analysis for water isotope analysis soil water was extracted using cryogenic vacuum distillation otieno et al 2006 voltas et al 2015 approximately 8 ml of extracted water and scintillation solution hisafe3 were prepared at a ratio of 8 12 and then stored in the dark for a period of 12 h before testing tritium activity reported as count per minute cpm averaged over a counting duration of 400 min was measured with a low background liquid scintillation counter quantulus 1220 perkinelmer singapore the standard error of the liquid scintillation counter was approximately 5 tu and the detection limit defined as 3 29 times greater than the measurement error was 16 5 tu armbruster and pry 2008 after correcting for background noise the measured cpm was subsequently transformed into tritium units tu a detailed description of this procedure can be found in jakonić et al 2014 and nikolov et al 2013 in order to determine the active layer of soil water dynamics of each test sites a tubular time domain reflectometry tdr system trime iph t3 imko germany was employed to measure the volumetric soil water content dynamics of different jujube stands 6 and 15 year old every other week in 2014 at yuanzegou watershed li et al 2017a and soil water contents were measured every 10 days from 2015 2016 with a neutron probe in a grassland at the wangdonggou long term experimental station 1 km away from the soil core sampling site in the wangdonggou watershed according to gao et al 2014 the soil water dynamics in jujube and grassland behaved similar so we supposed that they had a similar active layer of soil water dynamics in yuanzegou watershed meanwhile the measured root length densities of the jujube stands decreased exponentially with soil depth with more than 95 of fine roots located within 0 1 8 m soil layers in 6 and 15 year old jujube stands in the sampling year 2014 in yuanzegou watershed li et al 2017a similarly in wangdougou watershed 95 of the fine roots of grasslands were located within the 0 1 5 m soil layer li et al 2018 the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 was used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration pet in the wangdonggou watershed using meteorological data from the china meteorological data network as there was no weather station available near the yuanzegou watershed data from the adjacent station in suide county shaanxi province 37 30 n 110 13 e were used to estimate pet at the yuanzegou watershed 2 3 methodology for groundwater recharge

zone and i is the time it takes for tritium in precipitation to penetrate to the bottom of the active root zone we capitalized on the tritium peak depth method to determine groundwater recharge in this study because first groundwater recharge is dominated by soil matrix flow on the chinese loess plateau second the deep loessal thickness more than 50 m at our study site retained the whole tritium profiles this would not be possible for areas with thin unsaturated zone or with substantial macropore flow in unsaturated zone 2 4 determination of peak concentration depth the accurate determination of the tritium peak concentration depth is essential for the tritium peak depth method a bell shaped tritium concentration distribution in the soil profile may be fit by a modified gaussian function which resembles the solution to the convection dispersion equation for a conservative tracer jury and horton 2004 3 c z t m 0 z 2 j w π d t 3 e x p z z 0 2 2 d t where c z t is the tracer concentration as a function of depth z and time t z 0 is the mean depth and d is the apparent dispersion coefficient m 0 and j w are the total mass of 3h in the soil profile and steady state soil water flux respectively however these are treated as fitting parameters in this study although d may not represent the true dispersion coefficient due to the radioactive exponential nature of the decay of the tritium eq 3 remains a physically plausible model for determining the peak depth 2 5 statistical analysis for a given standard error of two treatments the difference between the means of the two treatments can be tested using the following 4 t x y σ x 2 σ y 2 where x and y are the means of variables x and y respectively σ x and σ y are the standard errors of x and y respectively 3 results 3 1 yuanzegou watershed the four sites have different textural layering and consequently the soil textures at the same depths from the soil surface differed between the sites fig 2 the soil water contents varied with depth within each of the four soil profiles but they showed a positive correlation with clay content especially at depths below 2 m fig 2 table 3 the coefficient of determination between the clay and soil water contents for the four sites is 0 68 fig 3 surprisingly land use did not alter the relationship between soil water content and clay content fig 3 the vertical variability in clay content expressed as the standard deviation of clay content in the displacement zone showed no clear trends with the increases in peak depth or pore water velocity table 3 this indicates that neither the peak location nor the average pore water velocity are greatly affected by the textural stratification in the soil profile which may be due in part to mixing over long time periods 50 years dagan 1989 there were elevated soil water contents within the profiles especially just above textural interfaces fig 2 for example there is a remarkable increase in soil water content at the 2 5 m depth of the 7 year old jujube site which is located directly above the fine coarse layer interface furthermore above the interface the clay content is approximately 18 g 100g 1 and below the interface it decreases to 15 g 100g 1 this change in soil texture and associated hydraulic properties may have slowed the downward flow of water resulting in elevated soil water contents above the interface this phenomenon occurred in all 4 soil profiles fig 2 it is possible to quantify the heterogeneity in soil particle size distribution using the standard deviation of the clay content within the soil profile however the standard deviation of the clay contents in this study did not show any obvious trend with the average soil water content within a soil profile table 3 this suggests that the heterogeneity in soil texture within the soil profile was not the main control of soil water content and consequently of soil water storage the four sites have a well defined bell shaped tritium distribution within the soil profile fig 4 with the peak concentrations of 60 80 tu located at depths between 7 12 m the exact depths were not readily identifiable but may be obtained by fitting eq 3 to the measured tritium distribution within each soil profile using a nonlinear least square procedure sigmaplot 13 systat london the coefficients of determination were between 0 86 and 0 94 for the 4 soil profiles and the fitted peak depth had a small estimated standard error 0 18 m showing excellent goodness of fit for each profile the fitted peak depth varies from 9 33 m at the 7 year old jujube site to 11 01 m in the 16 year old grassland fig 4 table 3 this high variability in the tritium peak depth is somewhat surprising considering the relatively small differences in the average clay contents among the four sites it is remarkable that the 7 year old jujube and grassland sites had shallower peak penetration depths than the 16 year old jujube and grassland sites table 3 this indicates that the 16 year old jujube and grassland sites had a higher pore water velocity than the 7 year old jujube and grassland sites table 3 according to solute transport theory the dispersion coefficient is approximately linearly correlated to average pore water velocity the larger the pore water velocity the larger the dispersion coefficient jury and horton 2004 due to their larger dispersion coefficients the 16 year old jujube and grassland sites had lower peak concentrations of tritium than the 7 year old jujube and grassland sites fig 4 in addition the shape of the tritium distributions around the peak concentrations are strikingly similar between the 16 year old jujube and grassland sites despite the differences in soil textural stratification fig 2 the temporal variability of soil water contents reduced considerably below 1 4 m fig 5 a b therefore it can be assumed that the depth of 1 4 m is the bottom of the active layer of soil water dynamics the active layer of soil water dynamics represents the long term annual rainfall penetration depth suo et al 2018 thus on average it took roughly 1 year for rain water to infiltrate to 1 4 m as the tritium moves with the soil water we can assume it took roughly 1 year for the tritium peak concentration to pass the 1 4 m depth bai et al 2016 chen et al 2008 zhao et al 2012 below 1 4 m soil water and tritium in the water move at steady state considering that the long term average infiltration depth also this active layer of soil water dynamic is deeper than the active root zone which is defined as 60 of total fine root mass fig 5c thus it is reasonable that we considered d r was 1 4 m when i was 1 year using eq 2 to calculate the pore water velocity given this information the long term average pore water velocity during the past 51 years can be calculated from eq 2 the resulting average pore water velocities were 184 mm yr 1 for jujube site and 185 mm yr 1 for the 16 year old grassland site and 152 and 161 mm yr 1 at the 7 year old jujube and grassland sites respectively table 3 the two grassland and two jujube sites had groundwater recharge rates between 25 8 and 32 2 mm yr 1 table 3 the precipitation infiltration coefficient which is defined as the ratio of recharge rate to mean annual precipitation was 5 7 for the two grassland and two jujube sites 3 2 wangdonggou watershed the soil water contents monitored during 2015 2016 are shown in fig 5b the range of temporal variation maximum to minimum is reduced considerably below depths of 1 4 m therefore the active root zone can be defined as 1 4 m fig 5b soil tritium concentrations at wangdonggou watershed also showed bell shaped distributions the coefficients of determination between the fitted eq 5 and measured tritium distributions were 0 84 0 97 and 0 95 for the upper mid and lower slope position where their best fit peak depths were at 6 29 7 17 and 7 22 m respectively fig 4 table 3 the groundwater recharge rates determined using the same method as at yuanzegou watershed are 24 5 26 5 and 27 9 mm yr 1 for the upper mid and lower slope positions respectively table 3 the precipitation infiltration coefficient is approximately 4 5 which is similar to that of yuanzegou watershed 3 3 uncertainty of estimated groundwater recharge rates because there is little uncertainty in the time duration n between 1963 to the time of sampling we can assume that the uncertainty in r primarily originates from the uncertainty in 1 the peak depth d 2 the thickness of the active root zone dr and 3 the average soil water content θ in the displacement zone between dr and d based on the first order perturbation analysis of eq 1 the variance in estimated r σ r 2 can be calculated as 5 σ r 2 r d 2 σ d 2 r d r 2 σ d r 2 r θ 2 σ θ 2 θ n i 2 σ d 2 θ n i 2 σ d r 2 d d r n i 2 σ θ 2 where n 51 and 52 for yuanzegou and wangdonggou watersheds respectively and i 1 year σ d σ d r a n d σ θ are the standard errors of d d r and θ respectively the largest standard error of d is σ d 0 18 m table 3 the measurement error of soil water content using the oven dry method is generally taken as 0 01 m3 m 3 considering there are always more errors in field sampling than in the laboratory it is reasonable to assume the measurement error of 0 02 m3 m 3 where its standard error may be approximated as σ θ 0 01 m3 m 3 furthermore the depth of the active root zone as suggested by the majority of the literature is between 1 0 and 2 0 m and therefore the maximum deviation introduced by assuming a thickness of the active root zone of 1 4 m is 0 5 m assuming this represents the 95 confidence range the standard error of d r σ d r is 250 mm according to eq 5 σ r 2 2 mm yr 1 which is the maximum standard error introduced by the uncertainties from peak depth thickness of the active root zone and average soil water content consequently the 95 confidence intervals of the estimated recharge are r 4 4 mm yr 1 3 4 statistical comparisons within and between wangdonggou and yuanzegou watersheds there was a very small difference 0 2 g 100g 1 in the average clay contents between the four sampling sites within the yuanzhugou watershed and between the three slope positions within wangdonggou watershed table 3 this suggests that on average the soil texture in the soil profiles is quite similar within each watershed given the standard error of the estimated groundwater recharge rate σ r 2 2 mm yr 1 eq 4 was used to test if there is a statistical difference between the different land use types within yuanzegou and between the three slope positions within wangdonggou watershed there were no statistical differences in the estimated recharge rates between the grassland and jujube for either 7 years or 16 years after conversion from cropland p 0 05 although the 16 year old grassland and jujube sites had larger groundwater recharge rates than the 7 year old grassland and jujube sites respectively these differences were not statistically significant p 0 05 this indicates that conversion from cereal cropland to grassland or jujube did not affect the groundwater recharge at wangdonggou watershed the lower and mid slope positions had greater peak depths pore water velocities and groundwater recharge rates relative to the upper slope position there were however no significant differences in the estimated groundwater recharge rates between the three slope positions p 0 05 compared to yuanzegou wangdonggou watershed had a significantly higher average clay content as determined using the student s t test with unequal variances p 0 05 this is because finer particles were deposited in the southeastern portion of the chinese loess plateau whereas coarser particles were deposited in the northwest relative to yuanzegou watershed wangdonggou watershed is further to the southeast and consequently is composed of finer deposits the clay content may have a direct influence on the groundwater recharge the average groundwater recharge rates are 26 3 mm yr 1 for the three slope positions at wangdonggou watershed and 28 7 mm yr 1 for the 4 land use types at yuanzegou watershed table 3 student s t test with unequal variances showed that there were significant differences between yuanzegou and wangdonggou watersheds in the average tritium peak depths average soil water contents and pore water velocities p 0 05 but not in the groundwater water recharge rates p 0 05 for all 7 soil profiles in the two watersheds there is a negative correlation between precipitation amount and groundwater recharge rate suggesting that precipitation is not the first order control of recharge rates the linear correlation coefficients are 0 67 between the groundwater recharge rates and clay contents p 0 05 and 0 44 between the recharge rates and cos slope aspect p 0 05 in seven test sites at two watersheds this further suggests that clay content is the primary control of groundwater recharge in the two watersheds rather than climate or land use 4 discussion 4 1 transport mechanism soil matrix flow vs preferential flow the tritium distributions in all profiles are bell shaped which may indicate a soil matrix flow dominated in non fractured unsaturated zones dincer et al 1974 lin and wei 2006 given the relatively coarse and homogeneous texture of the soils of the loess plateau formation of cracks due to shrink swell of clay particles is unlikely making this an ideal media for soil matrix flow in contrast bell shaped tritium distributions have also been found in fractured british chalk formations the soil matrix of these formations consists of fine materials with relatively low hydraulic conductivity 0 1 cm day 1 foster 1975 mathias et al 2005 the humid climate of britain provides intense rainfall that facilitates preferential flow through large fractures the post bomb tritiated rainwater of these large fractures diffuses into the soil matrix which could also result in a bell shaped tritium distribution within the soil profile resembling that of soil matrix flow foster 1975 contrary to the chalk formations the loess plateau consists of relatively coarse materials with hydraulic conductivities of approximately 20 cm day 1 and 28 cm day 1 for the relatively fine paleosol and coarse loess respectively unpublished results occasionally rainstorms in late summer or early autumn temporarily saturate the soil surface however due to the semiarid climate and high soil hydraulic conductivity the subsoil water contents are generally well below field capacity furthermore although the deep unsaturated zone contains macropores in the form of root channels they are generally empty and incapable of conducting water through the subsurface consequently it is unlikely that the tritium peaks in the loess soil are a result of the diffusion of tritiated water from macropores into micropores therefore the results of this study suggest that the dominant transport mechanism in these regions is soil matrix flow which is further supported by the work of huang et al 2013 groundwater samples collected from the highland areas of the loess plateau show no evidence of elevated tritium concentrations suggesting the groundwater is older than 50 years huang et al 2013 2016 this is consistent with the results of brilliant blue dye tracer experiments which showed that preferential flow is absent indicating that the dominant transport mechanism in the region is soil matrix flow zheng et al 2017 the soil matrix flow model would suggest that all of the post bomb tritiated water in the soil profile is still located within the deep unsaturated zone and has not yet reached the groundwater below however there have been reports of elevated tritium concentrations in spring and well water as high as 40 60 tu lin and wei 2001 it is possible that because surface runoff origination in upslope areas which carried post bomb tritiated water could recharge the groundwater through the crack or fissure in a preferential flow on the chinese loess plateau li et al 2017b xiang et al 2018 thus resulting in elevated the tritium level in the spring or well water from the lower gully regions however the elevation of the groundwater table underlying the loess plateau is highest beneath the highlands and decreases as the surface elevation decreases therefore groundwater beneath the highland flows downslope and should not affected by the elevated tritium concentrations as shown in the spring and well water at lower slope positions in addition the tritium concentrations in three wells at wangdonggou are 2 2 3 3 tu collected in the flat area which is very close to the detection limit of 2 tu and in the two springs are below 2 tu huang et al 2019 further suggesting it is free of water from surface runoff and thus free of post bomb tritiated water therefore the soil matrix flow model is also consistent with observations of groundwater tritium in this region we acknowledge that locally soil matrix flow is the dominant flow mechanism within the deep unsaturated zone as is evident from the measured soil tritium distributions however at the regional scale preferential flow may occur at locations where cracks and channels are developed and activated by surface runoff li et al 2017b utilized multiple environmental tracers on the loess plateau to source groundwater recharge at the regional scale and concluded that approximately 80 of the recharge originated directly from precipitation and the remainder was from soil matrix flow they postulated that a preferential flow path must exist in order for precipitation to directly recharge the groundwater however there is still a lack of direct evidence of preferential flow on the loess plateau therefore at the regional scale the relative contributions of preferential flow and soil matrix flow to regional groundwater recharge remains an open research question 4 2 groundwater recharge of flat landscapes and hillslopes previous unsaturated zone studies in arid and semi arid regions have shown that direct recharge is generally low and often subject to strong spatial variability gates et al 2008 kim and jackson 2012 scanlon et al 2006 on the chinese loess plateau however the spatial variability in the obtained groundwater recharge is relatively small for example the groundwater recharge rates obtained using the chloride mass balance method ranged from 43 to 54 mm yr 1 on a terraced landscape at zhifanggou watershed near yuanzegou watershed and 50 55 mm yr 1 on a drier flat site at guyuan 250 km west of yuanzegou watershed gates et al 2011 huang et al 2013 the long term 1963 1997 average groundwater recharge rate at a site in inner mongolia was approximately 47 mm yr 1 lin and wei 2006 similarly the long term 1963 1985 average recharge rate at pingding shanxi was 53 mm yr 1 these study sites are located in different parts of the chinese loess plateau and had an average recharge rate of 50 mm year 1 the difference between the average groundwater recharge rates in hillslopes in yuanzegou and wangdonggou watersheds is less than 4 mm yr 1 further confirming the relatively small spatial variability found in hillslopes table 3 in the current study the recharge rate in hillslopes is on average 28 2 mm yr 1 table 3 which is only approximately 56 of the average recharge rate found on flat landscapes of the loess plateau 50 mm yr 1 as reported in the literature this may be because on hillslopes however extreme rainfall events may induce surface runoff effectively reducing the water infiltration volume and penetration depth the thickness of the unsaturated zone can result in a reduction of groundwater recharge in north china plain because percolated water will refill the depleted soil water storage cao et al 2016 but this situation may not suit for our study when there exists an elevation difference between the hillslope and flat areas this is because the recharge in our study is potential groundwater recharge it represents the soil water flux leaving the root zone and moves in a steady flow and is assumed to enter groundwater eventually from the overlying soil if the water input p et r into soil is different between flat upslope area and hillslope the groundwater recharges will likely differ however the recharge rates should not be affected by water table depth because the deep water table is quite deep 50 m at both flat plateau and hillslope does not affect hydrological processes occurring at the surface and thus does not alter the groundwater recharge therefore for similar vegetation soil and climate the groundwater recharge on hillslopes is typically less than on flat landscapes causing by different rainwater infiltration processes 4 3 first order control of groundwater recharge in hillslopes land use climate or soil texture on flat landscapes groundwater recharge rates are controlled strongly by water input precipitation irrigation followed by potential evapotranspiration rates vegetation and soil texture kim and jackson 2012 by comparison there is lack of information on the controls of groundwater recharge on hillslopes which hinders our ability to draw general conclusions about this process the 7 sites in this study however have similar slope gradients 20 to 33 and rainfall patterns allowing us to infer the effects of slope aspect soil texture vegetation and climate on groundwater recharge in two watersheds although slope gradient will influence the precipitation partition the runoff amount ratios were only 3 4 4 2 and 1 9 3 6 in each corresponding adjacent watersheds of wangdougong and yuanzegou zhang et al 2021 thus the net input water in wangdonggou watershed was still much larger than yuanzegou watershed at yuanzegou watershed the slope aspects varied from 80 to 350 table 3 but groundwater recharge showed no clear relationship with slope aspect at yuanzegou watershed the result suggests that slope aspect has little influence on groundwater recharge which is consistent with gao et al 2011 who showed that root zone soil water contents at yuanzegou watershed had a negligible correlation to slope aspect meanwhile vegetation conversion from cereal cropland to grassland or jujube did not affect the groundwater recharge at yuanzegou watershed the land use changes occurred 7 and 16 years ago but the depth of the tritium peak concentration is the result of cumulative recharge occurring over the past 52 years for the 7 year old grassland the tritium peak method distributed the change in recharge experienced over the past 7 years over 52 years resulting in a seemingly much smaller estimated change in recharge than in reality similarly assuming the 16 year old grassland had the same recharge rate increase since its conversion from cropland as the 7 year old grassland the tritium peak method would distribute the 16 years recharge change over 52 years resulting in a smaller recharge change than in reality but would still be more than twice that of the 7 year old grassland thus the effects of land use changes progressively unveil themselves in the movement of the tritium peak concentration depth consequently the groundwater recharge may increase with the elapsed time after conversion from cropland until a new equilibrium for groundwater recharge is reached for the new land use the effect of land use change on groundwater recharge depends on vegetation type for example a study performed in australia showed a two to three fold magnitude increase in groundwater recharge 50 years after conversion from deep rooted to shallow rooted vegetation allison et al 1990 in the current study the groundwater recharge rates did not decrease as one would normally expect in areas converted from cropland to grassland or forest in fact they increased by a few millimeters per year for deep rooted ecosystems such as the eucalypt forests in australia deep root water uptake greatly reduces groundwater recharge allison et al 1990 however on steep slopes such as the ones in this study land uses such as shallow rooted grasslands and jujube orchards reduce surface runoff and promote rainfall infiltration thus leading to slightly higher groundwater recharge the results of the current study are also supported by those of ilstedt et al 2016 who showed that an intermediate tree cover density such as that in the converted grassland and jujube plots maximizes groundwater recharge furthermore the groundwater recharge rates increased slightly but not significantly with the elapsed time since conversion from cropland to grassland or jujube at yuanzegou watershed this was not the case at wangdonggou watershed where the grassland at all three slope positions despite having a large elapsed time 50 years since conversion experienced smaller groundwater recharge rates than any of the land use types at yuanzegou this indicates that land use is not the first order control of groundwater recharge across the two climate zones but rather it is a local control of groundwater recharge at most thus although the length of land use or vegetation between the hillslopes of two watersheds is different they could still be used to compare the influence of climate when excluding the effects of slope aspect and land use the difference of groundwater recharge rates between the two watersheds should be controlled by climate and soil texture when comparing the two watersheds the profiles of the sub humid wangdonggou watershed had shallower tritium peak depths fig 4 but the resulting groundwater recharge rates were not significantly different from that of the semiarid yuanzegou despite the 20 increase in precipitation and 20 reduction in potential evapotranspiration at wangdonggou table 3 this suggests that precipitation is not the primary control of groundwater recharge on hillslopes across the two climate zones p 0 05 furthermore there is a significant linear correlation between the groundwater recharge rates and average clay contents within the displacement zones of all 7 profiles in the two watersheds r 0 67 p 0 05 therefore it would appear that clay content is the first order control of groundwater recharge across the two climate zones this is contrary to the typical conclusions obtained from flat landscapes where groundwater recharge rates are found to be influenced primarily by the amount of annual precipitation followed by soil texture as a second order control kim and jackson 2012 scanlon et al 2006 the reason for the apparent inconsistency may be two fold first both watersheds are located in water limited environments where annual potential evapotranspiration is generally much greater than annual precipitation and as a result the actual evapotranspiration rate relies heavily on the soil water storage in the root zone soil water storage capacity or field capacity is 0 28 m3 m 3 at wangdonggou liu et al 2010 wang et al 2008 and 0 25 m3 m 3 at yuanzegou li et al 2014 this difference 0 03 m3 m 3 in field capacity means that a 1 4 m thick root zone at wangdonggou could potentially hold 42 mm more water than that at yuanzegou which is 36 of the annual rainfall difference 117 mm between the two sites therefore most if not all of the annual precipitation difference between the two sites can be easily compensated for by the extra soil water storage capacity however due to the water limited nature of the region pet p this extra water storage would typically be consumed by vegetation between major rainfall events and thus may contribute little to the groundwater recharge in water limited regions like the chinese loess plateau water is the limiting factor for actual evapotranspiration wang et al 2011 plant will response to elevated precipitation and resultant soil water storage is to increase transpiration in these dry systems brito et al 2015 chebbi et al 2018 second the significantly lower clay contents at yuanzegou watershed resulted in a greater hydraulic conductivity and infiltration capacity as shown earlier the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of the soils at wangdonggou were 20 and 28 cm day 1 for the interglacial paleosol and glacial loess respectively while the ks for yuanzegou watershed varied between 118 and 160 cm day 1 gao et al 2011 the high ks at yuanzegou watershed may contribute to reduced surface runoff during intense rainfall events and shorter transit times of water in the root zone which in turn increases groundwater recharge compensating for the relatively low annual precipitation field studies in south western murray basin also indicated that the recharge rates decreased from 30 to 3 mm year 1 when the clay content in the top 2 m soil layer increased from 0 to 20 kennett smith et al 1994 higher clay contents in the shallow soils lead to a higher water holding capacity in evapotranspiration zone then less water will become deep drainage 4 4 study limitations and implications for hillslope processes the uncertainty analysis conducted in this study assumes that the horizontal variability is much smaller than the vertical variability within both watersheds being an aeolian sediment loess is quite texturally uniform horizontally but exhibits considerable vertical variability due to varying rates of deposition within the quaternary period however outcrops displaying the vertical stratification of the soils are present at different positions along hillslopes in the region as one would expect the scale of the horizontal variability over the sloping surface of a hillslope is still much larger than the scale of vertical variability where soil layers may be as small as centimeters in thickness this results in smaller horizontal than vertical variability for example the coefficient of variation cv values for clay contents with depth in soil profiles at yuanzegou watershed were 0 31 0 28 0 31 and 0 39 for the 7 year old jujube 16 year old jujube 7 year old grassland and 16 year old grassland respectively table 3 gao et al 2011 found that the cv value for clay contents of samples collected at depths of 0 to 0 2 m over the entirety of the yuanzegou watershed was approximately 0 22 similarly the cv values for clay contents in the soil profiles at wangdonggou watershed in the current study are 0 13 0 20 and 0 19 for the upper mid and lower slope positions respectively table 3 furthermore duan et al 2016 measured the clay contents at 105 locations at wangdonggou watershed encompassing the vertical variability of the top 3 m of the soil and the horizontal variability over several hillslopes and found that the cv value for the clay content was 0 14 considering that the distances between our sites at wangdonggou watershed are less than the distance spanned in the study performed by duan et al 2016 it is assumed that the cv for horizontal variability in our study would also be much smaller than the 0 14 recorded in the previous study therefore the horizontal variability was much smaller than the vertical variability at both yuanzegou and wangdonggou watersheds indicating that the uncertainty analysis carried out in section 3 4 included the major sources of variability and uncertainty and thus is valid hydrological processes in hillslopes are more complex than in flat areas a significant fraction of rain water could move vertically to bedrock and laterally over the bedrock surface in a hillslope the subsurface flow process which dominates mainly in humid forest regions is controlled by geology soil properties rainfall characteristics and vegetation ghasemizade and schirmer 2013 however on the chinese plateau the stream runoff is dominated by horton overland flow with less subsurface runoff because of low vegetation coverage coupled with intense precipitation in a thick unsaturated zone tao et al 2021 wu et al 2020 consequently the deep drainage water below the root zone on a hillslope on the loess plateau is more likely to recharge groundwater 5 conclusion globally the dominant control of groundwater recharge on flat landscapes is water input precipitation plus irrigation followed by vegetation type potential evapotranspiration and soil texture kim and jackson 2012 slope is the main landform unit on the chinese loess plateau but groundwater recharge in hillslopes is poorly understood to our knowledge this study makes the first attempt to quantify recharge in the deep unsaturated zone of hillslopes and compare it with the recharge on flat landscapes in the same region the well established tritium method provides a vehicle for us to do so the main findings are as follows 1 tritium concentrations showed a bell shaped distribution within soil profiles with a clearly identifiable peak the peak depth varied between 6 29 11 01 m in the sub humid wangdonggou and semi arid yuanzegou watersheds this indicates that the predominant transport mechanism for soil tritium and groundwater recharge on a hillslope is soil matrix flow as opposed to preferential flow 2 groundwater recharge rates on the loess plateau varied between 4 7 of the total precipitation on hillslopes which are only 56 of the recharge rates on flat landscapes in the region furthermore due to the large proportion of sloping land in this area the contribution of hillslopes to groundwater recharge is considerable 3 soil texture is the dominant control on groundwater recharge in the two watersheds fine textured soil experienced reduced groundwater recharge due to its relatively large soil water storage capacity and small hydraulic conductivity 4 the two watershed belong to two different climate zones subhumid and semiarid however the groundwater recharge rates of the watersheds are not significantly different suggesting relative to soil texture climate is at most a seconday control of groundwater recharge in the region author statement we have made substantial contribution to the highlights advance and further implication for the hydrology process in

8186,study region yuanzegou watershed in qingjian wangdonggou watershed in changwu the chinese loess plateau study focus hillslopes are the predominant land form unit on earth and despite its importance in maintaining groundwater supplies in many parts of the world groundwater recharge on hillslopes is poorly understood we hypothesize that groundwater recharge in the deep unsaturated zones of hillslopes is facilitated mainly by soil matrix flow and the recharge rates are much smaller in hillslopes than on flat landscapes to test the hypothesis seven 15 20 m long cores were collected from areas of different land uses to determine the groundwater recharge rates and its controls in deep unsaturated zones of hillslopes at a sub humid and a semi arid watershed located on the chinese loess plateau new hydrologic insights for the region the tritium distribution in each soil profile exhibits a well defined bell shape signifying that soil matrix displacement is the main recharge mechanism the tritium peak was located between depths of 9 33 m 11 01 m at the semiarid watershed and 6 29 m 7 22 m at the sub humid watershed and the recharge rates varied from 24 5 to 33 8 mm yr 1 these recharge rates account for 4 7 of the long term precipitation which is approximately 56 of the recharge typically seen on flat landscapes groundwater recharges were mainly controlled by soil texture and land use changes but exhibited little impact from the climatic difference between the two watersheds keywords groundwater recharge tritium tracer method hillslope the loess plateau soil texture land use change 1 introduction groundwater recharge is defined as the soil water flux that enters groundwater from the overlying soil and is a critical link in the hydrological cycle it is one of the most important hydrogeological considerations in both water resource management and waste disposal in arid and semi arid regions scanlon et al 2006 wood 1999 the groundwater recharge rate is closely linked to the soil water flux leaving the root zone which is the deep drainage rate deep drainage water generally reaches groundwater but there are circumstances which can alter deep drainage such as lateral flow due to an impermeable layer located between the bottom of the root zone and the groundwater table as such deep drainage rates are typically equivalent to groundwater recharge rates and so in most studies the two terms are used interchangeably scanlon et al 2006 groundwater recharge rates are often difficult to measure directly due to the complexity of the vadose zone and its relative inaccessibility de vries and simmers 2002 methods such as water balance groundwater fluctuation and modeling based techniques have often been used to estimate the recharge of groundwater but they are not suitable for the deep loess semi arid area this is because the response of groundwater to precipitation damped remarkably and the errors associated with these methods may exceed the magnitude of the measured recharged rate in these regions allison et al 1994 scanlon et al 2002 due to limitation of the other methods much effort on recharge estimation in arid and semi arid regions has focused on environmental tracers including the chloride mass balance cmb and tritium tracer methods because the attractive feature of tracers approaches is that they can intergrate recharge over a long term gee and hillel 1988 scanlon et al 2002 the boundary conditions required measurements and associated equations for common groundwater recharge determination methods are summarized in table 1 recharge estimates in unsaturated zones are typically based on flat landscapes where all precipitation enters soil however hillslopes are the predominant terrestrial landform and are the fundamental landscape unit that control the processes which partition precipitation into vertical and lateral flow to groundwater and streams on steep slopes a substantial amount of precipitation may be converted to lateral flow resulting in low soil water storage and groundwater recharge considerable attention has been focused on lateral flow processes such as overland flow and subsurface interflow or groundwater flow especially those processes that lead to the rapid movement of water and or effusion of old water into stream flow weiler and mcdonnell 2004 however the groundwater recharge on hillslopes may be different from that of flat landscapes because the controls on groundwater recharge are different groundwater recharge on flat land may be controlled mainly by extreme precipitation events taylor et al 2013 but perhaps less so on sloping landscapes due to the generation of overland flow which arises from intense rainfall weiler and mcdonnell 2004 hillslope hydrology is a complex system and the water movement through hillslopes influences the deep percolation and fast flow through fractures that may contribute to catchment streamflow bronstert 1999 buttle and mcdonald 2002 much effort has been made on the hillslope runoff baumann et al 2008 buttle and mcdonald 2002 or hillslope soil hydrological process on water storage or evapotranspiration geroy et al 2011 lee and kim 2019 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 while less was researched on the deep groundwater recharge groundwater recharge on hillslopes can be small but in some areas it may be the only input to groundwater it also plays an important role in the transit time distribution of precipitation contributing to streamflow allison et al 1994 despite its importance there is a poor understanding of the vertical flow component in groundwater recharge in hillslopes salve et al 2012 previous studies on deep percolation or groundwater recharge in hillslopes were mainly focused on thin unsaturated zone of humid areas with water balance based on hydrometric observations graham et al 2010 lysimeter analysis heppner et al 2007 or modelling bronstert 1999 in these areas event scale groundwater recharge as a percentage of precipitation can be more than 30 buttle and mcdonald 2002 graham et al 2010 kosugi et al 2006 however the recharge ratio is often less than 10 in semiarid areas scanlon et al 2006 due to large uncertainty disqualifying water balance based approach for determining and evaluating the control factor for groundwater recharge of hillslopes further little is known on the relative difference between groundwater recharges of hillslopes and flat land this is because determining groundwater recharge on sloping landscapes is relatively complex and many of the popular methods which are applicable on flat landscapes are not suitable for sloping landscapes for example the cmb method has been widely applied on flat landscapes but on hillslopes has many challenges in terms of fulfilling the prerequisite assumptions of the method wood 1999 in some cases cmb may be directly applicable to a watershed if it is a closed system hayashi et al 1998 or produces a steady outflow with known water flux and chloride concentration guan et al 2010 however for the purposes of soil management we still need to improve our understanding of groundwater recharge on hillslopes at the point scale tritium as an environmental tracer has been used widely in evaluating groundwater recharge dincer et al 1974 unlike many other tracers such as chloride tritium is part of water and thus participates in all hydrological processes therefore tritium is an ideal tracer for water and is particularly suited for the determination of groundwater recharge in the unsaturated zone in arid and semiarid zones two methods have been used for this purpose tritium peak method and total tritium method the total tritium method requires a full record of tritium concentrations in precipitation between the 1960s and the date of sampling because there is large spatial and temporal variability in the tritium concentrations in precipitation the total tritium method can only be applied to the few locations around the globe where a full record is available a few attempts have been made to reconstruct the precipitation tritium records at locations without a full record li and si 2018 however these efforts have been met with limited success due to the sparsity of the long term precipitation tritium records necessary to validate the methods in this regard the tritium peak depth method is particularly attractive because it requires only the peak depth from the measured tritium distribution in the soil profile table 1 however the tritium peak method is not applicable to soil where significant preferential flow occurs allison et al 1994 furthermore tritium has a short half life 12 3 year and consequently the tritium in the soil will become undetectable within a few decades fortunately lin and wei 2006 reported a distinct post bomb tritium peak in the deep unsaturated zone of the chinese loess plateau this tritium peak and its location provide a valuable scientific tool and offer a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of long term groundwater recharge on sloping landscapes therefore the objective of this study is to determine the controls and mechanisms of groundwater recharge in the deep unsaturated zone of the semi arid region of the chinese loess plateau by capitalizing on the radioactive tritium in the deep unsaturated zone we will 1 estimate groundwater recharge rates on hillslopes and 2 identify and compare the local and regional controls of groundwater recharge 2 material and methods 2 1 site description two sites were selected on hillslopes of the chinese loess plateau one site is located in yuanzegou watershed 37 14 n 110 20 e fig 1 in qingjian county shaanxi province the area experiences a semi arid continental climate with a mean annual temperature of 8 6 c the long term 1953 2013 mean annual precipitation is 454 mm 70 of which occurs from august to october yuanzegou watershed has a very rugged hill and gully type topography which is typical for this region of the loess plateau the main stream channel is incised down to the underlying bedrock creating topographic relief of more than 200 m where the main slope gradient lies between 0 and 35 the unsaturated zone is relatively homogeneous in soil texture varying from sandy loam to silt loam with a thickness of 80 300 m the watershed was under rain fed cereal cultivation before 1999 growing predominately corn and wheat since 2000 the land surface has been progressively converted into primarily rain fed red jujube forest and grassland for reducing soil erosion four hillslopes at the yuanzegou watershed were selected for soil coring in 2015 two of the hillslopes contained dwarf jujube trees ziziphus jujuba mill 7 and 16 years old respectively planted in 3 m by 2 m grids the other two hillslopes consisted of grassland which are dominated by grasses such as stipa bungeana and brushwoods such as artemisia gmelini both the grassland and jujube forest sites were cropland prior to conversion to the current land use additional site information for the four hillslopes is included in table 2 the other study site is the wangdonggou watershed 35 14 n 107 41 e fig 1 which is located within the southeastern portion of the loess plateau in changwu county shaanxi province this region has a sub humid continental climate with a long term 51 year mean annual temperature of 9 4 c the long term 1957 2015 mean annual precipitation is 578 mm of which 55 occurs between july and september the soils are predominantly silt loam textured with silt contents greater than 50 the depth from the soil surface to the water table ranges from 30 to 100 m the land uses include rain fed farmlands and orchards on flat upland portions and rain fed grasslands and forests on hillslopes a typical south facing hillslope was selected for the tritium sampling in the wangdonggou watershed the slope was cultivated prior to 1960 and has since been converted to rain fed grassland in 2014 upper middle and lower slope positions were selected for soil coring to avoid the spatial variability and the influence of slope position on groundwater recharge within a watershed and the additional sites information in wangdonggou watershed is included in table 2 the detail profile soil water particle size distributions with soil depth can be referred to li et al 2018 2 2 sampling methods a hand auger with extensions was used to collect the soil cores at sampling intervals of 0 2 m up to depths of 15 20 m each soil core sample was well mixed and then divided into three parts one part was placed immediately into high density polyethylene plastic bottles sealed with parafilm and kept frozen until tritium analysis was performed and the remaining two parts were collected in aluminum and polyethylene containers and later used for the determination of soil water content and particle size distribution respectively the mass based soil water contents were determined using the oven dry method where the soil was dried at 105 c for a minimum of 10 h or until reaching constant mass the soil particle size fractions were measured using the pipette method and characterized according to the usda system which defines soil separates as sand 2 0 05 mm silt 0 05 0 002 mm and clay 0 002 mm due to the relatively homogeneous nature of the loess only samples from the depths which showed substantial changes in soil water contents were used for particle size analysis for water isotope analysis soil water was extracted using cryogenic vacuum distillation otieno et al 2006 voltas et al 2015 approximately 8 ml of extracted water and scintillation solution hisafe3 were prepared at a ratio of 8 12 and then stored in the dark for a period of 12 h before testing tritium activity reported as count per minute cpm averaged over a counting duration of 400 min was measured with a low background liquid scintillation counter quantulus 1220 perkinelmer singapore the standard error of the liquid scintillation counter was approximately 5 tu and the detection limit defined as 3 29 times greater than the measurement error was 16 5 tu armbruster and pry 2008 after correcting for background noise the measured cpm was subsequently transformed into tritium units tu a detailed description of this procedure can be found in jakonić et al 2014 and nikolov et al 2013 in order to determine the active layer of soil water dynamics of each test sites a tubular time domain reflectometry tdr system trime iph t3 imko germany was employed to measure the volumetric soil water content dynamics of different jujube stands 6 and 15 year old every other week in 2014 at yuanzegou watershed li et al 2017a and soil water contents were measured every 10 days from 2015 2016 with a neutron probe in a grassland at the wangdonggou long term experimental station 1 km away from the soil core sampling site in the wangdonggou watershed according to gao et al 2014 the soil water dynamics in jujube and grassland behaved similar so we supposed that they had a similar active layer of soil water dynamics in yuanzegou watershed meanwhile the measured root length densities of the jujube stands decreased exponentially with soil depth with more than 95 of fine roots located within 0 1 8 m soil layers in 6 and 15 year old jujube stands in the sampling year 2014 in yuanzegou watershed li et al 2017a similarly in wangdougou watershed 95 of the fine roots of grasslands were located within the 0 1 5 m soil layer li et al 2018 the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 was used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration pet in the wangdonggou watershed using meteorological data from the china meteorological data network as there was no weather station available near the yuanzegou watershed data from the adjacent station in suide county shaanxi province 37 30 n 110 13 e were used to estimate pet at the yuanzegou watershed 2 3 methodology for groundwater recharge determination groundwater recharge rates can be calculated using a modified tritium peak method si and de jong 2007 1 r d r d θ d z n i v θ 2 v d d r n i where r is the groundwater recharge rate mm year 1 θ is the volumetric soil water content m3 m 3 d is the depth m of the tritium peak concentration n is the number of years between 1963 and the date the soil core was collected ν is the pore water velocity m s 1 d r is the depth m to the bottom of the active root zone θ is the average volumetric soil water content m3 m 3 between the tritium peak depth and the bottom of the active root zone and i is the time it takes for tritium in precipitation to penetrate to the bottom of the active root zone we capitalized on the tritium peak depth method to determine groundwater recharge in this study because first groundwater recharge is dominated by soil matrix flow on the chinese loess plateau second the deep loessal thickness more than 50 m at our study site retained the whole tritium profiles this would not be possible for areas with thin unsaturated zone or with substantial macropore flow in unsaturated zone 2 4 determination of peak concentration depth the accurate determination of the tritium peak concentration depth is essential for the tritium peak depth method a bell shaped tritium concentration distribution in the soil profile may be fit by a modified gaussian function which resembles the solution to the convection dispersion equation for a conservative tracer jury and horton 2004 3 c z t m 0 z 2 j w π d t 3 e x p z z 0 2 2 d t where c z t is the tracer concentration as a function of depth z and time t z 0 is the mean depth and d is the apparent dispersion coefficient m 0 and j w are the total mass of 3h in the soil profile and steady state soil water flux respectively however these are treated as fitting parameters in this study although d may not represent the true dispersion coefficient due to the radioactive exponential nature of the decay of the tritium eq 3 remains a physically plausible model for determining the peak depth 2 5 statistical analysis for a given standard error of two treatments the difference between the means of the two treatments can be tested using the following 4 t x y σ x 2 σ y 2 where x and y are the means of variables x and y respectively σ x and σ y are the standard errors of x and y respectively 3 results 3 1 yuanzegou watershed the four sites have different textural layering and consequently the soil textures at the same depths from the soil surface differed between the sites fig 2 the soil water contents varied with depth within each of the four soil profiles but they showed a positive correlation with clay content especially at depths below 2 m fig 2 table 3 the coefficient of determination between the clay and soil water contents for the four sites is 0 68 fig 3 surprisingly land use did not alter the relationship between soil water content and clay content fig 3 the vertical variability in clay content expressed as the standard deviation of clay content in the displacement zone showed no clear trends with the increases in peak depth or pore water velocity table 3 this indicates that neither the peak location nor the average pore water velocity are greatly affected by the textural stratification in the soil profile which may be due in part to mixing over long time periods 50 years dagan 1989 there were elevated soil water contents within the profiles especially just above textural interfaces fig 2 for example there is a remarkable increase in soil water content at the 2 5 m depth of the 7 year old jujube site which is located directly above the fine coarse layer interface furthermore above the interface the clay content is approximately 18 g 100g 1 and below the interface it decreases to 15 g 100g 1 this change in soil texture and associated hydraulic properties may have slowed the downward flow of water resulting in elevated soil water contents above the interface this phenomenon occurred in all 4 soil profiles fig 2 it is possible to quantify the heterogeneity in soil particle size distribution using the standard deviation of the clay content within the soil profile however the standard deviation of the clay contents in this study did not show any obvious trend with the average soil water content within a soil profile table 3 this suggests that the heterogeneity in soil texture within the soil profile was not the main control of soil water content and consequently of soil water storage the four sites have a well defined bell shaped tritium distribution within the soil profile fig 4 with the peak concentrations of 60 80 tu located at depths between 7 12 m the exact depths were not readily identifiable but may be obtained by fitting eq 3 to the measured tritium distribution within each soil profile using a nonlinear least square procedure sigmaplot 13 systat london the coefficients of determination were between 0 86 and 0 94 for the 4 soil profiles and the fitted peak depth had a small estimated standard error 0 18 m showing excellent goodness of fit for each profile the fitted peak depth varies from 9 33 m at the 7 year old jujube site to 11 01 m in the 16 year old grassland fig 4 table 3 this high variability in the tritium peak depth is somewhat surprising considering the relatively small differences in the average clay contents among the four sites it is remarkable that the 7 year old jujube and grassland sites had shallower peak penetration depths than the 16 year old jujube and grassland sites table 3 this indicates that the 16 year old jujube and grassland sites had a higher pore water velocity than the 7 year old jujube and grassland sites table 3 according to solute transport theory the dispersion coefficient is approximately linearly correlated to average pore water velocity the larger the pore water velocity the larger the dispersion coefficient jury and horton 2004 due to their larger dispersion coefficients the 16 year old jujube and grassland sites had lower peak concentrations of tritium than the 7 year old jujube and grassland sites fig 4 in addition the shape of the tritium distributions around the peak concentrations are strikingly similar between the 16 year old jujube and grassland sites despite the differences in soil textural stratification fig 2 the temporal variability of soil water contents reduced considerably below 1 4 m fig 5 a b therefore it can be assumed that the depth of 1 4 m is the bottom of the active layer of soil water dynamics the active layer of soil water dynamics represents the long term annual rainfall penetration depth suo et al 2018 thus on average it took roughly 1 year for rain water to infiltrate to 1 4 m as the tritium moves with the soil water we can assume it took roughly 1 year for the tritium peak concentration to pass the 1 4 m depth bai et al 2016 chen et al 2008 zhao et al 2012 below 1 4 m soil water and tritium in the water move at steady state considering that the long term average infiltration depth also this active layer of soil water dynamic is deeper than the active root zone which is defined as 60 of total fine root mass fig 5c thus it is reasonable that we considered d r was 1 4 m when i was 1 year using eq 2 to calculate the pore water velocity given this information the long term average pore water velocity during the past 51 years can be calculated from eq 2 the resulting average pore water velocities were 184 mm yr 1 for jujube site and 185 mm yr 1 for the 16 year old grassland site and 152 and 161 mm yr 1 at the 7 year old jujube and grassland sites respectively table 3 the two grassland and two jujube sites had groundwater recharge rates between 25 8 and 32 2 mm yr 1 table 3 the precipitation infiltration coefficient which is defined as the ratio of recharge rate to mean annual precipitation was 5 7 for the two grassland and two jujube sites 3 2 wangdonggou watershed the soil water contents monitored during 2015 2016 are shown in fig 5b the range of temporal variation maximum to minimum is reduced considerably below depths of 1 4 m therefore the active root zone can be defined as 1 4 m fig 5b soil tritium concentrations at wangdonggou watershed also showed bell shaped distributions the coefficients of determination between the fitted eq 5 and measured tritium distributions were 0 84 0 97 and 0 95 for the upper mid and lower slope position where their best fit peak depths were at 6 29 7 17 and 7 22 m respectively fig 4 table 3 the groundwater recharge rates determined using the same method as at yuanzegou watershed are 24 5 26 5 and 27 9 mm yr 1 for the upper mid and lower slope positions respectively table 3 the precipitation infiltration coefficient is approximately 4 5 which is similar to that of yuanzegou watershed 3 3 uncertainty of estimated groundwater recharge rates because there is little uncertainty in the time duration n between 1963 to the time of sampling we can assume that the uncertainty in r primarily originates from the uncertainty in 1 the peak depth d 2 the thickness of the active root zone dr and 3 the average soil water content θ in the displacement zone between dr and d based on the first order perturbation analysis of eq 1 the variance in estimated r σ r 2 can be calculated as 5 σ r 2 r d 2 σ d 2 r d r 2 σ d r 2 r θ 2 σ θ 2 θ n i 2 σ d 2 θ n i 2 σ d r 2 d d r n i 2 σ θ 2 where n 51 and 52 for yuanzegou and wangdonggou watersheds respectively and i 1 year σ d σ d r a n d σ θ are the standard errors of d d r and θ respectively the largest standard error of d is σ d 0 18 m table 3 the measurement error of soil water content using the oven dry method is generally taken as 0 01 m3 m 3 considering there are always more errors in field sampling than in the laboratory it is reasonable to assume the measurement error of 0 02 m3 m 3 where its standard error may be approximated as σ θ 0 01 m3 m 3 furthermore the depth of the active root zone as suggested by the majority of the literature is between 1 0 and 2 0 m and therefore the maximum deviation introduced by assuming a thickness of the active root zone of 1 4 m is 0 5 m assuming this represents the 95 confidence range the standard error of d r σ d r is 250 mm according to eq 5 σ r 2 2 mm yr 1 which is the maximum standard error introduced by the uncertainties from peak depth thickness of the active root zone and average soil water content consequently the 95 confidence intervals of the estimated recharge are r 4 4 mm yr 1 3 4 statistical comparisons within and between wangdonggou and yuanzegou watersheds there was a very small difference 0 2 g 100g 1 in the average clay contents between the four sampling sites within the yuanzhugou watershed and between the three slope positions within wangdonggou watershed table 3 this suggests that on average the soil texture in the soil profiles is quite similar within each watershed given the standard error of the estimated groundwater recharge rate σ r 2 2 mm yr 1 eq 4 was used to test if there is a statistical difference between the different land use types within yuanzegou and between the three slope positions within wangdonggou watershed there were no statistical differences in the estimated recharge rates between the grassland and jujube for either 7 years or 16 years after conversion from cropland p 0 05 although the 16 year old grassland and jujube sites had larger groundwater recharge rates than the 7 year old grassland and jujube sites respectively these differences were not statistically significant p 0 05 this indicates that conversion from cereal cropland to grassland or jujube did not affect the groundwater recharge at wangdonggou watershed the lower and mid slope positions had greater peak depths pore water velocities and groundwater recharge rates relative to the upper slope position there were however no significant differences in the estimated groundwater recharge rates between the three slope positions p 0 05 compared to yuanzegou wangdonggou watershed had a significantly higher average clay content as determined using the student s t test with unequal variances p 0 05 this is because finer particles were deposited in the southeastern portion of the chinese loess plateau whereas coarser particles were deposited in the northwest relative to yuanzegou watershed wangdonggou watershed is further to the southeast and consequently is composed of finer deposits the clay content may have a direct influence on the groundwater recharge the average groundwater recharge rates are 26 3 mm yr 1 for the three slope positions at wangdonggou watershed and 28 7 mm yr 1 for the 4 land use types at yuanzegou watershed table 3 student s t test with unequal variances showed that there were significant differences between yuanzegou and wangdonggou watersheds in the average tritium peak depths average soil water contents and pore water velocities p 0 05 but not in the groundwater water recharge rates p 0 05 for all 7 soil profiles in the two watersheds there is a negative correlation between precipitation amount and groundwater recharge rate suggesting that precipitation is not the first order control of recharge rates the linear correlation coefficients are 0 67 between the groundwater recharge rates and clay contents p 0 05 and 0 44 between the recharge rates and cos slope aspect p 0 05 in seven test sites at two watersheds this further suggests that clay content is the primary control of groundwater recharge in the two watersheds rather than climate or land use 4 discussion 4 1 transport mechanism soil matrix flow vs preferential flow the tritium distributions in all profiles are bell shaped which may indicate a soil matrix flow dominated in non fractured unsaturated zones dincer et al 1974 lin and wei 2006 given the relatively coarse and homogeneous texture of the soils of the loess plateau formation of cracks due to shrink swell of clay particles is unlikely making this an ideal media for soil matrix flow in contrast bell shaped tritium distributions have also been found in fractured british chalk formations the soil matrix of these formations consists of fine materials with relatively low hydraulic conductivity 0 1 cm day 1 foster 1975 mathias et al 2005 the humid climate of britain provides intense rainfall that facilitates preferential flow through large fractures the post bomb tritiated rainwater of these large fractures diffuses into the soil matrix which could also result in a bell shaped tritium distribution within the soil profile resembling that of soil matrix flow foster 1975 contrary to the chalk formations the loess plateau consists of relatively coarse materials with hydraulic conductivities of approximately 20 cm day 1 and 28 cm day 1 for the relatively fine paleosol and coarse loess respectively unpublished results occasionally rainstorms in late summer or early autumn temporarily saturate the soil surface however due to the semiarid climate and high soil hydraulic conductivity the subsoil water contents are generally well below field capacity furthermore although the deep unsaturated zone contains macropores in the form of root channels they are generally empty and incapable of conducting water through the subsurface consequently it is unlikely that the tritium peaks in the loess soil are a result of the diffusion of tritiated water from macropores into micropores therefore the results of this study suggest that the dominant transport mechanism in these regions is soil matrix flow which is further supported by the work of huang et al 2013 groundwater samples collected from the highland areas of the loess plateau show no evidence of elevated tritium concentrations suggesting the groundwater is older than 50 years huang et al 2013 2016 this is consistent with the results of brilliant blue dye tracer experiments which showed that preferential flow is absent indicating that the dominant transport mechanism in the region is soil matrix flow zheng et al 2017 the soil matrix flow model would suggest that all of the post bomb tritiated water in the soil profile is still located within the deep unsaturated zone and has not yet reached the groundwater below however there have been reports of elevated tritium concentrations in spring and well water as high as 40 60 tu lin and wei 2001 it is possible that because surface runoff origination in upslope areas which carried post bomb tritiated water could recharge the groundwater through the crack or fissure in a preferential flow on the chinese loess plateau li et al 2017b xiang et al 2018 thus resulting in elevated the tritium level in the spring or well water from the lower gully regions however the elevation of the groundwater table underlying the loess plateau is highest beneath the highlands and decreases as the surface elevation decreases therefore groundwater beneath the highland flows downslope and should not affected by the elevated tritium concentrations as shown in the spring and well water at lower slope positions in addition the tritium concentrations in three wells at wangdonggou are 2 2 3 3 tu collected in the flat area which is very close to the detection limit of 2 tu and in the two springs are below 2 tu huang et al 2019 further suggesting it is free of water from surface runoff and thus free of post bomb tritiated water therefore the soil matrix flow model is also consistent with observations of groundwater tritium in this region we acknowledge that locally soil matrix flow is the dominant flow mechanism within the deep unsaturated zone as is evident from the measured soil tritium distributions however at the regional scale preferential flow may occur at locations where cracks and channels are developed and activated by surface runoff li et al 2017b utilized multiple environmental tracers on the loess plateau to source groundwater recharge at the regional scale and concluded that approximately 80 of the recharge originated directly from precipitation and the remainder was from soil matrix flow they postulated that a preferential flow path must exist in order for precipitation to directly recharge the groundwater however there is still a lack of direct evidence of preferential flow on the loess plateau therefore at the regional scale the relative contributions of preferential flow and soil matrix flow to regional groundwater recharge remains an open research question 4 2 groundwater recharge of flat landscapes and hillslopes previous unsaturated zone studies in arid and semi arid regions have shown that direct recharge is generally low and often subject to strong spatial variability gates et al 2008 kim and jackson 2012 scanlon et al 2006 on the chinese loess plateau however the spatial variability in the obtained groundwater recharge is relatively small for example the groundwater recharge rates obtained using the chloride mass balance method ranged from 43 to 54 mm yr 1 on a terraced landscape at zhifanggou watershed near yuanzegou watershed and 50 55 mm yr 1 on a drier flat site at guyuan 250 km west of yuanzegou watershed gates et al 2011 huang et al 2013 the long term 1963 1997 average groundwater recharge rate at a site in inner mongolia was approximately 47 mm yr 1 lin and wei 2006 similarly the long term 1963 1985 average recharge rate at pingding shanxi was 53 mm yr 1 these study sites are located in different parts of the chinese loess plateau and had an average recharge rate of 50 mm year 1 the difference between the average groundwater recharge rates in hillslopes in yuanzegou and wangdonggou watersheds is less than 4 mm yr 1 further confirming the relatively small spatial variability found in hillslopes table 3 in the current study the recharge rate in hillslopes is on average 28 2 mm yr 1 table 3 which is only approximately 56 of the average recharge rate found on flat landscapes of the loess plateau 50 mm yr 1 as reported in the literature this may be because on hillslopes however extreme rainfall events may induce surface runoff effectively reducing the water infiltration volume and penetration depth the thickness of the unsaturated zone can result in a reduction of groundwater recharge in north china plain because percolated water will refill the depleted soil water storage cao et al 2016 but this situation may not suit for our study when there exists an elevation difference between the hillslope and flat areas this is because the recharge in our study is potential groundwater recharge it represents the soil water flux leaving the root zone and moves in a steady flow and is assumed to enter groundwater eventually from the overlying soil if the water input p et r into soil is different between flat upslope area and hillslope the groundwater recharges will likely differ however the recharge rates should not be affected by water table depth because the deep water table is quite deep 50 m at both flat plateau and hillslope does not affect hydrological processes occurring at the surface and thus does not alter the groundwater recharge therefore for similar vegetation soil and climate the groundwater recharge on hillslopes is typically less than on flat landscapes causing by different rainwater infiltration processes 4 3 first order control of groundwater recharge in hillslopes land use climate or soil texture on flat landscapes groundwater recharge rates are controlled strongly by water input precipitation irrigation followed by potential evapotranspiration rates vegetation and soil texture kim and jackson 2012 by comparison there is lack of information on the controls of groundwater recharge on hillslopes which hinders our ability to draw general conclusions about this process the 7 sites in this study however have similar slope gradients 20 to 33 and rainfall patterns allowing us to infer the effects of slope aspect soil texture vegetation and climate on groundwater recharge in two watersheds although slope gradient will influence the precipitation partition the runoff amount ratios were only 3 4 4 2 and 1 9 3 6 in each corresponding adjacent watersheds of wangdougong and yuanzegou zhang et al 2021 thus the net input water in wangdonggou watershed was still much larger than yuanzegou watershed at yuanzegou watershed the slope aspects varied from 80 to 350 table 3 but groundwater recharge showed no clear relationship with slope aspect at yuanzegou watershed the result suggests that slope aspect has little influence on groundwater recharge which is consistent with gao et al 2011 who showed that root zone soil water contents at yuanzegou watershed had a negligible correlation to slope aspect meanwhile vegetation conversion from cereal cropland to grassland or jujube did not affect the groundwater recharge at yuanzegou watershed the land use changes occurred 7 and 16 years ago but the depth of the tritium peak concentration is the result of cumulative recharge occurring over the past 52 years for the 7 year old grassland the tritium peak method distributed the change in recharge experienced over the past 7 years over 52 years resulting in a seemingly much smaller estimated change in recharge than in reality similarly assuming the 16 year old grassland had the same recharge rate increase since its conversion from cropland as the 7 year old grassland the tritium peak method would distribute the 16 years recharge change over 52 years resulting in a smaller recharge change than in reality but would still be more than twice that of the 7 year old grassland thus the effects of land use changes progressively unveil themselves in the movement of the tritium peak concentration depth consequently the groundwater recharge may increase with the elapsed time after conversion from cropland until a new equilibrium for groundwater recharge is reached for the new land use the effect of land use change on groundwater recharge depends on vegetation type for example a study performed in australia showed a two to three fold magnitude increase in groundwater recharge 50 years after conversion from deep rooted to shallow rooted vegetation allison et al 1990 in the current study the groundwater recharge rates did not decrease as one would normally expect in areas converted from cropland to grassland or forest in fact they increased by a few millimeters per year for deep rooted ecosystems such as the eucalypt forests in australia deep root water uptake greatly reduces groundwater recharge allison et al 1990 however on steep slopes such as the ones in this study land uses such as shallow rooted grasslands and jujube orchards reduce surface runoff and promote rainfall infiltration thus leading to slightly higher groundwater recharge the results of the current study are also supported by those of ilstedt et al 2016 who showed that an intermediate tree cover density such as that in the converted grassland and jujube plots maximizes groundwater recharge furthermore the groundwater recharge rates increased slightly but not significantly with the elapsed time since conversion from cropland to grassland or jujube at yuanzegou watershed this was not the case at wangdonggou watershed where the grassland at all three slope positions despite having a large elapsed time 50 years since conversion experienced smaller groundwater recharge rates than any of the land use types at yuanzegou this indicates that land use is not the first order control of groundwater recharge across the two climate zones but rather it is a local control of groundwater recharge at most thus although the length of land use or vegetation between the hillslopes of two watersheds is different they could still be used to compare the influence of climate when excluding the effects of slope aspect and land use the difference of groundwater recharge rates between the two watersheds should be controlled by climate and soil texture when comparing the two watersheds the profiles of the sub humid wangdonggou watershed had shallower tritium peak depths fig 4 but the resulting groundwater recharge rates were not significantly different from that of the semiarid yuanzegou despite the 20 increase in precipitation and 20 reduction in potential evapotranspiration at wangdonggou table 3 this suggests that precipitation is not the primary control of groundwater recharge on hillslopes across the two climate zones p 0 05 furthermore there is a significant linear correlation between the groundwater recharge rates and average clay contents within the displacement zones of all 7 profiles in the two watersheds r 0 67 p 0 05 therefore it would appear that clay content is the first order control of groundwater recharge across the two climate zones this is contrary to the typical conclusions obtained from flat landscapes where groundwater recharge rates are found to be influenced primarily by the amount of annual precipitation followed by soil texture as a second order control kim and jackson 2012 scanlon et al 2006 the reason for the apparent inconsistency may be two fold first both watersheds are located in water limited environments where annual potential evapotranspiration is generally much greater than annual precipitation and as a result the actual evapotranspiration rate relies heavily on the soil water storage in the root zone soil water storage capacity or field capacity is 0 28 m3 m 3 at wangdonggou liu et al 2010 wang et al 2008 and 0 25 m3 m 3 at yuanzegou li et al 2014 this difference 0 03 m3 m 3 in field capacity means that a 1 4 m thick root zone at wangdonggou could potentially hold 42 mm more water than that at yuanzegou which is 36 of the annual rainfall difference 117 mm between the two sites therefore most if not all of the annual precipitation difference between the two sites can be easily compensated for by the extra soil water storage capacity however due to the water limited nature of the region pet p this extra water storage would typically be consumed by vegetation between major rainfall events and thus may contribute little to the groundwater recharge in water limited regions like the chinese loess plateau water is the limiting factor for actual evapotranspiration wang et al 2011 plant will response to elevated precipitation and resultant soil water storage is to increase transpiration in these dry systems brito et al 2015 chebbi et al 2018 second the significantly lower clay contents at yuanzegou watershed resulted in a greater hydraulic conductivity and infiltration capacity as shown earlier the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of the soils at wangdonggou were 20 and 28 cm day 1 for the interglacial paleosol and glacial loess respectively while the ks for yuanzegou watershed varied between 118 and 160 cm day 1 gao et al 2011 the high ks at yuanzegou watershed may contribute to reduced surface runoff during intense rainfall events and shorter transit times of water in the root zone which in turn increases groundwater recharge compensating for the relatively low annual precipitation field studies in south western murray basin also indicated that the recharge rates decreased from 30 to 3 mm year 1 when the clay content in the top 2 m soil layer increased from 0 to 20 kennett smith et al 1994 higher clay contents in the shallow soils lead to a higher water holding capacity in evapotranspiration zone then less water will become deep drainage 4 4 study limitations and implications for hillslope processes the uncertainty analysis conducted in this study assumes that the horizontal variability is much smaller than the vertical variability within both watersheds being an aeolian sediment loess is quite texturally uniform horizontally but exhibits considerable vertical variability due to varying rates of deposition within the quaternary period however outcrops displaying the vertical stratification of the soils are present at different positions along hillslopes in the region as one would expect the scale of the horizontal variability over the sloping surface of a hillslope is still much larger than the scale of vertical variability where soil layers may be as small as centimeters in thickness this results in smaller horizontal than vertical variability for example the coefficient of variation cv values for clay contents with depth in soil profiles at yuanzegou watershed were 0 31 0 28 0 31 and 0 39 for the 7 year old jujube 16 year old jujube 7 year old grassland and 16 year old grassland respectively table 3 gao et al 2011 found that the cv value for clay contents of samples collected at depths of 0 to 0 2 m over the entirety of the yuanzegou watershed was approximately 0 22 similarly the cv values for clay contents in the soil profiles at wangdonggou watershed in the current study are 0 13 0 20 and 0 19 for the upper mid and lower slope positions respectively table 3 furthermore duan et al 2016 measured the clay contents at 105 locations at wangdonggou watershed encompassing the vertical variability of the top 3 m of the soil and the horizontal variability over several hillslopes and found that the cv value for the clay content was 0 14 considering that the distances between our sites at wangdonggou watershed are less than the distance spanned in the study performed by duan et al 2016 it is assumed that the cv for horizontal variability in our study would also be much smaller than the 0 14 recorded in the previous study therefore the horizontal variability was much smaller than the vertical variability at both yuanzegou and wangdonggou watersheds indicating that the uncertainty analysis carried out in section 3 4 included the major sources of variability and uncertainty and thus is valid hydrological processes in hillslopes are more complex than in flat areas a significant fraction of rain water could move vertically to bedrock and laterally over the bedrock surface in a hillslope the subsurface flow process which dominates mainly in humid forest regions is controlled by geology soil properties rainfall characteristics and vegetation ghasemizade and schirmer 2013 however on the chinese plateau the stream runoff is dominated by horton overland flow with less subsurface runoff because of low vegetation coverage coupled with intense precipitation in a thick unsaturated zone tao et al 2021 wu et al 2020 consequently the deep drainage water below the root zone on a hillslope on the loess plateau is more likely to recharge groundwater 5 conclusion globally the dominant control of groundwater recharge on flat landscapes is water input precipitation plus irrigation followed by vegetation type potential evapotranspiration and soil texture kim and jackson 2012 slope is the main landform unit on the chinese loess plateau but groundwater recharge in hillslopes is poorly understood to our knowledge this study makes the first attempt to quantify recharge in the deep unsaturated zone of hillslopes and compare it with the recharge on flat landscapes in the same region the well established tritium method provides a vehicle for us to do so the main findings are as follows 1 tritium concentrations showed a bell shaped distribution within soil profiles with a clearly identifiable peak the peak depth varied between 6 29 11 01 m in the sub humid wangdonggou and semi arid yuanzegou watersheds this indicates that the predominant transport mechanism for soil tritium and groundwater recharge on a hillslope is soil matrix flow as opposed to preferential flow 2 groundwater recharge rates on the loess plateau varied between 4 7 of the total precipitation on hillslopes which are only 56 of the recharge rates on flat landscapes in the region furthermore due to the large proportion of sloping land in this area the contribution of hillslopes to groundwater recharge is considerable 3 soil texture is the dominant control on groundwater recharge in the two watersheds fine textured soil experienced reduced groundwater recharge due to its relatively large soil water storage capacity and small hydraulic conductivity 4 the two watershed belong to two different climate zones subhumid and semiarid however the groundwater recharge rates of the watersheds are not significantly different suggesting relative to soil texture climate is at most a seconday control of groundwater recharge in the region author statement we have made substantial contribution to the highlights advance and further implication for the hydrology process in

8187,study region douala cameroon west africa study focus salinity of shallow coastal groundwater in douala cameroon impairs its use for drinking and industrial purposes previous studies suggest that salinization is from tidal flooding from the wouri estuary we aimed to test the tidal origin of groundwater salinization by conducting a time series investigation of water level and salinity and assessed the stable water isotopes δ¹⁸o and δd and major cations ca² and mg² in groundwater and adjacent estuarine tidal creek during the time series measurements we pumped groundwater for over 5 tidal cycles to induce flow into a test well new hydrologic insights for the region the time series groundwater level mimicked water level changes in the estuary however the temporal salinity in groundwater did not correspond to tidal salinity changes of estuarine water indicating that estuarine water did not intrude groundwater the δ¹⁸o and δd of the groundwater and estuarine samples are collinear and fall along the local meteoric water line of douala and had d excesses of 10 indicating a non evaporated rain recharge of groundwater or lack of salinization by evapoconcentration the salinity δ¹⁸o relationship showed that the origin of salinity in the coastal groundwater aquifer is not from seawater intrusion the mg² ca² ratios of 1 in groundwater compared to 6 8 in estuarine water support the non seawater origin of groundwater salinity we conclude that the salinity of coastal groundwater in douala is not affected by tide induced salinization from the adjacent wouri estuary but by geogenic sources in the aquifer keywords coastal groundwater groundwater salinization time series analysis wouri estuary cameroon 1 introduction the quality of coastal groundwater is a crucial factor in water resource management and sustainability lee and song 2007 werner et al 2013 mirzavand et al 2018 2020 ouhamdouch et al 2021 salinization is an important process that causes quality deterioration in groundwater in coastal regions studies conducted in coastal settings show that groundwater salinization occurs from seawater intrusion induced by groundwater overdraft melloul and goldenberg 1997 demirel 2004 pulido laboeuf 2004 jørgensen et al 2008 werner et al 2013 ouhamdouch et al 2017 kanagaraj et al 2018 tidal flooding and storm surges mao et al 2001 geochemical processes such as water rock interaction cation exchange carbonate and mineral dissolution evaporation of freshwater and mixing with saline connate water in the sedimentary formations hem 1985 aquilina et al 2002 amiri et al 2016 mirzavand et al 2020 and from anthropogenic pollution cary et al 2015 bahir and ouhamdouch 2020 the effective management of coastal groundwater resources depends on the understanding of sources of salinity in the groundwater however the multiplicity of mechanisms of salinization confound the determination of the origin of salinity in coastal groundwater mirzavand et al 2020 hence many studies have utilized different methods to identify saline coastal groundwater and determined their salinization mechanisms geophysical methods e g electrical resistivity have been used to detect salinity differences between saline and fresh groundwater and their interface mirzavand et al 2018 2020 although the commonly used electrical resistivity method show salinity disparities between saline and fresh groundwater the method cannot determine the origin and mechanism of groundwater salinization mirzavand et al 2020 thus to determine the source s of salinity and mechanisms of groundwater salinization studies have used hydrogeochemical modelling techniques such as phreeqe and hydrochemical facies evolution diagrams giménez forcada 2010 and geochemical tracers such as salinity minor and major ions alcalá and custodio 2008 harkness et al 2017 isawi et al 2016 mirzavand et al 2018 amiri et al 2016 2021 hydrogeochemical modelling allow researchers to simulate mixing and reaction pathways phreeqe classify water piper diagrams and decipher intrusion and freshening phases hydrochemical facies evolution diagram hfe d geochemical tracers such as major ion ratios na cl br cl so4 2 cl ca2 cl b cl mg2 cl have been used in studies to identify the major sources of salinity in groundwater alcalá and custodio 2008 amiri et al 2016 2021 however these ionic ratios can be affected by processes such as water rock interaction and anthropogenic contamination which may cause problems with source identification in coastal aquifers in urbanized settings due to the limitations of the different approaches to identify the origin of salinity in coastal groundwater researchers combine multiple approaches to elucidate the origin of salinity in groundwater although groundwater salinization in coastal areas have been widely researched using different methods few of these studies have focused on assessing the effects of salinization of groundwater by estuarine water mao et al 2001 2006 lenkopane et al 2009 tularam and singh 2009 dieng et al 2017 shalem et al 2019 as a result of tidal forcing studies on tide induced groundwater salinization in estuarine settings requires a unique experimental approach assessing near real time behavior of water and salinity in both groundwater and the estuary a significant challenge to study tide induced salinization of coastal groundwater in estuarine environments is to acquire hydrochemical data at a frequency adequate to elucidate the effects of tides in this process thus there is a need to acquire data on water level tides and tracers of salinity e g salinity major cations and tracers of water origin stable oxygen δ¹⁸o and hydrogen δd isotopes at a frequency adequate to characterize tidal effects when tracers of salinity and water origin are collected over multiples tidal cycles the data allows for direct comparison between the near real time behavior of the tracers in estuarine water to those in groundwater jones et al 1999 mao et al 2006 lenkopane et al 2009 currell et al 2015 shalem et al 2019 in this study we investigated groundwater salinization from the coastal aquifer adjacent to the tropical wouri estuary douala cameroon groundwater in the coastal douala aquifer serves as both a supplementary and a primary source of water supply for domestic and industrial activities takem et al 2010 2015 fantong et al 2016 ketchemen tandia et al 2017 wirmvem et al 2017a a study of the hydrogeochemical characteristics of surface flows and groundwater in douala by fantong et al 2016 confirmed quality impacts from salinization the groundwater salinization characterized by high chloride concentrations is attributed to tide induced flooding by estuarine water mafany 1999 fantong et al 2016 tide induced salinization adequately explains seawater contamination of coastal groundwater immediately adjacent to the coast where high tides cause 1 higher heads relative to groundwater causing estuarine water to flow into and salinize groundwater or 2 estuarine water to overtop and flood the land surface which subsequently infiltrates recharges and salinize groundwater mao et al 2006 tularam and singh 2009 shalem et al 2019 to test if tide induced estuarine water head and or flooding are responsible for estuarine water contamination of the coastal aquifer in douala mafany 1999 fantong et al 2016 we investigate tide induced salinization of groundwater in the youpwe neighborhood adjacent to the wouri estuary the youpwe neighborhood in the coastal city of douala cameroon fig 1 is an ideal location to study estuarine salinization of groundwater a tidal creek dr creek forms a linear boundary between groundwater below the youpwe neighborhood and the estuary and can be envisioned as a linear source of estuarine water which could potentially impact shallow groundwater we employed a combination of time series water level and salinity measurements and assessed the δ¹⁸o and δd and major cation ratios to track estuarine salinization of groundwater our objective was to ascertain if saline water from the wouri estuary is the cause of salinization of groundwater our findings are important for understanding coastal groundwater salinization and contamination and for management of coastal groundwater resources

creek is flanked to the north by the youpwe neighborhood built on previously destroyed marshland and to the south by mangrove forests of the estuary fig 1b the hydrologic regime of the dr creek and the wouri estuary is characterized by semidiurnal mixed tides with an average range of about 3 m olivry 1974 onguene et al 2014 3 methodology 3 1 locations for groundwater and estuarine water investigation we selected three locations to investigate groundwater properties fig 1b and c well 1 4 0 27 16 n 9 42 3 62 e is a 0 25 m diameter borehole that is 30 m deep and located 122 m from dr

water temperature and electrical conductivity we recorded air temperature c and barometric pressure with a solinst barologger the solinst barologger was set to record and convert the barometric pressure in the same units as water level m by using a conversion factor of 0 101972 m kpa the barologger pressure sensor has an accuracy of 0 05 kpa and the air temperature sensor has an accuracy of 0 05 c and a resolution of 0 003 c the barologger was deployed outside the aquarius marina 2000 hotel 4 0 26 60 n 9 42 3 35 e and set to an altitude of 0 m above sea level asl we used solinst ltc level temperature conductivity loggers to record water level temperature and electrical conductivity ec in groundwater and estuarine water the solinst ltc logger records water level with an accuracy of 0 1 percentage of full scale and is automatically temperature compensated between 0 40 c the temperature sensor of the solinst ltc has an accuracy of 0 1 c and a resolution of 0 1 c the solinst ltc

normalized to 25 c the ec values were converted to salinity by multiplying the ec by 0 0006 which was empirically determined from a least squares regression of ec vs salinity measured in the douala estuary by us bennett 1976 a solinst ltc logger was deployed in well 1 from 6 11 2019 at 15 h to 6 14 2019 at 10 h the level temperature and conductivity of groundwater in well 1 was monitored for 19 5 h before it was subsequently pumped at 4 7 m³ minute for the duration 47 5 h of the study using a high capacity well pump another solinst ltc logger was deployed in dr creek near a small 200 m diameter island 4 0 4 28 n 9 42 3 45 e in the middle of the tidal channel fig 1b the logger was deployed from 6 12 2019 at 10 h to 6 14 2019 at 10 h at 5 cm from the channel bottom in a 5 2 cm diameter perforated pvc tube the solinst barologger and ltc loggers were programmed to collect data in a linear sampling mode at minute intervals the water levels recorded by the ltc leveloggers were corrected for barometric pressure effects using the time equivalent barometric pressure values recorded by the barologger barometric pressure compensation is necessary because of elevation differences above and below sea level and pressure changes from storms which can introduce errors to ltc leveloggers recorded water levels 3 3 water sampling groundwater samples from shallow and hand dug wells

groundwater sampled in the youpwe neighborhood in douala cameroon ranged from 399 to 2499 μs cm table 1 the ec exceeded the who drinking water limit of 750 μs cm for drinking water who 2011 the salinized groundwater observation is consistent with the results of previous studies that show highly salinized groundwater in the douala coastal aquifer takem et al 2010 2015 fantong et al 2016 ketchemen tandia et al 2017 wirmvem et al 2017a we use our time series groundwater and estuarine water salinity and temperature and the stable water isotopes salinity and ionic ratios to assess if the origin of salinity that impairs the groundwater quality in the coastal aquifer in douala cameroon is tidally induced 5 1 1 evaluation of tidal induced groundwater salinization from temporal salinity and temperature variations tidal intrusion of estuarine water into coastal aquifers that causes salinization occurs during high tides when estuarine water 1 has a higher head which induces flow of saline water into the groundwater aquifer where groundwater has a lower head and or 2 overtops the topography and cause flooding and seepage of saline estuarine water into the groundwater aquifer mao et al 2001 2006 lenkopane et al 2009 tularam and singh 2009 shalem et al 2019 tidal intrusion of saline water into coastal aquifers will induce concomitant or rhythmic cyclicity in groundwater levels and chemistry wang and tsay 2001 lenkopane et al 2009 mitra et al 2011 to track groundwater salinization due to tidal forcing we compare the time series variations in water level tides salinity and temperature in estuarine water from dr creek and the adjacent groundwater aquifer in youpwe fig 2 similar to water in dr creek groundwater level increases and decreases coincide with the semidiurnal mixed tidal forcing in the wouri estuary fig 2a vs 2b the variations in salinity in dr creek fig 2d corresponds to tidal cycles fig 2b while the temporal salinity in groundwater fig 2c does not correspond to tidal cycles fig 2a this disparity between the behavior of tides and the temporal salinity in groundwater allows us to argue that shallow coastal groundwater at a distance of 120 m from the estuary is not affected by tide induced salinization because tides are rhythmic over time the effect of tidal salinization should show a rhythmic behavior in the nearshore groundwater shalem et al 2019 it is clear that the temperature in dr creek fig 2f only slightly mimics the sinusoidal patterns of tides fig 2b with slight temperature decreases at high tide on the other hand groundwater temperature fig 2e mimics neither the behavior of the air temperature fig 2g nor dr creek water temperature fig 2f the nearly constant temperature temporal difference of 0 1 ⁰c table s1 in groundwater indicates that groundwater temperature is not affected by mixing with warmer surface water temperature range 1 4 ⁰c table s1 from dr creek we posit that groundwater level fluctuations fig 2a which coincided with tidal cycles in dr creek fig 2b is due to the effects of tidal energy and not from the intrusion or infiltration of estuarine water into the groundwater e g wang and tsay 2001 5 1 2 cause of groundwater salinization from isotopic and hydrochemical tracers the δ¹⁸o and δd and salinity are conservative and are therefore good indicators of salinization by evapoconcentration and tracers of mixing between fresh groundwater and saline estuarine water kim et al 2003 bouchaou et al 2008 mongelli et al 2013 cary et al 2015 bahir et al 2018 carreira et al 2018 amiri et al 2016 the δ¹⁸o and δd of water from dr creek groundwater in the youpwe neighborhood and the wouri river water wirmvem et al 2017a co vary fig 3 a cluster along the lmwl of douala wirmvem et al 2017b and plot above the gmwl craig 1961 the clustering of groundwater samples along the lmwl indicates meteoric origin of the groundwater ketchemen tandia et al 2007 wirmvem et al 2017b evidence for evapoconcentration in increasing solute concentrations and therefore responsible for groundwater salinization by evapoconcentration can be assessed from the relationship between salinity and d excess fig 3b lower d excess values indicate greater extent of evaporation e g dansgaard 1964 which can be linked to salinization e g fröhlich et al 2002 huang and pang 2012 krishan et al 2020 the d excess in groundwater estuarine water in dr creek and the wouri river are between 11 and 15 and are in the range of 10 17 observed in douala precipitation wirmvem et al 2017b indicating a meteoric origin the wide range in d excess with a relatively limited variation in salinity is an indication of minimal effect of evaporation consistent with unevaporated rain recharge of groundwater short residence time of water in the creek and river and or low evaporation rates from high humidity fantong et al 2016 we can use the relationship between salinity and δ¹⁸o fig 4 a to assess saline estuarine water intrusion and mixing with groundwater e g gonfiantini and araguás 1988 bahir et al 2018 in fig 4a we show a model line of freshwater salinity 0 δ¹⁸o 2 9 and seawater salinity 35 δ¹⁸o 0 end member mixing we also show a line that depicts dissolution and leaching in freshwater with a δ¹⁸o 2 9 the arrow showing increasing salinity indicates that the dissolution and leaching processes do not modify the δ¹⁸o composition of water gonfiantini and araguás 1988 both model lines have a δ¹⁸o end member value of 2 9 which represents the average δ¹⁸o composition of groundwater in douala on the salinity vs δ¹⁸o plot the data points from dr creek the wouri river wirmvem et al 2017a coastal groundwater from youpwe and the rest of the douala coastal aquifer fantong et al 2016 do not fall along the freshwater seawater mixing line fig 4a indicating no seawater intrusion the groundwater samples that were analyzed from well 1 were collected between low and high tide regimes fig 2a and yet the data forms a cluster in the salinity vs δ¹⁸o plot this similarity of groundwater δ¹⁸o and salinity despite variations in collection times relative to tides indicates no systematic increases or decreases from tide induced intrusion of estuarine water into groundwater similarly estuarine water wouri river and groundwater are not affected by dissolution and or leaching as the samples do not plot in the direction of the model line indicating dissolution and leaching fig 4a the lack of seawater intrusion into the coastal aquifer is further supported by the mg² ca² vs the electrical conductivity relationship fig 4b the mg² ca² ratios should increase in groundwater with increased proportion of seawater intrusion where higher ratios 1 depict seawater intrusion and lower ratios 1 indicate no seawater intrusion pulido leboeuf et al 2003 salem and osman 2017 the mg² ca² of estuarine water from dr creek range from 6 to 8 and are much higher compared to groundwater fig 4b groundwater from the coastal aquifer in youpwe as well as from the rest of the douala coastal aquifer takem et al 2010 2015 fantong et al 2016 show low mg² ca² ratios of 1 indicating no tide induced salinization of groundwater fig 4b the finding of no tide induced groundwater salinization is inconsistent with the previous suggestion of possible seawater source for the high chloride concentrations observed in about 30 of the shallow groundwater in the douala aquifer located 0 44 3 km from the shoreline by fantong et al 2016 fantong et al 2016 argued that during high tides seawater that flows through the dibamba river and wouri river cause bank overflow and flooding the saline water from bank overflow and flooding recharges the unconfined shallow aquifer causing the high chloride concentrations observed although estuarine water overflow and flooding is able to salinize groundwater in close proximity to the rivers takem 2012 established from na cl ratios in groundwater in the douala aquifer that less than 20 of samples had na cl ratio lower than that of seawater and argued against seawater intrusion as the primary source of the chloride the widely distributed high chloride concentrations in groundwater of the douala coastal aquifer was then attributed to sea spray aerosol and atmospheric sea salt deposition as an alternative explanation to seawater intrusion takem et al 2015 the salts deposited on the surface from the sea spray and atmospheric deposition are flushed by rain recharge into groundwater takem et al 2015 during our study we observed tidal flooding at the surface adjacent to the groundwater sampling location which can potentially induce saline water flow and or recharge into the shallow groundwater moreover the pumping of well 1 at 4 7 m3 s should have further promoted lower groundwater head which was decreased by 1 5 m and facilitated salinization from inflow of estuarine water with a higher head however the mg² ca² ratios of 1 in groundwater is consistent with results from takem 2012 that indicated that the high chloride concentrations in the douala coastal aquifer are not from modern seawater from the gulf of guinea our results do not support the takem et al 2015 idea of a sea spray origin for the high chloride concentrations in groundwater either we make this argument because the ratio of the ions e g mg2 ca2 in sea spray or sea salt deposition will be the same as in the seawater if the sea spray or salt deposition was responsible for the high chloride concentrations in groundwater we should observe mg² ca² ratios 1 which is not the case for groundwater in youpwe neighborhood and the rest of the douala coastal aquifer fig 4b wirmvem et al 2017a posit that the main source of chloride in groundwater in the douala coastal aquifer is from seepage from the numerous pit latrines in the city although our current study is unable to test this idea of anthropogenic pollution we do observe higher salinity values 1 psu in groundwater well 1 and well 3 fig 3b which can be attributed to either aquifer source of contamination or anthropogenic pollution 6 conclusions we assessed tide induced salinization in coastal groundwater in the youpwe neighborhood in douala which is adjacent to the wouri estuary in cameroon we employed a combination of time series investigations of water level tides salinity and temperature and assessments of major cations and δ¹⁸o and δd in estuarine water and in groundwater during our experiment we pumped groundwater to decrease its head and to induce flow from estuarine water with higher head groundwater table showed tidal induced fluctuations similar to flood and tide ebb in the estuary the salinity δ¹⁸o and δd and mg2 ca2 used as tracers showed that salinity in groundwater did not originate from seawater and that there was no evidence of mixing between saline water in the estuary and groundwater thus our results show that shallow groundwater 120 250 m from the estuary coast and groundwater in the broader douala coastal aquifer in general is not affected by tidal induced salinization our findings indicate that in estuarine settings where tidal salinization is not a major process controlling groundwater quality other processes such as anthropogenic pollution and or contamination from the aquifer formation connate water in the aquifer units that may affect groundwater quality should not be ignored disclosure statement no potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors funding this work was supported by the national science

8187,study region douala cameroon west africa study focus salinity of shallow coastal groundwater in douala cameroon impairs its use for drinking and industrial purposes previous studies suggest that salinization is from tidal flooding from the wouri estuary we aimed to test the tidal origin of groundwater salinization by conducting a time series investigation of water level and salinity and assessed the stable water isotopes δ¹⁸o and δd and major cations ca² and mg² in groundwater and adjacent estuarine tidal creek during the time series measurements we pumped groundwater for over 5 tidal cycles to induce flow into a test well new hydrologic insights for the region the time series groundwater level mimicked water level changes in the estuary however the temporal salinity in groundwater did not correspond to tidal salinity changes of estuarine water indicating that estuarine water did not intrude groundwater the δ¹⁸o and δd of the groundwater and estuarine samples are collinear and fall along the local meteoric water line of douala and had d excesses of 10 indicating a non evaporated rain recharge of groundwater or lack of salinization by evapoconcentration the salinity δ¹⁸o relationship showed that the origin of salinity in the coastal groundwater aquifer is not from seawater intrusion the mg² ca² ratios of 1 in groundwater compared to 6 8 in estuarine water support the non seawater origin of groundwater salinity we conclude that the salinity of coastal groundwater in douala is not affected by tide induced salinization from the adjacent wouri estuary but by geogenic sources in the aquifer keywords coastal groundwater groundwater salinization time series analysis wouri estuary cameroon 1 introduction the quality of coastal groundwater is a crucial factor in water resource management and sustainability lee and song 2007 werner et al 2013 mirzavand et al 2018 2020 ouhamdouch et al 2021 salinization is an important process that causes quality deterioration in groundwater in coastal regions studies conducted in coastal settings show that groundwater salinization occurs from seawater intrusion induced by groundwater overdraft melloul and goldenberg 1997 demirel 2004 pulido laboeuf 2004 jørgensen et al 2008 werner et al 2013 ouhamdouch et al 2017 kanagaraj et al 2018 tidal flooding and storm surges mao et al 2001 geochemical processes such as water rock interaction cation exchange carbonate and mineral dissolution evaporation of freshwater and mixing with saline connate water in the sedimentary formations hem 1985 aquilina et al 2002 amiri et al 2016 mirzavand et al 2020 and from anthropogenic pollution cary et al 2015 bahir and ouhamdouch 2020 the effective management of coastal groundwater resources depends on the understanding of sources of salinity in the groundwater however the multiplicity of mechanisms of salinization confound the determination of the origin of salinity in coastal groundwater mirzavand et al 2020 hence many studies have utilized different methods to identify saline coastal groundwater and determined their salinization mechanisms geophysical methods e g electrical resistivity have been used to detect salinity differences between saline and fresh groundwater and their interface mirzavand et al 2018 2020 although the commonly used electrical resistivity method show salinity disparities between saline and fresh groundwater the method cannot determine the origin and mechanism of groundwater salinization mirzavand et al 2020 thus to determine the source s of salinity and mechanisms of groundwater salinization studies have used hydrogeochemical modelling techniques such as phreeqe and hydrochemical facies evolution diagrams giménez forcada 2010 and geochemical tracers such as salinity minor and major ions alcalá and custodio 2008 harkness et al 2017 isawi et al 2016 mirzavand et al 2018 amiri et al 2016 2021 hydrogeochemical modelling allow researchers to simulate mixing and reaction pathways phreeqe classify water piper diagrams and decipher intrusion and freshening phases hydrochemical facies evolution diagram hfe d geochemical tracers such as major ion ratios na cl br cl so4 2 cl ca2 cl b cl mg2 cl have been used in studies to identify the major sources of salinity in groundwater alcalá and custodio 2008 amiri et al 2016 2021 however these ionic ratios can be affected by processes such as water rock interaction and anthropogenic contamination which may cause problems with source identification in coastal aquifers in urbanized settings due to the limitations of the different approaches to identify the origin of salinity in coastal groundwater researchers combine multiple approaches to elucidate the origin of salinity in groundwater although groundwater salinization in coastal areas have been widely researched using different methods few of these studies have focused on assessing the effects of salinization of groundwater by estuarine water mao et al 2001 2006 lenkopane et al 2009 tularam and singh 2009 dieng et al 2017 shalem et al 2019 as a result of tidal forcing studies on tide induced groundwater salinization in estuarine settings requires a unique experimental approach assessing near real time behavior of water and salinity in both groundwater and the estuary a significant challenge to study tide induced salinization of coastal groundwater in estuarine environments is to acquire hydrochemical data at a frequency adequate to elucidate the effects of tides in this process thus there is a need to acquire data on water level tides and tracers of salinity e g salinity major cations and tracers of water origin stable oxygen δ¹⁸o and hydrogen δd isotopes at a frequency adequate to characterize tidal effects when tracers of salinity and water origin are collected over multiples tidal cycles the data allows for direct comparison between the near real time behavior of the tracers in estuarine water to those in groundwater jones et al 1999 mao et al 2006 lenkopane et al 2009 currell et al 2015 shalem et al 2019 in this study we investigated groundwater salinization from the coastal aquifer adjacent to the tropical wouri estuary douala cameroon groundwater in the coastal douala aquifer serves as both a supplementary and a primary source of water supply for domestic and industrial activities takem et al 2010 2015 fantong et al 2016 ketchemen tandia et al 2017 wirmvem et al 2017a a study of the hydrogeochemical characteristics of surface flows and groundwater in douala by fantong et al 2016 confirmed quality impacts from salinization the groundwater salinization characterized by high chloride concentrations is attributed to tide induced flooding by estuarine water mafany 1999 fantong et al 2016 tide induced salinization adequately explains seawater contamination of coastal groundwater immediately adjacent to the coast where high tides cause 1 higher heads relative to groundwater causing estuarine water to flow into and salinize groundwater or 2 estuarine water to overtop and flood the land surface which subsequently infiltrates recharges and salinize groundwater mao et al 2006 tularam and singh 2009 shalem et al 2019 to test if tide induced estuarine water head and or flooding are responsible for estuarine water contamination of the coastal aquifer in douala mafany 1999 fantong et al 2016 we investigate tide induced salinization of groundwater in the youpwe neighborhood adjacent to the wouri estuary the youpwe neighborhood in the coastal city of douala cameroon fig 1 is an ideal location to study estuarine salinization of groundwater a tidal creek dr creek forms a linear boundary between groundwater below the youpwe neighborhood and the estuary and can be envisioned as a linear source of estuarine water which could potentially impact shallow groundwater we employed a combination of time series water level and salinity measurements and assessed the δ¹⁸o and δd and major cation ratios to track estuarine salinization of groundwater our objective was to ascertain if saline water from the wouri estuary is the cause of salinization of groundwater our findings are important for understanding coastal groundwater salinization and contamination and for management of coastal groundwater resources

southern boundary of the eastern part of the city of douala fig 1a dr creek opens to the eastern side of the wouri estuary and the nearly 10 km long channel is nearly perpendicular to the estuary dr creek is flanked to the north by the youpwe neighborhood built on previously destroyed marshland and to the south by mangrove forests of the estuary fig 1b the hydrologic regime of the dr creek and the wouri estuary is characterized by semidiurnal mixed tides with an average range of about 3 m olivry 1974 onguene et al 2014 3 methodology 3 1 locations for groundwater and estuarine water investigation we selected three locations to investigate groundwater properties fig 1b and c well 1 4 0 27 16 n 9 42 3 62 e is a 0 25 m diameter borehole that is 30 m deep and located 122 m from dr creek well 1 was drilled to support commercial activities of a hotel and is not in use because of contamination by salinity well 2 4 0 29 89 n 9 42 3 20 e is a hand dug well 3 m deep with a diameter

water temperature and electrical conductivity we recorded air temperature c and barometric pressure with a solinst barologger the solinst barologger was set to record and convert the barometric pressure in the same units as water level m by using a conversion factor of 0 101972 m kpa the barologger pressure sensor has an accuracy of 0 05 kpa and the air temperature sensor has an accuracy of 0 05 c and a resolution of 0 003 c the barologger was deployed outside the aquarius marina 2000 hotel 4 0 26 60 n 9 42 3 35 e and set to an altitude of 0 m above sea level asl we used solinst ltc level temperature conductivity loggers to record water level temperature and electrical conductivity ec in groundwater and estuarine water the solinst ltc logger records water level with an accuracy of 0 1 percentage of full scale and is automatically temperature compensated between 0 40 c the temperature sensor of the solinst ltc has an accuracy of 0 1 c and a resolution of 0 1 c the solinst ltc measures the ec using a 4 electrode conductivity sensor that operates between 20 to 80 c has the ability to measure on a full range of 0 80 000 μs cm with a resolution of 1 μs cm and the ec is normalized to 25 c the ec values were converted to salinity by multiplying the ec by 0 0006 which was empirically determined from a least squares regression of ec vs salinity measured in the douala estuary by us bennett 1976 a solinst ltc logger was deployed in well 1 from 6 11 2019 at 15 h to 6 14 2019 at 10 h the level temperature and conductivity of groundwater in well 1 was monitored for 19 5 h before it was subsequently pumped at 4 7 m³ minute for the duration 47 5 h of the study using a high capacity well pump another solinst ltc logger was deployed in dr creek near a small 200 m diameter island 4 0 4 28 n 9 42 3 45 e in the middle of the tidal channel fig 1b the logger was deployed from 6 12 2019 at 10 h to 6 14 2019 at 10 h at 5 cm from the channel bottom in a 5 2 cm diameter perforated pvc tube the solinst barologger and ltc loggers were programmed to collect data in a linear sampling mode at minute intervals the water levels recorded by the ltc leveloggers were corrected for barometric pressure effects using the time equivalent barometric pressure values recorded by the barologger barometric pressure compensation is necessary because of elevation differences above and below sea level and pressure changes from storms which can introduce errors to ltc leveloggers recorded water levels 3 3 water sampling groundwater samples from shallow and hand dug wells wells 1 2 and 3 and surface water samples from the estuary were collected using standard sampling procedures apha 1985 six samples were collected from well 1 during well pumping at 2 h intervals on 6

sampling the salinity and electrical conductivity ec were measured in situ in groundwater and in dr creek using a hanna hi98194 multi parameter ph oxidation reduction potential orp electrical

readings were taken after stabilization of ph temperature and ec groundwater was collected directly from the outlet of the hose attached to the pump surface water from dr creek was collected at 25 cm below the surface by the grab technique all water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm nylon filters during collection the sampling bottles used were rinsed with the filtered sample to be collected

collected unacidified in 25 ml glass scintillation vials with inverted cone closures all the water samples were kept cool and transported to the university of delaware usa where they were refrigerated until analyses in the laboratory the water samples were analyzed for calcium and magnesium by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer agilent tech icp ms 7500cx series the δ¹⁸o and δd were measured using a los gatos research liquid water isotope analyzer lgr lwia the isotopic ratios are reported in delta notation δ in per mil δ rsample rstandard rstandard x 1000 where r is the ratio of

by 1 1 m table s1 the temporal groundwater table response was sinusoidal with peak water level or low water level separated by 13 h fig 2 a the sinusoidal behavior and the range in change of groundwater level observed for 19 5 h before pumping was the same as during pumping over 47 5 h except for the lowering of the water table by 1 5 m from the pumping action water level in dr creek varied by 1 2 m table s1 the water level reflects semidiurnal mixed tides with a periodicity of 13 h fig 2b 4 1 2 salinity the salinity of groundwater in well 1 varied between 0 48 and0 62 psu table s1 the temporal salinity in well 1 for the 19 5 h before pumping decreased only slightly from 0 62 to 0 49 psu and during pumping the salinity was nearly constant at 0 48 psu for the 47 5 h fig 2c the salinity in dr creek varied by 1 4 table s1 the temporal changes in the salinity coincide with tidal cycles with high salinity observed during low tides and lower salinity observed during high tides

groundwater sampled in the youpwe neighborhood in douala cameroon ranged from 399 to 2499 μs cm table 1 the ec exceeded the who drinking water limit of 750 μs cm for drinking water who 2011 the salinized groundwater observation is consistent with the results of previous studies that show highly salinized groundwater in the douala coastal aquifer takem et al 2010 2015 fantong et al 2016 ketchemen tandia et al 2017 wirmvem et al 2017a we use our time series groundwater and estuarine water salinity and temperature and the stable water isotopes salinity and ionic ratios to assess if the origin of salinity that impairs the groundwater quality in the coastal aquifer in douala cameroon is tidally induced 5 1 1 evaluation of tidal induced groundwater salinization from temporal salinity and temperature variations tidal intrusion of estuarine water into coastal aquifers that causes salinization occurs during high tides when estuarine water 1 has a higher head which induces flow of saline water into the groundwater aquifer where groundwater has a lower head and or 2 overtops the topography and cause flooding and seepage of saline estuarine water into the groundwater aquifer mao et al 2001 2006 lenkopane et al 2009 tularam and singh 2009 shalem et al 2019 tidal intrusion of saline water into coastal aquifers will induce concomitant or rhythmic cyclicity in groundwater levels and chemistry wang and tsay 2001 lenkopane et al 2009 mitra et al 2011 to track groundwater salinization due to tidal forcing we compare the time series variations in water level tides salinity and temperature in estuarine water from dr creek and the adjacent groundwater aquifer in youpwe fig 2 similar to water in dr creek groundwater level increases and decreases coincide with the semidiurnal mixed tidal forcing in the wouri estuary fig 2a vs 2b the variations in salinity in dr creek fig 2d corresponds to tidal cycles fig 2b while the temporal salinity in groundwater fig 2c does not correspond to tidal cycles fig 2a this disparity between the behavior of tides and the temporal salinity in groundwater allows us to argue that shallow coastal groundwater at a distance of 120 m from the estuary is not affected by tide induced salinization because tides are rhythmic over time the effect of tidal salinization should show a rhythmic behavior in the nearshore groundwater shalem et al 2019 it is clear that the temperature in dr creek fig 2f only slightly mimics the sinusoidal patterns of tides fig 2b with slight temperature decreases at high tide on the other hand groundwater temperature fig 2e mimics neither the behavior of the air temperature fig 2g nor dr creek water temperature fig 2f the nearly constant temperature temporal difference of 0 1 ⁰c table s1 in groundwater indicates that groundwater temperature is not affected by mixing with warmer surface water temperature range 1 4 ⁰c table s1 from dr creek we posit that groundwater level fluctuations fig 2a which coincided with tidal cycles in dr creek fig 2b is due to the effects of tidal energy and not from the intrusion or infiltration of estuarine water into the groundwater e g wang and tsay 2001 5 1 2 cause of groundwater salinization from isotopic and hydrochemical tracers the δ¹⁸o and δd and salinity are conservative and are therefore good indicators of salinization by evapoconcentration and tracers of mixing between fresh groundwater and saline estuarine water kim et al 2003 bouchaou et al 2008 mongelli et al 2013 cary et al 2015 bahir et al 2018 carreira et al 2018 amiri et al 2016 the δ¹⁸o and δd of water from dr creek groundwater in the youpwe neighborhood and the wouri river water wirmvem et al 2017a co vary fig 3 a cluster along the lmwl of douala wirmvem et al 2017b and plot above the gmwl craig 1961 the clustering of groundwater samples along the lmwl indicates meteoric origin of the groundwater ketchemen tandia et al 2007 wirmvem et al 2017b evidence for evapoconcentration in increasing solute concentrations and therefore responsible for groundwater salinization by evapoconcentration can be assessed from the relationship between salinity and d excess fig 3b lower d excess values indicate greater extent of evaporation e g dansgaard 1964 which can be linked to salinization e g fröhlich et al 2002 huang and pang 2012 krishan et al 2020 the d excess in groundwater estuarine water in dr creek and the wouri river are between 11 and 15 and are in the range of 10 17 observed in douala precipitation wirmvem et al 2017b indicating a meteoric origin the wide range in d excess with a relatively limited variation in salinity is an indication of minimal effect of evaporation consistent with unevaporated rain recharge of groundwater short residence time of water in the creek and river and or low evaporation rates from high humidity fantong et al 2016 we can use the relationship between salinity and δ¹⁸o fig 4 a to assess saline estuarine water intrusion and mixing with groundwater e g gonfiantini and araguás 1988 bahir et al 2018 in fig 4a we show a model line of freshwater salinity 0 δ¹⁸o 2 9 and seawater salinity 35 δ¹⁸o 0 end member mixing we also show a line that depicts dissolution and leaching in freshwater with a δ¹⁸o 2 9 the arrow showing increasing salinity indicates that the dissolution and leaching processes do not modify the δ¹⁸o composition of water gonfiantini and araguás 1988 both model lines have a δ¹⁸o end member value of 2 9 which represents the average δ¹⁸o composition of groundwater in douala on the salinity vs δ¹⁸o plot the data points from dr creek the wouri river wirmvem et al 2017a coastal groundwater from youpwe and the rest of the douala coastal aquifer fantong et al 2016 do not fall along the freshwater seawater mixing line fig 4a indicating no seawater intrusion the groundwater samples that were analyzed from well 1 were collected between low and high tide regimes fig 2a and yet the data forms a cluster in the salinity vs δ¹⁸o plot this similarity of groundwater δ¹⁸o and salinity despite variations in collection times relative to tides indicates no systematic increases or decreases from tide induced intrusion of estuarine water into groundwater similarly estuarine water wouri river and groundwater are not affected by dissolution and or leaching as the samples do not plot in the direction of the model line indicating dissolution and leaching fig 4a the lack of seawater intrusion into the coastal aquifer is further supported by the mg² ca² vs the electrical conductivity relationship fig 4b the mg² ca² ratios should increase in groundwater with increased proportion of seawater intrusion where higher ratios 1 depict seawater intrusion and lower ratios 1 indicate no seawater intrusion pulido leboeuf et al 2003 salem and osman 2017 the mg² ca² of estuarine water from dr creek range from 6 to 8 and are much higher compared to groundwater fig 4b groundwater from the coastal aquifer in youpwe as well as from the rest of the douala coastal aquifer takem et al 2010 2015 fantong et al 2016 show low mg² ca² ratios of 1 indicating no tide induced salinization of groundwater fig 4b the finding of no tide induced groundwater salinization is inconsistent with the previous suggestion of possible seawater source for the high chloride concentrations observed in about 30 of the shallow groundwater in the douala aquifer located 0 44 3 km from the shoreline by fantong et al 2016 fantong et al 2016 argued that during high tides seawater that flows through the dibamba river and wouri river cause bank overflow and flooding the saline water from bank overflow and flooding recharges the unconfined shallow aquifer causing the high chloride concentrations observed although estuarine water overflow and flooding is able to salinize groundwater in close proximity to the rivers takem 2012 established from na cl ratios in groundwater in the douala aquifer that less than 20 of samples had na cl ratio lower than that of seawater and argued against seawater intrusion as the primary source of the chloride the widely distributed high chloride concentrations in groundwater of the douala coastal aquifer was then attributed to sea spray aerosol and atmospheric sea salt deposition as an alternative explanation to seawater intrusion takem et al 2015 the salts deposited on the surface from the sea spray and atmospheric deposition are flushed by rain recharge into groundwater takem et al 2015 during our study we observed tidal flooding at the surface adjacent to the groundwater sampling location which can potentially induce saline water flow and or recharge into the shallow groundwater moreover the pumping of well 1 at 4 7 m3 s should have further promoted lower groundwater head which was decreased by 1 5 m and facilitated salinization from inflow of estuarine water with a higher head however the mg² ca² ratios of 1 in groundwater is consistent with results from takem 2012 that indicated that the high chloride concentrations in the douala coastal aquifer are not from modern seawater from the gulf of guinea our results do not support the takem et al 2015 idea of a sea spray origin for the high chloride concentrations in groundwater either we make this argument because the ratio of the ions e g mg2 ca2 in sea spray or sea salt deposition will be the same as in the seawater if the sea spray or salt deposition was responsible for the high chloride concentrations in groundwater we should observe mg² ca² ratios 1 which is not the case for groundwater in youpwe neighborhood and the rest of the douala coastal aquifer fig 4b wirmvem et al 2017a posit that the main source of chloride in groundwater in the douala coastal aquifer is from seepage from the numerous pit latrines in the city although our current study is unable to test this idea of anthropogenic pollution we do observe higher salinity values 1 psu in groundwater well 1 and well 3 fig 3b which can be attributed to either aquifer source of contamination or anthropogenic pollution 6 conclusions we assessed tide induced salinization in coastal groundwater in the youpwe neighborhood in douala which is adjacent to the wouri estuary in cameroon we employed a combination of time series investigations of water level tides salinity and temperature and assessments of major cations and δ¹⁸o and δd in estuarine water and in groundwater during our experiment we pumped groundwater to decrease its head and to induce flow from estuarine water with higher head groundwater table showed tidal induced fluctuations similar to flood and tide ebb in the estuary the salinity δ¹⁸o and δd and mg2 ca2 used as tracers showed that salinity in groundwater did not originate from seawater and that there was no evidence of mixing between saline water in the estuary and groundwater thus our results show that shallow groundwater 120 250 m from the estuary coast and groundwater in the broader douala coastal aquifer in general is not affected by tidal induced salinization our findings indicate that in estuarine settings where tidal salinization is not a major process controlling groundwater quality other processes such as anthropogenic pollution and or contamination from the aquifer formation connate water in the aquifer units that may affect groundwater quality should not be ignored disclosure statement no potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors funding this work was supported by the national science

significant challenge to water resource management in this study the sustainability of llrb was evaluated by comparing hydrologic availability with ecological and anthropogenic needs current river ecological status was scored with a habitat integrity index verified through ground truthing field surveys and aerial imagery data local stakeholder interviews were used to further evaluate the habitat index scores deficiencies between water availability and ecological human requirements were assessed with a water scarcity index new hydrological insights for the region four environmental flow categories defined as excellent fair poor and degraded coincided to approximately 50 39 27 and 14 of the natural mean annual flow respectively stakeholder interview responses indicated annual water shortages currently occur between august and november and coincide with poor and degraded environmental flow conditions water supplies appear to meet consumption needs when calculated on an annual basis with the water scarcity index however when calculated monthly there is not enough to meet human water demand between august and october this deficit period will likely expand from june to november due to projected increases in future water demands as the greatest water use in the basin is agricultural irrigation long term environmental flows sustainability will likely depend upon

experience water quality issues in addition to availability problems hirji et al 2002 addressing the water needs of aquatic riparian estuarian and other associated ecosystems will require strong water conservation efforts in multiple sectors tough choices will have to be made to ensure the long term environmental health of watersheds and the human activities they support dyson et al 2008 this study evaluated monthly and annual water volume scarcity in the lower limpopo river basin llrb to quantify sustainable balances between ecological integrity and anthropogenic activities the limpopo river basin lrb sustains ecosystems that are biologically diverse and provide ecosystem services critical to the human livelihoods among lrb communities the basin supports an estimated 5200 human settlements of which 49 lie within mozambique un habitat unep 2007 in historical times the limpopo river was a strong flowing perennial river but is now regarded as a weakly flowing perennial river flows frequently cease during drought periods and large stretches of the middle and lower reaches of the river may have no surface water present ashton et al 2001 the over use of water can cause severe water shortages in the lower catchment water shortages negatively affect downstream ecosystems and people with a high socio economic dependence on these ecosystems fao safr 2004 reported increases in abstractions are apparent in dry season as it is not feasible from a socio economic developmental point of view to maintain or return the natural regime of the river by forcing full reduction of water consumption needs for various uses it is important to identify a balance between consumption needs for social and economic purposes with the minimum requirements for ecosystem maintenance hipolito and vaz 2011 additionally because of local data availability efr are evaluated from the aspect of water quantity only thus ecological aspects targeting specific species with a specific location in the river ecosystem are not considered in this study 2 description of study area the lrb is a transboundary basin covering a 412 938 km2 area shared by south africa 47 botswana 17

southern african research and documentation centre 2003 the llrb study area encompasses 5618 km2 in southeastern mozambique fig 1 the catchment characteristics of the lrb are diverse covering different climatic and topographic zones as well as land use types including protected areas and sensitive ecosystems african water facility african development bank 2014 in the mozambique portion of the basin the climate varies from humid semi arid to arid along the coastal strip the mean annual rainfall is 800 1000 mm declining to less than 400 mm in the dry interior bordering zimbabwe rainfall is highly seasonal with 95 occurring between october and april often with a mid season dry spell during critical periods of crop growth fao safr 2004 the temperature and reference evapotranspiration also show variation gradient toward the interior the average annual temperature in the basin ranges from 23 c to 26 c the largest annual water deficits are observed between september and november the relative humidity is generally higher than 70 and may reach even higher values between may and august except within the drier pafúri region brito et al 2009 the main channels in the llrb are the limpopo river and its tributary the elephant river van der zaag et al 2010 the major structures influencing river flow in mozambique are the massingir dam with 2840 106 m3 of capacity located in the upper portion of the elephant river and the macarretane weir on the limpopo river boroto and görgens 1999 the largest water use in the llrb is agricultural irrigation aurecon amei pty ltd 2013 3 methodology 3 1 assessment of current river condition the current condition of the limpopo river was assessed at fifteen sites from mabalane to xai xai using a procedure described by kleynhans 1996 and kleynhans and louw 2008 ground truthing surveys were conducted in the dry season in july 2016 site visits were selected based on accessibility land use topography soil conditions irrigation infrastructure and other water uses influencing water quantity and quality geo referenced photos were taken at all sites photo 1 to aid with the evaluation and verification processes aerial data including low level photographs and satellite imagery using satellite map earth satellite image 2016 provided estimates of recent development and activities in the basin hydrological and water quality data obtained from regional directors of the southern waters administração regional das águas do sul ara sul were also used to support ground truthing survey information and aerial imagery the method assesses the present ecological status pes of the river by calculating a habitat integrity index to calculate the habitat integrity index an assessment of modifications at each target site was conducted and scored by using the descriptive classes shown in table 1 the severity of modification impacts was based on six classes ranging from no impact to critical impact to score the level of the modifications a field observation manual developed by graham and louw 2009 was used the manual includes photographic examples of different site modifications and presents scoring procedures based on site characteristics site criteria and scoring weights for incorporating habitat integrity are shown in table 2 this involves the separate assessment of instream habitat integrity and riparian habitat integrity according to several key modifiers the impact of a criterion in instream and riparian zone was calculated by using eq 1 1 i h a b i t a t i n t e g r i t y s c m a x n w c where i h a b i t a t i n t e g r i t y is the impact of a criterion on habitat integrity s c is the score of the criterion m a x n is maximum score value note limit is 25 w c is the criterion weight as percentage following the calculation of habitat integrity the estimated impacts of all criteria were summed expressed as a percentage and subtracted from 100 to arrive at a provisional assessment of habitat integrity for the instream and riparian components respectively the final score for the riparian zone and instream components indicates the habitat integrity of the specific segment of the river the integrity score was subsequently transformed into the ecological category a to f according to the ecostatus classification system in south africa shown in table 3 following determination and validation of river pes an evaluation of ecosystem services used by riverine communities near assessed habitat integrity sites was conducted using methodology proposed by freire 2013 at selected sites water related activities conducted by local riparian communities were evaluated as well as the loss of ecosystem services caused by the activity effects were quantified through fifteen interviews with individuals and or groups who were considered to be key river stakeholders having local knowledge of the river interview questions are shown in table 4 the interviewees consisted of individual farmers farmer s associations individual fishermen livestock farmers local community leaders along around the river and water management authorities intentional and iterative sampling methods were applied potential interviewees were identified with the help of staff from the district service of economic activities serviços distritais das actividades economicas sdae of chibuto mabalane guijá and chonguene once resources and their availability to conduct an activity was identified each activity and or availability of the natural resources was linked to the indicators of ecosystem services in the river this was classified based on the concepts of ecosystem functions and services proposed by costanza 2000 de groot et al 2002 and the millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 using a likert scale responses were qualitatively analyzed the criteria used accounted for the perception of the people interviewed in relation to the environment and natural resource use tompkins et al 2011 3 2 environmental flow requirement estimation limpopo river discharge data measured at the chókwè hydrometric station was used to estimate the mean monthly flow mmf and the mean annual flow maf in the llrb the period of record between 1953 and 1971 was selected to represent natural river flow conditions because development and water abstraction was considered lower prior to construction of the massingir dam which was started in 1972 and finished in 1977 based on mmf and maf values from pre development river flow period an efr was calculated for each month i e january through december for the period of record efr s were categorized as excellent fair poor and degraded for different river flow conditions i e high medium and low flows following methodology similar to that used by the grand river conservation authority grca 2017 table 5 summarizes the erf categorization methodology used in this study after establishing efr values for mmfs under pre development natural river flow conditions attained efr values were calculated for mmfs under post development river flow conditions i e 1983 2015 whenever the mmf was larger than the efr value the largest value of the efr categories i e excellent fair poor degraded was designated the attained efr flow data for 2005 was omitted from the analysis because half of mmf values were unavailable for that year 3 3 estimation of present and future water demand and use present and future water demand and water use were projected for domestic livestock and irrigated agriculture sectors future projection was set to 2035 based on available data data from the mozambique national institute of statistics instituto nacional de statistical national institute of statistics 1997 was used to estimate domestic water demand and water use a daily water requirement of 50 l per person in rural areas and 150 l per household for urban areas was based on information from the world bank and world health organization respectively the estimation of water demand and use for livestock was based on the livestock data of the administrative posts and localities a daily water consumption of 35 l 15 l and 7 l was estimated for cattle pig and sheep and goat respectively the future water demand for livestock was estimated using the projection of future livestock number in the basin made by administração regional de águas do sul 2017 arcgis 10 3 1 was used to calculate the internal population in the target basin from the population and livestock data of gaza s districts and posts administrative the present and future irrigation water requirement and use were estimated based on registered water user area of the year 2015 and potential planned area the data were obtained from ara sul in the case of mabalane administração regional de águas do sul 2017 data representing current operation and future irrigation were used climatic data from chókwè chibuto and xai xai from climwat 2 0 were used to estimate crop water requirement by cropwat 8 0 data from the direcção provincial of agriculture dpa gaza and sdaes were used to identify the major crops cropping schedules were identified through stakeholder interviews and the administração regional de águas do sul 2017 study 60 of irrigation efficiency was used when water demand for agriculture was estimated soil types were identified using the soil map from aurecon amei pty ltd 2013 and the soil texture content from the report on the soils of the limpopo river basin made by bangira and manyevere 2009 soil characteristics such as hydraulic conductivity and bulk density were defined using the soil texture data and the soil water atmosphere plant swap model kroes et al 2017 3 4 assessment of water availability considering human and ecosystem requirements a water scarcity index squantity considering water quantity with respect to anthropogenic water use and efr liu et al 2015 was used to determine if water availability in the llrb was sufficient to fill both the anthropogenic water demand and environment flows supporting fair habitat conditions monthly and annual squantity were calculated for current 2015 and future 2035 availability the index uses definitions from the water footprint concept hoekstra and chapagain 2007 hoekstra et al 2011 including blue water footprint bwf water that has been sourced from surface or groundwater resources and is either evaporated incorporated into a product or taken from one body of water and returned to another or returned at a different time blue water resources bwr the total amount blue water of an area or region and blue water availability bwa total blue water resources minus environmental flow requirement maf and mmf rates m3 s were converted to maf and mmf volumes m3 and water use ratios for irrigation livestock and domestic use were estimated at 100 75 and 70 respectively squantity was estimated using the following eq 2 2 s q u a n t i t y b w f b w a w r b w r e f r where squantity is the index of water quantity scarcity bwf m3 is the blue water footprint bwa m3 is the blue water availability which equals bwr m3 minus efr m3 bwr is total blue water resources m3 efr is the environmental flow requirements m3 w is the blue water withdrawal m3 and r is the water use ratio describing the proportion of water consumption to total water withdrawal when squantity 1 0 the water availability is not enough to meet the demand at 1 0 there is sufficient water to meet demand liu et al 2015 4 results 4 1 changes in river discharge two periods of record were compared to quantify the changes in limpopo river flow pre development i e 1953 1971 and post development 1983 2015 mafs were determined to be 216 8 m3 s and 156 8 m3 s respectively after construction of the massingir dam river discharge was reduced an average 60 0 m3 s on a monthly basis high flows generally occur between january and march and low flows are observed between august and november this trend was similar for both pre and post development periods however in all months mmf was noticeably lower in the post development period the coefficient of variation cv shows the degree of flow variation increase after dam construction fig 2 4 2 present ecological status and perception of ecosystem service loss the current pes varied from natural with few modifications to moderately modified table 6 pes differences in the assessed sites reflected different activities and activity levels along the river the major activities identified in the basin included irrigated agriculture fishing gravel extraction and grazing i e livestock production these activities were one of the indicators of provisioning in ecosystem services and the fishing activities were also an indicator of habitat function the effects of farming and grazing were most reported the assessed guijá and xai xai sites had low pes relative to other sites due to higher agricultural activity and higher population along the river in these areas the loss of ecosystem services varied from high to low among interviewed stakeholders with exception of xai xai all sites perceived water shortage as the main reason of loss of ecosystem services affecting their activities the longest period of water shortage august to november was reported in chibuto water abstraction by upstream countries and river regulation by massingir dam were reported as significant water shortage factors by many stakeholders some considered shortages a natural phenomenon due to changes in climate the factors reported by the stakeholders as reasons for water quality deterioration were livestock grazing erosion and human activity table 6 summarizes stakeholder descriptions and perceived ecosystem service losses in the llrb 4 3 environmental flow requirement the estimated efr for excellent fair poor and degraded conditions represented 50 3 39 4 27 2 and 13 6 of the maf during the 1953 1971 period of record respectively efr from july to october for the excellent condition was equivalent to mmf from the year 1953 1971 fig 3 the attained efr represented 42 8 of maf of the respective period 1953 1971 on annual average this flow satisfied an efr fair condition at 85 5 m3 s but when calculated monthly efr decreased from june to november with september to november conditions falling into the degraded category 4 4 present and future water demands in areas where irrigated agriculture was the major water use sector accounting for 86 8 of the total demand the current total annual water demand by agriculture livestock and domestic sectors was estimated to be 226 5 106 m3 the domestic and livestock sectors accounted for 10 8 and 2 4 of water demand respectively the annual water demand was highest between november and january two low demand periods were observed between february and april and august and october fig 4 the variation of water demand within the year is mainly due to cropping schedules fig 5 from april to september agricultural production depends entirely on irrigation the estimated future water demand was 4 9 times larger compared to the current water demand the water demands of irrigated agriculture livestock and domestic are expected increase 5 4 1 4 and 1 5 times respectively fig 6 4 5 incompatibilities between human and ecosystem water needs bwa in the llrb was estimated from 1953 to 1971 water discharge data collected before massingir dam construction i e pre development natural flow regime the mean bwa for the llrb was determined to be 332 7 106 m3 and represents the potential monthly availability of water in the basin bwa is highest from december to april which is 90 2 fig 7 the 2015 bwf was 5 5 of the bwa the llrb annual squantity index value for 2015 was 0 05 indicating there was sufficient water to meet anthropogenic consumption needs table 7 when calculated by month the indicator showed deficits between august and october the annual squantity assessment indicated that the consumptive water for anthropogenic activities was 0 05 times the annual bwa when the efrs are maintained under fair conditions similarly the july and november values suggest that the water consumptive use for anthropogenic activities was 0 48 and 0 37 times of the bwa respectively it means anthropogenic uses in july and november are nearly 50 and 40 of the bwas and any increased water abstractions during the months will intensify the competition between human water needs and efrs by 2035 the annual water scarcity value is expected to increase five times that of 2015 but still remain lower than 1 on an annual basis there is enough water to meet the anthropogenic water demands in llrb however the period of incompatibility will expand from june to november and also anthropogenic uses will reach approximately 70 of bwa in december in the future thus more than half of the year will face no water availability to meet efrs of fair condition in the future 5 discussion according to international water management institute iwmi 2005 it was reported that 60 80 of annual natural flow was necessary to maintain a river in a pristine state in the case of llrb it was found that at least 50 3 of maf was necessary to maintain excellent efr conditions based on pre development river discharge data the post development period required 69 5 of maf for the same criteria currently it is impossible to attain an excellent efr condition for the llrb however when efr target conditions are set to fair maf calculated from the attained efr satisfy the criteria this finding agrees with a result by aurecon amei pty ltd 2013 that study predicted a significant annual surplus in llrb resulting from the massingir dam project while the predicted yield was not fully utilized the provision of efrs at the sub basin level would reduce available yield and hence decrease existing water surplus although the analysis on an annual basis concluded that the llrb discharge was enough water to maintain fair efrs the conclusion did not accurately represent observed llrb conditions pastor et al 2014 found that in local studies the average the efr was approximately 40 of maf and that water withdrawals were not possible during the low flow season water conservation measures are therefore especially important during the low flow season in order to preserve ecosystem function for example ensuring fish survival to support fisheries and maintaining estuaries to support water quality through biofiltering according to a fisherman that was interviewed the critical period of llrb fishing activity is from august to november fishing will be significantly affected if water for maintaining the ecological integrity in the limpopo river is not ensured at the same time crop production will be affected if irrigation water is not available from september to november the initial stage of first season crop production the perceived high loss of ecosystem services in mabalane was due to water shortage in the region in this area there is no infrastructure to store water the district depends on solely upon discharge from upstream countries water volumes in the lower parts of the llrb depend upon the elephant river which is regulated by the massingir dam downstream at xai xai water shortage was not an issue however high salinity provides evidence that river flows are not enough to prevent seawater intrusion aurecon amei pty ltd 2013 reported that small scale farmers on the floodplain are beginning to see salinity increases in irrigation water fao safr 2004 reported that the lrb has a highly variable and unreliable flow the river is intermittent with peak flows in february followed by low flow from may to early november our study showed about 78 of llrb flow occurred between december and april in both of pre development 1953 1971 and post development 1983 2015 periods high flow variability explains the difference between annual water scarcity and monthly water scarcity illustrating the importance of river flow seasonality when making sustainability assessments hoekstra et al 2012 reported that analysis of bwa on an annual basis might provide an incomplete and misleading view of bwa in watersheds where the majority of annual runoff occurs within few weeks or months and drought conditions dominate other parts of the year upon examining the llrb 2015 water demand it was determined that there was not enough water to meet human water consumption from august to october while maintaining a fair efr condition pes estimated from the assessment of the stream and riparian zone habitat integrity did not include local stakeholder s perceptions it is therefore not surprising that the pes score for the mabalane chibuto and xai xai sites did not agree with pesl assessments table 6 this fact reflected the priority of river components which the stakeholders considered for carrying on their activities in mabalane for example the pes status was categorized as b indicating the site is largely natural with few modifications and the ecosystem functions are essentially unchanged however pesl was high indicating stakeholders perceive a strong loss of ecosystem services as agriculture was major activity there interviewees such as farmers strongly paid attention to water quantity and their perceptions reflected to the results of the questionnaire survey photo 2 stakeholder interviews showed perceived water shortages occurred mainly from august to november also perceived loss of the ecosystem services varied from medium to high in these months this analysis agrees with the stakeholder perception however the length of the period from august to october did not agree with a previous study conducted by hoekstra et al 2012 in the larger lrb they found that the lrb faced severe water scarcity from july to november through their global water scarcity study this difference in results is attributed to the difference in water scarcity indices the environmental flow estimation approach and study area size according to liu et al 2015 hoekstra et al 2012 assumed efr to be 80 of the total water resources in the assessment of global water quantity scarcity this assumption is simplistic because it does not consider the complexity of efr and leads to an overestimate of the quantity based water scarcity problem even if annual water availability does not change increased anthropogenic water demand will expand within year period of water scarcity vilanculos and macuácua 2009 reported that in 2025 the water demand in lrb at in mozambique is projected to increase almost fourfold over the present water demand and the projected water availability will be more than the double that of demand they concluded that it will be possible to satisfy the water needs in the basin however future water demand and availability was calculated on a yearly basis and monthly scarcity was not considered richter et al 2003 pointed out that areas of potential incompatibility must be examined both within and among years within year evaluations will reveal the specific months or seasons during which ecosystem flow requirements are likely not to be met this analysis shows in 2035 the annual water scarcity will increase five times compared to 2015 and the period of incompatibility will expand from june to november mainly due to increased water abstraction for human purposes das gupta 2008 affirmed that the objective in implementing environmental flows is not to return rivers their natural state but to establish environmental needs of aquatic ecosystems so that these needs can be considered along with the social and economic needs when decisions are being made with regard to water uses and water allocations less water will be available to meet the water need for the environment due to the increase of water demand and this may create tension among water users to prevent this situation water managers in the llrb should focus mainly on agricultural irrigation the main driver of water demand pressure attention must also be given to monthly water demand and availability 6 limitation of the study according to liu et al 2015 the squantity indicator is more suitable for large scale quick approximate assessments of general variation information across regions for detailed assessments local factors such as small scale water consumptions and water allocation manners must be included also the index does not account for green water resources the amount of water from precipitation that after having been stored in the root zone of the soil is either lost by evapotranspiration or incorporated by plants moreover the calculation of future llrb water demand was based on the current cultivated crop patterns and potential planned areas which could change over time due to social factors in addition different types of environmental flow assessment tharme 2003 are necessary by using such as more detail

aquatic ecosystems with several levels of spatial and temporal resolutions 7 conclusions this study assessed the sustainability of llrb by efrs from the aspect of river water volumes findings are summarized as follows currently annual water shortages occur between august and october and are the main concern of local stakeholders maintaining an excellent efr i e 50 of natural flow condition is not possible due to socioeconomic water needs but a fair condition i e 39 of natural flow may be achieved with careful management when calculated on an annual basis the squantity indicator showed that there was will be sufficient water volume to meet water the consumption needs of 2015 and 2035 when calculated on a monthly basis the squantity indicator showed that there was not enough water to meet human water consumption from august to october in 2015 and this period will expand from june to november due to projected increases in water demand high variability in river flow suggests the need to determine monthly rather than annual water availability estimates agricultural irrigation dominates water use in the llrb and must be effectively managed to ensure efr sustainability and the ecosystem services they provide to prevent the potential water conflict among local llrb stakeholders it is recommended to focus mainly on the agricultural irrigation sector when considering management options in order to determine realistic efr values additional investigations are necessary to obtain data on needs of multiple river ecosystems finally it is necessary to involve expert knowledge from different scientific areas for assessing the ecological state of the llrb in detail author contributions osvaldo silva zefanias nhassengo conceptualization methodology investigation data curation

significant challenge to water resource management in this study the sustainability of llrb was evaluated by comparing hydrologic availability with ecological and anthropogenic needs current river ecological status was scored with a habitat integrity index verified through ground truthing field surveys and aerial imagery data local stakeholder interviews were used to further evaluate the habitat index scores deficiencies between water availability and ecological human requirements were assessed with a water scarcity index new hydrological insights for the region four environmental flow categories defined as excellent fair poor and degraded coincided to approximately 50 39 27 and 14 of the natural mean annual flow respectively stakeholder interview responses indicated annual water shortages currently occur between august and november and coincide with poor and degraded environmental flow conditions water supplies appear to meet consumption needs when calculated on an annual basis with the water scarcity index however when calculated monthly there is not enough to meet human water demand between august and october this deficit period will likely expand from june to november due to projected increases in future water demands as the greatest water use in the basin is agricultural irrigation long term environmental flows sustainability will likely depend upon

some ecological aspects pastor et al 2014 it is expected that by 2025 some countries in the southern region of africa will face absolute water scarcity while others including mozambique are likely to experience water quality issues in addition to availability problems hirji et al 2002 addressing the water needs of aquatic riparian estuarian and other associated ecosystems will require strong water conservation efforts in multiple sectors tough choices will have to be made to ensure the long term environmental health of watersheds and the human activities they support dyson et al 2008 this study evaluated monthly and annual water volume scarcity in the lower limpopo river basin llrb to quantify sustainable balances between ecological integrity and anthropogenic activities the limpopo river basin lrb sustains ecosystems that are biologically diverse and provide ecosystem services critical to the human livelihoods among lrb communities the basin supports an estimated 5200 human settlements of which 49 lie within mozambique un habitat unep 2007 in historical times the limpopo river was a strong flowing perennial river but is now regarded as a weakly flowing perennial river flows frequently cease during drought periods and large stretches of the middle and lower reaches of the river may have no surface water present ashton et al 2001 the over use of water can cause severe water shortages in the lower catchment water shortages negatively affect downstream ecosystems and people with a high socio economic dependence on these ecosystems fao safr 2004 reported increases in abstractions are apparent in dry season as it is not feasible from a socio economic developmental point of view to maintain or return the natural regime of the river by forcing full reduction of water consumption needs for various uses it is important to identify a balance between consumption needs for social and economic purposes with the minimum requirements for ecosystem maintenance hipolito and vaz 2011 additionally because of local data availability efr are evaluated from the aspect of water quantity only thus ecological aspects targeting specific species with a specific location in the river ecosystem are not considered in this study 2 description of study area the lrb is a transboundary basin covering a 412 938 km2 area shared by south africa 47 botswana 17 7 zimbabwe 16 and mozambique 19 3 fao safr 2004 the limpopo river flows a total distance of 1750 km through the basin with 561 km passing through mozambique until draining into the indian ocean southern african research and documentation centre 2003 the llrb study area encompasses 5618 km2 in southeastern mozambique fig 1 the catchment characteristics of the lrb are diverse covering different climatic and topographic zones as well as land use types including protected areas and sensitive ecosystems african water facility african development bank 2014 in the mozambique portion of the basin the climate varies from humid semi arid to arid along the coastal strip the mean annual rainfall is 800 1000 mm declining to less than 400 mm in the dry interior bordering zimbabwe rainfall is highly seasonal with 95 occurring between october and april often with a mid season dry spell during critical periods of crop growth fao safr 2004 the temperature and reference evapotranspiration also show variation gradient toward the interior the average annual temperature in the basin ranges from 23 c to 26 c the largest annual water deficits are observed between september and november the relative humidity is generally higher than 70 and may reach even higher values between may and august except within the drier pafúri region brito et al 2009 the main channels in the llrb are the limpopo river and its tributary the elephant river van der zaag et al 2010 the major structures influencing river flow in mozambique are the massingir dam with 2840 106 m3 of capacity located in the upper portion of the elephant river and the macarretane weir on the limpopo river boroto and görgens 1999 the largest water use in the llrb is agricultural irrigation aurecon amei pty ltd 2013 3 methodology 3 1 assessment of current river condition the current condition of the limpopo river was assessed at fifteen sites from mabalane to xai xai using a procedure described by kleynhans 1996 and kleynhans and louw 2008 ground truthing surveys were conducted in the dry season in july 2016 site visits were selected based on accessibility land use topography soil conditions irrigation infrastructure and other water uses influencing water quantity and quality geo referenced photos were taken at all sites photo 1 to aid with the evaluation and verification processes aerial data including low level photographs and satellite imagery using satellite map earth satellite image 2016 provided estimates of recent development and activities in the basin hydrological and water quality data obtained from regional directors of the southern waters administração regional das águas do sul ara sul were also used to support ground truthing survey information and aerial imagery the method assesses the present ecological status pes of the river by calculating a habitat integrity index to calculate the habitat integrity index an assessment of modifications at each target site was conducted and scored by using the descriptive classes shown in table 1 the severity of modification impacts was based on six classes ranging from no impact to critical impact to score the level of the modifications a field observation manual developed by graham and louw 2009 was used the manual includes photographic examples of different site modifications and presents scoring procedures based on site characteristics site criteria and scoring weights for incorporating habitat integrity are shown in table 2 this involves the separate assessment of instream habitat integrity and riparian habitat integrity according to several key modifiers the impact of a criterion in instream and riparian zone was calculated by using eq 1 1 i h a b i t a t i n t e g r i t y s c m a x n w c where i h a b i t a t i n t e g r i t y is the impact of a criterion on habitat integrity s c is the score of the criterion m a x n is maximum score value note limit is 25 w c is the criterion weight as percentage following the calculation of habitat integrity the estimated impacts of all criteria were summed expressed as a percentage and subtracted from 100 to arrive at a provisional assessment of habitat integrity for the instream and riparian components respectively the final score for the riparian zone and instream components indicates the habitat integrity of the specific segment of the river the integrity score was subsequently transformed into the ecological category a to f according to the ecostatus classification system in south africa shown in table 3 following determination and validation of river pes an evaluation of ecosystem services used by riverine communities near assessed habitat integrity sites was conducted using methodology proposed by freire 2013 at selected sites water related activities conducted by local riparian communities were evaluated as well as the loss of ecosystem services caused by the activity effects were quantified through fifteen interviews with individuals and or groups who were considered to be key river stakeholders having local knowledge of the river interview questions are shown in table 4 the interviewees consisted of individual farmers farmer s associations individual fishermen livestock farmers local community leaders along around the river and water management authorities intentional and iterative sampling methods were applied potential interviewees were identified with the help of staff from the district service of economic activities serviços distritais das actividades economicas sdae of chibuto mabalane guijá and chonguene once resources and their availability to conduct an activity was identified each activity and or availability of the natural resources was linked to the indicators of ecosystem services in the river this was classified based on the concepts of ecosystem functions and services proposed by costanza 2000 de groot et al 2002 and the millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 using a likert scale responses were qualitatively analyzed the criteria used accounted for the perception of the people interviewed in relation to the environment and natural resource use tompkins et al 2011 3 2 environmental flow requirement estimation limpopo river discharge data measured at the chókwè hydrometric station was used to estimate the mean monthly flow mmf and the mean annual flow maf in the llrb the period of record between 1953 and 1971 was selected to represent natural river flow conditions because development and water abstraction was considered lower prior to construction of the massingir dam which was started in 1972 and finished in 1977 based on mmf and maf values from pre development river flow period an efr was calculated for each month i e january through december for the period of record efr s were categorized as excellent fair poor and degraded for different river flow conditions i e high medium and low flows following methodology similar to that used by the grand river conservation authority grca 2017 table 5 summarizes the erf categorization methodology used in this study after establishing efr values for mmfs under pre development natural river flow conditions attained efr values were calculated for mmfs under post development river flow conditions i e 1983 2015 whenever the mmf was larger than the efr value the largest value of the efr categories i e excellent fair poor degraded was designated the attained efr flow data for 2005 was omitted from the analysis because half of mmf values were unavailable for that year 3 3 estimation of present and future water demand and use present and future water demand and water use were projected for domestic livestock and irrigated agriculture sectors future projection was set to 2035 based on available data data from the mozambique national institute of statistics instituto nacional de statistical national institute of statistics 1997 was used to estimate domestic water demand and water use a daily water requirement of 50 l per person in rural areas and 150 l per household for urban areas was based on information from the world bank and world health organization respectively the estimation of water demand and use for livestock was based on the livestock data of the administrative posts and localities a daily water consumption of 35 l 15 l and 7 l was estimated for cattle pig and sheep and goat respectively the future water demand for livestock was estimated using the projection of future livestock number in the basin made by administração regional de águas do sul 2017 arcgis 10 3 1 was used to calculate the internal population in the target basin from the population and livestock data of gaza s districts and posts administrative the present and future irrigation water requirement and use were estimated based on registered water user area of the year 2015 and potential planned area the data were obtained from ara sul in the case of mabalane administração regional de águas do sul 2017 data representing current operation and future irrigation were used climatic data from chókwè chibuto and xai xai from climwat 2 0 were used to estimate crop water requirement by cropwat 8 0 data from the direcção provincial of agriculture dpa gaza and sdaes were used to identify the major crops cropping schedules were identified through stakeholder interviews and the administração regional de águas do sul 2017 study 60 of irrigation efficiency was used when water demand for agriculture was estimated soil types were identified using the soil map from aurecon amei pty ltd 2013 and the soil texture content from the report on the soils of the limpopo river basin made by bangira and manyevere 2009 soil characteristics such as hydraulic conductivity and bulk density were defined using the soil texture data and the soil water atmosphere plant swap model kroes et al 2017 3 4 assessment of water availability considering human and ecosystem requirements a water scarcity index squantity considering water quantity with respect to anthropogenic water use and efr liu et al 2015 was used to determine if water availability in the llrb was sufficient to fill both the anthropogenic water demand and environment flows supporting fair habitat conditions monthly and annual squantity were calculated for current 2015 and future 2035 availability the index uses definitions from the water footprint concept hoekstra and chapagain 2007 hoekstra et al 2011 including blue water footprint bwf water that has been sourced from surface or groundwater resources and is either evaporated incorporated into a product or taken from one body of water and returned to another or returned at a different time blue water resources bwr the total amount blue water of an area or region and blue water availability bwa total blue water resources minus environmental flow requirement maf and mmf rates m3 s were converted to maf and mmf volumes m3 and water use ratios for irrigation livestock and domestic use were estimated at 100 75 and 70 respectively squantity was estimated using the following eq 2 2 s q u a n t i t y b w f b w a w r b w r e f r where squantity is the index of water quantity scarcity bwf m3 is the blue water footprint bwa m3 is the blue water availability which equals bwr m3 minus efr m3 bwr is total blue water resources m3 efr is the environmental flow requirements m3 w is the blue water withdrawal m3 and r is the water use ratio describing the proportion of water consumption to total water withdrawal when squantity 1 0 the water availability is not enough to meet the demand at 1 0 there is sufficient water to meet demand liu et al 2015 4 results 4 1 changes in river discharge two periods of record were compared to quantify the changes in limpopo river flow pre development i e 1953 1971 and post development 1983 2015 mafs were determined to be 216 8 m3 s and 156 8 m3 s respectively after construction of the massingir dam river discharge was reduced an average 60 0 m3 s on a monthly basis high flows generally occur between january and march and low flows are observed between august and november this trend was similar for both pre and post development periods however in all months mmf was noticeably lower in the post development period the coefficient of variation cv shows the degree of flow variation increase after dam construction fig 2 4 2 present ecological status and perception of ecosystem service loss the current pes varied from natural with few modifications to moderately modified table 6 pes differences in the assessed sites reflected different activities and activity levels along the river the major activities identified in the basin included irrigated agriculture fishing gravel extraction and grazing i e livestock production these activities were one of the indicators of provisioning in ecosystem services and the fishing activities were also an indicator of habitat function the effects of farming and grazing were most reported the assessed guijá and xai xai sites had low pes relative to other sites due to higher agricultural activity and higher population along the river in these areas the loss of ecosystem services varied from high to low among interviewed stakeholders with exception of xai xai all sites perceived water shortage as the main reason of loss of ecosystem services affecting their activities the longest period of water shortage august to november was reported in chibuto water abstraction by upstream countries and river regulation by massingir dam were reported as significant water shortage factors by many stakeholders some considered shortages a natural phenomenon due to changes in climate the factors reported by the stakeholders as reasons for water quality deterioration were livestock grazing erosion and human activity table 6 summarizes stakeholder descriptions and perceived ecosystem service losses in the llrb 4 3 environmental flow requirement the estimated efr for excellent fair poor and degraded conditions represented 50 3 39 4 27 2 and 13 6 of the maf during the 1953 1971 period of record respectively efr from july to october for the excellent condition was equivalent to mmf from the year 1953 1971 fig 3 the attained efr represented 42 8 of maf of the respective period 1953 1971 on annual average this flow satisfied an efr fair condition at 85 5 m3 s but when calculated monthly efr decreased from june to november with september to november conditions falling into the degraded category 4 4 present and future water demands in areas where irrigated agriculture was the major water use sector accounting for 86 8 of the total demand the current total annual water demand by agriculture livestock and domestic sectors was estimated to be 226 5 106 m3 the domestic and livestock sectors accounted for 10 8 and 2 4 of water demand respectively the annual water demand was highest between november and january two low demand periods were observed between february and april and august and october fig 4 the variation of water demand within the year is mainly due to cropping schedules fig 5 from april to september agricultural production depends entirely on irrigation the estimated future water demand was 4 9 times larger compared to the current water demand the water demands of irrigated agriculture livestock and domestic are expected increase 5 4 1 4 and 1 5 times respectively fig 6 4 5 incompatibilities between human and ecosystem water needs bwa in the llrb was estimated from 1953 to 1971 water discharge data collected before massingir dam construction i e pre development natural flow regime the mean bwa for the llrb was determined to be 332 7 106 m3 and represents the potential monthly availability of water in the basin bwa is highest from december to april which is 90 2 fig 7 the 2015 bwf was 5 5 of the bwa the llrb annual squantity index value for 2015 was 0 05 indicating there was sufficient water to meet anthropogenic consumption needs table 7 when calculated by month the indicator showed deficits between august and october the annual squantity assessment indicated that the consumptive water for anthropogenic activities was 0 05 times the annual bwa when the efrs are maintained under fair conditions similarly the july and november values suggest that the water consumptive use for anthropogenic activities was 0 48 and 0 37 times of the bwa respectively it means anthropogenic uses in july and november are nearly 50 and 40 of the bwas and any increased water abstractions during the months will intensify the competition between human water needs and efrs by 2035 the annual water scarcity value is expected to increase five times that of 2015 but still remain lower than 1 on an annual basis there is enough water to meet the anthropogenic water demands in llrb however the period of incompatibility will expand from june to november and also anthropogenic uses will reach approximately 70 of bwa in december in the future thus more than half of the year will face no water availability to meet efrs of fair condition in the future 5 discussion according to international water management institute iwmi 2005 it was reported that 60 80 of annual natural flow was necessary to maintain a river in a pristine state in the case of llrb it was found that at least 50 3 of maf was necessary to maintain excellent efr conditions based on pre development river discharge data the post development period required 69 5 of maf for the same criteria currently it is impossible to attain an excellent efr condition for the llrb however when efr target conditions are set to fair maf calculated from the attained efr satisfy the criteria this finding agrees with a result by aurecon amei pty ltd 2013 that study predicted a significant annual surplus in llrb resulting from the massingir dam project while the predicted yield was not fully utilized the provision of efrs at the sub basin level would reduce available yield and hence decrease existing water surplus although the analysis on an annual basis concluded that the llrb discharge was enough water to maintain fair efrs the conclusion did not accurately represent observed llrb conditions pastor et al 2014 found that in local studies the average the efr was approximately 40 of maf and that water withdrawals were not possible during the low flow season water conservation measures are therefore especially important during the low flow season in order to preserve ecosystem function for example ensuring fish survival to support fisheries and maintaining estuaries to support water quality through biofiltering according to a fisherman that was interviewed the critical period of llrb fishing activity is from august to november fishing will be significantly affected if water for maintaining the ecological integrity in the limpopo river is not ensured at the same time crop production will be affected if irrigation water is not available from september to november the initial stage of first season crop production the perceived high loss of ecosystem services in mabalane was due to water shortage in the region in this area there is no infrastructure to store water the district depends on solely upon discharge from upstream countries water volumes in the lower parts of the llrb depend upon the elephant river which is regulated by the massingir dam downstream at xai xai water shortage was not an issue however high salinity provides evidence that river flows are not enough to prevent seawater intrusion aurecon amei pty ltd 2013 reported that small scale farmers on the floodplain are beginning to see salinity increases in irrigation water fao safr 2004 reported that the lrb has a highly variable and unreliable flow the river is intermittent with peak flows in february followed by low flow from may to early november our study showed about 78 of llrb flow occurred between december and april in both of pre development 1953 1971 and post development 1983 2015 periods high flow variability explains the difference between annual water scarcity and monthly water scarcity illustrating the importance of river flow seasonality when making sustainability assessments hoekstra et al 2012 reported that analysis of bwa on an annual basis might provide an incomplete and misleading view of bwa in watersheds where the majority of annual runoff occurs within few weeks or months and drought conditions dominate other parts of the year upon examining the llrb 2015 water demand it was determined that there was not enough water to meet human water consumption from august to october while maintaining a fair efr condition pes estimated from the assessment of the stream and riparian zone habitat integrity did not include local stakeholder s perceptions it is therefore not surprising that the pes score for the mabalane chibuto and xai xai sites did not agree with pesl assessments table 6 this fact reflected the priority of river components which the stakeholders considered for carrying on their activities in mabalane for example the pes status was categorized as b indicating the site is largely natural with few modifications and the ecosystem functions are essentially unchanged however pesl was high indicating stakeholders perceive a strong loss of ecosystem services as agriculture was major activity there interviewees such as farmers strongly paid attention to water quantity and their perceptions reflected to the results of the questionnaire survey photo 2 stakeholder interviews showed perceived water shortages occurred mainly from august to november also perceived loss of the ecosystem services varied from medium to high in these months this analysis agrees with the stakeholder perception however the length of the period from august to october did not agree with a previous study conducted by hoekstra et al 2012 in the larger lrb they found that the lrb faced severe water scarcity from july to november through their global water scarcity study this difference in results is attributed to the difference in water scarcity indices the environmental flow estimation approach and study area size according to liu et al 2015 hoekstra et al 2012 assumed efr to be 80 of the total water resources in the assessment of global water quantity scarcity this assumption is simplistic because it does not consider the complexity of efr and leads to an overestimate of the quantity based water scarcity problem even if annual water availability does not change increased anthropogenic water demand will expand within year period of water scarcity vilanculos and macuácua 2009 reported that in 2025 the water demand in lrb at in mozambique is projected to increase almost fourfold over the present water demand and the projected water availability will be more than the double that of demand they concluded that it will be possible to satisfy the water needs in the basin however future water demand and availability was calculated on a yearly basis and monthly scarcity was not considered richter et al 2003 pointed out that areas of potential incompatibility must be examined both within and among years within year evaluations will reveal the specific months or seasons during which ecosystem flow requirements are likely not to be met this analysis shows in 2035 the annual water scarcity will increase five times compared to 2015 and the period of incompatibility will expand from june to november mainly due to increased water abstraction for human purposes das gupta 2008 affirmed that the objective in implementing environmental flows is not to return rivers their natural state but to establish environmental needs of aquatic ecosystems so that these needs can be considered along with the social and economic needs when decisions are being made with regard to water uses and water allocations less water will be available to meet the water need for the environment due to the increase of water demand and this may create tension among water users to prevent this situation water managers in the llrb should focus mainly on agricultural irrigation the main driver of water demand pressure attention must also be given to monthly water demand and availability 6 limitation of the study according to liu et al 2015 the squantity indicator is more suitable for large scale quick approximate assessments of general variation information across regions for detailed assessments local factors such as small scale water consumptions and water allocation manners must be included also the index does not account for green water resources the amount of water from precipitation that after having been stored in the root zone of the soil is either lost by evapotranspiration or incorporated by plants moreover the calculation of future llrb water demand was based on the current cultivated crop patterns and potential planned areas which could change over time due to social factors in addition different types of environmental flow assessment tharme 2003 are necessary by using such as more detail

aquatic ecosystems with several levels of spatial and temporal resolutions 7 conclusions this study assessed the sustainability of llrb by efrs from the aspect of river water volumes findings are summarized as follows currently annual water shortages occur between august and october and are the main concern of local stakeholders maintaining an excellent efr i e 50 of natural flow condition is not possible due to socioeconomic water needs but a fair condition i e 39 of natural flow may be achieved with careful management when calculated on an annual basis the squantity indicator showed that there was will be sufficient water volume to meet water the consumption needs of 2015 and 2035 when calculated on a monthly basis the squantity indicator showed that there was not enough water to meet human water consumption from august to october in 2015 and this period will expand from june to november due to projected increases in water demand high variability in river flow suggests the need to determine monthly rather than annual water availability estimates agricultural irrigation dominates water use in the llrb and must be effectively managed to ensure efr sustainability and the ecosystem services they provide to prevent the potential water conflict among local llrb stakeholders it is recommended to focus mainly on the agricultural irrigation sector when considering management options in order to determine realistic efr values additional investigations are necessary to obtain data on needs of multiple river ecosystems finally it is necessary to involve expert knowledge from different scientific areas for assessing the ecological state of the llrb in detail author contributions osvaldo silva zefanias nhassengo conceptualization methodology investigation data curation

8189,study region this study used data collected from three cropland sites two in manitoba and one in prince edward island in canada study focus in efforts to accurately describe the water dynamics in agricultural soils most of the agri hydrological models developed are highly complex such that they require detailed input data of which most of them are not always measured or otherwise readily available however the comprehensive and complex representations of the processes may not be justified when data is scarce thus this study developed a soil water budget model that could describe the movement of water through canadian agricultural soils using a few parameters only the model was developed by selecting algorithms from various existing models whose data requirements are readily available in literature and public canadian databases new hydrological insights the model developed in this study can simulate evapotranspiration runoff deep percolation and soil moisture content for various seasons i e growing non growing dormant and pre planting post harvest with minimum data requirement which addresses the limited availability of data in the country for crop and hydrological modeling moreover the model is simple and easy to use and can work without calibration it was tested using three site specific datasets and results show that despite its simplicity its overall performance was comparable with those of other agricultural models that use cascade flow framework for hydrology keywords agri hydrological model deep percolation evapotranspiration runoff soil moisture 1 introduction soil water has a wide range of effects on crop growth and yield raes et al 2006 aina et al 2007 bennett and harms 2011 and affects the rate and movement of water within agricultural landscapes hence it becomes an important consideration in the implementation of various cropping systems and influences many agricultural management decisions for instance the timing and application rate of fertilizer and irrigation water and the design and operation of tile drainage systems depend on the water content of the soil profile further the increasing concern regarding the impacts of agriculture on water resources both from quality and quantity perspectives intensifies a need to have an accurate accounting of water budgets within agricultural landscapes measuring and monitoring storage and movement of water in soils are therefore crucial for developing and achieving sustainable agricultural management systems however these measurements are generally costly as they have to be continually carried out to observe responses to climate and soil properties thus when field measurements are not available soil water balance simulation is often used perez sanchez et al 2019 soil water balance simulation applies the principle of mass balance where the change of moisture content in a soil reservoir e g root zone is determined through additions and losses of water it generally simulates processes such as infiltration of rain or irrigation water runoff of water exceeding soil infiltration rate redistribution of infiltrated water within the root zone evapotranspiration of water from plants and soil surfaces and percolation of water out of the root zone deep drainage a number of soil water balance simulation models with varying degrees of complexity and data requirements are available for various hydrological applications ranging from simple volume balance models to sophisticated dynamic models dynamic and semi dynamic models e g hydrus pc progress 2019 and root zone water quality model rzwqm usda 2020 describe saturated unsaturated water flow in soil through more detailed process based transport phenomena expressed as differential equations such as the richards equation thus they require more specific data such as unsaturated soil hydraulic properties which are difficult to measure and rarely available in most soil databases moreover analytical solution to the richards equation is limited to a few simple cases only due to the high nonlinear dependence of hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity on moisture content islam et al 2017 even with numerical approaches solution to the richards equation still remains challenging despite numerous efforts farthing and ogden 2017 zhu et al 2018 gao et al 2019 mass balance and non convergence problems sometimes exist in applying this equation for water flow as it assumes a consistent hydraulic gradient which is often not the case in heterogeneous agricultural soil profiles beven and germann 2013 in contrast volume balance or budget models follow a semi empirical approach to avoid complicated differential equations in describing water dynamics for that purpose the concept of water holding capacity defined by saturation field capacity and wilting point of distinct soil layers is employed the soil layers are represented as tipping buckets each having a specified capacity to hold water the water in the upper layer moves down to the lower layer when the upper layer exceeds its water holding capacity cascade approach however despite the general simplicity of the budgeting approach a number of models that apply this concept e g soil and water assessment tool swat texas a m university 2021 aquacrop food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2021 simulateur multidisciplinaire pour les cultures standard stics national research institute for agriculture food and environment national research institute for agriculture food and environment inrae 2020 and denitrification and decomposition model dndc university of new hampshire 2021 also require detailed input data for specific algorithms that are not always measured or otherwise readily available such as canopy cover leaf area index and above ground biomass as these models also simulate other ecological processes e g carbon and nitrogen cycling they require inputs that may not be necessary for quick and simple water budget estimates moreover these models often need to be calibrated when applied in regions with different agricultural and environmental conditions malago et al 2015 faramarzi et al 2017 smith et al 2020 when data is scarce calibration becomes challenging particularly with complex models which typically involve large number of parameters hishinuma et al 2014 although there are a couple of models originally developed for canadian agricultural conditions they are also facing some limitations for instance the versatile soil moisture budget vsmb model which was originally developed by baier and robertson 1966 is not relatively simple to implement particularly with its empirically derived drying curves further it does not have crop specific root extraction coefficients except for those that were validated in recent studies akinremi et al 1996 hayashi et al 2010 hayashi et al 2012 and requires site specific calibration before implementation in addition the alberta irrigation management model aimm alberta agriculture and forestry 2020 though relatively straightforward does not estimate runoff as it was mainly designed for irrigation scheduling thus the objective of this study was to develop a water budget model for simulating movement of water within canadian agricultural landscapes with the following criteria 1 the model can simulate main water fluxes i e evapotranspiration surface runoff deep percolation and soil water storage with a few parameters only parsimonious to address the limited availability of data in the country for crop and hydrological modeling 2 the required data can be easily obtained from literature and canadian databases e g national soil database nsdb and climate data from environment and climate change canada eccc and 3 the model is simple and easy to use can work without calibration the model was developed by selecting and combining algorithms from various existing models that satisfy the abovementioned criteria this paper presents the conceptual framework sensitivity and uncertainty analyses and testing of the model 2 methods 2 1 model description 2 1 1 model simulation for various seasons the model which is intended to be incorporated into the holos model agriculture and agri food canada aafc 2020 of agriculture and agri food canada as its hydrological component simulates soil moisture content and movement of water across agricultural landscapes during different stages of plant growth as well as during off season pre planting and post harvest and non growing and dormant periods fig 1 growing period spans from planting to harvest which varies depending on crop location and climate non growing and dormant periods start when daily minimum air temperatures are 0 c or below for five consecutive days after october 31st and end when this temperature requirement is no longer satisfied any day after march 31st although non growing and dormant periods are theoretically similar in the context of temperature requirement dormant in the model particularly refers to the case when the field is planted with a crop e g winter wheat that stops growing during winter while non growing period applies when the field is not planted with any crop the two cases have to be distinguished as they use different surface coefficients the period outside growing non growing and dormant periods is considered off season other events can also be simulated by choosing any of the aforementioned events periods that closely describe them for instance fallow can be simulated as off season 2 1 2 soil profile and soil water storage in the model the entire soil profile is divided into four layers the partitioning of the soil profile into four layers as well as the depth of each layer is user defined the only requisite is that the upper most layer layer 1 should not be less than 10 cm as explained in the next paragraph below there is flexibility in the model to allow users to partition the soil profile into four layers the way it fits for their study for instance in simulating deep rooted crops such as alfalfa which can have a maximum rooting depth of 2 m the a b and c main soil horizons indicated in the canadian system of soil classification could be assigned to layers 1 2 and 3 respectively as the soil information provided in the national soil database agriculture and agri food canada aafc 2021 is generally available for depths of up to 1 0 1 2 m only the c horizon could be extended to compensate for the remaining portion of the rooting depth the extended c horizon is designated as layer 4 and assumes the properties of the c horizon this particular case was the main consideration for the four layer partitioning in cases where the maximum rooting depth is up to the b horizon only such as with shallow rooted crops the soil profile could be partitioned this way a horizon for layer 1 and three partitions of the b horizon for layers 2 3 and 4 another way to partition the soil profile is shown in fig 2 here the a and b horizons are assigned to layers 1 and 2 respectively part of the c horizon that could be penetrated with roots is designated as layer 3 while the remaining portion of the c horizon below the maximum rooting depth is designated as layer 4 with this flexibility it is possible to simulate soil moisture content involving shallow and deep rooted crops it is also possible to simulate soil moisture content up to the depth of the ground water table provided there is no interceptive layer e g clay pan rock that prevents further downward movement of water it should be noted that the number of ways the soil profile can be partitioned into four layers is not limited to the examples given above through an internal process the model classifies each of the soil layers as either surface root or below root zones fig 2 layer 1 is automatically classified as surface zone in each of these zones different mass balance equation all model equations are found in appendix a in the supplementary material is implemented equation a 1 describes the water that flows in and out of the surface zone equation a 2 accounts for the water flowing through the root zone while eq a 3 describes the water moving out of the root zone below root zone these equations are adapted from the pesticide root zone model przm suarez 2005 joint research centre 2021 the model classifies the soil layers into these three zones as the soil water mass balances are calculated based on the depths of these zones which change with root dynamics except the surface zone which is fixed throughout simulation the surface zone corresponds to the uppermost soil layer i e layer 1 hence its depth is fixed throughout simulation as mentioned earlier the depth of layer 1 should not be less than 10 cm to have sufficient depth to account for evaporation and runoff infiltration the depths of the root and below root zones vary in correspondence to the root dynamics i e root zone depth increases while below root zone depth decreases as roots expand 2 1 3 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et is the loss of water from a vegetated surface through the combined processes of soil evaporation and plant transpiration in the beginning of the season when the crop is small and the soil surface is exposed evaporation is the dominant process however once the crop has fully grown and completely covers the soil transpiration becomes the governing process allen et al 1998 as both processes occur simultaneously it is difficult to estimate the two separately and accurately without utilizing a phenological crop growth model that provides a reliable transpiration estimate such addition would require parameters that are sometimes not measurable or generally available only from very specific experiments e g photosynthetic rate or radiation use efficiency photoperiod canopy cover leaf area expansion it would also require algorithms that govern above ground biomass accumulation and growth stage initialization e g solar radiation intensity temperature triggers wang and engel 1998 wang et al 2002 most of the models that adopt this approach are crop models or at least have a crop growth component e g aquacrop decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat swat environmental policy integrated climate epic or models that deal with nutrient cycling uptake e g przm where a more accurate estimate for transpiration is necessary as the primary intended use of the current model is for generating localized soil water balance estimates with minimum input requirements calculation of evapotranspiration from combined evaporation and transpiration has been deemed sufficient to achieve the objective of this study depending on available climate data the model can estimate reference evapotranspiration using the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 or potential evapotranspiration using the makkink makkink 1957 or hargreaves samani hargreaves and samani 1985 equations see appendix b in the supplementary material for the descriptions of these equations in this paper the acronym etr is used to refer to both reference and potential evapotranspiration martel et al 2018 found that the makkink and hargreaves samani equations had comparable performance with the fao56 penman monteith equation using the meteorological data collected in the canadian prairies with these options the etr can be estimated even with only air temperature data the model adopts the crop coefficient approach eq a 4 presented in fao56 allen et al 1998 for the estimation of actual crop evapotranspiration etc the crop coefficients kc used in the model listed in appendix c which are available for more than 50 crops are fourth order functions of growing degree day gdd thus their values vary over the growing period most of these coefficients were adopted from the aimm model alberta agriculture and forestry 2020 as the fao56 penman monteith equation uses grass based kc these alfalfa based kc are converted to grass based using eq a 5 allen et al 1998 the parameter kr in eq a 4 accounts for the effects of water availability in the root zone on etc as described in eq a 6 values for kr could range from 0 maximum water stress to 1 minimum or no water stress the default minimum value for kr in the model was set at 0 1 similar to what is applied in aimm alberta agriculture and forestry 2020 however the user can always modify this value depending on what seems more suitable for the location under study evapotranspiration is removed from the entire root zone including the surface zone an in depth discussion on the calculation of et can be found in martel et al 2018 the model does not account for canopy interception due to the available gdd based kc it can be applied only to monoculture system except for barley silage underseeded in alfalfa the kc database is updated once new gdd based kc are developed 2 1 4 root expansion and extraction the model simulates linear root expansion from minimum to maximum effective root depth the minimum effective root depth depth at the time of planting is user defined its default value was set at 0 2 m which was adopted from the aquacrop model raes et al 2012 the maximum root depth is attained when kc curve reaches its maximum once the maximum root depth is attained it remains constant until harvest planting and harvest dates are inputs to the model the active root zone is divided into four sections of equal vertical thickness each of these sections corresponds to a user defined root distribution which determines the depth distribution of water extraction the default values used in the model for root distribution are 40 30 20 and 10 raes et al 2012 which means that 40 of the roots are found in the upper most quarter of the root zone 30 in the second lower quarter 20 in the third lower quarter and 10 in the bottom quarter the rate at which water as etc is removed from each quarter follows the same proportion which means that for the default values given above 40 of the total etc is removed from the upper most quarter 30 in the second lower quarter and so on if enough water is not available in a certain quarter the demand is transferred to the next lower quarter at the minimum amount i e at kr 0 1 2 1 5 evaporation during off season for the off season pre planting and post harvest period the model accounts only for evaporation from bare soil surface or reduced evaporation under crop residues eos in layer 1 the approach applied for growing season eq a 4 is used to estimate eos a surface coefficient kos described in eq a 7 snyder et al 2007 which was derived for bare wet soil is employed in lieu of kc a correction factor kr1 similar to the one described in eq a 6 was also introduced to account for water availability in layer 1 if the surface is under crop residues the amount of eos is adjusted to account for the decrease in evaporation a 5 reduction for every 10 of soil surface that is covered with residues is used as suggested by allen et al 1998 weeds and volunteers i e spontaneous plants that are not planted deliberately during off season particularly for no till and organic systems could also affect the amount of eos thus for this condition eos is adjusted to account for the water consumed by weeds and volunteers the kc value assigned for weeds volunteers is 0 15 adapted from allen et al 1998 2 1 6 sublimation and evaporation during non growing and dormant periods the model simulates evaporation from soil and sublimation from snow cover during non growing and dormant periods eng in a way similar to estimating etc for growing season eq a 4 however a surface coefficient kng was used in lieu of kc although the etr equations were developed for vegetated surfaces or for growing period they were used to estimate water losses during non growing and dormant periods hay and irmak 2009 the value for kng used in the model is 0 44 adopted from a study conducted in a corn field in nebraska during non growing period with normal wet and dry seasons including periods of snow cover hay and irmak 2009 this value is within the range 0 25 0 50 cited by allen et al 1998 for surface coefficients during non growing and dormant periods it should be noted that the user can override all crop and surface coefficients employed in the model if more suitable values are available if the soil surface is frozen tss 0 c the amount of sublimation is limited by the amount of snow cover stored as snow water equivalent swe if eng is greater than swe the remainder of eng is taken from the soil surface layer however this is allowed only if tss 0 c and the soil moisture content of the surface layer is greater than 50 of its wilting point 2 1 7 snowmelt precipitation is assumed to occur as rain if the daily mean temperature tm is greater than or equal to 1 5 c scheider et al 1983 and snow if otherwise snow is accumulated in snowpack as swe and melting occurs when tm 1 5 c the amount of snowmelt is estimated using the empirical equations eqs a 8a and a 8b derived by scheider et al 1983 for ontario conditions based on air mean temperature equation a 8a is used for dry weather condition while eq a 8b is applied when there is rainfall as rain enhances melting of snow the amount of snowmelt is limited by the amount of swe in the snowpack see eqs a 8a and a 8b melted snow is treated as rainfall when estimating runoff and infiltration 2 1 8 surface runoff and infiltration the model estimates surface runoff using the natural resources conservation service curve number nrcs cn method united states department of agriculture united states department of agriculture usda 2021 the runoff equation was modified to include both rain and snowmelt as inputs eqs a 9a and a 9b the water that infiltrates into the soil is the difference between rain plus snowmelt and runoff eq a 17 however the actual infiltration is limited by the saturation of layer 1 thus if the amount exceeds the saturation of layer 1 the excess will be added to the amount of runoff estimated from eq a 9a the model assumes that infiltration does not occur when soil surface is frozen tss 0 c thus when this happens any snowmelt or rainfall is considered surface runoff soil surface temperature tss is estimated using the equation eq a 18 used by akinremi et al 1996 and hayashi et al 2012 it should be noted that the model does not account for land slope ponding runon and subsurface drain 2 1 9 percolation percolation is simulated in the model based on a tipping bucket approach where water from the upper most layer percolates down to the next lower layer when field capacity is exceeded with the process continuing down to the next succeeding soil layers until either all the percolating water is used up or all soil layers are brought to field capacity the water that exceeds the field capacity of the lowest layer drains out of the soil profile deep percolation and recharges the ground water table thus considered lost from the soil profile upward water flow or capillary rise is not simulated in the model each soil layer can only take water up to its saturation and water can only percolate to the lower layer if the water content of the upper layer exceeds field capacity and that of the lower layer is below saturation percolating water or part of it from the upper layer that exceeds saturation of the lower layer will remain in the upper layer until it is used up or until the moisture content of the lower layer becomes less than saturation the volume of water that percolates from one layer to the underlying layer is calculated using the algorithm employed in the swat model eq a 20 neitsch et al 2011 equation a 22 shows that the time water percolates through soil layers depends mainly on the hydraulic properties of the soil the model assumes no movement of water into and within the soil profile when soil surface is frozen further it does not simulate soil freeze thaw dynamics or perched water table conditions 2 2 model input requirements and outputs the input parameters required to calculate the various water budget components discussed earlier include site location soil and crop properties climate and management systems table 1 values of these parameters can be easily obtained from literature and canadian databases e g nsdb and eccc which was the intent of developing the model potential sources and references for obtaining these parameters are also listed in table 1 should they not be available locally appendix d presents the soil hydraulic properties reported in the literature for various soil types apart from precipitation the minimum required climate input to run the model is temperature in order to calculate etr using the hargreaves samani equation initial soil moisture content of each soil layer soil moisture content at the start of the simulation period is also required as input to the model if measured values of these parameters are not available moisture content at field capacity would be a reasonable assumption for irrigated fields while for rainfed fields depending on precipitation events and amounts prior to seeding field capacity can be assumed for wet weather and 50 of total available water for dry weather conditions outputs from the model include actual evaporation evapotranspiration surface runoff deep percolation and changes in water storage table 1 2 3 sequence of model calculation the model can run in multiple years on a daily time step it is suggested to start simulation a few days before seeding as the model does not simulate soil freeze thaw dynamics it is not recommended to start simulation during non growing or dormant periods i e when soil is frozen the different water budget components are added to or removed from the soil profile control volume sequentially fig 3 calculation starts off with sublimation if applicable and the remaining amount of water in the snow pack is then used to calculate snow accumulation or melt depending on air temperature this is followed by the calculation of runoff from rain and snowmelt and infiltration of water to the first soil layer it is assumed that there is no runoff from irrigation i e 100 of the irrigation water infiltrates into the soil percolation of water to each succeeding soil layer is then simulated followed by the removal of water through evaporation evapotranspiration moisture content of the soil profile is updated after every addition or removal of a water budget component 2 4 field measurements for model testing 2 4 1 kenton and carberry sites the two sites in manitoba kenton and carberry sites fig 4 were characterized by sub humid climatic conditions the soils at the two sites had clay loam surface textures and were classified as black chernozem according to the canadian system of soil classification table 2 the kenton site was an organic farm situated 50 km northwest of brandon manitoba 50 01 16 n 100 34 26 w it was sown with millet and hemp in june of 2013 and 2014 respectively and with fall rye in september 2014 the carberry site was a conventional crop production field at the canada manitoba crop diversification centre carberry located approximately 45 km east of brandon manitoba 49 54 22 n 99 20 49 w this site was planted with soybean spring wheat and canola in the 2013 2014 and 2015 growing seasons respectively daily meteorological data which included maximum and minimum temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity incoming solar radiation wind speed precipitation and sensible heat flux were monitored at both sites as described in martel et al 2018 sensible heat flux was measured directly at each site using sonic anemometer thermometers 81000 r m young company traverse city mi at kenton site csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut at carberry site and the eddy covariance technique daily etc rates were estimated using the residual energy balance reb technique martel et al 2018 and soil moisture contents were measured at 20 50 and 100 cm depths using soil moisture probes table 3 as the probes model 5 t m decagon devices inc pullman wa were calibrated for liquid water and not for ice the soil moisture measurements when the soil was frozen were excluded in the data analysis for soil moisture content deep percolation was measured using a gee passive capillary lysimeter g2 drain gauge decagon devices inc installed at each field site in fall 2012 near the reb system and collocated with the soil moisture profile the divergence control tubes 0 2 m diameter 0 66 m length of the lysimeter assemblies were installed such that the tops were located 0 5 m beneath the soil surface and bottoms at a depth of 1 2 m the volume of water exiting through the bottom of each lysimeter divergence control tube was monitored using a level sensor drainage resolution 0 1 mm and logged electronically em50 data logger decagon devices inc runoff volume was measured at edge of field of each site using compound sharp crested v notch weirs as described in wilson et al 2019 both fields were non irrigated during the study period further there were no surface drains or ditches at these two sites 2 4 2 harrington site the climate in harrington prince edward island was classified as humid continental the study was conducted at the experimental farm of the agriculture and agri food canada located 10 km north of charlottetown 46 20 37 n 63 10 11 w fig 4 table 2 the soil at the site had a sandy loam surface texture and was classified as ferro humic podzol according to the canadian system of soil classification nyiraneza et al 2015 the field was under a 3 year potato rotation potato barley underseeded with clover clover however only the potato data in 2011 and 2014 were used in the analysis due to availability of the crop coefficient daily soil moisture was measured at the site at 5 20 30 50 and 80 cm depths using soil moisture probes capacitance frequency domain sensor table 3 danielescu et al 2016 temperature and precipitation data were taken from the environment canada data from its charlottetown station runoff deep percolation and et were not measured at this site the field was also non irrigated and similar to the other two study sites there were no surface drains ditches at this site 2 5 sensitivity and uncertainty analyses a global first order sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the influences of field capacity wilting point saturation saturated hydraulic conductivity maximum root depth curve number cn and crop coefficient on model outputs using a variance based approach saltelli et al 2008 described in eq 1 1 s i v e y x i v y where y and x represent output and input variables respectively si denotes first order sensitivity index for parameter xi e y xi is the expected value of the output y keeping xi fixed averaged over all possible values of non xi factors and v y is the total output variance of output y the conditional variance v e y xi was calculated across all values of xi si in eq 1 represents the fractional contribution of the conditional variance due to parameter xi to the unconditional variance of the model higher si indicates greater influence on the output a sample size of 100 equivalent to 10 000 model runs was randomly generated for each abovementioned model parameter which was assumed to be uniformly distributed within the upper and lower bounds 20 of the default values for all parameters except for cn which was 10 listed in table 4 the sensitivity of the model was evaluated using potato as the crop under two different conditions sub humid kenton site using the 2015 weather data and humid harrington site using the 2011 weather data an uncertainty analysis was performed to quantitatively evaluate the model estimates using the average deviation amplitude ada index eq 2

parameters and uncertainty of model results results of the sensitivity analysis show that for both kenton and harrington sites the most influential factor for et and runoff were kc and cn respectively table 5 the cn also had a slight influence on deep percolation in both sites the most influential factor for deep percolation in kenton site was field capacity while that in harrington site was kc on the contrary the most influential factor for soil moisture content in kenton site was kc while that in harrington site was field capacity wilting point saturation saturated hydraulic conductivity and maximum root depth did not show substantial influence on any of the model outputs in the tested range the uncertainty of the model results indicated by the ada values table 6 are comparable with those obtained in other hydrological modeling studies xiong et al 2009 walega and ksiazek 2016 3 2 measured and estimated water budgets on average the estimated evapotranspiration to precipitation ratio etr p in carberry and kenton sites sub humid climate was 1 5 while that in harrington humid continental was 0 8 table 7 the relatively high precipitation in kenton site in 2014 was mostly due to a series of heavy rainfall events which deposited 115 mm of rain over four days in early summer june 27 june 30 although 2013 was a drier year on an annual basis compared to 2014 both kenton and carberry sites experienced 96 mm of rain from june 22 june 26 in 2013 it should be noted that for 2013 and 2015 only a portion of the year was considered in the study see table 3 measured annual cumulative actual evapotranspiration runoff and deep percolation in carberry and kenton sites ranged from 409 to 534 mm 0 to 61 mm and 0 to 172 mm respectively while simulated values ranged from 383 to 475 mm 0 to 28 mm and 0 to 150 mm respectively fig 5 measured et runoff and deep percolation in carberry site accounted for 95 4 and 1 respectively of the total water flow balance while simulated values accounted for 96 4 and 0 respectively in kenton site measured et runoff and deep percolation accounted for 84 3 and 13 respectively of the total water flow balance compared with the simulated values which accounted for 81 4 and 15 respectively as the fields were non irrigated the difference between total inflow i e precipitation in table 7 and total outflow i e evapotranspiration runoff deep percolation fig 5 could be assumed to represent the net change of soil moisture simulated net change of soil moisture in carberry and kenton sites were 18 and 146 mm respectively indicating that the estimated water budgets balanced well for both sites 3 3 model performance the model estimated daily et relatively well with d values ranging from 0 7 0 9 for kenton site and 0 6 0 8 for carberry site for the various periods table 8 it underestimated et during the growing and non growing dormant periods by approximately 19 and 21 respectively in kenton site and 20 and 7 respectively in carberry site however it overestimated et during pre planting post harvest by 12 in kenton site and 42 in carberry site as the pre planting and post harvest were relatively shorter periods compared to the other the model tended to generally underestimate et in both sites figs 6 and 7 overall the model simulated daily deep percolation during the various periods relatively well as explained by the lower rmse and are values shown in table 8 in particular it showed better performance for carberry site than kenton site it should be noted that the 100 are obtained for carberry site during the growing season resulted from a 14 mm deep percolation measured over four days against zero millimeters estimated by the model fig 8 c and d most of the discrepancy in deep percolation in kenton site in 2013 occurred in the month of june when a 96 mm of rain deposited over six days june 24 to june 30 resulted in a deep percolation of 77 mm yet the model predicted only a total of 27 mm deep percolation with only 1 mm runoff for the same period fig 9 c and d no runoff was observed during this period fig 9a most of the rain resulted in an increase in the simulated soil moisture in the following year at the same site the model estimated a total of 82 mm deep percolation and 9 mm runoff from june 27 to june 30 after a 115 mm rainfall however only 4 mm deep percolation and 2 mm runoff were observed during this period increases in soil moisture content were observed at the site although the model tended to overestimate runoff during the growing season the d statistic which ranged from 0 5 0 8 table 8 suggests a relatively good performance the 272 are obtained in kenton site resulted from the cumulative 10 mm runoff estimated by the model against the 3 mm observed in the site over the three growing periods while the 178 in carberry site resulted from the cumulative 36 mm estimated by the model against 13 mm measured runoff the model also showed a relatively good performance for the non growing dormant period as explained by the relatively lower rmse values 0 4 0 6 mm d however relatively large inconsistencies in runoff were observed during pre planting post harvest particularly at the beginning of spring when the snow started to melt figs 8a and b and 9 a and b there was a relatively good agreement between simulated and observed soil moisture content with are ranging from 0 4 21 0 and d ranging from 0 4 0 8 table 9 it should be noted that the data when the soil was frozen were not included in the analysis for kenton and carberry sites as mentioned in the method section although the model tended to overestimate the moisture content in upper layers and underestimate in lower layers it was able to capture the peaks particularly in the upper layers fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity of model outputs to key parameters the high influence of kc on et was not surprising considering that et was estimated from these coefficients this suggests that more accurate and representative crop surface coefficients are necessary for better et estimates the high sensitivity of runoff to cn found in this study agrees with what other studies have also observed soomro et al 2019 obtained a 78 reduction in peak discharges when the cn value was reduced from 90 to 40 in addition boughton 1989 found that increasing cn by 15 20 doubled the estimated runoff while reducing cn by the same range reduced runoff by half hawkins 1975 found that runoff was more sensitive to cn than to rainfall even with rainfall of up to 229 mm this indicates that accurate cn values are crucial for estimating runoff that employs the nrcs cn method the sensitivity of runoff to cn even at very small variations could be the downside of this method as the differences between some of the cnii values provided in the nrcs hydrology national engineering handbook for various soil groups and land covers are relatively large thus choosing a slightly different cn value could result in a large error in runoff the slight influence of cn on deep percolation could be due to its influence on runoff as changes in runoff may also impact deep percolation the differing impacts of field capacity and kc on deep percolation and soil water content in harrington and kenton sites could be due to the difference in the precipitation to evapotranspiration ratio in these sites varying the field capacity did not have a substantial impact on deep percolation in harrington site as the high precipitation in the site always resulted in deep percolation whether field capacity was high or low however it affected moisture content as field capacity is the amount of water held in soil after excess water has drained away on the contrary due to the semi arid condition in kenton site varying the field capacity of the soil resulted in substantial impact on deep percolation crop coefficients did influence deep percolation in harrington site probably due to their slight impact on soil moisture content root depth did not have influence on deep percolation probably due to relatively shorter root depths 0 4 0 6 m employed in the analysis saturation did not show any influence on the model outputs as the simulated soil moisture content in both sites did not reach the saturation of the soil in addition it was found that saturated hydraulic conductivity had to be very low such as those of a clay soil to have substantial influence on the model outputs 4 2 model performance as et was mainly influenced by kc as indicated by the results of the sensitivity analysis the varied performance of the model in estimating et for the different periods underestimate in growing and non growing dormant and overestimate in pre planting post harvest periods could be due to the different crop and surface coefficients used in the model for the various periods which were not calibrated as part of the modeling approach and objective of the study most of the underestimates during growing period occurred toward the end of the period fig 7 using the swat model marek et al 2016 also observed underestimates in et toward the end of the growing period of sorghum which coincided with the underestimates in leaf area index the underestimates in soil moisture content available for root uptake at deeper soil layers toward the end of the growing period fig 10 could also be the reason for the underestimates in et in addition the inconsistency in et could also be due to the conversion of the alfalfa based kc and application of these coefficients in the penman monteith equation which was developed for grass based kc the discrepancy in et during the non growing dormant and pre planting post harvest periods could be due to the wide fluctuation in temperature at the beginning and end of these periods for instance in april 2014 the model was already simulating pre planting which has higher et than for non growing period in carberry and kenton sites as the criterion of five consecutive daily temperatures of 0 c or below was no longer satisfied yet there were a couple of days during this month where the measured tmin were still as low as 15 c and 11 c with a few snow falls for the two sites respectively this means that due to the abovementioned criterion the model could be using the pre planting post harvest surface coefficient even when the temperature was below 0 c or using the non growing dormant surface coefficient even the temperature was above 0 c hence most overestimates were observed during the months of april may and october fig 7 regardless of the identified errors the performance of the model in simulating et even without calibration was comparable to that of a calibrated validated swat model which obtained rmse values ranging from 1 18 to 1 48 mm day for growing cotton grain sorghum soybean and from 0 63 0 82 mm day for non growing season marek et al 2016 higher rmse values were obtained for growing period which was likely due to greater crop water demand during this period the model performance on estimating et is comparable with those of other models dndc d 0 83 and vsmb d 0 72 guest et al 2018 improved version of dndc r2 0 73 0 85 and rmse 0 77 1 04 mm d dutta et al 2016 rzwqm2 rmse 1 0 1 5 mm d anapalli et al 2016 swat r2 0 81 melaku and wang 2019 hydrus 2d 3d r2 0 51 0 78 mante and ranjan 2017 the model simulated deep percolation relatively better in carberry site than in kenton site one of the main differences between these two sites were the weeds and volunteers that deliberately grew in kenton site however as et and soil moisture content were simulated relatively better in kenton site than in carberry site as indicated by higher r2 d and are statistics the presence of weeds and volunteers might not be the cause for the larger error in deep percolation in kenton site the discrepancy could be due to the inaccuracy of the water holding capacity particularly field capacity of which deep percolation was highly sensitive to sensitivity index of 0 52 table 5 its impact on deep percolation seemed to be more pronounced during periods of heavy rain in addition the inconsistency in deep percolation could also be due to the relatively poor performance of the model for runoff particularly during spring in kenton site for instance a total of 55 mm runoff was observed in early april 2014 from snowmelt however no runoff from snowmelt was predicted during this period the model captured the snowmelt towards the end of that month which resulted in a total of 39 mm deep percolation evaluating the model performance on a long term basis e g monthly yearly as what other studies have done tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 mapes and pricope 2020 could have resulted in better agreement as it could eliminate the error caused by the difference in the timing of occurrence as mentioned above a relatively large discrepancy was observed between simulated and measured runoff particularly those from snowmelt which resulted in relatively poor performance statistics for pre planting post harvest period table 8 figs 8a and b 9 a and b for instance a total of 49 mm runoff from snowmelt was observed in the beginning of april 2014 in carberry site however the model estimated only 2 mm as mean air temperatures were still below 1 5 c it should be noted that in the model snowmelt occurs only when mean air temperature is 1 5 c similar phenomenon was also observed in kenton site in the same period as described earlier though temperature based snowmelt equation is simple to implement the melting factor and base temperature used in this equation are dependent on several factors including snow density liquid water content thermal conductivity snow albedo and wind speed kondo and yamazaki 1990 usda 2004 variations of these factors can change the energy dynamics and snowpack conditions over time and space massmann 2019 found that temperature based snowmelt models give good results in gauged basins but not in ungauged ones due to lack of data for calibration of the snowmelt parameters the results of this study suggest necessary improvements for the snowmelt algorithms the error in runoff estimates during the growing period could be due to the nrcs cn method employed numerous studies have shown that the cn values provided in the nrcs hydrology national engineering handbook can be substantially different from those calculated using observed rainfall runoff events tedela et al 2012 kowalik and walega 2015 lal et al 2017 walega and salata 2019 results from the sensitivity analysis conducted in this study as well as from other related studies hawkins 1975 boughton 1989 show that even a small difference in cn value can result in substantial difference in runoff further several studies have indicated that the 0 2 value for initial abstraction adopted in the nrcs cn method is not always suitable for different site specific cases d asaro and grillone 2012 ling and yusop 2014 moreover garen and moore 2005 underlined that the nrcs cn procedure was originally developed at a watershed scale thus it is not suitable for point plot or field scale applications however despite the limitations of the cn method it has been employed in many hydrological models e g dndc swat przm and vsmb due to its simplicity and dependence on a few parameters only ponce and hawkins 1996 hence it is the one adopted in the model regardless of this limitation the d statistic of the model for growing period is comparable to the 0 55 and 0 64 of the rzwqm and dndc models respectively smith et al 2020 and the 0 49 of the vsmb model guest et al 2018 as the model does not simulate soil freeze thaw dynamics and allows infiltration and water movement in soil based only on air and soil surface temperatures the simulated increases in moisture content after winter generally occurred a few days earlier than were observed the model tended to overestimate moisture content in upper layers but underestimate moisture content in lower layers fig 10 which is a common issue with bucket models as they do not simulate unsaturated downward flow of water smith et al 2019 also observed overestimates in soil moisture content near soil surface and underestimates in the deeper portion of the profile using the dndc model improved root density and penetration functions could improve the results as the authors suggested in addition the relatively higher measured moisture contents in the lower layers compared with the modeled values particularly in harrington site fig 10b could be due to the upward flow of water which is not simulated in the model presence of a transient perched water table at the bottom of the soil profile has been documented at this site in the past zebarth et al 2015 factors such as infiltration to frozen soil preferential flow and dynamic storage routing which have been identified to be potentially present in manitoba basins cordeiro et al 2017 might have also influenced the simulated soil moisture content however the overall performance of the model in simulating moisture content for various soil types is comparable with other models particularly those that use a cascade flow framework for hydrology he et al 2014 obtained rmse values ranging from 0 02 0 06 vol fraction and d values from 0 47 0 90 with a calibrated dssat ceres wheat model daycent dndc and stics models obtained are ranging from 0 5 7 4 for soil moisture simulations at various sites in eastern canada guest et al 2017 wang et al 2010 obtained r2 ranging from 0 0 66 using dssat and shaw models 5 summary and conclusions a parsimonious soil water budget model for estimating soil moisture content and water fluxes across agricultural landscapes in canada was developed by selecting and combining algorithms from various existing models whose data requirement are readily available in canadian databases the model can simulate evapotranspiration surface runoff deep percolation and soil moisture content during various seasons i e growing non growing dormant and pre planting post harvest with minimum data requirement which addresses the limited available data in the country for crop and hydrological modeling sensitivity analysis of the model showed that et and runoff were highly sensitive to kc and cn respectively indicating the importance of choosing accurate values of these parameters that best represent the field conditions and crop characteristics it was also found that deep percolation was highly sensitive to field capacity in sub humid conditions and to crop coefficient in humid conditions in contrast the most influential factor for soil moisture content in sub humid regions was kc while that in humid locations was field capacity the model tended to underestimate et during growing and non growing dormant periods but overestimate et during pre planting post harvest season however despite these inconsistencies the d values ranged from 0 6 0 8 indicating that the model performed relatively well even without site calibration rmse values for deep percolation ranged from 0 to 3 5 mm d which are comparable with those obtained by other models the discrepancy in deep percolation could be due to the inaccuracy in field capacity whose impact became more pronounced during heavy rainfall and to the inconsistency in simulating runoff from snowmelt although the model had a relatively satisfactory d statistic for runoff for the growing period a relatively large inconsistency was observed for runoff from snowmelt which could be due to the algorithm employed for snowmelt the discrepancy in runoff could also be attributed to the nrcs cn method which seems to be too simplistic in describing actual rainfall runoff events although the model tended to overestimate moisture content in upper layers and underestimate in lower layers a relatively good agreement was observed between simulated and observed soil moisture content as indicated by relatively lower are values which ranged from 0 4 21 0 the discrepancy in soil moisture content estimates could be attributed to some soil water dynamics which are not considered in the model e g soil freeze thaw upward water flow infiltration to frozen soil preferential flow and dynamic storage routing although the model inadequately captured runoff from snowmelt it simulated soil moisture content et and deep percolation relatively well for its intended simplicity and low input parameter requirement the model can run using the gdd based crop coefficients available for more than 50 crops and widely available soil water hydraulic and weather parameters its overall performance was found comparable with other models particularly those that implement a cascade flow framework for hydrology the ada values indicate that the model simulations have fairly low uncertainties testing the model using the limited amount of data could not sufficiently indicate that the model worked better in one site than the other results show that the model in its current form is limited by the simplicity of the snowmelt equation and cn method it employs better algorithms for snowmelt improved cn method and soil freeze thaw dynamics will be considered for better future estimates in addition the implication of using alfalfa based kc for the penman monteith equation will be further assessed in the future to carefully consider options and solutions to improve the performance of the model in estimating et credit authorship contribution statement myra martel conceptualization methodology writing aaron glenn

8189,study region this study used data collected from three cropland sites two in manitoba and one in prince edward island in canada study focus in efforts to accurately describe the water dynamics in agricultural soils most of the agri hydrological models developed are highly complex such that they require detailed input data of which most of them are not always measured or otherwise readily available however the comprehensive and complex representations of the processes may not be justified when data is scarce thus this study developed a soil water budget model that could describe the movement of water through canadian agricultural soils using a few parameters only the model was developed by selecting algorithms from various existing models whose data requirements are readily available in literature and public canadian databases new hydrological insights the model developed in this study can simulate evapotranspiration runoff deep percolation and soil moisture content for various seasons i e growing non growing dormant and pre planting post harvest with minimum data requirement which addresses the limited availability of data in the country for crop and hydrological modeling moreover the model is simple and easy to use and can work without calibration it was tested using three site specific datasets and results show that despite its simplicity its overall performance was comparable with those of other agricultural models that use cascade flow framework for hydrology keywords agri hydrological model deep percolation evapotranspiration runoff soil moisture 1 introduction soil water has a wide range of effects on crop growth and yield raes et al 2006 aina et al 2007 bennett and harms 2011 and affects the rate and movement of water within agricultural landscapes hence it becomes an important consideration in the implementation of various cropping systems and influences many agricultural management decisions for instance the timing and application rate of fertilizer and irrigation water and the design and operation of tile drainage systems depend on the water content of the soil profile further the increasing concern regarding the impacts of agriculture on water resources both from quality and quantity perspectives intensifies a need to have an accurate accounting of water budgets within agricultural landscapes measuring and monitoring storage and movement of water in soils are therefore crucial for developing and achieving sustainable agricultural management systems however these measurements are generally costly as they have to be continually carried out to observe responses to climate and soil properties thus when field measurements are not available soil water balance simulation is often used perez sanchez et al 2019 soil water balance simulation applies the principle of mass balance where the change of moisture content in a soil reservoir e g root zone is determined through additions and losses of water it generally simulates processes such as infiltration of rain or irrigation water runoff of water exceeding soil infiltration rate redistribution of infiltrated water within the root zone evapotranspiration of water from plants and soil surfaces and percolation of water out of the root zone deep drainage a number of soil water balance simulation models with varying degrees of complexity and data requirements are available for various hydrological applications ranging from simple volume balance models to sophisticated dynamic models dynamic and semi dynamic models e g hydrus pc progress 2019 and root zone water quality model rzwqm usda 2020 describe saturated unsaturated water flow in soil through more detailed process based transport phenomena expressed as differential equations such as the richards equation thus they require more specific data such as unsaturated soil hydraulic properties which are difficult to measure and rarely available in most soil databases moreover analytical solution to the richards equation is limited to a few simple cases only due to the high nonlinear dependence of hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity on moisture content islam et al 2017 even with numerical approaches solution to the richards equation still remains challenging despite numerous efforts farthing and ogden 2017 zhu et al 2018 gao et al 2019 mass balance and non convergence problems sometimes exist in applying this equation for water flow as it assumes a consistent hydraulic gradient which is often not the case in heterogeneous agricultural soil profiles beven and germann 2013 in contrast volume balance or budget models follow a semi empirical approach to avoid complicated differential equations in describing water dynamics for that purpose the concept of water holding capacity defined by saturation field capacity and wilting point of distinct soil layers is employed the soil layers are represented as tipping buckets each having a specified capacity to hold water the water in the upper layer moves down to the lower layer when the upper layer exceeds its water holding capacity cascade approach however despite the general simplicity of the budgeting approach a number of models that apply this concept e g soil and water assessment tool swat texas a m university 2021 aquacrop food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2021 simulateur multidisciplinaire pour les cultures standard stics national research institute for agriculture food and environment national research institute for agriculture food and environment inrae 2020 and denitrification and decomposition model dndc university of new hampshire 2021 also require detailed input data for specific algorithms that are not always measured or otherwise readily available such as canopy cover leaf area index and above ground biomass as these models also simulate other ecological processes e g carbon and nitrogen cycling they require inputs that may not be necessary for quick and simple water budget estimates moreover these models often need to be calibrated when applied in regions with different agricultural and environmental conditions malago et al 2015 faramarzi et al 2017 smith et al 2020 when data is scarce calibration becomes challenging particularly with complex models which typically involve large number of parameters hishinuma et al 2014 although there are a couple of models originally developed for canadian agricultural conditions they are also facing some limitations for instance the versatile soil moisture budget vsmb model which was originally developed by baier and robertson 1966 is not relatively simple to implement particularly with its empirically derived drying curves further it does not have crop specific root extraction coefficients except for those that were validated in recent studies akinremi et al 1996 hayashi et al 2010 hayashi et al 2012 and requires site specific calibration before implementation in addition the alberta irrigation management model aimm alberta agriculture and forestry 2020 though relatively straightforward does not estimate runoff as it was mainly designed for irrigation scheduling thus the objective of this study was to develop a water budget model for simulating movement of water within canadian agricultural landscapes with the following criteria 1 the model can simulate main water fluxes i e evapotranspiration surface runoff deep percolation and soil water storage with a few parameters only parsimonious to address the limited availability of data in the country for crop and hydrological modeling 2 the required data can be easily obtained from literature and canadian databases e g national soil database nsdb and climate data from environment and climate change canada eccc and 3 the model is simple and easy to use can work without calibration the model was developed by selecting and combining algorithms from various existing models that satisfy the abovementioned criteria this paper presents the conceptual framework sensitivity and uncertainty analyses and testing of the model 2 methods 2 1 model description 2 1 1 model simulation for various seasons the model which is intended to be incorporated into the holos model agriculture and agri food canada aafc 2020 of agriculture and agri food canada as its hydrological component simulates soil moisture content and movement of water across agricultural landscapes during different stages of plant growth as well as during off season pre planting and post harvest and non growing and dormant periods fig 1 growing period spans from planting to harvest which varies depending on crop location and climate non growing and dormant periods start when daily minimum air temperatures are 0 c or below for five consecutive days after october 31st and end when this temperature requirement is no longer satisfied any day after march 31st although non growing and dormant periods are theoretically similar in the context of temperature requirement dormant in the model particularly refers to the case when the field is planted with a crop e g winter wheat that stops growing during winter while non growing period applies when the field is not planted with any crop the two cases have to be distinguished as they use different surface coefficients the period outside growing non growing and dormant periods is considered off season other events can also be simulated by choosing any of the aforementioned events periods that closely describe them for instance fallow can be simulated as off season 2 1 2 soil profile and soil water storage in the model the entire soil profile is divided into four layers the partitioning of the soil profile into four layers as well as the depth of each layer is user defined the only requisite is that the upper most layer layer 1 should not be less than 10 cm as explained in the next paragraph below there is flexibility in the model to allow users to partition the soil profile into four layers the way it fits for their study for instance in simulating deep rooted crops such as alfalfa which can have a maximum rooting depth of 2 m the a b and c main soil horizons indicated in the canadian system of soil classification could be assigned to layers 1 2 and 3 respectively as the soil information provided in the national soil database agriculture and agri food canada aafc 2021 is generally available for depths of up to 1 0 1 2 m only the c horizon could be extended to compensate for the remaining portion of the rooting depth the extended c horizon is designated as layer 4 and assumes the properties of the c horizon this particular case was the main consideration for the four layer partitioning in cases where the maximum rooting depth is up to the b horizon only such as with shallow rooted crops the soil profile could be partitioned this way a horizon for layer 1 and three partitions of the b horizon for layers 2 3 and 4 another way to partition the soil profile is shown in fig 2 here the a and b horizons are assigned to layers 1 and 2 respectively part of the c horizon that could be penetrated with roots is designated as layer 3 while the remaining portion of the c horizon below the maximum rooting depth is designated as layer 4 with this flexibility it is possible to simulate soil moisture content involving shallow and deep rooted crops it is also possible to simulate soil moisture content up to the depth of the ground water table provided there is no interceptive layer e g clay pan rock that prevents further downward movement of water it should be noted that the number of ways the soil profile can be partitioned into four layers is not limited to the examples given above through an internal process the model classifies each of the soil layers as either surface root or below root zones fig 2 layer 1 is automatically classified as surface zone in each of these zones different mass balance equation all model equations are found in appendix a in the supplementary material is implemented equation a 1 describes the water that flows in and out of the surface zone equation a 2 accounts for the water flowing through the root zone while eq a 3 describes the water moving out of the root zone below root zone these equations are adapted from the pesticide root zone model przm suarez 2005 joint research centre 2021 the model classifies the soil layers into these three zones as the soil water mass balances are calculated based on the depths of these zones which change with root dynamics except the surface zone which is fixed throughout simulation the surface zone corresponds to the uppermost soil layer i e layer 1 hence its depth is fixed throughout simulation as mentioned earlier the depth of layer 1 should not be less than 10 cm to have sufficient depth to account for evaporation and runoff infiltration the depths of the root and below root zones vary in correspondence to the root dynamics i e root zone depth increases while below root zone depth decreases as roots expand 2 1 3 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et is the loss of water from a vegetated surface through the combined processes of soil evaporation and plant transpiration in the beginning of the season when the crop is small and the soil surface is exposed evaporation is the dominant process however once the crop has fully grown and completely covers the soil transpiration becomes the governing process allen et al 1998 as both processes occur simultaneously it is difficult to estimate the two separately and accurately without utilizing a phenological crop growth model that provides a reliable transpiration estimate such addition would require parameters that are sometimes not measurable or generally available only from very specific experiments e g photosynthetic rate or radiation use efficiency photoperiod canopy cover leaf area expansion it would also require algorithms that govern above ground biomass accumulation and growth stage initialization e g solar radiation intensity temperature triggers wang and engel 1998 wang et al 2002 most of the models that adopt this approach are crop models or at least have a crop growth component e g aquacrop decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat swat environmental policy integrated climate epic or models that deal with nutrient cycling uptake e g przm where a more accurate estimate for transpiration is necessary as the primary intended use of the current model is for generating localized soil water balance estimates with minimum input requirements calculation of evapotranspiration from combined evaporation and transpiration has been deemed sufficient to achieve the objective of this study depending on available climate data the model can estimate reference evapotranspiration using the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 or potential evapotranspiration using the makkink makkink 1957 or hargreaves samani hargreaves and samani 1985 equations see appendix b in the supplementary material for the descriptions of these equations in this paper the acronym etr is used to refer to both reference and potential evapotranspiration martel et al 2018 found that the makkink and hargreaves samani equations had comparable performance with the fao56 penman monteith equation using the meteorological data collected in the canadian prairies with these options the etr can be estimated even with only air temperature data the model adopts the crop coefficient approach eq a 4 presented in fao56 allen et al 1998 for the estimation of actual crop evapotranspiration etc the crop coefficients kc used in the model listed in appendix c which are available for more than 50 crops are fourth order functions of growing degree day gdd thus their values vary over the growing period most of these coefficients were adopted from the aimm model alberta agriculture and forestry 2020 as the fao56 penman monteith equation uses grass based kc these alfalfa based kc are converted to grass based using eq a 5 allen et al 1998 the parameter kr in eq a 4 accounts for the effects of water availability in the root zone on etc as described in eq a 6 values for kr could range from 0 maximum water stress to 1 minimum or no water stress the default minimum value for kr in the model was set at 0 1 similar to what is applied in aimm alberta agriculture and forestry 2020 however the user can always modify this value depending on what seems more suitable for the location under study evapotranspiration is removed from the entire root zone including the surface zone an in depth discussion on the calculation of et can be found in martel et al 2018 the model does not account for canopy interception due to the available gdd based kc it can be applied only to monoculture system except for barley silage underseeded in alfalfa the kc database is updated once new gdd based kc are developed 2 1 4 root expansion and extraction the model simulates linear root expansion from minimum to maximum effective root depth the minimum effective root depth depth at the time of planting is user defined its default value was set at 0 2 m which was adopted from the aquacrop model raes et al 2012 the maximum root depth is attained when kc curve reaches its maximum once the maximum root depth is attained it remains constant until harvest planting and harvest dates are inputs to the model the active root zone is divided into four sections of equal vertical thickness each of these sections corresponds to a user defined root distribution which determines the depth distribution of water extraction the default values used in the model for root distribution are 40 30 20 and 10 raes et al 2012 which means that 40 of the roots are found in the upper most quarter of the root zone 30 in the second lower quarter 20 in the third lower quarter and 10 in the bottom quarter the rate at which water as etc is removed from each quarter follows the same proportion which means that for the default values given above 40 of the total etc is removed from the upper most quarter 30 in the second lower quarter and so on if enough water is not available in a certain quarter the demand is transferred to the next lower quarter at the minimum amount i e at kr 0 1 2 1 5 evaporation during off season for the off season pre planting and post harvest period the model accounts only for evaporation from bare soil surface or reduced evaporation under crop residues eos in layer 1 the approach applied for growing season eq a 4 is used to estimate eos a surface coefficient kos described in eq a 7 snyder et al 2007 which was derived for bare wet soil is employed in lieu of kc a correction factor kr1 similar to the one described in eq a 6 was also introduced to account for water availability in layer 1 if the surface is under crop residues the amount of eos is adjusted to account for the decrease in evaporation a 5 reduction for every 10 of soil surface that is covered with residues is used as suggested by allen et al 1998 weeds and volunteers i e spontaneous plants that are not planted deliberately during off season particularly for no till and organic systems could also affect the amount of eos thus for this condition eos is adjusted to account for the water consumed by weeds and volunteers the kc value assigned for weeds volunteers is 0 15 adapted from allen et al 1998 2 1 6 sublimation and evaporation during non growing and dormant periods the model simulates evaporation from soil and sublimation from snow cover during non growing and dormant periods eng in a way similar to estimating etc for growing season eq a 4 however a surface coefficient kng was used in lieu of kc although the etr equations were developed for vegetated surfaces or for growing period they were used to estimate water losses during non growing and dormant periods hay and irmak 2009 the value for kng used in the model is 0 44 adopted from a study conducted in a corn field in nebraska during non growing period with normal wet and dry seasons including periods of snow cover hay and irmak 2009 this value is within the range 0 25 0 50 cited by allen et al 1998 for surface coefficients during non growing and dormant periods it should be noted that the user can override all crop and surface coefficients employed in the model if more suitable values are available if the soil surface is frozen tss 0 c the amount of sublimation is limited by the amount of snow cover stored as snow water equivalent swe if eng is greater than swe the remainder of eng is taken from the soil surface layer however this is allowed only if tss 0 c and the soil moisture content of the surface layer is greater than 50 of its wilting point 2 1 7 snowmelt precipitation is assumed to occur as rain if the daily mean temperature tm is greater than or equal to 1 5 c scheider et al 1983 and snow if otherwise snow is accumulated in snowpack as swe and melting occurs when tm 1 5 c the amount of snowmelt is estimated using the empirical equations eqs a 8a and a 8b derived by scheider et al 1983 for ontario conditions based on air mean temperature equation a 8a is used for dry weather condition while eq a 8b is applied when there is rainfall as rain enhances melting of snow the amount of snowmelt is limited by the amount of swe in the snowpack see eqs a 8a and a 8b melted snow is treated as rainfall when estimating runoff and infiltration 2 1 8 surface runoff and infiltration the model estimates surface runoff using the natural resources conservation service curve number nrcs cn method united states department of agriculture united states department of agriculture usda 2021 the runoff equation was modified to include both rain and snowmelt as inputs eqs a 9a and a 9b the water that infiltrates into the soil is the difference between rain plus snowmelt and runoff eq a 17 however the actual infiltration is limited by the saturation of layer 1 thus if the amount exceeds the saturation of layer 1 the excess will be added to the amount of runoff estimated from eq a 9a the model assumes that infiltration does not occur when soil surface is frozen tss 0 c thus when this happens any snowmelt or rainfall is considered surface runoff soil surface temperature tss is estimated using the equation eq a 18 used by akinremi et al 1996 and hayashi et al 2012 it should be noted that the model does not account for land slope ponding runon and subsurface drain 2 1 9 percolation percolation is simulated in the model based on a tipping bucket approach where water from the upper most layer percolates down to the next lower layer when field capacity is exceeded with the process continuing down to the next succeeding soil layers until either all the percolating water is used up or all soil layers are brought to field capacity the water that exceeds the field capacity of the lowest layer drains out of the soil profile deep percolation and recharges the ground water table thus considered lost from the soil profile upward water flow or capillary rise is not simulated in the model each soil layer can only take water up to its saturation and water can only percolate to the lower layer if the water content of the upper layer exceeds field capacity and that of the lower layer is below saturation percolating water or part of it from the upper layer that exceeds saturation of the lower layer will remain in the upper layer until it is used up or until the moisture content of the lower layer becomes less than saturation the volume of water that percolates from one layer to the underlying layer is calculated using the algorithm employed in the swat model eq a 20 neitsch et al 2011 equation a 22 shows that the time water percolates through soil layers depends mainly on the hydraulic properties of the soil the model assumes no movement of water into and within the soil profile when soil surface is frozen further it does not simulate soil freeze thaw dynamics or perched water table conditions 2 2 model input requirements and outputs the input parameters required to calculate the various water budget components discussed earlier include site location soil and crop properties climate and management systems table 1 values of these parameters can be easily obtained from literature and canadian databases e g nsdb and eccc which was the intent of developing the model potential sources and references for obtaining these parameters are also listed in table 1 should they not be available locally appendix d presents the soil hydraulic properties reported in the literature for various soil types apart from precipitation the minimum required climate input to run the model is temperature in order to calculate etr using the hargreaves samani equation initial soil moisture content of each soil layer soil moisture content at the start of the simulation period is also required as input to the model if measured values of these parameters are not available moisture content at field capacity would be a reasonable assumption for irrigated fields while for rainfed fields depending on precipitation events and amounts prior to seeding field capacity can be assumed for wet weather and 50 of total available water for dry weather conditions outputs from the model include actual evaporation evapotranspiration surface runoff deep percolation and changes in water storage table 1 2 3 sequence of model calculation the model can run in multiple years on a daily time step it is suggested to start simulation a few days before seeding as the model does not simulate soil freeze thaw dynamics it is not recommended to start simulation during non growing or dormant periods i e when soil is frozen the different water budget components are added to or removed from the soil profile control volume sequentially fig 3 calculation starts off with sublimation if applicable and the remaining amount of water in the snow pack is then used to calculate snow accumulation or melt depending on air temperature this is followed by the calculation of runoff from rain and snowmelt and infiltration of water to the first soil layer it is assumed that there is no runoff from irrigation i e 100 of the irrigation water infiltrates into the soil percolation of water to each succeeding soil layer is then simulated followed by the removal of water through evaporation evapotranspiration moisture content of the soil profile is updated after every addition or removal of a water budget component 2 4 field measurements for model testing 2 4 1 kenton and carberry sites the two sites in manitoba kenton and carberry sites fig 4 were characterized by sub humid climatic conditions the soils at the two sites had clay loam surface textures and were classified as black chernozem according to the canadian system of soil classification table 2 the kenton site was an organic farm situated 50 km northwest of brandon manitoba 50 01 16 n 100 34 26 w it was sown with millet and hemp in june of 2013 and 2014 respectively and with fall rye in september 2014 the carberry site was a conventional crop production field at the canada manitoba crop diversification centre carberry located approximately 45 km east of brandon manitoba 49 54 22 n 99 20 49 w this site was planted with soybean spring wheat and canola in the 2013 2014 and 2015 growing seasons respectively daily meteorological data which included maximum and minimum temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity incoming solar radiation wind speed precipitation and sensible heat flux were monitored at both sites as described in martel et al 2018 sensible heat flux was measured directly at each site using sonic anemometer thermometers 81000 r m young company traverse city mi at kenton site csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut at carberry site and the eddy covariance technique daily etc rates were estimated using the residual energy balance reb technique martel et al 2018 and soil moisture contents were measured at 20 50 and 100 cm depths using soil moisture probes table 3 as the probes model 5 t m decagon devices inc pullman wa were calibrated for liquid water and not for ice the soil moisture measurements when the soil was frozen were excluded in the data analysis for soil moisture content deep percolation was measured using a gee passive capillary lysimeter g2 drain gauge decagon devices inc installed at each field site in fall 2012 near the reb system and collocated with the soil moisture profile the divergence control tubes 0 2 m diameter 0 66 m length of the lysimeter assemblies were installed such that the tops were located 0 5 m beneath the soil surface and bottoms at a depth of 1 2 m the volume of water exiting through the bottom of each lysimeter divergence control tube was monitored using a level sensor drainage resolution 0 1 mm and logged electronically em50 data logger decagon devices inc runoff volume was measured at edge of field of each site using compound sharp crested v notch weirs as described in wilson et al 2019 both fields were non irrigated during the study period further there were no surface drains or ditches at these two sites 2 4 2 harrington site the climate in harrington prince edward island was classified as humid continental the study was conducted at the experimental farm of the agriculture and agri food canada located 10 km north of charlottetown 46 20 37 n 63 10 11 w fig 4 table 2 the soil at the site had a sandy loam surface texture and was classified as ferro humic podzol according to the canadian system of soil classification nyiraneza et al 2015 the field was under a 3 year potato rotation potato barley underseeded with clover clover however only the potato data in 2011 and 2014 were used in the analysis due to availability of the crop coefficient daily soil moisture was measured at the site at 5 20 30 50 and 80 cm depths using soil moisture probes capacitance frequency domain sensor table 3 danielescu et al 2016 temperature and precipitation data were taken from the environment canada data from its charlottetown station runoff deep percolation and et were not measured at this site the field was also non irrigated and similar to the other two study sites there were no surface drains ditches at this site 2 5 sensitivity and uncertainty analyses a global first order sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the influences of field capacity wilting point saturation saturated hydraulic conductivity maximum root depth curve number cn and crop coefficient on model outputs using a variance based approach saltelli et al 2008 described in eq 1 1 s i v e y x i v y where y and x represent output and input variables respectively si denotes first order sensitivity index for parameter xi e y xi is the expected value of the output y keeping xi fixed averaged over all possible values of non xi factors and v y is the total output variance of output y the conditional variance v e y xi was calculated across all values of xi si in eq 1 represents the fractional contribution of the conditional variance due to parameter xi to the unconditional variance of the model higher si indicates greater influence on the output a sample size of 100 equivalent to 10 000 model runs was randomly generated for each abovementioned model parameter which was assumed to be uniformly distributed within the upper and lower bounds 20 of the default values for all parameters except for cn which was 10 listed in table 4 the sensitivity of the model was evaluated using potato as the crop under two different conditions sub humid kenton site using the 2015 weather data and humid harrington site using the 2011 weather data an uncertainty analysis was performed to quantitatively evaluate the model estimates using the average deviation amplitude ada index eq 2

simulated data at day t llt is the 5th percentile of the simulated data at day t and ot is the observed data at day t lower ada values indicate lower uncertainty 2 6 statistical analysis statistical approaches were used to quantitatively assess the performance of the model by comparing measured and simulated values the statistical measures implemented include nash sutcliffe model efficiency

n is the number of observations and the overbar indicates mean value the value of nse ranges from negative infinity to 1 0 where a nse 1 0 indicates a perfect fit while a nse 0 indicates that the observed mean is better than the model prediction ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 the indicators rmse and are summarize the mean difference between measured and modeled values and the smaller the difference the better is the agreement between the two values closer to 1 0 for d and r2 indicate better agreement between measured and modeled values 3 results 3 1 sensitivity of model outputs to key parameters and uncertainty of model results results of the sensitivity analysis show that for both kenton and harrington sites the most influential factor for et and runoff were kc and cn respectively table 5 the cn also had a slight influence on deep percolation in both sites the most influential factor for deep percolation in kenton site was field capacity while that in harrington site was kc on the contrary the most influential factor for soil moisture content in kenton site was kc while that in harrington site was field capacity wilting point saturation saturated hydraulic conductivity and maximum root depth did not show substantial influence on any of the model outputs in the tested range the uncertainty of the model results indicated by the ada values table 6 are comparable with those obtained in other hydrological modeling studies xiong et al 2009 walega and ksiazek 2016 3 2 measured and estimated water budgets on average the estimated evapotranspiration to precipitation ratio etr p in carberry and kenton sites sub humid climate was 1 5 while that in harrington humid continental was 0 8 table 7 the relatively high precipitation in kenton site in 2014 was mostly due to a series of heavy rainfall events which deposited 115 mm of rain over four days in early summer june 27 june 30 although 2013 was a drier year on an annual basis compared to 2014 both kenton and carberry sites experienced 96 mm of rain from june 22 june 26 in 2013 it should be noted that for 2013 and 2015 only a portion of the year was considered in the study see table 3 measured annual cumulative actual evapotranspiration runoff and deep percolation in carberry and kenton sites ranged from 409 to 534 mm 0 to 61 mm and 0 to 172 mm respectively while simulated values ranged from 383 to 475 mm 0 to 28 mm and 0 to 150 mm respectively fig 5 measured et runoff and deep percolation in carberry site accounted for 95 4 and 1 respectively of the total water flow balance while simulated values accounted for 96 4 and 0 respectively in kenton site measured et runoff and deep percolation accounted for 84 3 and 13 respectively of the total water flow balance compared with the simulated values which accounted for 81 4 and 15 respectively as the fields were non irrigated the difference between total inflow i e precipitation in table 7 and total outflow i e evapotranspiration runoff deep percolation fig 5 could be assumed to represent the net change of soil moisture simulated net change of soil moisture in carberry and kenton sites were 18 and 146 mm respectively indicating that the estimated water budgets balanced well for both sites 3 3 model performance the model estimated daily et relatively well with d values ranging from 0 7 0 9 for kenton site and 0 6 0 8 for carberry site for the various periods table 8 it underestimated et during the growing and non growing dormant periods by approximately 19 and 21 respectively in kenton site and 20 and 7 respectively in carberry site however it overestimated et during pre planting post harvest by 12 in kenton site and 42 in carberry site as the pre planting and post harvest were relatively shorter periods compared to the other the model tended to generally underestimate et in both sites figs 6 and 7 overall the model simulated daily deep percolation during the various periods relatively well as explained by the lower rmse and are values shown in table 8 in particular it showed better performance for carberry site than kenton site it should be noted that the 100 are obtained for carberry site during the growing season resulted from a 14 mm deep percolation measured over four days against zero millimeters estimated by the model fig 8 c and d most of the discrepancy in deep percolation in kenton site in 2013 occurred in the month of june when a 96 mm of rain deposited over six days june 24 to june 30 resulted in a deep percolation of 77 mm yet the model predicted only a total of 27 mm deep percolation with only 1 mm runoff for the same period fig 9 c and d no runoff was observed during this period fig 9a most of the rain resulted in an increase in the simulated soil moisture in the following year at the same site the model estimated a total of 82 mm deep percolation and 9 mm runoff from june 27 to june 30 after a 115 mm rainfall however only 4 mm deep percolation and 2 mm runoff were observed during this period increases in soil moisture content were observed at the site although the model tended to overestimate runoff during the growing season the d statistic which ranged from 0 5 0 8 table 8 suggests a relatively good performance the 272 are obtained in kenton site resulted from the cumulative 10 mm runoff estimated by the model against the 3 mm observed in the site over the three growing periods while the 178 in carberry site resulted from the cumulative 36 mm estimated by the model against 13 mm measured runoff the model also showed a relatively good performance for the non growing dormant period as explained by the relatively lower rmse values 0 4 0 6 mm d however relatively large inconsistencies in runoff were observed during pre planting post harvest particularly at the beginning of spring when the snow started to melt figs 8a and b and 9 a and b there was a relatively good agreement between simulated and observed soil moisture content with are ranging from 0 4 21 0 and d ranging from 0 4 0 8 table 9 it should be noted that the data when the soil was frozen were not included in the analysis for kenton and carberry sites as mentioned in the method section although the model tended to overestimate the moisture content in upper layers and underestimate in lower layers it was able to capture the peaks particularly in the upper layers fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity of model outputs to key parameters the high influence of kc on et was not surprising considering that et was estimated from these coefficients this suggests that more accurate and representative crop surface coefficients are necessary for better et estimates the high sensitivity of runoff to cn found in this study agrees with what other studies have also observed soomro et al 2019 obtained a 78 reduction in peak discharges when the cn value was reduced from 90 to 40 in addition boughton 1989 found that increasing cn by 15 20 doubled the estimated runoff while reducing cn by the same range reduced runoff by half hawkins 1975 found that runoff was more sensitive to cn than to rainfall even with rainfall of up to 229 mm this indicates that accurate cn values are crucial for estimating runoff that employs the nrcs cn method the sensitivity of runoff to cn even at very small variations could be the downside of this method as the differences between some of the cnii values provided in the nrcs hydrology national engineering handbook for various soil groups and land covers are relatively large thus choosing a slightly different cn value could result in a large error in runoff the slight influence of cn on deep percolation could be due to its influence on runoff as changes in runoff may also impact deep percolation the differing impacts of field capacity and kc on deep percolation and soil water content in harrington and kenton sites could be due to the difference in the precipitation to evapotranspiration ratio in these sites varying the field capacity did not have a substantial impact on deep percolation in harrington site as the high precipitation in the site always resulted in deep percolation whether field capacity was high or low however it affected moisture content as field capacity is the amount of water held in soil after excess water has drained away on the contrary due to the semi arid condition in kenton site varying the field capacity of the soil resulted in substantial impact on deep percolation crop coefficients did influence deep percolation in harrington site probably due to their slight impact on soil moisture content root depth did not have influence on deep percolation probably due to relatively shorter root depths 0 4 0 6 m employed in the analysis saturation did not show any influence on the model outputs as the simulated soil moisture content in both sites did not reach the saturation of the soil in addition it was found that saturated hydraulic conductivity had to be very low such as those of a clay soil to have substantial influence on the model outputs 4 2 model performance as et was mainly influenced by kc as indicated by the results of the sensitivity analysis the varied performance of the model in estimating et for the different periods underestimate in growing and non growing dormant and overestimate in pre planting post harvest periods could be due to the different crop and surface coefficients used in the model for the various periods which were not calibrated as part of the modeling approach and objective of the study most of the underestimates during growing period occurred toward the end of the period fig 7 using the swat model marek et al 2016 also observed underestimates in et toward the end of the growing period of sorghum which coincided with the underestimates in leaf area index the underestimates in soil moisture content available for root uptake at deeper soil layers toward the end of the growing period fig 10 could also be the reason for the underestimates in et in addition the inconsistency in et could also be due to the conversion of the alfalfa based kc and application of these coefficients in the penman monteith equation which was developed for grass based kc the discrepancy in et during the non growing dormant and pre planting post harvest periods could be due to the wide fluctuation in temperature at the beginning and end of these periods for instance in april 2014 the model was already simulating pre planting which has higher et than for non growing period in carberry and kenton sites as the criterion of five consecutive daily temperatures of 0 c or below was no longer satisfied yet there were a couple of days during this month where the measured tmin were still as low as 15 c and 11 c with a few snow falls for the two sites respectively this means that due to the abovementioned criterion the model could be using the pre planting post harvest surface coefficient even when the temperature was below 0 c or using the non growing dormant surface coefficient even the temperature was above 0 c hence most overestimates were observed during the months of april may and october fig 7 regardless of the identified errors the performance of the model in simulating et even without calibration was comparable to that of a calibrated validated swat model which obtained rmse values ranging from 1 18 to 1 48 mm day for growing cotton grain sorghum soybean and from 0 63 0 82 mm day for non growing season marek et al 2016 higher rmse values were obtained for growing period which was likely due to greater crop water demand during this period the model performance on estimating et is comparable with those of other models dndc d 0 83 and vsmb d 0 72 guest et al 2018 improved version of dndc r2 0 73 0 85 and rmse 0 77 1 04 mm d dutta et al 2016 rzwqm2 rmse 1 0 1 5 mm d anapalli et al 2016 swat r2 0 81 melaku and wang 2019 hydrus 2d 3d r2 0 51 0 78 mante and ranjan 2017 the model simulated deep percolation relatively better in carberry site than in kenton site one of the main differences between these two sites were the weeds and volunteers that deliberately grew in kenton site however as et and soil moisture content were simulated relatively better in kenton site than in carberry site as indicated by higher r2 d and are statistics the presence of weeds and volunteers might not be the cause for the larger error in deep percolation in kenton site the discrepancy could be due to the inaccuracy of the water holding capacity particularly field capacity of which deep percolation was highly sensitive to sensitivity index of 0 52 table 5 its impact on deep percolation seemed to be more pronounced during periods of heavy rain in addition the inconsistency in deep percolation could also be due to the relatively poor performance of the model for runoff particularly during spring in kenton site for instance a total of 55 mm runoff was observed in early april 2014 from snowmelt however no runoff from snowmelt was predicted during this period the model captured the snowmelt towards the end of that month which resulted in a total of 39 mm deep percolation evaluating the model performance on a long term basis e g monthly yearly as what other studies have done tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 mapes and pricope 2020 could have resulted in better agreement as it could eliminate the error caused by the difference in the timing of occurrence as mentioned above a relatively large discrepancy was observed between simulated and measured runoff particularly those from snowmelt which resulted in relatively poor performance statistics for pre planting post harvest period table 8 figs 8a and b 9 a and b for instance a total of 49 mm runoff from snowmelt was observed in the beginning of april 2014 in carberry site however the model estimated only 2 mm as mean air temperatures were still below 1 5 c it should be noted that in the model snowmelt occurs only when mean air temperature is 1 5 c similar phenomenon was also observed in kenton site in the same period as described earlier though temperature based snowmelt equation is simple to implement the melting factor and base temperature used in this equation are dependent on several factors including snow density liquid water content thermal conductivity snow albedo and wind speed kondo and yamazaki 1990 usda 2004 variations of these factors can change the energy dynamics and snowpack conditions over time and space massmann 2019 found that temperature based snowmelt models give good results in gauged basins but not in ungauged ones due to lack of data for calibration of the snowmelt parameters the results of this study suggest necessary improvements for the snowmelt algorithms the error in runoff estimates during the growing period could be due to the nrcs cn method employed numerous studies have shown that the cn values provided in the nrcs hydrology national engineering handbook can be substantially different from those calculated using observed rainfall runoff events tedela et al 2012 kowalik and walega 2015 lal et al 2017 walega and salata 2019 results from the sensitivity analysis conducted in this study as well as from other related studies hawkins 1975 boughton 1989 show that even a small difference in cn value can result in substantial difference in runoff further several studies have indicated that the 0 2 value for initial abstraction adopted in the nrcs cn method is not always suitable for different site specific cases d asaro and grillone 2012 ling and yusop 2014 moreover garen and moore 2005 underlined that the nrcs cn procedure was originally developed at a watershed scale thus it is not suitable for point plot or field scale applications however despite the limitations of the cn method it has been employed in many hydrological models e g dndc swat przm and vsmb due to its simplicity and dependence on a few parameters only ponce and hawkins 1996 hence it is the one adopted in the model regardless of this limitation the d statistic of the model for growing period is comparable to the 0 55 and 0 64 of the rzwqm and dndc models respectively smith et al 2020 and the 0 49 of the vsmb model guest et al 2018 as the model does not simulate soil freeze thaw dynamics and allows infiltration and water movement in soil based only on air and soil surface temperatures the simulated increases in moisture content after winter generally occurred a few days earlier than were observed the model tended to overestimate moisture content in upper layers but underestimate moisture content in lower layers fig 10 which is a common issue with bucket models as they do not simulate unsaturated downward flow of water smith et al 2019 also observed overestimates in soil moisture content near soil surface and underestimates in the deeper portion of the profile using the dndc model improved root density and penetration functions could improve the results as the authors suggested in addition the relatively higher measured moisture contents in the lower layers compared with the modeled values particularly in harrington site fig 10b could be due to the upward flow of water which is not simulated in the model presence of a transient perched water table at the bottom of the soil profile has been documented at this site in the past zebarth et al 2015 factors such as infiltration to frozen soil preferential flow and dynamic storage routing which have been identified to be potentially present in manitoba basins cordeiro et al 2017 might have also influenced the simulated soil moisture content however the overall performance of the model in simulating moisture content for various soil types is comparable with other models particularly those that use a cascade flow framework for hydrology he et al 2014 obtained rmse values ranging from 0 02 0 06 vol fraction and d values from 0 47 0 90 with a calibrated dssat ceres wheat model daycent dndc and stics models obtained are ranging from 0 5 7 4 for soil moisture simulations at various sites in eastern canada guest et al 2017 wang et al 2010 obtained r2 ranging from 0 0 66 using dssat and shaw models 5 summary and conclusions a parsimonious soil water budget model for estimating soil moisture content and water fluxes across agricultural landscapes in canada was developed by selecting and combining algorithms from various existing models whose data requirement are readily available in canadian databases the model can simulate evapotranspiration surface runoff deep percolation and soil moisture content during various seasons i e growing non growing dormant and pre planting post harvest with minimum data requirement which addresses the limited available data in the country for crop and hydrological modeling sensitivity analysis of the model showed that et and runoff were highly sensitive to kc and cn respectively indicating the importance of choosing accurate values of these parameters that best represent the field conditions and crop characteristics it was also found that deep percolation was highly sensitive to field capacity in sub humid conditions and to crop coefficient in humid conditions in contrast the most influential factor for soil moisture content in sub humid regions was kc while that in humid locations was field capacity the model tended to underestimate et during growing and non growing dormant periods but overestimate et during pre planting post harvest season however despite these inconsistencies the d values ranged from 0 6 0 8 indicating that the model performed relatively well even without site calibration rmse values for deep percolation ranged from 0 to 3 5 mm d which are comparable with those obtained by other models the discrepancy in deep percolation could be due to the inaccuracy in field capacity whose impact became more pronounced during heavy rainfall and to the inconsistency in simulating runoff from snowmelt although the model had a relatively satisfactory d statistic for runoff for the growing period a relatively large inconsistency was observed for runoff from snowmelt which could be due to the algorithm employed for snowmelt the discrepancy in runoff could also be attributed to the nrcs cn method which seems to be too simplistic in describing actual rainfall runoff events although the model tended to overestimate moisture content in upper layers and underestimate in lower layers a relatively good agreement was observed between simulated and observed soil moisture content as indicated by relatively lower are values which ranged from 0 4 21 0 the discrepancy in soil moisture content estimates could be attributed to some soil water dynamics which are not considered in the model e g soil freeze thaw upward water flow infiltration to frozen soil preferential flow and dynamic storage routing although the model inadequately captured runoff from snowmelt it simulated soil moisture content et and deep percolation relatively well for its intended simplicity and low input parameter requirement the model can run using the gdd based crop coefficients available for more than 50 crops and widely available soil water hydraulic and weather parameters its overall performance was found comparable with other models particularly those that implement a cascade flow framework for hydrology the ada values indicate that the model simulations have fairly low uncertainties testing the model using the limited amount of data could not sufficiently indicate that the model worked better in one site than the other results show that the model in its current form is limited by the simplicity of the snowmelt equation and cn method it employs better algorithms for snowmelt improved cn method and soil freeze thaw dynamics will be considered for better future estimates in addition the implication of using alfalfa based kc for the penman monteith equation will be further assessed in the future to carefully consider options and solutions to improve the performance of the model in estimating et credit authorship contribution statement myra martel conceptualization methodology writing aaron glenn
