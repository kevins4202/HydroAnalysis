2585,storms and the resultant floods have always been catastrophic disasters and raised increasing global concerns in the context of climate change however the relationships between storms and floods remain largely elusive here we examine the storm flood relationship and its variations in the upper chao phraya river basin ucprb a typical tropical monsoon basin in southeast asia the distributions of storms and floods are characterized by statistical models with the aid of climatic and land surface covariates the storm flood relationship is depicted by the concept of storm flood elasticity which represents the corresponding changes in flood peaks in response to changes in the storm peaks with the same return period the storm flood elasticity coefficients for 100 year return period events range from 0 61 to 1 20 and the values of storm flood elasticity coefficients tend to be smaller for long return period events than for short return period events under high typhoon precipitation high tp high non typhoon precipitation high ntp and low forest low f conditions and in humid regions than in arid regions the climatic covariates are shown to have stronger effects on the storm flood elasticity coefficient than the land surface covariate in most basins in the basins where deforestation shows strong impacts on the storm flood relationship afforestation can be an effective approach for flood control in most basins in the ucprb the variation of typhoon precipitation has larger impacts than those of non typhoon precipitation indicating that typhoon precipitation should be paid more attention to when considering the future changes in floods the findings help develop a better understanding of storm flood relationships in tropical monsoon regions and the methods of this study can also be applied in other climate regions keywords storm flood relationship elasticity analysis chao phraya river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction precipitation extremes i e storms and concomitant floods have caused catastrophic damage across the globe mateo et al 2014 tanoue et al 2021 tellman et al 2021 under climate change more and more evidence suggests the intensification of the hydrological cycle huntington 2006 madakumbura et al 2019 manifested as increases in precipitation and hydrological extremes under the ongoing pressure more insights are required into the storm and flood peaks and their relationships to depict the characteristics of storms and floods various statistical methods have been adopted intensity duration frequency idf curve is a widely used method to depict the precipitation process of storms baeck et al 2011 breinl et al 2021 breinl et al 2020 cheng and aghakouchak 2014 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020 ombadi et al 2018 sadegh et al 2017 and the flood peaks are depicted by flood frequency curves in previous studies baeck et al 2011 bl√∂schl and sivapalan 1997 breinl et al 2021 serinaldi 2011 villarini and smith 2010 based on extreme value theory previous studies suggest that generalized extreme value gev and gumbel distribution are used to capture the distributions of peak values in annual maximum am methods and the exponential and generalized pareto distribution are used to capture the distributions of peak values in peak over threshold methods gao et al 2016 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 wang 1991 meanwhile the inclusion of covariates in the distribution function has been found to increase the ability to explain the temporal variations of storm and flood peaks large scale circulation indices and greenhouse gas emission indices have been selected as the covariates in depicting the distribution of precipitation extremes in china gao et al 2018 gao et al 2016 and summer precipitation and reservoir information as the covariates have also been found to better explain the variation of flood peaks in the yangtze river basin xiong et al 2020 the idf curves and flood frequency curves are generally derived separately indicating that previous information about the storm flood relationship can be derived from their comparison the relationship between storms and floods is often characterized by the flood runoff coefficient the ratio of flood peak to storm peak which is found to be affected by land surface conditions including catchment size land cover type and antecedent soil moisture sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 as well as rainfall characteristics including the causative mechanisms of precipitation extremes rainfall intensity and rainfall process breinl et al 2021 sharma et al 2018 the flood runoff coefficient captures the relationship between the peak storm and peak flood directly in a certain flood event however it cannot describe the response of peak flood to peak storm changes in a changing environment elasticity is a measurement of a variable s sensitivity to a change in another variable for example the precipitation elasticity of runoff refers to the percentage change in mean annual runoff for a given percentage change in mean annual precipitation tang et al 2019 the concept of elasticity has been widely adopted to depict the changes in annual precipitation and annual runoff schaake 1990 xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 which can be potentially useful in quantifying the changes in floods in response to changes in precipitation extremes recently breinl et al 2021 applied the concept of storm flood elasticity in austria as a function of return period and duration and found larger elasticity in arid regions than in humid regions the 1 hour storm flood elasticity coefficients decrease as the return period increases from 2 years to 100 years with values larger than 1 paquet et al 2013 suggested that a 1 increase in the extreme 3 day storm results in a 1 5 2 6 increase in the extreme 3 day flood in france and the flood response is more sensitive in arid basins although climate has been shown to be an important factor affecting the storm flood elasticity in europe the roles of climate factors are not explored in tropical regions where the rainfall is dominated by complicated monsoon systems and typhoons besides previous studies regarded elasticity as a constant value affected by local climate and land surface conditions considering the changes of climatic and land surface variables as covariates could help better characterize the dynamics of the storm flood relationship the chao phraya river basin is a tropical monsoon basin highly vulnerable to flood disasters the chao phraya river plain is the most densely populated region in thailand with large cities including the capital city bangkok and it holds 80 of the national rice production yang et al 2019 the floods generated in the upper chao phraya river basin ucprb can lead to devastating consequences in the downstream plains a recent case is the 2011 thailand flood which led to a loss of 45 billion dollars and became the most economically damaging flood in thailand s history mateo et al 2014 promchote et al 2016 consequently the floods in the ucprb are of great concern to the socioeconomic development of thailand the precipitation in the wet season is mainly brought by the monsoon system and tropical cyclones typhoons generated from the south china sea takahashi and yasunari 2006 the monsoon system is mainly affected by two sub systems of the asian summer monsoon including the indian summer monsoon ism and the western north pacific summer monsoon wnpsm faikrua et al 2020 wang and ho 2002 and the dominant monsoon system that brings precipitation to thailand is under decadal oscillation cao et al 2012 yang et al 2018 significant changes in precipitation have been observed in previous studies including increasing trends in precipitation extremes limsakul and singhruck 2016 increases in wet season precipitation and annual precipitation since 1993 faikrua et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 and a decreasing trend in typhoon precipitation chen et al 2019 takahashi and yasunari 2008 takahashi et al 2008 in addition to climate change human activities like deforestation in ucprb were also observed which could also contribute to the recent hydroclimatic changes zeng et al 2018a zeng et al 2018b zhao et al 2022 the changes in the storm distribution flood distribution the storm flood relationship and their possible causes in the ucprb remain not well understood and need to be further examined the objectives of this work are 1 to analyze the impacts of climatic and land surface conditions on the storm and flood peaks 2 to examine the storm flood relationship based on storm flood elasticity 3 to quantify the effects of changes in climatic and land surface conditions on the storm flood relationship the manuscript is organized as follows the details about the study area and data are presented in section 2 the methods used in this study are introduced in section 3 section 4 shows the results of storm peaks and flood peaks modeling the storm flood elasticity and its response to variations in climatic and land surface conditions section 5 shows the implications of the changes in the climatic and land surface covariates and storm flood elasticity and discusses the uncertainties and limitations of the study the conclusions are presented in section 6 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the ucprb fig 1 is part of the chao phraya river basin located upstream from nakhon sawan which consists of the four main tributaries including the ping river the wang river the yom river and the nan river the japan international cooperation agency report https openjicareport jica go jp pdf 11356094 04 pdf has quantified the water resources in the sub basins of the chao phraya river basin and the ucprb makes up 64 of the total water resources of the chao phraya river therefore the ucprb is the major area contributing to water resources in the whole chao phraya river basin the ucprb receives annual precipitation of about 1100 mm and generates an annual runoff of about 200 mm and more than 80 of the annual precipitation falls during the wet season from may to october yamada et al 2022 the mean annual air temperature is about 27 c with the annual maximum air temperature occurring between april and may and the annual minimum occurring between december and january of the following year the ucprb is mainly covered by forest and the plain region in the lower reach is mainly covered by cropland see fig s1 in the supplementary material located in a region where two distinct monsoon systems converge the ucprb has two rainfall peaks during the wet season in may and september respectively faikrua et al 2020 takahashi and yasunari 2006 wang and ho 2002 the first peak is mainly caused by the ism related to the monsoon southwesterlies indian monsoon trough and somalia jet and lasts for around 1 to 2 months the second peak is mainly caused by the wnpsm and westward propagating tropical cyclones and lasts for 10 20 days faikrua et al 2020 yokoi et al 2007 2 2 data used in the study this study uses the daily rainfall observations during 1981 2014 from 41 meteorological stations provided by the royal meteorological department and 29 rain gauges provided by the royal irrigation department fig 1 the daily rainfall observations are then interpolated into 2 5 km resolution using angular distance weighting interpolation with elevation correction mark et al 1999 yang et al 2004 daily runoff data from 9 hydrological stations are collected from the royal irrigation department fig 1 see table s1 in the supplementary material for the information on the hydrological stations wet season precipitation is obtained from the chirps based estimation of bombardi et al 2019 with 0 25 resolution tropical cyclone center tracks every three hours since 1980 are attained from the international best track archive for climate stewardship https climatedataguide ucar edu climate data ibtracs tropical cyclone best track data the typhoon precipitation is estimated based on the 500 km hypothesis chen et al 2019 that is the daily precipitation is identified as typhoon precipitation if the distance between the pixel and the typhoon center is lower than 500 km this study obtains 90 m resolution elevation data from shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scale hydrosheds lehner et al 2008 provided by the united states geological survey usgs which is used to generate river networks in the study to quantify the control areas of the hydrological stations the derived river network by hydrosheds fits well with those provided by the royal irrigation department indicating that the extent of control areas is reliable the annual forest cover ratio used in the study region is obtained from the result of zhao et al 2022 extended from historical land use maps using the ca markov algorithm all the data adopted in this study are summarized in table 1 3 methods 3 1 the extraction of storms and floods the precipitation extremes i e storms and floods are extracted using the am method cunnane 1973 previous studies have mostly focused on the storm and flood events at sub daily scale and daily scale breinl et al 2021 martel et al 2021 wang et al 2018 while we focus only on the events at daily scale because only daily observations are available the am method uses the maximum daily rainfall or discharge value in each year at each basin of the ucprb the daily discharge values are from the observations at hydrological gauges and the daily rainfall values are calculated as the basin average values upstream the corresponding hydrological gauges previous studies have shown that storms and floods can be determined by both climate conditions and land surface conditions in the corresponding years gao et al 2016 xiong et al 2020 therefore the storm and flood events extracted from am method are used to fit the idf curves and flood frequency curves by the gamlss model with the aid of climate and land surface covariates 3 2 storm and flood peak distribution considering climate and land surface covariates the storm peak distribution and the flood peak distributions refer to the idf curves and flood frequency curves respectively as we are only interested in the 1 day maximum the duration is set as one day in the idf curves previous studies have shown that both storm peaks and flood peaks are affected by wet season precipitation wp barbero et al 2019 xiong et al 2020 as well as land surface conditions like forest cover ratio later referred to as f zhang and wei 2021 the precipitation in the ucprb during the wet season can be divided into typhoon precipitation tp and non typhoon monsoon precipitation ntp the two types of precipitation show distinct temporal patterns and interdecadal variations as suggested by yokoi et al 2007 tp is characterized as short duration and high rainfall intensity compared to ntp the tp is found to have declined in the indochina peninsula takahashi and yasunari 2008 despite increased summer precipitation in thailand since the 1990s faikrua et al 2020 the discrimination between tp and ntp might help depict the distribution of storm peaks and flood peaks the significance of the trends of the climatic and land surface covariates in nine basins are shown in table s2 in the supplementary material to link the distribution of storms and floods to the covariates mentioned above the generalized additive models for location scale and shape parameters gamlss are adopted stasinopoulos and rigby 2008 ryd√©n 2019 has shown that the choice of distribution type merely based on goodness of fit may not give realistic results and the choice of distribution function has to be treated with caution under the hypothesis of poisson arrival rate the theoretical distribution of floods and storms identified by am method should be gumbel distribution or generalized extreme value gev distribution wang 1991 while gev distribution has more flexibility in tail behaviors compared to gumbel distribution breinl et al 2021 therefore gev distribution is selected to fit the historical storms and floods in this study there are three parameters in the gev distribution as the location parameter the scale parameter and the shape parameter the location parameter indicates where the distribution lies and serves as the mean value the scale parameter indicates the variation and serves as the variance the shape parameter allows the distribution to take different shapes and serves as the skewness the gamlss model links the parameters of distribution functions with user defined covariates following previous studies we treat the shape parameters as constant and only link the location parameters and scale parameters with the covariates gao et al 2018 xiong et al 2020 in the modeling of storm peaks two models are established separately in the cases when tp and ntp are separately considered as covariates model 1 the equations are shown as follows 1a Œº 1 t Œ± 0 Œ± 1 t p t Œ± 2 n t p t 1b œÉ 1 t Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 t p t Œ≤ 2 n t p t 1c Œæ 1 t Œ∂ 1 where t refers to the year t p t n t p t are the covariates of the year t Œ± i Œ≤ i and Œ∂ 1 are model parameters to be estimated Œº 1 t œÉ 1 t and Œæ 1 t refers to the location parameter scale parameter and shape parameter of the storm peak distribution of the year t respectively in the cases when climatic conditions are represented by wp model 2 the equations are shown as follows 2a Œº 1 t Œ± 0 Œ± 3 w p t 2b œÉ 1 t Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 3 w p t 2c Œæ 1 t Œ∂ 1 where w p t is the value of the wet season precipitation in the year t the selection of models is based on the akaike information criterion aic gao et al 2018 the climatic covariates and the land surface covariates together are then linked to the floods peaks according to the selection of climatic covariates as follows 3a Œº 2 t Œ≥ 0 Œ≥ 1 t p t Œ≥ 2 n t p t Œ≥ 4 f t m o d e l 1 Œ≥ 0 Œ≥ 3 w p t Œ≥ 4 f t m o d e l 2 3b œÉ 2 t Œ¥ 0 Œ¥ 1 t p t Œ¥ 2 n t p t Œ¥ 4 f t m o d e l 1 Œ¥ 0 Œ¥ 3 w p t Œ¥ 4 f t m o d e l 2 3c Œæ 2 t Œ∂ 2 where f t refers to the forest cover ratio in the year t Œ≥ i Œ¥ i and Œ∂ 2 are model parameters to be estimated Œº 2 t œÉ 2 t and Œæ 2 t refers to the location parameter scale parameter and shape parameter of the flood peak distribution of year t respectively the relationships between the distribution parameters and the covariates are estimated using a markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm which is introduced in detail in the supplementary material qin et al 2018 xiong et al 2020 the goodness of fit is tested by anderson darling test a d test engmann 2011 the null hypothesis of the a d test is that the residuals obey the gaussian distribution therefore if the p value is larger than 0 05 the null hypothesis is not denied that is the fit results are accepted and larger p values indicate better fits a storm distribution and a flood distribution are now obtained in each basin and these distributions are then used to estimate the storm flood elasticity 3 3 storm flood elasticity breinl et al 2021 defined storm flood elasticity as the function of return period and duration here we fix the duration as 1 day and only consider the case of a 1 day maximum value and examine the 1 day elasticity an analytical solution by comparing the flood and storm with the same return period in the special case of gumbel distribution has been proposed by breinl et al 2021 here we define the cumulative distribution function of storms and floods as follows 4a x f Œ± œÜ p 4b y g Œ≤ œâ q where f and g are the cumulative distribution functions of storms and floods Œ± and Œ≤ are the distribution parameters location parameter scale parameter shape parameter and are determined by the covariates œÜ and œâ and p and q are the design values of peak storm and peak flood at the corresponding return period for the sake of convenience we also define the inverse function of the cumulative distribution functions as follows 5a p m Œ± œÜ x 5b q n Œ≤ œâ y where m and n are the inverse functions of cumulative distribution functions f and g we define the probability density function as follows 6a f p f Œ± œÜ p 6b g q g Œ≤ œâ q where f and g are the probability density functions of storms and floods based on the differentiation of implicit function the following relationships can be derived 7 1 q q n Œ≤ œâ y q n Œ≤ œâ g Œ≤ œâ q q as Œ≤ is not affected by q the equation above can be further written as 8 1 n y g q breinl et al 2021 suggested that the return periods of storms and floods could be treated as equal to compare the distribution of storm peaks and flood peaks statistically a similar approach to comparing the quantiles of distribution is also applied in the studies on drought propagation as the index drought propagation ratio was raised and developed apurv and cai 2020 apurv et al 2017 suppose that x y we get the relationship between flood and storm as 9 q n Œ≤ œâ y n Œ≤ œâ f Œ± œÜ p 10 q p n y f p f p g q f Œ± œÜ p g Œ≤ œâ q the storm flood elasticity coefficient can be derived as following 11 Œµ x p q q p pf Œ± œÜ p qg Œ≤ œâ q the storm flood elasticity coefficient is the product of two factors one is the ratio of the daily storm peak and the daily flood peak and the other is the ratio of marginal runoff and the related marginal precipitation as defined in eq 11 the elasticity coefficient is a function of the return period and is affected by the distribution parameters which are further determined by the climatic covariates and land surface covariates compared to the formula based on the gumbel distribution proposed by breinl et al 2021 the formula in this study is more flexible in the choice of statistical distribution and can reflect the effects of covariates on storm flood elasticity the response of storm flood elasticity to the variation in covariates is determined by two factors including the sensitivity of elasticity to the variation and the variation itself the influence of covariates should be quantified based on the difference between the elasticity curve under different conditions therefore as done by apurv et al 2017 we use geometric means to show the difference between the curves we define the impact ratio ir to quantify the difference as follows 12 ir m a x i 1 n Œµ h x i 1 n i 1 n Œµ l x i 1 n i 1 n Œµ l x i 1 n i 1 n Œµ h x i 1 n where Œµ l and Œµ h are the storm flood elasticity coefficients in the low covariate condition and in the high covariate condition respectively x i are the percentiles representing cumulative probability i e 0 5 0 8 0 9 0 95 0 98 0 99 corresponding to the return periods of 2 years 5 years 10 years 20 years 50 years and 100 years the low covariate condition select the target covariate at the 5th percentile cumulative probability is 5 and the median value for the rest covariates and the high covariate condition select the target covariate at 95th percentile cumulative probability is 95 and the median value for the rest covariates ir is always no less than 1 larger ir indicates that the variation of the target covariate led to more variation in storm flood elasticity the entire flow chart for methodology of this study is shown in fig 2 4 results 4 1 storm and flood peak distribution by gamlss the selected models based on aic in the 9 basins are shown in table 2 the discrimination between tp and ntp gives better performance in most basins except for the p 1 basin and the p 4a basin therefore the discrimination between tp and ntp in depicting the distribution of storm and flood peaks is necessary in the ucprb as the storm and flood peaks in most basins of the ucprb are strongly affected by the typhoon for the sake of consistency we use model 1 the model with the discrimination between tp and ntp as the selected model for all basins all of these selected models passed the a d test table s3 indicating that the storm and flood peak models are all well fitted as nearly half of the hydrological basins are located in the ping river basin we select the p 12 basin as an example and show the results of the p 12 basin in the main text the performance of gamlss in the p 12 basin is shown in fig 3 and the performance in other basins is shown in figure s2 the variations of storm and flood peaks are depicted in the variation of the distributions as the grey shaded area shows most observation dots fall within the grey shaded area indicating that the inclusion of the covariates in the distribution function has increased the ability to explain the interannual variations in the storm and flood peaks fig 4 shows the relationships between the location parameters and the covariates the climatic covariates both represent moisture supply conditions so it seems plausible that tp and ntp are positively correlated to the location parameter of storm peaks the positive relationship indicates that stronger monsoons and typhoons will lead to larger storms and floods f is found to be negatively correlated to the location parameters of flood peaks indicating that deforestation will lead to larger flood peaks the mean value and standard deviation of all the parameters estimated by the mcmc method are shown in table s4 in the supplementary material and the confidence intervals of the parameters related to the significant relations are shown in table s5 in the supplementary material 4 2 storm flood elasticity coefficients and their variations the storm flood elasticity evaluates the relationship between the change of peak storm and peak flood and is estimated by eq 11 the values of the covariates are set as the median values during the study period and the storm flood elasticity coefficients with different return periods are shown in table 3 and the pink curves in fig 5 the value of the elasticity coefficient indicates the response of flood peak to the changes of storm peak at a certain return period for example the 100 year return period storm flood elasticity coefficient in the p 12 basin is 0 735 that is the 100 year flood will increase by 0 735 if the 100 year storm increases by 1 the storm flood elasticity decreases as the return period becomes longer table 3 fig 5 the difference between the storm flood elasticity coefficients among different basins of the ucprb can be largely explained by the differences in climate conditions here we use aridity index ai defined as the multiannual mean value of potential evaporation divided by the multiannual mean value of precipitation arora 2002 to represent the climate conditions of different basins a strong positive correlation is detected between aridity index ai and storm flood elasticity coefficients at different return periods table 4 and fig s4 in the supplementary materials the correlations are significant at a 0 05 level for most return periods except for the 2 year return period the results show that the storm flood elasticity in arid regions is likely to be larger than that in humid regions that is the same percentage change in storm peak is likely to result in a larger percentage change in flood peak in more arid regions to illustrate the effects of covariates on storm flood elasticity we compare the elasticity coefficients under different climatic and land surface conditions here we show the storm flood elasticity coefficients under different conditions in the p 12 basin as an example in fig 5 see table s4 in the supplementary material for other basins in fig 5 a the red pink and blue curves are the elasticity coefficients with different return periods under low median and high tp conditions with the covariate set as the 5th percentile value median value and the 95th percentile value during the study period respectively the curves in fig 5 b c are similar with the covariate changed to ntp and f it can be seen that with the same return period the storm flood elasticity is smaller in high tp conditions high ntp conditions and low f conditions in the p 12 basin fig 5 and such a pattern is also observed in other basins fig s4 this phenomenon together with the other that the storm flood elasticity decreases as the return period becomes longer indicates that the storm flood elasticity is smaller for larger floods this is also consistent with the phenomenon that storm flood elasticity is positively correlated to ai the influence of the historical variations in covariates on storm flood elasticity is quantified by the ir based on eq 12 and the results are shown in table 5 in some basins such as the w 16 and p 14 basin the ir for each covariate is quite close to 1 indicating that the historical variation of the covariates does not lead to strong variation in the storm flood elasticity in some basins such as the w 4a basin the variation in tp results in strong variation in the storm flood elasticity we define the dominant covariate as the one that has the largest ir tp is the dominant covariate in three large basins while f plays a more important role in the upstream basins in the p 1 basin and the p 4a basin where the discrimination between tp and ntp does not give better performance ntp plays a more important role than tp while in the other basins the impacts of tp are no less than ntp 5 discussions 5 1 the implications of the covariates on the storm flood relationship the climatic and land surface covariates both affect the storm flood relationship in the ucprb though the ucprb witnessed considerable deforestation during the past decades the variation of storm flood elasticity is dominated by the variation of climatic covariates in most basins except for the n 1 basin where the storm and flood peaks are quite sensitive to forest cover change table 5 the result indicates that the storm flood elasticity in the ucprb is mainly affected by climate conditions rather than anthropogenic activities the discrimination between tp and ntp helps model storm and flood better in most basins except for p 1 and p 4a sub basin the aics of the two models do not show much difference table 2 while the slight difference is consistent with the typhoon trajectories in the indochina peninsula typhoon in thailand is mainly generated in the northwestern pacific and land in the indochina peninsula from the south china sea the two sub basins are located in the northwestern mountain region of the ucprb making the effects of the typhoon precipitation weaker than those of other sub basins the other basins are closer to the sea and might be strongly affected by typhoons making the irs of tp larger than the irs of ntp therefore extra attention should be paid to typhoon forecasts for better flood control in these basins in the n 1 basin where the variation of forest cover is the main factor affecting the storm flood relationship afforestation can be an effective approach for flood management 5 2 the storm flood elasticity in the ucprb the storm flood elasticity describes the relationship between the change of peak storm and the change of peak flood the larger storm flood elasticity in arid regions is consistent with previous studies on the storm flood elasticity breinl et al 2021 paquet et al 2013 and the phenomenon is consistent with the pattern that runoff elasticity of annual precipitation is larger in arid basins than in humid basins xu et al 2013 the elasticity coefficient decreases as the return period increases which is consistent with previous results breinl et al 2021 here we attempt to explain why storm flood elasticity for longer return periods tends to be smaller at the event scale suppose that storm events and concomitant flood events have the same return period when the peak value is extremely large return period the elasticity will be intuitively quite close to unity as the flood peak will be quite close to the storm peak when all precipitation is transferred to river runoff for more realistic cases as shown in eq 11 the elasticity coefficient can be treated as the product of two factors including the ratio of precipitation and runoff and the marginal runoff and the related marginal precipitation the first factor can be recognized as the inverse of the runoff coefficient as the runoff coefficient is always lower than 1 and tends to increase with flood magnitude the first factor is always larger than 1 and decreases as the peak value increases the second factor shows the concept of the marginal runoff coefficient and estimates how much runoff will be further generated as precipitation increases the second factor should be quite close to 1 as most of the additional precipitation will be converted to runoff when the catchment is saturated therefore the theoretical value of the elasticity coefficient as the product of the two factors is always larger than 1 and decreases as the peak value increases however the theoretical value is derived based on the assumption that the storm events and the concomitant flood events have the same return period in our study since the assumption is not always valid the storm flood elasticity coefficients are lower than 1 in many basins however for a certain basin the negative relationship between the elasticity coefficients and return period is still kept the storm flood elasticity derived here may also help build a bridge between climate change and flood change at the local scale previous studies have shown a close relationship between temperature and precipitation extremes in water abundant regions known as the clausius clapeyron cc equation lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 trenberth et al 2003 wang et al 2018 in these regions the cc equation claims that a 1 k increase in temperature will lead to a 7 increase in precipitation extremes in the ucprb basins the storm flood elasticities can be applied to extend the temperature storm relationship to a temperature flood relationship however since the temperature storm relationship in the ucprb is still not clear the relationship between extreme flood and temperature remains unknown which calls for further studies 5 3 uncertainties and limitations the uncertainties of this study may come from the input and fitting process of the gamlss models the uncertainties in input data mainly come from the interpolation of precipitation and the use of hydroclimatic datasets among which the uncertainties from interpolation can be reduced if data from more gauges are utilized we have 41 meteorological stations and 29 rain gauges used for the interpolation of precipitation and the observation network has become much denser compared to previous studies limjirakan and limsakul 2012 tebakari et al 2005 while more observations are still needed to further reduce the possible uncertainties in the concept of elasticity we neglect the antecedent precipitation conditions before the extracted storm flood events and the storm flood processes this could bring some uncertainties but will not affect the results quite much due to the following reasons one is that the largest daily runoff in a year always occurs when the soil moisture conditions are relatively wet the other is as suggested by yokoi et al 2007 the two rainfall peaks in thailand show different patterns and the second peak is characterized as short duration and high rainfall intensity making the largest flood event more likely to happen in the late wet season when the soil moisture conditions are relatively wet therefore the neglection of antecedent precipitation is plausible the uncertainties of the elasticity method may also come from the hypothesis that storm events and concomitant flood events are at the same return period the hypothesis here may be strict at the event scale but the comparison of the same quantiles can provide insights into the relationship between storms and floods as for the covariates we only took f tp and ntp into consideration in the study there may be other factors affecting the storm and flood peaks and the inclusion of the other climatic and land surface covariates may help gain deeper insights into the storm flood relationship which can be further explored by future studies 6 conclusion in this study a more generalized storm flood elasticity formula was derived and the ucprb was selected as a typical basin in the tropical monsoon region to analyze the storm flood relationship and its influencing factors according to the results the following conclusions have been reached 1 the distribution of storm and flood peaks in the ucprb can be better fitted using gamlss by discriminating tp and ntp in most basins except for two northwestern basins the p 1 basin and the p 4a basin in all basins storm and flood peaks are larger in high tp and high ntp conditions and flood peaks are larger in low f conditions 2 the values of the storm flood elasticity coefficients rely on the return period and the climatic and land surface covariates the values of storm flood elasticity coefficients tend to be smaller for long return period events than for short return period events under high tp high ntp and low f conditions and in humid regions than in arid regions 3 climatic covariates show larger impacts on the storm flood elasticity than land surface covariates in most basins except for n 1 basin in the n 1 basin where the impacts of forest cover change are the most important afforestation is proposed as an effective flood management approach in basins except for the p 1 station and the p 4a station tp has a greater impact on the storm flood relationship than ntp the findings can help provide a better understanding of storm flood relationships in tropical monsoon regions and the methods derived in this study can also be applied to other basins in future studies to examine the storm

2585,storms and the resultant floods have always been catastrophic disasters and raised increasing global concerns in the context of climate change however the relationships between storms and floods remain largely elusive here we examine the storm flood relationship and its variations in the upper chao phraya river basin ucprb a typical tropical monsoon basin in southeast asia the distributions of storms and floods are characterized by statistical models with the aid of climatic and land surface covariates the storm flood relationship is depicted by the concept of storm flood elasticity which represents the corresponding changes in flood peaks in response to changes in the storm peaks with the same return period the storm flood elasticity coefficients for 100 year return period events range from 0 61 to 1 20 and the values of storm flood elasticity coefficients tend to be smaller for long return period events than for short return period events under high typhoon precipitation high tp high non typhoon precipitation high ntp and low forest low f conditions and in humid regions than in arid regions the climatic covariates are shown to have stronger effects on the storm flood elasticity coefficient than the land surface covariate in most basins in the basins where deforestation shows strong impacts on the storm flood relationship afforestation can be an effective approach for flood control in most basins in the ucprb the variation of typhoon precipitation has larger impacts than those of non typhoon precipitation indicating that typhoon precipitation should be paid more attention to when considering the future changes in floods the findings help develop a better understanding of storm flood relationships in tropical monsoon regions and the methods of this study can also be applied in other climate regions keywords storm flood relationship elasticity analysis chao phraya river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction precipitation extremes i e storms and concomitant floods have caused catastrophic damage across the globe mateo et al 2014 tanoue et al 2021 tellman et al 2021 under climate change more and more evidence suggests the intensification of the hydrological cycle huntington 2006 madakumbura et al 2019 manifested as increases in precipitation and hydrological extremes under the ongoing pressure more insights are required into the storm and flood peaks and their relationships to depict the characteristics of storms and floods various statistical methods have been adopted intensity duration frequency idf curve is a widely used method to depict the precipitation process of storms baeck et al 2011 breinl et al 2021 breinl et al 2020 cheng and aghakouchak 2014 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020 ombadi et al 2018 sadegh et al 2017 and the flood peaks are depicted by flood frequency curves in previous studies baeck et al 2011 bl√∂schl and sivapalan 1997 breinl et al 2021 serinaldi 2011 villarini and smith 2010 based on extreme value theory previous studies suggest that generalized extreme value gev and gumbel distribution are used to capture the distributions of peak values in annual maximum am methods and the exponential and generalized pareto distribution are used to capture the distributions of peak values in peak over threshold methods gao et al 2016 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 wang 1991 meanwhile the inclusion of covariates in the distribution function has been found to increase the ability to explain the temporal variations of storm and flood peaks large scale circulation indices and greenhouse gas emission indices have been selected as the covariates in depicting the distribution of precipitation extremes in china gao et al 2018 gao et al 2016 and summer precipitation and reservoir information as the covariates have also been found to better explain the variation of flood peaks in the yangtze river basin xiong et al 2020 the idf curves and flood frequency curves are generally derived separately indicating that previous information about the storm flood relationship can be derived from their comparison the relationship between storms and floods is often characterized by the flood runoff coefficient the ratio of flood peak to storm peak which is found to be affected by land surface conditions including catchment size land cover type and antecedent soil moisture sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 as well as rainfall characteristics including the causative mechanisms of precipitation extremes rainfall intensity and rainfall process breinl et al 2021 sharma et al 2018 the flood runoff coefficient captures the relationship between the peak storm and peak flood directly in a certain flood event however it cannot describe the response of peak flood to peak storm changes in a changing environment elasticity is a measurement of a variable s sensitivity to a change in another variable for example the precipitation elasticity of runoff refers to the percentage change in mean annual runoff for a given percentage change in mean annual precipitation tang et al 2019 the concept of elasticity has been widely adopted to depict the changes in annual precipitation and annual runoff schaake 1990 xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 which can be potentially useful in quantifying the changes in floods in response to changes in precipitation extremes recently breinl et al 2021 applied the concept of storm flood elasticity in austria as a function of return period and duration and found larger elasticity in arid regions than in humid regions the 1 hour storm flood elasticity coefficients decrease as the return period increases from 2 years to 100 years with values larger than 1 paquet et al 2013 suggested that a 1 increase in the extreme 3 day storm results in a 1 5 2 6 increase in the extreme 3 day flood in france and the flood response is more sensitive in arid basins although climate has been shown to be an important factor affecting the storm flood elasticity in europe the roles of climate factors are not explored in tropical regions where the rainfall is dominated by complicated monsoon systems and typhoons besides previous studies regarded elasticity as a constant value affected by local climate and land surface conditions considering the changes of climatic and land surface variables as covariates could help better characterize the dynamics of the storm flood relationship the chao phraya river basin is a tropical monsoon basin highly vulnerable to flood disasters the chao phraya river plain is the most densely populated region in thailand with large cities including the capital city bangkok and it holds 80 of the national rice production yang et al 2019 the floods generated in the upper chao phraya river basin ucprb can lead to devastating consequences in the downstream plains a recent case is the 2011 thailand flood which led to a loss of 45 billion dollars and became the most economically damaging flood in thailand s history mateo et al 2014 promchote et al 2016 consequently the floods in the ucprb are of great concern to the socioeconomic development of thailand the precipitation in the wet season is mainly brought by the monsoon system and tropical cyclones typhoons generated from the south china sea takahashi and yasunari 2006 the monsoon system is mainly affected by two sub systems of the asian summer monsoon including the indian summer monsoon ism and the western north pacific summer monsoon wnpsm faikrua et al 2020 wang and ho 2002 and the dominant monsoon system that brings precipitation to thailand is under decadal oscillation cao et al 2012 yang et al 2018 significant changes in precipitation have been observed in previous studies including increasing trends in precipitation extremes limsakul and singhruck 2016 increases in wet season precipitation and annual precipitation since 1993 faikrua et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 and a decreasing trend in typhoon precipitation chen et al 2019 takahashi and yasunari 2008 takahashi et al 2008 in addition to climate change human activities like deforestation in ucprb were also observed which could also contribute to the recent hydroclimatic changes zeng et al 2018a zeng et al 2018b zhao et al 2022 the changes in the storm distribution flood distribution the storm flood relationship and their possible causes in the ucprb remain not well understood and need to be further examined the objectives of this work are 1 to analyze the impacts of climatic and land surface conditions on the storm and flood peaks 2 to examine the storm flood relationship based on storm flood elasticity 3 to quantify the effects of changes in climatic and land surface conditions on the storm flood relationship the manuscript is organized as follows the details about the study area and data are presented in section 2 the methods used in this study are introduced in section 3 section 4 shows the results of storm peaks and flood peaks modeling the storm flood elasticity and its response to variations in climatic and land surface conditions section 5 shows the implications of the changes in the climatic and land surface covariates and storm flood elasticity and discusses the uncertainties and limitations of the study the conclusions are presented in section 6 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the ucprb fig 1 is part of the chao phraya river basin located upstream from nakhon sawan which consists of the four main tributaries including the ping river the wang river the yom river and the nan river the japan international cooperation agency report https openjicareport jica go jp pdf 11356094 04 pdf has quantified the water resources in the sub basins of the chao phraya river basin and the ucprb makes up 64 of the total water resources of the chao phraya river therefore the ucprb is the major area contributing to water resources in the whole chao phraya river basin the ucprb receives annual precipitation of about 1100 mm and generates an annual runoff of about 200 mm and more than 80 of the annual precipitation falls during the wet season from may to october yamada et al 2022 the mean annual air temperature is about 27 c with the annual maximum air temperature occurring between april and may and the annual minimum occurring between december and january of the following year the ucprb is mainly covered by forest and the plain region in the lower reach is mainly covered by cropland see fig s1 in the supplementary material located in a region where two distinct monsoon systems converge the ucprb has two rainfall peaks during the wet season in may and september respectively faikrua et al 2020 takahashi and yasunari 2006 wang and ho 2002 the first peak is mainly caused by the ism related to the monsoon southwesterlies indian monsoon trough and somalia jet and lasts for around 1 to 2 months the second peak is mainly caused by the wnpsm and westward propagating tropical cyclones and lasts for 10 20 days faikrua et al 2020 yokoi et al 2007 2 2 data used in the study this study uses the daily rainfall observations during 1981 2014 from 41 meteorological stations provided by the royal meteorological department and 29 rain gauges provided by the royal irrigation department fig 1 the daily rainfall observations are then interpolated into 2 5 km resolution using angular distance weighting interpolation with elevation correction mark et al 1999 yang et al 2004 daily runoff data from 9 hydrological stations are collected from the royal irrigation department fig 1 see table s1 in the supplementary material for the information on the hydrological stations wet season precipitation is obtained from the chirps based estimation of bombardi et al 2019 with 0 25 resolution tropical cyclone center tracks every three hours since 1980 are attained from the international best track archive for climate stewardship https climatedataguide ucar edu climate data ibtracs tropical cyclone best track data the typhoon precipitation is estimated based on the 500 km hypothesis chen et al 2019 that is the daily precipitation is identified as typhoon precipitation if the distance between the pixel and the typhoon center is lower than 500 km this study obtains 90 m resolution elevation data from shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scale hydrosheds lehner et al 2008 provided by the united states geological survey usgs which is used to generate river networks in the study to quantify the control areas of the hydrological stations the derived river network by hydrosheds fits well with those provided by the royal irrigation department indicating that the extent of control areas is reliable the annual forest cover ratio used in the study region is obtained from the result of zhao et al 2022 extended from historical land use maps using the ca markov algorithm all the data adopted in this study are summarized in table 1 3 methods 3 1 the extraction of storms and floods the precipitation extremes i e storms and floods are extracted using the am method cunnane 1973 previous studies have mostly focused on the storm and flood events at sub daily scale and daily scale breinl et al 2021 martel et al 2021 wang et al 2018 while we focus only on the events at daily scale because only daily observations are available the am method uses the maximum daily rainfall or discharge value in each year at each basin of the ucprb the daily discharge values are from the observations at hydrological gauges and the daily rainfall values are calculated as the basin average values upstream the corresponding hydrological gauges previous studies have shown that storms and floods can be determined by both climate conditions and land surface conditions in the corresponding years gao et al 2016 xiong et al 2020 therefore the storm and flood events extracted from am method are used to fit the idf curves and flood frequency curves by the gamlss model with the aid of climate and land surface covariates 3 2 storm and flood peak distribution considering climate and land surface covariates the storm peak distribution and the flood peak distributions refer to the idf curves and flood frequency curves respectively as we are only interested in the 1 day maximum the duration is set as one day in the idf curves previous studies have shown that both storm peaks and flood peaks are affected by wet season precipitation wp barbero et al 2019 xiong et al 2020 as well as land surface conditions like forest cover ratio later referred to as f zhang and wei 2021 the precipitation in the ucprb during the wet season can be divided into typhoon precipitation tp and non typhoon monsoon precipitation ntp the two types of precipitation show distinct temporal patterns and interdecadal variations as suggested by yokoi et al 2007 tp is characterized as short duration and high rainfall intensity compared to ntp the tp is found to have declined in the indochina peninsula takahashi and yasunari 2008 despite increased summer precipitation in thailand since the 1990s faikrua et al 2020 the discrimination between tp and ntp might help depict the distribution of storm peaks and flood peaks the significance of the trends of the climatic and land surface covariates in nine basins are shown in table s2 in the supplementary material to link the distribution of storms and floods to the covariates mentioned above the generalized additive models for location scale and shape parameters gamlss are adopted stasinopoulos and rigby 2008 ryd√©n 2019 has shown that the choice of distribution type merely based on goodness of fit may not give realistic results and the choice of distribution function has to be treated with caution under the hypothesis of poisson arrival rate the theoretical distribution of floods and storms identified by am method should be gumbel distribution or generalized extreme value gev distribution wang 1991 while gev distribution has more flexibility in tail behaviors compared to gumbel distribution breinl et al 2021 therefore gev distribution is selected to fit the historical storms and floods in this study there are three parameters in the gev distribution as the location parameter the scale parameter and the shape parameter the location parameter indicates where the distribution lies and serves as the mean value the scale parameter indicates the variation and serves as the variance the shape parameter allows the distribution to take different shapes and serves as the skewness the gamlss model links the parameters of distribution functions with user defined covariates following previous studies we treat the shape parameters as constant and only link the location parameters and scale parameters with the covariates gao et al 2018 xiong et al 2020 in the modeling of storm peaks two models are established separately in the cases when tp and ntp are separately considered as covariates model 1 the equations are shown as follows 1a Œº 1 t Œ± 0 Œ± 1 t p t Œ± 2 n t p t 1b œÉ 1 t Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 t p t Œ≤ 2 n t p t 1c Œæ 1 t Œ∂ 1 where t refers to the year t p t n t p t are the covariates of the year t Œ± i Œ≤ i and Œ∂ 1 are model parameters to be estimated Œº 1 t œÉ 1 t and Œæ 1 t refers to the location parameter scale parameter and shape parameter of the storm peak distribution of the year t respectively in the cases when climatic conditions are represented by wp model 2 the equations are shown as follows 2a Œº 1 t Œ± 0 Œ± 3 w p t 2b œÉ 1 t Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 3 w p t 2c Œæ 1 t Œ∂ 1 where w p t is the value of the wet season precipitation in the year t the selection of models is based on the akaike information criterion aic gao et al 2018 the climatic covariates and the land surface covariates together are then linked to the floods peaks according to the selection of climatic covariates as follows 3a Œº 2 t Œ≥ 0 Œ≥ 1 t p t Œ≥ 2 n t p t Œ≥ 4 f t m o d e l 1 Œ≥ 0 Œ≥ 3 w p t Œ≥ 4 f t m o d e l 2 3b œÉ 2 t Œ¥ 0 Œ¥ 1 t p t Œ¥ 2 n t p t Œ¥ 4 f t m o d e l 1 Œ¥ 0 Œ¥ 3 w p t Œ¥ 4 f t m o d e l 2 3c Œæ 2 t Œ∂ 2 where f t refers to the forest cover ratio in the year t Œ≥ i Œ¥ i and Œ∂ 2 are model parameters to be estimated Œº 2 t œÉ 2 t and Œæ 2 t refers to the location parameter scale parameter and shape parameter of the flood peak distribution of year t respectively the relationships between the distribution parameters and the covariates are estimated using a markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm which is introduced in detail in the supplementary material qin et al 2018 xiong et al 2020 the goodness of fit is tested by anderson darling test a d test engmann 2011 the null hypothesis of the a d test is that the residuals obey the gaussian distribution therefore if the p value is larger than 0 05 the null hypothesis is not denied that is the fit results are accepted and larger p values indicate better fits a storm distribution and a flood distribution are now obtained in each basin and these distributions are then used to estimate the storm flood elasticity 3 3 storm flood elasticity breinl et al 2021 defined storm flood elasticity as the function of return period and duration here we fix the duration as 1 day and only consider the case of a 1 day maximum value and examine the 1 day elasticity an analytical solution by comparing the flood and storm with the same return period in the special case of gumbel distribution has been proposed by breinl et al 2021 here we define the cumulative distribution function of storms and floods as follows 4a x f Œ± œÜ p 4b y g Œ≤ œâ q where f and g are the cumulative distribution functions of storms and floods Œ± and Œ≤ are the distribution parameters location parameter scale parameter shape parameter and are determined by the covariates œÜ and œâ and p and q are the design values of peak storm and peak flood at the corresponding return period for the sake of convenience we also define the inverse function of the cumulative distribution functions as follows 5a p m Œ± œÜ x 5b q n Œ≤ œâ y where m and n are the inverse functions of cumulative distribution functions f and g we define the probability density function as follows 6a f p f Œ± œÜ p 6b g q g Œ≤ œâ q where f and g are the probability density functions of storms and floods based on the differentiation of implicit function the following relationships can be derived 7 1 q q n Œ≤ œâ y q n Œ≤ œâ g Œ≤ œâ q q as Œ≤ is not affected by q the equation above can be further written as 8 1 n y g q breinl et al 2021 suggested that the return periods of storms and floods could be treated as equal to compare the distribution of storm peaks and flood peaks statistically a similar approach to comparing the quantiles of distribution is also applied in the studies on drought propagation as the index drought propagation ratio was raised and developed apurv and cai 2020 apurv et al 2017 suppose that x y we get the relationship between flood and storm as 9 q n Œ≤ œâ y n Œ≤ œâ f Œ± œÜ p 10 q p n y f p f p g q f Œ± œÜ p g Œ≤ œâ q the storm flood elasticity coefficient can be derived as following 11 Œµ x p q q p pf Œ± œÜ p qg Œ≤ œâ q the storm flood elasticity coefficient is the product of two factors one is the ratio of the daily storm peak and the daily flood peak and the other is the ratio of marginal runoff and the related marginal precipitation as defined in eq 11 the elasticity coefficient is a function of the return period and is affected by the distribution parameters which are further determined by the climatic covariates and land surface covariates compared to the formula based on the gumbel distribution proposed by breinl et al 2021 the formula in this study is more flexible in the choice of statistical distribution and can reflect the effects of covariates on storm flood elasticity the response of storm flood elasticity to the variation in covariates is determined by two factors including the sensitivity of elasticity to the variation and the variation itself the influence of covariates should be quantified based on the difference between the elasticity curve under different conditions therefore as done by apurv et al 2017 we use geometric means to show the difference between the curves we define the impact ratio ir to quantify the difference as follows 12 ir m a x i 1 n Œµ h x i 1 n i 1 n Œµ l x i 1 n i 1 n Œµ l x i 1 n i 1 n Œµ h x i 1 n where Œµ l and Œµ h are the storm flood elasticity coefficients in the low covariate condition and in the high covariate condition respectively x i are the percentiles representing cumulative probability i e 0 5 0 8 0 9 0 95 0 98 0 99 corresponding to the return periods of 2 years 5 years 10 years 20 years 50 years and 100 years the low covariate condition select the target covariate at the 5th percentile cumulative probability is 5 and the median value for the rest covariates and the high covariate condition select the target covariate at 95th percentile cumulative probability is 95 and the median value for the rest covariates ir is always no less than 1 larger ir indicates that the variation of the target covariate led to more variation in storm flood elasticity the entire flow chart for methodology of this study is shown in fig 2 4 results 4 1 storm and flood peak distribution by gamlss the selected models based on aic in the 9 basins are shown in table 2 the discrimination between tp and ntp gives better performance in most basins except for the p 1 basin and the p 4a basin therefore the discrimination between tp and ntp in depicting the distribution of storm and flood peaks is necessary in the ucprb as the storm and flood peaks in most basins of the ucprb are strongly affected by the typhoon for the sake of consistency we use model 1 the model with the discrimination between tp and ntp as the selected model for all basins all of these selected models passed the a d test table s3 indicating that the storm and flood peak models are all well fitted as nearly half of the hydrological basins are located in the ping river basin we select the p 12 basin as an example and show the results of the p 12 basin in the main text the performance of gamlss in the p 12 basin is shown in fig 3 and the performance in other basins is shown in figure s2 the variations of storm and flood peaks are depicted in the variation of the distributions as the grey shaded area shows most observation dots fall within the grey shaded area indicating that the inclusion of the covariates in the distribution function has increased the ability to explain the interannual variations in the storm and flood peaks fig 4 shows the relationships between the location parameters and the covariates the climatic covariates both represent moisture supply conditions so it seems plausible that tp and ntp are positively correlated to the location parameter of storm peaks the positive relationship indicates that stronger monsoons and typhoons will lead to larger storms and floods f is found to be negatively correlated to the location parameters of flood peaks indicating that deforestation will lead to larger flood peaks the mean value and standard deviation of all the parameters estimated by the mcmc method are shown in table s4 in the supplementary material and the confidence intervals of the parameters related to the significant relations are shown in table s5 in the supplementary material 4 2 storm flood elasticity coefficients and their variations the storm flood elasticity evaluates the relationship between the change of peak storm and peak flood and is estimated by eq 11 the values of the covariates are set as the median values during the study period and the storm flood elasticity coefficients with different return periods are shown in table 3 and the pink curves in fig 5 the value of the elasticity coefficient indicates the response of flood peak to the changes of storm peak at a certain return period for example the 100 year return period storm flood elasticity coefficient in the p 12 basin is 0 735 that is the 100 year flood will increase by 0 735 if the 100 year storm increases by 1 the storm flood elasticity decreases as the return period becomes longer table 3 fig 5 the difference between the storm flood elasticity coefficients among different basins of the ucprb can be largely explained by the differences in climate conditions here we use aridity index ai defined as the multiannual mean value of potential evaporation divided by the multiannual mean value of precipitation arora 2002 to represent the climate conditions of different basins a strong positive correlation is detected between aridity index ai and storm flood elasticity coefficients at different return periods table 4 and fig s4 in the supplementary materials the correlations are significant at a 0 05 level for most return periods except for the 2 year return period the results show that the storm flood elasticity in arid regions is likely to be larger than that in humid regions that is the same percentage change in storm peak is likely to result in a larger percentage change in flood peak in more arid regions to illustrate the effects of covariates on storm flood elasticity we compare the elasticity coefficients under different climatic and land surface conditions here we show the storm flood elasticity coefficients under different conditions in the p 12 basin as an example in fig 5 see table s4 in the supplementary material for other basins in fig 5 a the red pink and blue curves are the elasticity coefficients with different return periods under low median and high tp conditions with the covariate set as the 5th percentile value median value and the 95th percentile value during the study period respectively the curves in fig 5 b c are similar with the covariate changed to ntp and f it can be seen that with the same return period the storm flood elasticity is smaller in high tp conditions high ntp conditions and low f conditions in the p 12 basin fig 5 and such a pattern is also observed in other basins fig s4 this phenomenon together with the other that the storm flood elasticity decreases as the return period becomes longer indicates that the storm flood elasticity is smaller for larger floods this is also consistent with the phenomenon that storm flood elasticity is positively correlated to ai the influence of the historical variations in covariates on storm flood elasticity is quantified by the ir based on eq 12 and the results are shown in table 5 in some basins such as the w 16 and p 14 basin the ir for each covariate is quite close to 1 indicating that the historical variation of the covariates does not lead to strong variation in the storm flood elasticity in some basins such as the w 4a basin the variation in tp results in strong variation in the storm flood elasticity we define the dominant covariate as the one that has the largest ir tp is the dominant covariate in three large basins while f plays a more important role in the upstream basins in the p 1 basin and the p 4a basin where the discrimination between tp and ntp does not give better performance ntp plays a more important role than tp while in the other basins the impacts of tp are no less than ntp 5 discussions 5 1 the implications of the covariates on the storm flood relationship the climatic and land surface covariates both affect the storm flood relationship in the ucprb though the ucprb witnessed considerable deforestation during the past decades the variation of storm flood elasticity is dominated by the variation of climatic covariates in most basins except for the n 1 basin where the storm and flood peaks are quite sensitive to forest cover change table 5 the result indicates that the storm flood elasticity in the ucprb is mainly affected by climate conditions rather than anthropogenic activities the discrimination between tp and ntp helps model storm and flood better in most basins except for p 1 and p 4a sub basin the aics of the two models do not show much difference table 2 while the slight difference is consistent with the typhoon trajectories in the indochina peninsula typhoon in thailand is mainly generated in the northwestern pacific and land in the indochina peninsula from the south china sea the two sub basins are located in the northwestern mountain region of the ucprb making the effects of the typhoon precipitation weaker than those of other sub basins the other basins are closer to the sea and might be strongly affected by typhoons making the irs of tp larger than the irs of ntp therefore extra attention should be paid to typhoon forecasts for better flood control in these basins in the n 1 basin where the variation of forest cover is the main factor affecting the storm flood relationship afforestation can be an effective approach for flood management 5 2 the storm flood elasticity in the ucprb the storm flood elasticity describes the relationship between the change of peak storm and the change of peak flood the larger storm flood elasticity in arid regions is consistent with previous studies on the storm flood elasticity breinl et al 2021 paquet et al 2013 and the phenomenon is consistent with the pattern that runoff elasticity of annual precipitation is larger in arid basins than in humid basins xu et al 2013 the elasticity coefficient decreases as the return period increases which is consistent with previous results breinl et al 2021 here we attempt to explain why storm flood elasticity for longer return periods tends to be smaller at the event scale suppose that storm events and concomitant flood events have the same return period when the peak value is extremely large return period the elasticity will be intuitively quite close to unity as the flood peak will be quite close to the storm peak when all precipitation is transferred to river runoff for more realistic cases as shown in eq 11 the elasticity coefficient can be treated as the product of two factors including the ratio of precipitation and runoff and the marginal runoff and the related marginal precipitation the first factor can be recognized as the inverse of the runoff coefficient as the runoff coefficient is always lower than 1 and tends to increase with flood magnitude the first factor is always larger than 1 and decreases as the peak value increases the second factor shows the concept of the marginal runoff coefficient and estimates how much runoff will be further generated as precipitation increases the second factor should be quite close to 1 as most of the additional precipitation will be converted to runoff when the catchment is saturated therefore the theoretical value of the elasticity coefficient as the product of the two factors is always larger than 1 and decreases as the peak value increases however the theoretical value is derived based on the assumption that the storm events and the concomitant flood events have the same return period in our study since the assumption is not always valid the storm flood elasticity coefficients are lower than 1 in many basins however for a certain basin the negative relationship between the elasticity coefficients and return period is still kept the storm flood elasticity derived here may also help build a bridge between climate change and flood change at the local scale previous studies have shown a close relationship between temperature and precipitation extremes in water abundant regions known as the clausius clapeyron cc equation lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 trenberth et al 2003 wang et al 2018 in these regions the cc equation claims that a 1 k increase in temperature will lead to a 7 increase in precipitation extremes in the ucprb basins the storm flood elasticities can be applied to extend the temperature storm relationship to a temperature flood relationship however since the temperature storm relationship in the ucprb is still not clear the relationship between extreme flood and temperature remains unknown which calls for further studies 5 3 uncertainties and limitations the uncertainties of this study may come from the input and fitting process of the gamlss models the uncertainties in input data mainly come from the interpolation of precipitation and the use of hydroclimatic datasets among which the uncertainties from interpolation can be reduced if data from more gauges are utilized we have 41 meteorological stations and 29 rain gauges used for the interpolation of precipitation and the observation network has become much denser compared to previous studies limjirakan and limsakul 2012 tebakari et al 2005 while more observations are still needed to further reduce the possible uncertainties in the concept of elasticity we neglect the antecedent precipitation conditions before the extracted storm flood events and the storm flood processes this could bring some uncertainties but will not affect the results quite much due to the following reasons one is that the largest daily runoff in a year always occurs when the soil moisture conditions are relatively wet the other is as suggested by yokoi et al 2007 the two rainfall peaks in thailand show different patterns and the second peak is characterized as short duration and high rainfall intensity making the largest flood event more likely to happen in the late wet season when the soil moisture conditions are relatively wet therefore the neglection of antecedent precipitation is plausible the uncertainties of the elasticity method may also come from the hypothesis that storm events and concomitant flood events are at the same return period the hypothesis here may be strict at the event scale but the comparison of the same quantiles can provide insights into the relationship between storms and floods as for the covariates we only took f tp and ntp into consideration in the study there may be other factors affecting the storm and flood peaks and the inclusion of the other climatic and land surface covariates may help gain deeper insights into the storm flood relationship which can be further explored by future studies 6 conclusion in this study a more generalized storm flood elasticity formula was derived and the ucprb was selected as a typical basin in the tropical monsoon region to analyze the storm flood relationship and its influencing factors according to the results the following conclusions have been reached 1 the distribution of storm and flood peaks in the ucprb can be better fitted using gamlss by discriminating tp and ntp in most basins except for two northwestern basins the p 1 basin and the p 4a basin in all basins storm and flood peaks are larger in high tp and high ntp conditions and flood peaks are larger in low f conditions 2 the values of the storm flood elasticity coefficients rely on the return period and the climatic and land surface covariates the values of storm flood elasticity coefficients tend to be smaller for long return period events than for short return period events under high tp high ntp and low f conditions and in humid regions than in arid regions 3 climatic covariates show larger impacts on the storm flood elasticity than land surface covariates in most basins except for n 1 basin in the n 1 basin where the impacts of forest cover change are the most important afforestation is proposed as an effective flood management approach in basins except for the p 1 station and the p 4a station tp has a greater impact on the storm flood relationship than ntp the findings can help provide a better understanding of storm flood relationships in tropical monsoon regions and the methods derived in this study can also be applied to other basins in future studies to examine the storm

2586,since the 1960s xi an china has suffered from severe ground subsidence due to groundwater extraction and continuous urban construction during the urbanization process ground subsidence has threatened and will continue to threaten the stability of the city s infrastructure additionally parts of xi an have recently experienced a period of rebound in this context we must monitor the spatial and long term evolution of deformation in xi an city first archived sar datasets from 1992 to the present including ers1 2 envisat asar terrasar x tsx also palsar 2 alos 2 and sentinel 1 s1 provided independent historical deformation data in xi an city different sar interferometry methods can obtain the deformation rates and deformation time series of the region second to fuse the deformation time series acquired by different sensors the quantile quantile adjustment qqa algorithm was used to generate the long term deformation time series from october 2003 to may 2021 which has a higher precision than when using the singular value decomposition svd method quantitatively the standard deviation std of the qqa method was only 22 mm at maximum considerably smaller than the 54 mm obtained with the svd method third ers1 2 was linked by the segmental interpolation method to obtain the 30 year deformation time series of xi an which showed that ground deformation in xi an from 1992 to 2021 has experienced a deceleration acceleration deceleration rebound process with a maximum cumulative subsidence of over 2 m finally land use type data and hydraulic head change data were also collected to analyze the deformation information at the same time the elastic and inelastic water storage coefficients of the aquifer were calculated by combining the long term deformation time series and groundwater head data the deformation mechanism of the aquifer was analyzed accordingly keywords insar xi an ground subsidence groundwater quantile quantile adjustment qqa method aquifer storage coefficient data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar is a new spatial geodesy technique based on sar phase information aimed at monitoring surface changes over the past 30 years this technology has been widely used in the reconstruction of historical ground subsidence qu et al 2014 wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 landslides chen et al 2021 earthquakes yu et al 2020 volcanoes lu and dzurisin 2010 lu et al 2010 and other geological disasters owing to its all day all weather high precision and large scale coverage massonnet and feigl 1998 over the past two decades many multi temporal insar algorithms have been developed that not only obtain highly accurate deformation time series but also overcome or weaken to the maximum extent possible the effects of incoherence orbital atmospheric and dem errors currently these multi temporal techniques mainly include persistent scatterers insar psinsar ferretti et al 2001 small baseline subset sbas insar berardino et al 2002 lanari et al 2004 temporally coherent point insar tcpinsar zhang et al 2011 interferometric point target analysis ipta werner et al 2003 and intermittent sbas isbas bateson et al 2015 these advanced time series techniques have facilitated ground subsidence monitoring in many urban areas one of which is xi an xi an is located in the wei river basin and is the capital of shaanxi province which is north of the qinling mountains and south of the loess plateau owing to its complex geological structure and frequent human activities a large number of natural disasters have frequently occurred in xi an recently peng et al 2007 since the 1960 s the population of xi an has increased considerably which has placed pressure on its limited water resources as a result groundwater has become a major water source for irrigation industry and residential needs according to available surveys xi an continued to increase the amount of groundwater extracted from 1970 to 1994 groundwater extraction in urban areas increased to 1 18 10 8 m3 a from 1970 to 1994 dong et al 2019 historical level measurements show that before 1996 the cumulative subsidence in xi an exceeding 100 mm was over 150 km2 in area with the maximum subsidence rate of 300 mm a and the maximum cumulative subsidence of 2 600 mm wan 2008 seven major subsidence zones have formed in the southern eastern and southeastern suburbs of xi an accompanied by 11 ground fissures in an east west ene direction fig 1 with the enactment of the groundwater restriction policy in 1996 and the completion of the heihe diversion project in 2000 the water supply system began to change to surface water based with the alleviation of ground subsidence however after 2000 four subsidence zones still existed in the southern southeastern and southwestern suburbs of xi an three new ground fissures were discovered between 2000 and 2001 suo et al 2005 as research on ground subsidence in xi an continues zhang et al 2009 examined the spatial and temporal evolution and mechanisms of ground subsidence and ground fracture activity from 1992 to 2006 using gps and insar observations zhao et al 2009a zhao et al 2009b investigated the evolution of ground subsidence from 1992 to 2007 using ers1 2 and envisat data finding that subsidence in xi an had slowed to 8 10 cm a in 2006 subsequently qu et al 2014 investigated the spatial and temporal evolution of ground subsidence and ground fractures from 2005 to 2012 using sar data in the l and x bands more recently peng et al 2019 used tsx alos 2 and s1 data to analyze the spatiotemporal deformation of xi an from 2012 to 2018 finding a maximum subsidence of 175 mm a at yuhuazhai yhz during this period wang et al 2019a used sequential insar to examine ground deformation in xi an where the subsidence in xi an began to rebound in october 2018 over the last few decades with the continued launch of sar satellites including ers 1 2 envisat asar tsx cosmo skymed sentinel 1a b alos 2 and radarsat 2 increasing numbers of sar images have been acquired by multiple platforms with different sensors these satellites operate at different wavelengths imaging modes and coverage periods such that it is important to develop new multi sensor sar data fusion methods and combine multiple sensors for long term deformation studies darvishi et al 2021 used ers1 2 envisat alos palsar and sentinel 1 sar data spanning more than 25 years to assess ground deformation around lake mead and its relationship to changes in the water level pepe et al 2016 combined sbas insar techniques and geotechnical models to obtain deformation time series for shanghai from 2007 to 2016 liu et al 2021 used the tikhonov regularization method to fuse c and l band sar observations to obtain three dimensional and long term landslide deformation time series of the gongjue landslide in tibet china wu et al 2020 used a developed subsidence model and an improved multi temporal insar technique to obtain a 20 year deformation time series of the hong kong international airport although some studies have measured the subsidence and rebound in xi an with techniques such as insar they each have only covered limited periods therefore in this study for the first time sar data ers1 2 envisat asar tsx and alos 2 s1 from the past 30 years were collected to analyze deformation changes in xi an all sar data were processed using the sbas and d insar methods to obtain deformation rates and time series within different periods then different deformation time series were connected with the quantile quantile adjustment qqa method for data with overlapping periods and using the linear interpolation method for data without overlapping periods finally results for the cumulative deformation and 30 year time series results were recovered for xi an land use type data and hydraulic head change data were also collected to analyze the deformation information hydrological storage properties characterize the capacity of an aquifer system to store and release groundwater normally these physical properties are determined by a combination of field sampling and laboratory tests on aquifer material samples which can be time consuming and effort intensive fetter 2018 moreover insar provides an alternative method for estimating the skeletal storage coefficients and storage loss in areas lacking detailed hydrogeological data and historical sedimentation measurements previous studies such as peng et al 2022 jiang et al 2018 bai et al 2022 and hoffmann 2003 have successfully estimated skeletal storage coefficients and storage loss in this study we calculate the elastic and inelastic water storage coefficients of the xi an aquifer by combining long term deformation time series and groundwater head data this study is organized as follows section ii presents the study area and data section iii presents the methods used including the sbas and qqa methods section iv presents the results for the 30 year evolution of deformation in xi an sections v and vi respectively provide a discussion and our conclusions 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area xi an is located north of the qinling mountains atop of the second and third terraces of the weihe alluvial plain owing to active tectonic faults especially the lintong chang an faults lt ca fault hereinafter 14 ground fissures have developed in xi an with an approximate northeast east direction where the longest fissure is over 14 km fig 1 under the influence of these ground fissures the ground subsidence area has developed as an oval shape with its long axis parallel to the direction of the fissures peng et al 2016 the altitude of the study area is between 360 m and 750 m and the climate is semi humid continental monsoon with four distinct seasons the annual precipitation is between 522 4 mm and 719 5 mm qu et al 2014 fig 1 shows a geological map of xi an china where tectonic faults and ground fissures are superimposed since the eocene thick cenozoic strata have been deposited in this area dominated by quaternary material and consisting mainly of wind formed loess water deposited gravel sand and clay peng et al 2016 wang et al 2019b the loess is over 100 m thick and water flows mainly at depths between 400 m and 1 000 m providing advantageous conditions for the transfer and storage of groundwater according to hydrogeological data the xi an aquifer contains the first artesian aquifer and second artesian aquifer ground subsidence is mainly caused by changes in the deep confined aquifer systems owing to the over exploitation of groundwater 2 2 data to reveal the deformation characteristics across xi an from 1992 to 2021 we used 296 sar images from 5 different sensors with different imaging geometries including 19 descending ers 1 2 images acquired from june 1992 to october 1998 7 for track 161 and 12 for track 390 56 descending envisat images acquired from october 2003 to october 2010 39 for track 161 and 17 for track 390 57 descending tsx images acquired from december 2009 to may 2015 9 ascending alos 2 images acquired from november 2014 to october 2017 and 164 ascending s1 images acquired from june 2015 to may 2021 39 for track 161 and 17 for track 390 fig 1 c shows the coverage of the different sar data table 1 and fig 2 present the basic parameters of five sar datasets external dem data provided by nasa from shuttle radar topography mission 1 srtm with a spatial resolution of 30 m were used to simulate and remove the topographic phases wright et al 2004 3 methodology this study focuses on long term ground deformation time series retrieval by connecting multi sensor sar deformation time series as shown in fig 3 the procedure included the following three main operational steps step 1 deformation information in the los direction was calculated with sbas insar or d insar techniques for the ers1 2 envisat tsx alos 2 and s1 datasets then assuming that the horizontal deformation in the xi an area was negligible the ground deformation in the los direction was directly converted to the vertical direction peng et al 2019 qu et al 2014 step 2 the time series of surface deformation were all geocoded into a common utm coordinate system subsequently the common area of all datasets was cropped and resampled finally all the results were examined to identify the common and well processed pixels with high coherence step 3 to generate the long term ground deformation time series we mainly used two techniques the first was to fuse the deformation time series with overlapping periods using the qqa method which corrects their statistical and systematic biases based on their difference in the cumulative distribution functions cdf the second is to link the deformation time series with missing sar data using the segmented linear interpolation method finally the results obtained from the two series were combined to obtain a 30 year deformation time series in xi an 3 1 sbas insar the sbas insar technique was proposed by berardino et al 2002 this technique can reduce decorrelation effects and retrieve deformation time series it is now widely used for monitoring long term surface deformation time series first differential interferograms are generated based on thresholds in the temporal and spatial baselines then a goldstein filter is used to improve the signal to noise ratio of the interferogram a minimum cost flow mcf algorithm is used to recover the true phase of the high coherent pixels the unwrapped phase of any pixel x r of the m th differential interferogram is expressed as follows 1 Œ¥ œà x r œà x r t b œà x r t a Œ¥ œà Œµ d e f x r Œ¥ œà Œµ x r Œ¥ œà Œ± x r Œ¥ œà n x r w h e r e t a and t b respectively represent the acquisition dates of the sar images corresponding to interferogram m Œ¥ œà Œµ d e f x r is the deformation phase component in the los between t a and t b Œ¥ œà Œµ x r is the topographic phase error Œ¥ œà a x r is the atmosphere phase error and Œ¥ œà n x r is the noise phase error the atmospheric errors related to elevation were removed by polynomial fitting finally the high coherence pixel deformation time series were obtained by the least squares or svd method to implement the combined multi sensor approach all deformation time series must be initially converted to the vertical direction therefore all synthetic aperture radar los measurements were projected into the vertical direction via the corresponding incidence angle as follows peng et al 2019 qu et al 2014 wang et al 2021 2 d vertical d los c o s Œ∏ where d vertical is the vertical deformation d los is the deformation in the los direction and Œ∏ is the incidence angle 3 2 qqa fusion of multi sensor insar time series six independent deformation time series were calculated with the sbas insar technique based on five sar datasets as shown in fig 4 the vertical deformation time series of the same ground point acquired by the envisat 161 envisat 390 tsx alos 2 and s1 sensors covering different sar acquisition periods traditionally assuming the deformation at the first sar acquisition date was zero thus for each common coherence point a constant offset bias exists between two independent deformation time series results denoted by Œº t i to generate long term deformation time series from multi sensor datasets the constant offset bias between two independent deformation time series results must be calculated the biases denoted by œï t i are a random signal with an unknown probability density function pdf resulting from any possible errors introduced during insar processing as follows bai et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 3 d v t i d sar t i Œº t i œï t i i 1 2 3 k where d v t i is the estimate of the adjusted unbiased true deformation time series d sar t i is the original vertical deformation time series before correction k represents the k th deformation time series a n d œï t i is one single realization of the random process therefore Œº t i and œï t i can be combined into Œ¥ t i for each common coherence point the following relation holds 4 d v t i d sar t i Œ¥ t i i 1 2 3 k the qqa technique was first improved by bai et al 2016 and later applied by zhao et al 2019 the mathematical framework of the problem is as follows

period 2004 2007 was calibrated to envisat 390 then the envisat 161 of the same time span was projected onto envisat 390 according to the cdf function of the overlap time fig 5 deliberately shows the pdfs with incorrect data values for the sake of visualization 3 years 2004 2007 3 3 estimation of skeletal storage coefficients and storage loss the aquifer system mainly consists of an aquifer and water barrier xu et al 2010 according to the effective stress principle the total stress œÉ t is equal to the sum of the pore stress p in the aquifer and the effective stress œÉ e in the water barrier i e œÉ t p œÉ e when groundwater is artificially extracted the water table of the aquifer decreases and if œÉ t is assumed constant p decreases and œÉ e increases causing compression of the inter granular skeleton of the aquifer and subsidence of the ground surface if œÉ e is less than the maximum historical effective stress œÉ e m a x then aquifer system compression is elastic and subsidence can be recovered when the aquifer is recharged and the water table rises p increases œÉ e decreases the inter granular skeleton of the aquifer expands and the aquifer system lifts elastically if groundwater is withdrawn from the aquifer system for a long period without adequate recharge then œÉ e continues to increase when œÉ e is greater than the maximum historical effective stress this results in a permanent reduction in pore volume compressing the aquifer and causing inelastic deformation of the aquifer thus resulting in permanent subsidence of the ground surface the different aquifer deformations are usually described as two different skeletal water storage coefficients 13 s k e Œ¥ b Œ¥ h œÉ e œÉ e m a x a n d s k i Œ¥ b Œ¥ h œÉ e œÉ e m a x where s k e denotes the aquifer elastic skeletal storage coefficient and s k i denotes the aquifer inelastic skeletal storage coefficient they reflect the changes in groundwater levels in the aquifer system as reflected by the aquifer and water barrier which are key hydrodynamic parameters affecting the unsteady flow of groundwater and are important for the assessment of groundwater resources galloway et al 1998 hoffmann et al 2001 here Œ¥ b represents the change in the thickness of the aquifer system which can be calculated from the insar time series deformation maps Œ¥ h indicates the change in the groundwater head which can be obtained by observing changes in the groundwater level insar measurements provide an estimate of the total volume change in the water in the aquifer system due to the decline in the

as estimated using eq 13 4 results 4 1 annual variation in deformation across xi an from 1992 to 2021 the deformation in xi an has expanded from the west third ring road to textile city to the east and from the south third ring road to xinjiamiao to the north in 2018 since the sporadic exploitation of pressurized water in xi an in the late 1960 s the total area is approximately 300 km2 dong et al 2019 the vertical deformation rates were calculated from the ers envisat tsx and s1 sar datasets from 1992 to 2021 the three deformation rate maps from 1992 to 1998 were obtained from ers1 2 sar data table 1 as shown in fig 6 a and b present the vertical deformation rates obtained by ers 390 c presents the vertical deformation rates obtained by ers 161 the eastern and southern suburbs were the most severe ground subsidence areas in the 1990 s the north western suburbs were stable at the same time the maximum average annual subsidence rate over three stages i e 1992 1993 1996 and 1998 exceeded 212 mm a the heihe water supply project has been completed since 2002 the water supply system of xi an has changed from predominantly groundwater to predominantly surface water the groundwater level of the city has begun to recover while improving the ground subsidence fig 6 d r shows the change in the vertical deformation rates in xi an from 2003 to 2021 including deformation rates from 2003 to 2010 calculated from envisat 161 from 2010 to 2015 calculated with tsx data and from 2016 to 2021 calculated with s1 data the overall subsidence has decreased considerably since 2003 and the area of subsidence has also decreased from the eastern and southern suburbs in the 1990 s the main areas of subsidence have become the current south western and south eastern suburbs the maximum deformation rate at the center of subsidence has reduced from over 20 cm a to 8 cm a however owing to the rapid expansion of the city and the existence of some urban villages that still have their own wells for pumping deep groundwater the subsidence areas mainly occur in yhz beishanmen bsm and fengqiyuan dengjiapo fqy djp the subsidence rate accelerated from 2003 to 2014 especially in the yhz area reaching a maximum of 191 mm a in 2014 since 2015 ground subsidence has decreased in most parts of xi an by 2018 ground deformation had gradually stopped and rebounded with the promotion of urban renewal projects and the implementation of the artificial water injection strategy which will result in no deep aquifer water extraction by 2021 the maximum uplift will reach 159 mm a to validate the insar results a calibration of the insar derived deformation results was performed with gps measurements fig 1 a shows the locations of the gps benchmarks fig 7 shows comparisons with the gps measurements in 2009 2012 2014 and 2015 insar measurements from tsx datasets at each gps benchmark were calculated within a square of 50 m 50 m the std of the differences were 10 11 9 57 6 68 and 9 25 mm in 2009 2012 2014 and 2015 respectively additionally significant differences between the insar and gps measurements could be observed at some gps benchmarks such as xja1 in 2009 xj04 xj10 and xja1 in 2012 xj10 xj12 and xj19 in 2014 and xj04 xj06 xj25 and xja3 in 2015 these can be explained by the localized deformation horizontal deformation effect and low gps vertical accuracy under a poor measurement environment 4 2 fusion of multi sensor insar deformation time series in this study the interference pairs were obtained by setting short temporal and spatial baseline thresholds as shown in fig 3 next the sbas method was adopted to calculate the corresponding deformation time series based on the obtained combination of interference pairs thus through the envisat tsx alos 2 and s1 data seven deformation time series datasets were obtained from 2003 to 2021 as there was a data gap between the last tsx acquisition april 03 2010 and the first tsx acquisition october 5 2011 the two segments of the time series were joined using the average deformation rate from december 03 2009 to december 29 2012 to explore the temporal and spatial evolution of the deformation in xi an from 2003 to 2021 we combined sar data from five different sensors the temporal cross mission biases were estimated and removed using the qqa method in this process the envisat 161 dataset was used as the reference base and the remaining six datasets were adjusted to the envisat 161 reference base in chronological order the svd method was also used to obtain deformation time series from 2003 to 2021 for comparison with the qqa method fig 8 a presents the vertical cumulative deformation of the main xi an area from october 13 2003 to may 19 2021 based on the qqa method fig 8 b shows the vertical cumulative deformation of the main xi an area from october 13 2003 to may 19 2021 based on the svd method from 2003 to 2021 areas with severe deformation in xi an area were mainly distributed in the yhz bsm and fqy djp the largest subsidence of the yhz was greater than 1 2 m to analyze the accuracy of the deformation time series the std of the deformation time series was estimated for different sensors at overlapping periods as shown in fig 8 c d specifically two time points start and end were selected for each overlapping period for a total of 10 time points to calculate the std fig 8 c shows the std calculated by the qqa method fig 8 d shows the std calculated by the svd method as different sar sensor bands have different sensitivities to deformation their measurement accuracy varies among the results obtained the std obtained by the qqa method was less than 22 mm while the std obtained by the svd method was less than 54 mm the cross validation results for the deformation time series obtained from different sensors showed that the deformation time series estimated by the qqa method was more reliable fig 9 shows the cumulative deformation time series obtained with both methods from october 13 2003 to may 19 2021 both methods performed well when adjusting for cross task sensor bias the qqa method calculated time series with less fluctuation consistent with the std results moreover the overall trend in the time series obtained by the two methods was consistent fig 9 also shows the distribution of four typical points in the different deformation zones of xi an which shows that different spatial and temporal evolution characteristics exist in different regions of xi an p1 is located in yhz which experienced the severest ground subsidence in the study area from 2003 until water injection in 2018 with on going artificial water injection there was a rapid rebound since october 2018 this can be interpreted as immediate elastic recovery deformation zhang et al 2015 at present the rebound has largely ceased and plateaued p2 is located in the bsm and began to rapidly uplift in 2021 after a long period of sustained ground subsidence this phenomenon was similar to the yhz mentioned above p3 is located in fqy and has plateaued from a long period of subsidence until 2017 p4 is located in djp which has experienced a long period of slow subsidence and has recently rebounded long term deformation time series for the entire xi an area from 1992 to 2021 were obtained by segmented linear interpolation yielding the subsidence time series for the xi an area from 1992 to 2004 subsequently the results obtained from the qqa were summed to obtain the cumulative subsidence in the xi an area from 1992 to 2021 as shown in fig 10 specifically six interferometric pairs obtained using the two ers tracks were linearly interpolated from 1992 to 1996 three interferometric pairs obtained from two ers tracks were linearly interpolated from 1996 to 1998 similarly from 1998 to 2004 linear interpolation was performed using one interferometric pair from ers 161 and 10 interferometric pairs from two envisat orbits based on fig 10 the eastern and southern suburbs of xi an have experienced severe ground subsidence during the 30 year period with a maximum cumulative subsidence in the southern suburbs of over 2 m since the 1990 s the area around yhz and fqy djp has experienced cultivation the lower coherence results resulted in an inability to obtain a complete deformation field in these areas fig 11 shows the cumulative deformation time series for four points from august 1992 to may 2021 the time series shows that the most severe ground deformation in xi an over the last 30 years occurred in the 1990 s during this period groundwater extraction in the urban area of xi an increased to 118 million m3 a with a maximum decline in groundwater of 100 m the results in fig 6 also show that the maximum ground subsidence in the 1990 s exceeded 20 cm a ground deformation in the urban area continued to ease and rebound until the enactment of the groundwater restriction policy in 1996 the completion of the black river water supply hub in 2002 and the start of the artificial water injection project in 2018 5 discussion 5 1 correlation between urban development and ground subsidence ground subsidence is a slow time dependent subsidence process that may respond slowly and according to urban development to explore the relationship between surface deformation and urban development in xi an land use type data from 1995 to 2018 were collected from the resource and environmental science and data centre of the chinese academy of sciences https www resdc cn data aspx with a resolution of 1 km 1 km as shown in fig 12 according to tables 2 and 3 the proportion of construction land increased by 32 i e from 35 in 1995 to 67 in 2018 whereas the proportion of cropland decreased by 26 in only the deformation area the proportion of construction land increased by 59 the population increased from 6 179 500 to 10 203 500 from 1992 to 2019 according to census data population growth and the need for infrastructure construction have led to the continuous exploitation of groundwater from 1992 onwards resulting in severe ground subsidence based on the ground subsidence rate maps in fig 6 there was also an acceleration in ground subsidence in xi an from 2000 to 2018 solari et al 2016 found that the building load is a factor that promotes a high displacement rate the large scale construction of buildings aggravates the rate of land subsidence and the overexploitation of groundwater the increase in the proportion of construction land in the deformation areas has been a secondary factor in the intensification of ground subsidence during large scale groundwater extraction 5 2 correlation between groundwater extraction and ground subsidence ground subsidence is a regional slow change geohazard mainly caused by the irrational exploitation of groundwater which is costly and difficult to manage with city expansion and the construction of water supply projects groundwater extraction in the main city of xi an has evolved the history of groundwater exploitation can be divided into five stages dong et al 2019 in the first stage before 1970 water used in the urban area of xi an was mainly scooped and scattered groundwater extraction the groundwater system was in a natural equilibrium with an extraction volume of less than 30 million m3 a in the second stage 1970 1995 with city expansion the groundwater extraction volume increased rapidly and the urban groundwater extraction volume increased to 118 million m3 a in the third stage 1996 2002 the government began to control groundwater exploitation in the main urban area and built a water supply system outside the city using surface water and river water as sources the amount of groundwater extraction in the central city gradually decreased to 30 million m3 a in the fourth stage 2002 2017 projects such as the heihe water supply hub were built and the groundwater based water supply system was converted to surface water which substantially alleviated the imbalance in the groundwater level throughout the city in the fifth stage since 2018 there has been no extraction of deep pressurized water in the city and a water injection strategy has been adopted fig 13 shows the confined water contour maps for 1960 1977 1983 1995 2004 2008 2011 2014 and 2017 where in fig 13 d the superimposed water contour was in 1995 and the others correspond to the deformation rate of that year before the late 1960 s the natural flow field of closed water in the xi an area was runoff from the south to the north with a hydraulic gradient of 2 to 3 and a water table burial depth of 10 30 m at the end of the 1970 s confined water was exploited in large quantities forming three funnels the water level decreased by 30 40 m several funnel centers expanded further from 1983 to 1995 and the entire city of xi an became one large funnel with pressurized water in the center of the funnel decreasing by over 100 m this is largely consistent with the center of subsidence in the 1990 s the groundwater level in the city began to rise gradually after 1996 following the gradual closure of the wells in the city in 2004 the level had risen by approximately 20 m new funnel centers were formed in 2008 at qujiang tv tower and the western high tech zone at the same time the subsidence center transferred to the yhz bsm and fqy djp the groundwater level returned to the 1980 s level until 2011 however groundwater levels in the yhz have continued to decrease with a maximum of 80 m of pressurized water by 2017 with the over exploitation of groundwater the maximum subsidence rate in the yhz area exceeded 100 mm a from 2011 to 2017 particularly the maximum subsidence rate reached 190 mm a in 2014 meanwhile fig 14 shows the relationship between the vertical deformation time series and groundwater changes at two typical points p1 and p3 the results showed that the trend in the insar time series is in accordance with that of the groundwater level producing a strong positive correlation between the subsidence and groundwater level 5 3 aquifer parameter inversion hydraulic head data for 1960 to 1995 and 2008 to 2017 were obtained via inverse distance interpolation and difference making as shown in fig 15 a d at the same time the cumulative ground deformation from december 2008 to december 2017 was extracted based on the qqa results deformation rates in the 1990 s were obtained from two orbits of the ers1 2 sar data as groundwater extraction in xi an was in its second phase from 1983 to 1995 the average annual change in the hydraulic head in the 1990 s was calculated using the head change from that phase finally the skeletal water storage coefficient of the xi an area was calculated according to eq 13 the results are shown in fig 15 b f we used insar derived deformation observations to estimate the spatiotemporal groundwater storage gws variations in xi an from 1960 to 1995 as shown in fig 15 c the estimated gws was 9 11 10 8 m3 2 6 10 7 m3 a from 1960 to 1995 compared to an average of approximately 7 5 107 m3 a from 1970 to 1995 dong et al 2019 the estimated groundwater loss during the observation period was underestimated this could likely be explained by the following reasons 1 dong et al 2019 estimated the gws across a wider range whereas we only calculated the gws underlying the area covered by the known changes in the groundwater level 2 dong et al 2019 investigated the gws of the entire aquifer system including the upper unconfined aquifer whereas the contribution of the gws derived from insar was from confined aquifers and aquitards 3 the gws calculated from insar measurements included groundwater recharge but that reported in dong et al 2019 did not include this galloway et al 1998 stated that a value of s k e of approximately 0 0005 is typical of the elastic skeletal water storage coefficient whereas a value of approximately 0 005 is likely the inelastic skeletal water storage coefficient during surface subsidence hoffmann 2003 noted that the value of s k i in aquifers dominated by loose clay and silt is usually tens to hundreds of times higher than that of s k e combining their results with the values in fig 15 b f we obtained a maximum value for s k i of 0 127 and 0 147 for xi an from 1992 to 1998 and 2008 to 2017 respectively which are approximately 254 and 294 fold higher respectively than the typical elastic skeletal water storage coefficient s k e the relationship between the insar vertical deformation and groundwater level change is generally consistent with the results of other studies in southern california los angeles and other areas in the usa for example king et al 2007 used gps data and groundwater level change relationships in the san gabriel basin to derive s k e values of 0 0029 and 0 0016 from january 2005 to may 2005 and june 1998 to january 2005 respectively concluding that the aquifer may have experienced inelastic deformation based on the psinsar technique bell et al 2008 used ers and envisat data from 1992 to 2005 to obtain inelastic storage coefficients ranging from 0 009 to 0 025 and elastic storage coefficients ranging from 0 002 to 0 0037 for the las vegas area xu et al 2012 used sbas insar gps data and groundwater level data to estimate inelastic storage coefficients ranging from 0 004 to 0 09 in los angeles concluding that inelastic deformation of the aquifer may have occurred combining fig 15 b f with existing research results we can conclude that inelastic deformation may have occurred in xi an in yhz bsm and fqy from 2008 to 2017 as well as in the eastern and southern suburbs from 1992 to 1998 6 conclusions ers1 2 envisat tsx alos 2 and s1 sar images acquired from 1992 to 2021 were used to reveal the temporal and spatial characteristics of ground subsidence in xi an over the last 30 years the qqa method was used to link the deformation time series with the common sar acquisition period linear interpolation was applied to combine insar results without the common sar acquisition period accordingly the long term deformation time series of xi an from 1992 to 2021 were obtained the results showed that maximum regional ground subsidence of more than 2 m occurred in xi an over the last 30 years with different deformation characteristics in different areas at the same time the development of ground deformation in xi an has been closely related to the over exploitation of groundwater and the rapid development of urban areas according to the distribution of s k we can speculate that inelastic ground deformation may have occurred in the yhz bsm and fqy areas from 2007 to 2018 as well as in the eastern and southern suburbs from 1992 to 1998 furthermore the high spatial resolution aquifer storage coefficients and compression time constants were estimated using regional groundwater flow models and groundwater level changes combined with the results of long deformation time series this study can directly assist in ground subsidence mitigation and water management decision making credit authorship contribution statement guangrong li conceptualization

2586,since the 1960s xi an china has suffered from severe ground subsidence due to groundwater extraction and continuous urban construction during the urbanization process ground subsidence has threatened and will continue to threaten the stability of the city s infrastructure additionally parts of xi an have recently experienced a period of rebound in this context we must monitor the spatial and long term evolution of deformation in xi an city first archived sar datasets from 1992 to the present including ers1 2 envisat asar terrasar x tsx also palsar 2 alos 2 and sentinel 1 s1 provided independent historical deformation data in xi an city different sar interferometry methods can obtain the deformation rates and deformation time series of the region second to fuse the deformation time series acquired by different sensors the quantile quantile adjustment qqa algorithm was used to generate the long term deformation time series from october 2003 to may 2021 which has a higher precision than when using the singular value decomposition svd method quantitatively the standard deviation std of the qqa method was only 22 mm at maximum considerably smaller than the 54 mm obtained with the svd method third ers1 2 was linked by the segmental interpolation method to obtain the 30 year deformation time series of xi an which showed that ground deformation in xi an from 1992 to 2021 has experienced a deceleration acceleration deceleration rebound process with a maximum cumulative subsidence of over 2 m finally land use type data and hydraulic head change data were also collected to analyze the deformation information at the same time the elastic and inelastic water storage coefficients of the aquifer were calculated by combining the long term deformation time series and groundwater head data the deformation mechanism of the aquifer was analyzed accordingly keywords insar xi an ground subsidence groundwater quantile quantile adjustment qqa method aquifer storage coefficient data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar is a new spatial geodesy technique based on sar phase information aimed at monitoring surface changes over the past 30 years this technology has been widely used in the reconstruction of historical ground subsidence qu et al 2014 wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 landslides chen et al 2021 earthquakes yu et al 2020 volcanoes lu and dzurisin 2010 lu et al 2010 and other geological disasters owing to its all day all weather high precision and large scale coverage massonnet and feigl 1998 over the past two decades many multi temporal insar algorithms have been developed that not only obtain highly accurate deformation time series but also overcome or weaken to the maximum extent possible the effects of incoherence orbital atmospheric and dem errors currently these multi temporal techniques mainly include persistent scatterers insar psinsar ferretti et al 2001 small baseline subset sbas insar berardino et al 2002 lanari et al 2004 temporally coherent point insar tcpinsar zhang et al 2011 interferometric point target analysis ipta werner et al 2003 and intermittent sbas isbas bateson et al 2015 these advanced time series techniques have facilitated ground subsidence monitoring in many urban areas one of which is xi an xi an is located in the wei river basin and is the capital of shaanxi province which is north of the qinling mountains and south of the loess plateau owing to its complex geological structure and frequent human activities a large number of natural disasters have frequently occurred in xi an recently peng et al 2007 since the 1960 s the population of xi an has increased considerably which has placed pressure on its limited water resources as a result groundwater has become a major water source for irrigation industry and residential needs according to available surveys xi an continued to increase the amount of groundwater extracted from 1970 to 1994 groundwater extraction in urban areas increased to 1 18 10 8 m3 a from 1970 to 1994 dong et al 2019 historical level measurements show that before 1996 the cumulative subsidence in xi an exceeding 100 mm was over 150 km2 in area with the maximum subsidence rate of 300 mm a and the maximum cumulative subsidence of 2 600 mm wan 2008 seven major subsidence zones have formed in the southern eastern and southeastern suburbs of xi an accompanied by 11 ground fissures in an east west ene direction fig 1 with the enactment of the groundwater restriction policy in 1996 and the completion of the heihe diversion project in 2000 the water supply system began to change to surface water based with the alleviation of ground subsidence however after 2000 four subsidence zones still existed in the southern southeastern and southwestern suburbs of xi an three new ground fissures were discovered between 2000 and 2001 suo et al 2005 as research on ground subsidence in xi an continues zhang et al 2009 examined the spatial and temporal evolution and mechanisms of ground subsidence and ground fracture activity from 1992 to 2006 using gps and insar observations zhao et al 2009a zhao et al 2009b investigated the evolution of ground subsidence from 1992 to 2007 using ers1 2 and envisat data finding that subsidence in xi an had slowed to 8 10 cm a in 2006 subsequently qu et al 2014 investigated the spatial and temporal evolution of ground subsidence and ground fractures from 2005 to 2012 using sar data in the l and x bands more recently peng et al 2019 used tsx alos 2 and s1 data to analyze the spatiotemporal deformation of xi an from 2012 to 2018 finding a maximum subsidence of 175 mm a at yuhuazhai yhz during this period wang et al 2019a used sequential insar to examine ground deformation in xi an where the subsidence in xi an began to rebound in october 2018 over the last few decades with the continued launch of sar satellites including ers 1 2 envisat asar tsx cosmo skymed sentinel 1a b alos 2 and radarsat 2 increasing numbers of sar images have been acquired by multiple platforms with different sensors these satellites operate at different wavelengths imaging modes and coverage periods such that it is important to develop new multi sensor sar data fusion methods and combine multiple sensors for long term deformation studies darvishi et al 2021 used ers1 2 envisat alos palsar and sentinel 1 sar data spanning more than 25 years to assess ground deformation around lake mead and its relationship to changes in the water level pepe et al 2016 combined sbas insar techniques and geotechnical models to obtain deformation time series for shanghai from 2007 to 2016 liu et al 2021 used the tikhonov regularization method to fuse c and l band sar observations to obtain three dimensional and long term landslide deformation time series of the gongjue landslide in tibet china wu et al 2020 used a developed subsidence model and an improved multi temporal insar technique to obtain a 20 year deformation time series of the hong kong international airport although some studies have measured the subsidence and rebound in xi an with techniques such as insar they each have only covered limited periods therefore in this study for the first time sar data ers1 2 envisat asar tsx and alos 2 s1 from the past 30 years were collected to analyze deformation changes in xi an all sar data were processed using the sbas and d insar methods to obtain deformation rates and time series within different periods then different deformation time series were connected with the quantile quantile adjustment qqa method for data with overlapping periods and using the linear interpolation method for data without overlapping periods finally results for the cumulative deformation and 30 year time series results were recovered for xi an land use type data and hydraulic head change data were also collected to analyze the deformation information hydrological storage properties characterize the capacity of an aquifer system to store and release groundwater normally these physical properties are determined by a combination of field sampling and laboratory tests on aquifer material samples which can be time consuming and effort intensive fetter 2018 moreover insar provides an alternative method for estimating the skeletal storage coefficients and storage loss in areas lacking detailed hydrogeological data and historical sedimentation measurements previous studies such as peng et al 2022 jiang et al 2018 bai et al 2022 and hoffmann 2003 have successfully estimated skeletal storage coefficients and storage loss in this study we calculate the elastic and inelastic water storage coefficients of the xi an aquifer by combining long term deformation time series and groundwater head data this study is organized as follows section ii presents the study area and data section iii presents the methods used including the sbas and qqa methods section iv presents the results for the 30 year evolution of deformation in xi an sections v and vi respectively provide a discussion and our conclusions 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area xi an is located north of the qinling mountains atop of the second and third terraces of the weihe alluvial plain owing to active tectonic faults especially the lintong chang an faults lt ca fault hereinafter 14 ground fissures have developed in xi an with an approximate northeast east direction where the longest fissure is over 14 km fig 1 under the influence of these ground fissures the ground subsidence area has developed as an oval shape with its long axis parallel to the direction of the fissures peng et al 2016 the altitude of the study area is between 360 m and 750 m and the climate is semi humid continental monsoon with four distinct seasons the annual precipitation is between 522 4 mm and 719 5 mm qu et al 2014 fig 1 shows a geological map of xi an china where tectonic faults and ground fissures are superimposed since the eocene thick cenozoic strata have been deposited in this area dominated by quaternary material and consisting mainly of wind formed loess water deposited gravel sand and clay peng et al 2016 wang et al 2019b the loess is over 100 m thick and water flows mainly at depths between 400 m and 1 000 m providing advantageous conditions for the transfer and storage of groundwater according to hydrogeological data the xi an aquifer contains the first artesian aquifer and second artesian aquifer ground subsidence is mainly caused by changes in the deep confined aquifer systems owing to the over exploitation of groundwater 2 2 data to reveal the deformation characteristics across xi an from 1992 to 2021 we used 296 sar images from 5 different sensors with different imaging geometries including 19 descending ers 1 2 images acquired from june 1992 to october 1998 7 for track 161 and 12 for track 390 56 descending envisat images acquired from october 2003 to october 2010 39 for track 161 and 17 for track 390 57 descending tsx images acquired from december 2009 to may 2015 9 ascending alos 2 images acquired from november 2014 to october 2017 and 164 ascending s1 images acquired from june 2015 to may 2021 39 for track 161 and 17 for track 390 fig 1 c shows the coverage of the different sar data table 1 and fig 2 present the basic parameters of five sar datasets external dem data provided by nasa from shuttle radar topography mission 1 srtm with a spatial resolution of 30 m were used to simulate and remove the topographic phases wright et al 2004 3 methodology this study focuses on long term ground deformation time series retrieval by connecting multi sensor sar deformation time series as shown in fig 3 the procedure included the following three main operational steps step 1 deformation information in the los direction was calculated with sbas insar or d insar techniques for the ers1 2 envisat tsx alos 2 and s1 datasets then assuming that the horizontal deformation in the xi an area was negligible the ground deformation in the los direction was directly converted to the vertical direction peng et al 2019 qu et al 2014 step 2 the time series of surface deformation were all geocoded into a common utm coordinate system subsequently the common area of all datasets was cropped and resampled finally all the results were examined to identify the common and well processed pixels with high coherence step 3 to generate the long term ground deformation time series we mainly used two techniques the first was to fuse the deformation time series with overlapping periods using the qqa method which corrects their statistical and systematic biases based on their difference in the cumulative distribution functions cdf the second is to link the deformation time series with missing sar data using the segmented linear interpolation method finally the results obtained from the two series were combined to obtain a 30 year deformation time series in xi an 3 1 sbas insar the sbas insar technique was proposed by berardino et al 2002 this technique can reduce decorrelation effects and retrieve deformation time series it is now widely used for monitoring long term surface deformation time series first differential interferograms are generated based on thresholds in the temporal and spatial baselines then a goldstein filter is used to improve the signal to noise ratio of the interferogram a minimum cost flow mcf algorithm is used to recover the true phase of the high coherent pixels the unwrapped phase of any pixel x r of the m th differential interferogram is expressed as follows 1 Œ¥ œà x r œà x r t b œà x r t a Œ¥ œà Œµ d e f x r Œ¥ œà Œµ x r Œ¥ œà Œ± x r Œ¥ œà n x r w h e r e t a and t b respectively represent the acquisition dates of the sar images corresponding to interferogram m Œ¥ œà Œµ d e f x r is the deformation phase component in the los between t a and t b Œ¥ œà Œµ x r is the topographic phase error Œ¥ œà a x r is the atmosphere phase error and Œ¥ œà n x r is the noise phase error the atmospheric errors related to elevation were removed by polynomial fitting finally the high coherence pixel deformation time series were obtained by the least squares or svd method to implement the combined multi sensor approach all deformation time series must be initially converted to the vertical direction therefore all synthetic aperture radar los measurements were projected into the vertical direction via the corresponding incidence angle as follows peng et al 2019 qu et al 2014 wang et al 2021 2 d vertical d los c o s Œ∏ where d vertical is the vertical deformation d los is the deformation in the los direction and Œ∏ is the incidence angle 3 2 qqa fusion of multi sensor insar time series six independent deformation time series were calculated with the sbas insar technique based on five sar datasets as shown in fig 4 the vertical deformation time series of the same ground point acquired by the envisat 161 envisat 390 tsx alos 2 and s1 sensors covering different sar acquisition periods traditionally assuming the deformation at the first sar acquisition date was zero thus for each common coherence point a constant offset bias exists between two independent deformation time series results denoted by Œº t i to generate long term deformation time series from multi sensor datasets the constant offset bias between two independent deformation time series results must be calculated the biases denoted by œï t i are a random signal with an unknown probability density function pdf resulting from any possible errors introduced during insar processing as follows bai et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 3 d v t i d sar t i

the k th deformation time series a n d œï t i is one single realization of the random process therefore Œº t i and œï t i can be combined into Œ¥ t i for each common coherence point the following relation holds 4 d v t i d sar t i Œ¥ t i i 1 2 3 k the qqa technique was first improved by bai et al 2016 and later applied by zhao et al 2019 the mathematical framework of the problem is as follows

pdfs with incorrect data values for the sake of visualization 3 years 2004 2007 3 3 estimation of skeletal storage coefficients and storage loss the aquifer system mainly consists of an aquifer and water barrier xu et al 2010 according to the effective stress principle the total stress œÉ t is equal to the sum of the pore stress p in the aquifer and the effective stress œÉ e in the water barrier i e œÉ t p œÉ e when groundwater is artificially extracted the water table of the aquifer decreases and if œÉ t is assumed constant p decreases and œÉ e increases causing compression of the inter granular skeleton of the aquifer and subsidence of the ground surface if œÉ e is less than the maximum historical effective stress œÉ e m a x then aquifer system compression is elastic and subsidence can be recovered when the aquifer is recharged and the water table rises p increases œÉ e decreases the inter granular skeleton of the aquifer expands and the aquifer system lifts elastically if groundwater is withdrawn from the aquifer system for a long period without adequate recharge then œÉ e continues to increase when œÉ e is greater than the maximum historical effective stress this results in a permanent reduction in pore volume compressing the aquifer and causing inelastic deformation of the aquifer thus resulting in permanent subsidence of the ground surface the different aquifer deformations are usually described as two different skeletal water storage coefficients 13 s k e Œ¥ b Œ¥ h œÉ e œÉ e m a x a n d s k i Œ¥ b Œ¥ h œÉ e œÉ e m a x where s k e denotes the aquifer elastic skeletal storage coefficient and s k i denotes the aquifer inelastic skeletal storage coefficient they reflect the changes in groundwater levels in the aquifer system as reflected by the aquifer and water barrier which are key hydrodynamic parameters affecting the unsteady flow of groundwater and are important for the assessment of groundwater resources galloway et al 1998 hoffmann et al 2001 here Œ¥ b represents the change in the thickness of the aquifer system which can be calculated from the insar time series deformation maps Œ¥ h indicates the change in the groundwater head

as estimated using eq 13 4 results 4 1 annual variation in deformation across xi an from 1992 to 2021 the deformation in xi an has expanded from the west third ring road to textile city to the east and from the south third ring road to xinjiamiao to the north in 2018 since the sporadic exploitation of pressurized water in xi an in the late 1960 s the total area is approximately 300 km2 dong et al 2019 the vertical deformation rates were calculated from the ers envisat tsx and s1 sar datasets from 1992 to 2021 the three deformation rate maps from 1992 to 1998 were obtained from ers1 2 sar data table 1 as shown in fig 6 a and b present the vertical deformation rates obtained by ers 390 c presents the vertical deformation rates obtained by ers 161 the eastern and southern suburbs were the most severe ground subsidence areas in the 1990 s the north western suburbs were stable at the same time the maximum average annual subsidence rate over three stages i e 1992 1993 1996 and 1998 exceeded 212 mm a the heihe water supply project has been completed since 2002 the water supply system of xi an has changed from predominantly groundwater to predominantly surface water the groundwater level of the city has begun to recover while improving the ground subsidence fig 6 d r shows the change in the vertical deformation rates in xi an from 2003 to 2021 including deformation rates from 2003 to 2010 calculated from envisat 161 from 2010 to 2015 calculated with tsx data and from 2016 to 2021 calculated with s1 data the overall subsidence has decreased considerably since 2003 and the area of subsidence has also decreased from the eastern and southern suburbs in the 1990 s the main areas of subsidence have become the current south western and south eastern suburbs the maximum deformation rate at the center of subsidence has reduced from over 20 cm a to 8 cm a however owing to the rapid expansion of the city and the existence of some urban villages that still have their own wells for pumping deep groundwater the subsidence areas mainly occur in yhz beishanmen bsm and fengqiyuan dengjiapo fqy djp the subsidence rate accelerated from 2003 to 2014 especially in the yhz area reaching a maximum of 191 mm a in 2014 since 2015 ground subsidence has decreased in most parts of xi an by 2018 ground deformation had gradually stopped and rebounded with the promotion of urban renewal projects and the implementation of the artificial water injection strategy which will result in no deep aquifer water extraction by 2021 the maximum uplift will reach 159 mm a to validate the insar results a calibration of the insar derived deformation results was performed with gps measurements fig 1 a shows the locations of the gps benchmarks fig 7 shows comparisons with the gps measurements in 2009 2012 2014 and 2015 insar measurements from tsx datasets at each gps benchmark were calculated within a square of 50 m 50 m the std of the differences were 10 11 9 57 6 68 and 9 25 mm in 2009 2012 2014 and 2015 respectively additionally significant differences between the insar and gps measurements could be observed at some gps benchmarks such as xja1 in 2009 xj04 xj10 and xja1 in 2012 xj10 xj12 and xj19 in 2014 and xj04 xj06 xj25 and xja3 in 2015 these can be explained by the localized deformation horizontal deformation effect and low gps vertical accuracy under a poor measurement environment 4 2 fusion of multi sensor insar deformation time series in this study the interference pairs were obtained by setting short temporal and spatial baseline thresholds as shown in fig 3 next the sbas method was adopted to calculate the corresponding deformation time series based on the obtained combination of interference pairs thus through the envisat tsx alos 2 and s1 data seven deformation time series datasets were obtained from 2003 to 2021 as there was a data gap between the last tsx acquisition april 03 2010 and the first tsx acquisition october 5 2011 the two segments of the time series were joined using the average deformation rate from december 03 2009 to december 29 2012 to explore the temporal and spatial evolution of the deformation in xi an from 2003 to 2021 we combined sar data from five different sensors the temporal cross mission biases were estimated and removed using the qqa method in this process the envisat 161 dataset was used as the reference base and the remaining six datasets were adjusted to the envisat 161 reference base in chronological order the svd method was also used to obtain deformation time series from 2003 to 2021 for comparison with the qqa method fig 8 a presents the vertical cumulative deformation of the main xi an area from october 13 2003 to may 19 2021 based on the qqa method fig 8 b shows the vertical cumulative deformation of the main xi an area from october 13 2003 to may 19 2021 based on the svd method from 2003 to 2021 areas with severe deformation in xi an area were mainly distributed in the yhz bsm and fqy djp the largest subsidence of the yhz was greater than 1 2 m to analyze the accuracy of the deformation time series the std of the deformation time series was estimated for different sensors at overlapping periods as shown in fig 8 c d specifically two time points start and end were selected for each overlapping period for a total of 10 time points to calculate the std fig 8 c shows the std calculated by the qqa method fig 8 d shows the std calculated by the svd method as different sar sensor bands have different sensitivities to deformation their measurement accuracy varies among the results obtained the std obtained by the qqa method was less than 22 mm while the std obtained by the svd method was less than 54 mm the cross validation results for the deformation time series obtained from different sensors showed that the deformation time series estimated by the qqa method was more reliable fig 9 shows the cumulative deformation time series obtained with both methods from october 13 2003 to may 19 2021 both methods performed well when adjusting for cross task sensor bias the qqa method calculated time series with less fluctuation consistent with the std results moreover the overall trend in the time series obtained by the two methods was consistent fig 9 also shows the distribution of four typical points in the different deformation zones of xi an which shows that different spatial and temporal evolution characteristics exist in different regions of xi an p1 is located in yhz which experienced the severest ground subsidence in the study area from 2003 until water injection in 2018 with on going artificial water injection there was a rapid rebound since october 2018 this can be interpreted as immediate elastic recovery deformation zhang et al 2015 at present the rebound has largely ceased and plateaued p2 is located in the bsm and began to rapidly uplift in 2021 after a long period of sustained ground subsidence this phenomenon was similar to the yhz mentioned above p3 is located in fqy and has plateaued from a long period of subsidence until 2017 p4 is located in djp which has experienced a long period of slow subsidence and has recently rebounded long term deformation time series for the entire xi an area from 1992 to 2021 were obtained by segmented linear interpolation yielding the subsidence time series for the xi an area from 1992 to 2004 subsequently the results obtained from the qqa were summed to obtain the cumulative subsidence in the xi an area from 1992 to 2021 as shown in fig 10 specifically six interferometric pairs obtained using the two ers tracks were linearly interpolated from 1992 to 1996 three interferometric pairs obtained from two ers tracks were linearly interpolated from 1996 to 1998 similarly from 1998 to 2004 linear interpolation was performed using one interferometric pair from ers 161 and 10 interferometric pairs from two envisat orbits based on fig 10 the eastern and southern suburbs of xi an have experienced severe ground subsidence during the 30 year period with a maximum cumulative subsidence in the southern suburbs of over 2 m since the 1990 s the area around yhz and fqy djp has experienced cultivation the lower coherence results resulted in an inability to obtain a complete deformation field in these areas fig 11 shows the cumulative deformation time series for four points from august 1992 to may 2021 the time series shows that the most severe ground deformation in xi an over the last 30 years occurred in the 1990 s during this period groundwater extraction in the urban area of xi an increased to 118 million m3 a with a maximum decline in groundwater of 100 m the results in fig 6 also show that the maximum ground subsidence in the 1990 s exceeded 20 cm a ground deformation in the urban area continued to ease and rebound until the enactment of the groundwater restriction policy in 1996 the completion of the black river water supply hub in 2002 and the start of the artificial water injection project in 2018 5 discussion 5 1 correlation between urban development and ground subsidence ground subsidence is a slow time dependent subsidence process that may respond slowly and according to urban development to explore the relationship between surface deformation and urban development in xi an land use type data from 1995 to 2018 were collected from the resource and environmental science and data centre of the chinese academy of sciences https www resdc cn data aspx with a resolution of 1 km 1 km as shown in fig 12 according to tables 2 and 3 the proportion of construction land increased by 32 i e from 35 in 1995 to 67 in 2018 whereas the proportion of cropland decreased by 26 in only the deformation area the proportion of construction land increased by 59 the population increased from 6 179 500 to 10 203 500 from 1992 to 2019 according to census data population growth and the need for infrastructure construction have led to the continuous exploitation of groundwater from 1992 onwards resulting in severe ground subsidence based on the ground subsidence rate maps in fig 6 there was also an acceleration in ground subsidence in xi an from 2000 to 2018 solari et al 2016 found that the building load is a factor that promotes a high displacement rate the large scale construction of buildings aggravates the rate of land subsidence and the overexploitation of groundwater the increase in the proportion of construction land in the deformation areas has been a secondary factor in the intensification of ground subsidence during large scale groundwater extraction 5 2 correlation between groundwater extraction and ground subsidence ground subsidence is a regional slow change geohazard mainly caused by the irrational exploitation of groundwater which is costly and difficult to manage with city expansion and the construction of water supply projects groundwater extraction in the main city of xi an has evolved the history of groundwater exploitation can be divided into five stages dong et al 2019 in the first stage before 1970 water used in the urban area of xi an was mainly scooped and scattered groundwater extraction the groundwater system was in a natural equilibrium with an extraction volume of less than 30 million m3 a in the second stage 1970 1995 with city expansion the groundwater extraction volume increased rapidly and the urban groundwater extraction volume increased to 118 million m3 a in the third stage 1996 2002 the government began to control groundwater exploitation in the main urban area and built a water supply system outside the city using surface water and river water as sources the amount of groundwater extraction in the central city gradually decreased to 30 million m3 a in the fourth stage 2002 2017 projects such as the heihe water supply hub were built and the groundwater based water supply system was converted to surface water which substantially alleviated the imbalance in the groundwater level throughout the city in the fifth stage since 2018 there has been no extraction of deep pressurized water in the city and a water injection strategy has been adopted fig 13 shows the confined water contour maps for 1960 1977 1983 1995 2004 2008 2011 2014 and 2017 where in fig 13 d the superimposed water contour was in 1995 and the others correspond to the deformation rate of that year before the late 1960 s the natural flow field of closed water in the xi an area was runoff from the south to the north with a hydraulic gradient of 2 to 3 and a water table burial depth of 10 30 m at the end of the 1970 s confined water was exploited in large quantities forming three funnels the water level decreased by 30 40 m several funnel centers expanded further from 1983 to 1995 and the entire city of xi an became one large funnel with pressurized water in the center of the funnel decreasing by over 100 m this is largely consistent with the center of subsidence in the 1990 s the groundwater level in the city began to rise gradually after 1996 following the gradual closure of the wells in the city in 2004 the level had risen by approximately 20 m new funnel centers were formed in 2008 at qujiang tv tower and the western high tech zone at the same time the subsidence center transferred to the yhz bsm and fqy djp the groundwater level returned to the 1980 s level until 2011 however groundwater levels in the yhz have continued to decrease with a maximum of 80 m of pressurized water by 2017 with the over exploitation of groundwater the maximum subsidence rate in the yhz area exceeded 100 mm a from 2011 to 2017 particularly the maximum subsidence rate reached 190 mm a in 2014 meanwhile fig 14 shows the relationship between the vertical deformation time series and groundwater changes at two typical points p1 and p3 the results showed that the trend in the insar time series is in accordance with that of the groundwater level producing a strong positive correlation between the subsidence and groundwater level 5 3 aquifer parameter inversion hydraulic head data for 1960 to 1995 and 2008 to 2017 were obtained via inverse distance interpolation and difference making as shown in fig 15 a d at the same time the cumulative ground deformation from december 2008 to december 2017 was extracted based on the qqa results deformation rates in the 1990 s were obtained from two orbits of the ers1 2 sar data as groundwater extraction in xi an was in its second phase from 1983 to 1995 the average annual change in the hydraulic head in the 1990 s was calculated using the head change from that phase finally the skeletal water storage coefficient of the xi an area was calculated according to eq 13 the results are shown in fig 15 b f we used insar derived deformation observations to estimate the spatiotemporal groundwater storage gws variations in xi an from 1960 to 1995 as shown in fig 15 c the estimated gws was 9 11 10 8 m3 2 6 10 7 m3 a from 1960 to 1995 compared to an average of approximately 7 5 107 m3 a from 1970 to 1995 dong et al 2019 the estimated groundwater loss during the observation period was underestimated this could likely be explained by the following reasons 1 dong et al 2019 estimated the gws across a wider range whereas we only calculated the gws underlying the area covered by the known changes in the groundwater level 2 dong et al 2019 investigated the gws of the entire aquifer system including the upper unconfined aquifer whereas the contribution of the gws derived from insar was from confined aquifers and aquitards 3 the gws calculated from insar measurements included groundwater recharge but that reported in dong et al 2019 did not include this galloway et al 1998 stated that a value of s k e of approximately 0 0005 is typical of the elastic skeletal water storage coefficient whereas a value of approximately 0 005 is likely the inelastic skeletal water storage coefficient during surface subsidence hoffmann 2003 noted that the value of s k i in aquifers dominated by loose clay and silt is usually tens to hundreds of times higher than that of s k e combining their results with the values in fig 15 b f we obtained a maximum value for s k i of 0 127 and 0 147 for xi an from 1992 to 1998 and 2008 to 2017 respectively which are approximately 254 and 294 fold higher respectively than the typical elastic skeletal water storage coefficient s k e the relationship between the insar vertical deformation and groundwater level change is generally consistent with the results of other studies in southern california los angeles and other areas in the usa for example king et al 2007 used gps data and groundwater level change relationships in the san gabriel basin to derive s k e values of 0 0029 and 0 0016 from january 2005 to may 2005 and june 1998 to january 2005 respectively concluding that the aquifer may have experienced inelastic deformation based on the psinsar technique bell et al 2008 used ers and envisat data from 1992 to 2005 to obtain inelastic storage coefficients ranging from 0 009 to 0 025 and elastic storage coefficients ranging from 0 002 to 0 0037 for the las vegas area xu et al 2012 used sbas insar gps data and groundwater level data to estimate inelastic storage coefficients ranging from 0 004 to 0 09 in los angeles concluding that inelastic deformation of the aquifer may have occurred combining fig 15 b f with existing research results we can conclude that inelastic deformation may have occurred in xi an in yhz bsm and fqy from 2008 to 2017 as well as in the eastern and southern suburbs from 1992 to 1998 6 conclusions ers1 2 envisat tsx alos 2 and s1 sar images acquired from 1992 to 2021 were used to reveal the temporal and spatial characteristics of ground subsidence in xi an over the last 30 years the qqa method was used to link the deformation time series with the common sar acquisition period linear interpolation was applied to combine insar results without the common sar acquisition period accordingly the long term deformation time series of xi an from 1992 to 2021 were obtained the results showed that maximum regional ground subsidence of more than 2 m occurred in xi an over the last 30 years with different deformation characteristics in different areas at the same time the development of ground deformation in xi an has been closely related to the over exploitation of groundwater and the rapid development of urban areas according to the distribution of s k we can speculate that inelastic ground deformation may have occurred in the yhz bsm and fqy areas from 2007 to 2018 as well as in the eastern and southern suburbs from 1992 to 1998 furthermore the high spatial resolution aquifer storage coefficients and compression time constants were estimated using regional groundwater flow models and groundwater level changes combined with the results of long deformation time series this study can directly assist in ground subsidence mitigation and water management decision making credit authorship contribution statement guangrong li conceptualization

predicts the reservoir volumes using ai techniques artificial neural networks ann support vector regression svr and long short term memory lstm in two reservoirs ladik and yedikir reservoirs the effects of various parameters on the performance of the models were analyzed the results show that 1 the number of epochs affects the performance of the ann and lstm models considerably but the svr model performance is sensitive to kernel function type 2 the svr model does not produce as good results when compared to the ann and lstm models the svr model performance can be improved with more advanced strategies 3 the lstm model which is good at modelling time series data showed the best performance for both reservoirs indicating that it is more adaptive to temporal dynamics in water

control hydroelectric production irrigation in agriculture and drought reduction yang et al 2019 one of the major challenges in the operation of reservoirs is unequal and contradictory targets uncertainties in water availability due to the variability of climatic conditions also pose challenges to obtain a balanced solutions between targets and water availability it is necessary to optimize the operation of the reservoirs ngo 2006 in recent years reservoir operation has become more important to protect the health of river ecosystems in many countries zhang et al 2018 computer models can be used for understanding reservoir hydrology and reservoir management these models can help predict the effects of different water use decisions and impacts of climatic variations kangrang 2009 physically based models have long been used for reservoir volume prediction and reservoir operation yates et al 2005 recently with the developments in artificial intelligence ai data driven models have become popular tools for the same purpose hejazi and cai 2009 zhang et al 2018 comprehensively discussed the advantages disadvantages of ai data driven ai models and big data mining technology over the physically based models physically based models provide mathematical representation of the physical systems based on general physical principles establishing these models requires professional expertise and high resolution data about watershed characteristics however multiple complex factors and nonlinear problems can be solved precisely by ai models besides ai models have significantly stronger response speeds learning abilities and better performance in modeling complex relationships compared to the approaches used for physically based reservoir modeling hejazi and cai 2009 there are many ai models in the literature artificial neural networks anns support vector regression or machine svr or svm and deep learning are some of them ann models have been successfully applied in various fields including water resources management parida et al 2006 and hydrologic modelling chen and chang 2009 arai et al 2022 estimated the streamflow in japan using anns for potential hydropower reservoir operation is also successfully promoted using anns chaves and chang 2008 ghazali et al 2018 jain et al 1999 karimi googhari et al 2010 thair et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 for example jain et al 1999 predicted reservoir inflow for upper indravati in the orissa state of india thair et al 2015 estimated reservoir outflow for iraq mosul reservoir thirumalaiah and deo 1998 predicted the changes in reservoir water levels with anns some scholars combined other heuristic algorithms with ann algorithms for reservoir operation chaves and chang 2008 chaves et al 2004 chen and chang 2009 cortes and vapnik 1995 introduced the svm algorithm they discussed that the svm models have faster training time and are more advantageous than the ann models in finding universal optimal solutions the svr algorithm is obtained from the svm algorithm and has previously been used in predicting reservoir volumes hipni et al 2013 lin et al 2010 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 some other studies combined different heuristic algorithms with svr for reservoir operation aboutalebi et al 2015 ji et al 2014 khalil et al 2005 su et al 2014 su et al 2014 coupled genetic algorithm and svm to predict water volumes at the miyun reservoir aboutalebi et al 2015 used svm with nonlinear programming with nondominated sorting genetic algorithm nsgaii for optimization of monthly reservoir volumes ji et al 2014 used a hybrid programming technique to increase the performance of the svr models in this regard cross validation and grid research techniques were applied in calibration of svr model parameters even though these ai algorithms were successful for estimation of reservoir release or storage they have some disadvantages such as long training time requirements zhang et al 2018 artificial intelligence models on the other hand offer efficient alternatives without considering physical processes but their application is limited by the instability inherent in observations data driven models trained using historic observations may no longer serve as sufficient guides for future conditions known as the effect of nonstationarity sun et al 2014 deep learning is a new class of ai techniques which has the frontier of computer technology and science deep learning is more successful than other models because it does not need engineering by hand so it can be applied easily with available data and calculations lecun et al 2015 long short term memory lstm is a deep learning algorithm that can prediction time series data efficiently in recent years lstm has been widely used in different fields including in hydrology fu et al 2020 liu et al 2022a compared multiple linear regression mlr svr ann convlstm and st lstm sa machine learning models for creating hourly precipitation forecasts in wuhan china liu et al 2022b predicted daily streamflows using deep learning techniques ghanghas et al 2022 used a deep learning application for flood mapping however deep learning is a relatively new technique therefore there are only a limited number of studies available related to reservoir operation and management zhang et al 2018 prediction gezhouba reservoir operation using the ann svr and lstm algorithms for hourly daily and monthly reservoir outflow the lstm model reduced memory storage and time consumption compared to other models liang et al 2018 applied lstm model for estimation of dongting lake water levels the review of the literature showed that ai models have significant potential in making predictions about the hydrologic systems however the use ai approaches particularly deep learning to predict reservoir parameters is rather limited the deep learning approach has been successfully applied in time series modeling but its effectiveness for predicting reservoir volumes but its effectiveness for predicting reservoir volumes has not been studied in detail moreover the majority of the previous studies conducted with ai models have focused on reservoir inflows outflows or water levels reservoir volume which is a critical parameter for evaluating water availability has not been sufficiently investigated in this study we aim to discuss the applicability of three ai models anns svr and lstm in predicting reservoir volumes we chose three different types of ai models a black box model anns a regression model svr and a deep learning model lstm we compared the performances of the models and discussed the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches finally we investigated the optimal parameters for each type of models and evaluated the importance of various parameters on model performance the training times and prediction accuracies of the models were analyzed for this purpose the analyses were conducted based on data obtained from two reservoirs ladik and yedikir reservoirs this study provides an important contribution to reservoir volume prediction to reservoir volume prediction by applying and comparing three ai approaches in addition it is expected to advance our knowledge of the lstm model which is a new type of ai model compared to traditional ann and svr models 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted to predict water volumes at the ladik and yedikir reservoirs located in the tersakan basin in t√ºrkiye fig 1 tersakan stream originate from ladik lake a regulator was constructed at the outlet of ladik lake in 1933 in 1986 the regulator was renewed for irrigation purposes t√ºbitak marmara research center 2010 the precipitation area at the outlet of the ladik reservoir is 145 km2 and the lake area and volume are 13 3 km2 and 4854x104 m3 respectively the annual average flow of ladik reservoir from the 145 km2 precipitation area is 55 8 hm3 and accordingly the annual average flow rate is 1 77 m3 s yedikir reservoir is an irrigation reservoir constructed on the tersakan river in 1986 the volume of yedikir reservoir is 5710x104 m3 and its surface area is 5 93 km2 yedikir reservoir provides irrigation service to an area of 7403 ha the annual average precipitation in the region is 428 mm in the range of 297 654 mm and the annual average air temperature is 12 c in the range of 10 13 c based on data from the 2010 2017 period annual precipitation and annual average air temperature during the 1975 to 2019 period are shown in fig 2 the region has continental climatic characteristics with hot and dry summers and cold and wet winters 2 2 data used in this study ann svr and lstm models were used to predict water volumes at the ladik and yedikir reservoirs the models were developed on the monthly timescale by using data from the 2010 2017 period 96 months the model inputs included meteorological data precipitation maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation and the previous month s reservoir volume the model output is the current reservoir volume the data were divided into training and testing sets 80 of the data was used for training and 20 for testing normalization was done for all data used in the models original values were transformed to the range of 0 0 1 0 after min max normalization equation 1 was used for normalization 1 x x ori x min x max x min where x x ori x min and x max are the normalized original minimum and maximum original values respectively in this study 3d 3 dimensional inputs were used for the ann svr and lstm models the input data were reshaped into samples time step and features respectively 3d inputs corresponded to 3d space for a vector 2 3 description of ai models in this study we apply ann svr and lstm models for prediction of reservoir volumes below we provide a brief overview of these techniques a ann model ann is a mathematical model which is based on the brain cells interconnected structure this model is known to be more flexible faster more adaptive to a new environment jain et al 1999 an ann consists of an input layer one or more hidden layers and an output layer the important issues in the ann modelling are the number of hidden layers neurons and the transfer function zhang et al 2018 in this study we selected to use an ann architecture consisting of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer fig 3 we used the sigmoid activation function in this model adaptive moment estimation adam optimizer was selected kingma and ba 2015 adam keeps the momentum changes as well as the learning rates of each of the optimization parameters in a cache this algorithm is a popular and used in many machine learning models bock and weiŒ≤ 2019 adam optimizer was chosen for the ann model in order to be compatible with the lstm model in the ann model we seek to optimize different parameters i e the numbers of neurons in the hidden layer and the number of epochs we tested four different numbers of neurons i e 5 10 15 and 20 in combination with different number of epochs i e 100 200 300 and 400 therefore 16 sets of parameterizations were evaluated the parameters were determined based on the available literature amini et al 2022 chen and chang 2009 mojtahedi et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 and the preliminary analysis run with the models first the parameters were tested for various values since the change in model performance was observed the number of neurons was between 5 and 20 and the number of epochs was between 100 and 400 b svr model svr is a technique derived from svm smola and sch√∂lkopf 2004 vapnik 1995 in general the methodology is similar to svm with a few minor differences yang et al 2017 svr maps the primary data nonlinearly and analyzes the linear regression problem in an advanced dimensional feature space fig 4 svr solves the problem in the form of linear regression on a higher dimensional feature space after organizing the initial data input space non linearly thus the svr needs to create an appropriate function to describe the nonlinear relationship function f x i is shown in equation 2 and it describes the nonlinear relationship between target value y i and feature x i 2 f x i w œÜ x i b in the function w is the weight vector œÜ x i is the transformation function and b is the bias regularized risk function r w is described in the following equation 3 and b and w are estimated this equation 3 r w 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n l Œµ y i f x i in equation 2 c is called the penalty coefficient 1 2 w 2 is regularization term l Œµ y i f x i represents Œµ insensitive loss function and is calculated with equation 4 4 l Œµ y i f x i m a x 0 y i f x i Œµ where Œµ is the permitted error threshold if the predicted value is within the threshold Œµ will be ignored or else the loss equals greater than Œµ there are two slack factors Œæ and Œæ as solve the optimization boundary equation 5 the lagrange

Œµ Œæ Œæ 0 the key idea is to develop a lagrange function from the corresponding constraint and objective function conditions 7 max h i i 1 2 i 1 n j 1 n i i j j k x i x j i 1 n y i i i Œµ i 1 n y i i

the d parameter was chosen as 2 3 and 4 thus 20 400 and 1200 sets of parameterizations were tested for the linear rbf and polynomial kernel functions respectively c lstm model long short term memory is a special type of recurrent neural networks rnns and was developed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the long term dependency problem in the rnn model was solved in the lstm gers et al 2000 defined in the lstm block which consists of a memory cell an input gate an output gate and a forget gate fig 5 the data used in this study are time series data lstm was chosen because it is proved to be successful in modeling time series problems the equations 11 15 show the method in detail with input vector x to a hidden vector h in these equations f t is the forget gate i t is the input gate c

number of neurons in the forget gate 10 20 30 40 and 50 therefore 20 sets of parameterizations of lstm model were evaluated for two reservoirs the parameters were determined similar to the ann model based on the available literature amini et al 2022 chen and chang 2009 mojtahedi et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 and the preliminary analysis run with the models 2 4 evaluation of model performances we quantify the success of model simulations using three different performance measures these were the root mean square error rmse equation 18 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse equation 19 and the determination coefficient r2 equation 20 rmse measures the difference or error between the predicted with observed values nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 specifically evaluates the harmony between the peaks values close to 0 indicate that the simulation results are successful the model performance can be considered satisfactory if nse 0 5 morias et al 2007 yang et al 2017 r2 krause et al 2005 ranges between 0 and 1 and defines how much of the observed distribution is predicted a value of zero means there is no correlation while a value of 1 means that the distribution of the prediction is equal to the distribution of the observation since we are comparing two reservoirs with different capacities we also presented the results in relative terms scaled by the mean values in this we used the normalized root mean squared error nrmse armstrong and collopy 1992 equation 21 as the model performance evaluation criterion the nrmse model performance can be classified as follows nrmse 10 is very good 10 nrmse 20 is good 20 nrmse 30 is satisfactory and nrmse 30 is unsatisfactory jamieson et al 1991 18 r m s e i 0 n e prediction e observed 2 n 19 nse 1 i 1 n e observed e prediction 2 i 1 n

of data 3 results and discussion parameter selection is among the most important steps in ai model development in this study we investigate the effect of different parameter combinations with three models we also compare the best results of each model with each other 3 1 performance of the ann model the ann model was optimized based on the number of epochs and the number of neurons in the hidden layer table 1 these parameters were tested in different combinations and the effects of them on prediction of reservoir volumes were investigated the best rmse r2 nse and nrmse values calculated between the observed and predicted reservoir volumes for the ladik reservoir were found to be 3 843 million m3 0 920 0 919 and 26 4 respectively the best rmse r2 nse and nrmse values for the yedikir reservoir were found to be 6 424 million m3 0 831 0 794 and 44 1 respectively another important parameter in model performance is the training time of the model the best model performance for the ladik reservoir was obtained when the number of epochs was 400 and the number of neurons in the hidden layer was 10 for the yedikir reservoir the model with 400 epochs and 15 neurons in the hidden layer provided the best results fig 6 shows the box plots drawn to examine the effects of different parameter combinations on the performance of the ann model the rmse value shows the difference between the actual reservoir volume and the predicted reservoir volume in the box graphs the line in the middle of the boxes shows the median and the dashed line shows the mean of the all rmse data boxes were drawn by determining the line starting point of the upper box in the first quarter and the starting point of the lower box by the second quarter values the symbols shown with dots above and below the boxes are the lowest and the highest values of the dataset respectively the box plots show that the number of epochs had a significant impact on the model performance for both reservoirs the increase in the number of epochs improved the model performance in general however the increase in the number of neurons in the hidden layer did not produce consistent outputs however it is seen that the number of neurons selected suitable for the model affects the model performance zhang et al 2018 stated that the appropriate number of neurons in the hidden layer can significantly improve the performance of the model but the effect on accuracy is unpredictable therefore the number of neurons in the hidden layer has been one of the important research areas in developing an ann model yao 1999 mentioned that the number of neurons in an ann model should be designed with an appropriate training algorithm and lippmann 1987 indicated that input and output parameters can be effective in determining the number of neurons our results are in agreement with these studies 3 2 performance of the svr model to establish the svr model we evaluated the effects of penalty coefficient c structural parameter …£ and degree d together with different kernel functions on the model performance table 3 results showed that the model performance ranking was rbf kernel polynomial kernel linear kernel for the ladik reservoir polynomial kernel linear kernel rbf kernel for the yedikir reservoir table 2 the best rmse r2 nse and nrmse values for the ladik reservoir were found as 12 579 million m3 0 609 0 506 and 86 4 respectively for yedikir reservoir these values are 14 530 million m3 0 468 0 376 and 90 2 respectively when the kernel functions are ordered in terms of training time of the model the result was found as polynomial kernel rbf kernel linear kernel for both reservoirs when the results obtained according to the statistical results tested in the model were evaluated the best result for the ladik reservoir was found in the rbf kernel function when the c and …£ values were 0 233572 and 1 623776 respectively for the yedikir reservoir the best result was found with the polynomial kernel function when d c and …£ values were 4 29 7635 and 0 233572 respectively as shown in table 2 although the nse and r2 values for the ladik reservoir were satisfactory with nse and r2 values above 0 50 the results were not satisfactory for the yedikir reservoir the results obtained with the linear kernel function was the worst for both reservoirs in the study the best results were found with rbf for ladik reservoir and polynomial kernel for yedikir reservoir yaseen et al 2015 reported that in majority of the hydrological studies rbf kernels were more suitable as the kernel function because they have fewer tuning parameters than other models they can better capture nonlinear situations and they assume smoothness however they emphasized that any kernel function has weaknesses as well as strengths yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 su et al 2014 developed svm with various genetic algorithms modeling reservoir volumes and they emphasized that svm technology is still developing and further improvements should be made with the methods such as parameter optimization of the kernel function in this study svr did not provide satisfactory results in reservoir volume simulation the model could be improved by using different algorithms or by changing model inputs meteorological data reservoir inflow outflow or irrigation water use 3 3 performance of the lstm model the lstm model developed for ladik and yedikƒ±r reservoirs were tested with different number of epochs and neurons table 3 the best rmse r2 nse and nrmse values for the ladik reservoir were found as 3 641 million m3 0 930 0 927 and 25 0 respectively for the yedikir reservoir these values were 6 131 million m3 0 862 0 812 and 38 1 respectively in table 3 the best results are shown in bold we did not identify much difference in model training times the number of data used in model training is an important factor in the training times of the model in this study the dataset was not very large therefore the training times were found to be small the best model result for the ladik and yedikir reservoirs was found when the number of epochs were 200 and the number of neurons were 10 in both reservoirs we can say that the lstm model is a suitable model for reservoir volume estimation as it provided the best performance for the same parameter values for both reservoirs fig 7 shows the box plots drawn to examine the effects of different parameter combinations used in the study on the lstm model performance according to the graphics the model performance increases as the number of epoch increases from 50 to 200 as the difference between the lstm model output value and the observation value decreases the model error tends to decrease so an increase in the number of iterations does not significantly improve the model result zhang et al 2018 therefore the number of epochs was not increased further as it was determined that there was no further improvement in the result when the number of epochs exceeded 200 in the model although the number of epochs was effective on the accuracy of the model the effectiveness of the number of neurons was not clear there are very few studies in the literature examining the effect of the number of neurons on the lstm model of reservoirs zhang et al 2018 examined the effect of the number of maximum iterations on the model performance and stated that while the number of iterations was constant the number of neurons has limited impact on changing the accuracy of the model simulation performance in this study when the simulation results were examined it was determined that the effect of the number of neurons was weaker and inconsistent for both reservoirs 3 4 comparison of the results of the ann svr and lstm models in this study three different ai models were tested for predicting reservoirs volumes the graphs drawn according to the best results are shown in fig 8 for three models and two reservoirs according to the model performances the best results ranking was found as the lstm model ann model svr model in both reservoirs zhang et al 2018 on the other hand found that the performance of the models could be ordered as lstm model svr model ann model in their study for the reservoir outflow estimation in this study the svr model was the model that showed the lowest performance su et al 2014 examined the performance of svr for reservoir volume estimation they also used svm in their studies but integrated it with various genetic algorithms these results show that svr has some limitation in simulating reservoir volumes when the models were compared based on the training times the models can be ordered as ann model lstm model svr model for the ladik reservoir and ann model svr model lstm model for the yedikir reservoir the number of data is an important parameter in determining the training time this study used a small dataset so there was no significant difference in training times between the models however for application using large datasets the training time is an important and limiting parameter the main reason for the limitations in ann models are the long time consumption required when extracting independent features from the network zhang et al 2018 the applicable conditions of svr are similar to ann models on the other hand the lstm model produces very fast and accurate results in large datasets therefore lstm is more advantageous than traditional models for creating medium and long term predictions for reservoirs in this study when the results of three models for two reservoirs are compared we see that the reservoir volumes predicted for the ladik reservoir were better than those predicted for the yedikir reservoir ladik reservoir is located at the upstream of the tersakan basin and therefore it is affected less by the anthropogenic impacts such as irrigation yedikir reservoir is located to the central basin and is more exposed to anthropogenic effects fig 1 since the waters are used for different purposes such as irrigation until they reach the yedikir reservoir it is thought that the reservoir volume simulation results are lower than ladik reservoir if we had data on irrigation water use better results could be obtained by adding them to the models as input ouyang et al 2021 studied the reservoir operation model of the lstm model for a large dataset consisting of 3557 basins at continental scale under anthropogenic effects they calculated the nse value of the lstm model they trained as 0 74 and stated that this value was the highest result in the studies conducted until that time as seen in this study there are major challenges in predicting water volumes for lakes reservoirs affected by anthropogenic impacts anthropogenic impacts on the hydrologic system could affect the success of all ai approaches when we examine the literature on the subject anthropogenic effects have been mentioned indirectly if not directly for example mojtahedi et al 2022 emphasized that they added two more parameters to the ann models in order to reflect the human anthropogenic effect in their studies abhishek et al 2021 studied water storage dynamics in the chao phraya river basin using the ann model they emphasized that the dynamics of water storage in the basins reservoirs and groundwater should be evaluated in their anthropogenic effects sun et al 2014 on the other hand worked on an ann model to simulate runoff in semi arid regions they emphasized that semi arid areas tend to be more vulnerable to anthropogenic influences which can affect basin responses and flow regimes dadaser celik and cengiz 2013 used ann models predict water levels in a highly altered wetland ecosystem and found that performance of the model was comparatively lower than that of similar studies 4 conclusions predicting reservoir volumes is essential for the sustainability of reservoir management reservoir volumes can be predicted with physically based models or data driven or ai models physically based models require high resolution data on watershed characteristics and water use practices and professional experience ai models have learning abilities to reservoir operation rules from historical data so they can deal with complex factors much better this study investigated the lstm model which is a new type of ai model and compared the results obtained with traditional ann and svr models for reservoir volume prediction detailed recommendations and discussions on model performances and parameter settings for two reservoirs were provided the main findings of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 our results showed that the number of epochs is very important for the performance of the ann and lstm models therefore the selection of the number of epoch should be prioritized for these models in contrast the number of neurons in the hidden layer do not affect model performance significantly svr model performance is affected by the kernel function type but in this study the svr model was not as successful as the other two models for prediction of reservoir volumes to reduce the effects of model parameters on model performance and determine the optimum parameters the models should be trained repeatedly 2 anns can be an alternative technique if the model can learn the operation principle of a reservoir from a small dataset and the anthropogenic factors that affect reservoir volumes are not important however if a large dataset is available regarding the reservoir and reservoir operation is uncertain anns may not provide satisfactory results the long training time requirements when extracting network independent features is the main factor limiting the performance of the ann models this paper used a small dataset so that there was no significant difference in training times between the models however the training time is important and limiting parameter for the ann and svr models one of the most important features that make the lstm model superior to traditional models ann and svr is that it produces fast and accurate results even in large datasets 3 in this study the performances of the ann svm and lstm models were compared by using data from two reservoirs ladik and yedikir the reservoirs are located in the same basin and have similar hydrological characteristics however the performances of the three models for the yedikir reservoir were lower than those of the ladik reservoir ladik reservoir is located at the upstream of the tersakan river while yedikir reservoir is located towards the basin outlet therefore has been exposed to more anthropogenic effects it has been determined that this situation causes difference in the model performance between the two reservoirs but the lstm model performance is less affected by ann and svr models in the yedikir reservoir this result shows that the lstm model is more successful in coping with anthropogenic effects compared to the

an effective reservoir operation artificial intelligence ai techniques can be used for forecasting reservoir volumes which is a critical parameter for reservoir operation and management this study predicts the reservoir volumes using ai techniques artificial neural networks ann support vector regression svr and long short term memory lstm in two reservoirs ladik and yedikir reservoirs the effects of various parameters on the performance of the models were analyzed the results show that 1 the number of epochs affects the performance of the ann and lstm models considerably but the svr model performance is sensitive to kernel function type 2 the svr model does not produce as good results when compared to the ann and lstm models the svr model performance can be improved with more advanced strategies 3 the lstm model which is good at modelling time series data showed the best performance for both reservoirs indicating that it is more adaptive to temporal dynamics in water

epoch n hidden neurons 3d three dimensional 1 introduction reservoirs have important functions in the management planning and use of water resources they are used for different purposes such as flood control hydroelectric production irrigation in agriculture and drought reduction yang et al 2019 one of the major challenges in the operation of reservoirs is unequal and contradictory targets uncertainties in water availability due to the variability of climatic conditions also pose challenges to obtain a balanced solutions between targets and water availability it is necessary to optimize the operation of the reservoirs ngo 2006 in recent years reservoir operation has become more important to protect the health of river ecosystems in many countries zhang et al 2018 computer models can be used for understanding reservoir hydrology and reservoir management these models can help predict the effects of different water use decisions and impacts of climatic variations kangrang 2009 physically based models have long been used for reservoir volume prediction and reservoir operation yates et al 2005 recently with the developments in artificial intelligence ai data driven models have become popular tools for the same purpose hejazi and cai 2009 zhang et al 2018 comprehensively discussed the advantages disadvantages of ai data driven ai models and big data mining technology over the physically based models physically based models provide mathematical representation of the physical systems based on general physical principles establishing these models requires professional expertise and high resolution data about watershed characteristics however multiple complex factors and nonlinear problems can be solved precisely by ai models besides ai models have significantly stronger response speeds learning abilities and better performance in modeling complex relationships compared to the approaches used for physically based reservoir modeling hejazi and cai 2009 there are many ai models in the literature artificial neural networks anns support vector regression or machine svr or svm and deep learning are some of them ann models have been successfully applied in various fields including water resources management parida et al 2006 and hydrologic modelling chen and chang 2009 arai et al 2022 estimated the streamflow in japan using anns for potential hydropower reservoir operation is also successfully promoted using anns chaves and chang 2008 ghazali et al 2018 jain et al 1999 karimi googhari et al 2010 thair et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 for example jain et al 1999 predicted reservoir inflow for upper indravati in the orissa state of india thair et al 2015 estimated reservoir outflow for iraq mosul reservoir thirumalaiah and deo 1998 predicted the changes in reservoir water levels with anns some scholars combined other heuristic algorithms with ann algorithms for reservoir operation chaves and chang 2008 chaves et al 2004 chen and chang 2009 cortes and vapnik 1995 introduced the svm algorithm they discussed that the svm models have faster training time and are more advantageous than the ann models in finding universal optimal solutions the svr algorithm is obtained from the svm algorithm and has previously been used in predicting reservoir volumes hipni et al 2013 lin et al 2010 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 some other studies combined different heuristic algorithms with svr for reservoir operation aboutalebi et al 2015 ji et al 2014 khalil et al 2005 su et al 2014 su et al 2014 coupled genetic algorithm and svm to predict water volumes at the miyun reservoir aboutalebi et al 2015 used svm with nonlinear programming with nondominated sorting genetic algorithm nsgaii for optimization of monthly reservoir volumes ji et al 2014 used a hybrid programming technique to increase the performance of the svr models in this regard cross validation and grid research techniques were applied in calibration of svr model parameters even though these ai algorithms were successful for estimation of reservoir release or storage they have some disadvantages such as long training time requirements zhang et al 2018 artificial intelligence models on the other hand offer efficient alternatives without considering physical processes but their application is limited by the instability inherent in observations data driven models trained using historic observations may no longer serve as sufficient guides for future conditions known as the effect of nonstationarity sun et al 2014 deep learning is a new class of ai techniques which has the frontier of computer technology and science deep learning is more successful than other models because it does not need engineering by hand so it can be applied easily with available data and calculations lecun et al 2015 long short term memory lstm is a deep learning algorithm that can prediction time series data efficiently in recent years lstm has been widely used in different fields including in hydrology fu et al 2020 liu et al 2022a compared multiple linear regression mlr svr ann convlstm and st lstm sa machine learning models for creating hourly precipitation forecasts in wuhan china liu et al 2022b predicted daily streamflows using deep learning techniques ghanghas et al 2022 used a deep learning application for flood mapping however deep learning is a relatively new technique therefore there are only a limited number of studies available related to reservoir operation and management zhang et al 2018 prediction gezhouba reservoir operation using the ann svr and lstm algorithms for hourly daily and monthly reservoir outflow the lstm model reduced memory storage and time consumption compared to other models liang et al 2018 applied lstm model for estimation of dongting lake water levels the review of the literature showed that ai models have significant potential in making predictions about the hydrologic systems however the use ai approaches particularly deep learning to predict reservoir parameters is rather limited the deep learning approach has been successfully applied in time series modeling but its effectiveness for predicting reservoir volumes but its effectiveness for predicting reservoir volumes has not been studied in detail moreover the majority of the previous studies conducted with ai models have focused on reservoir inflows outflows or water levels reservoir volume which is a critical parameter for evaluating water availability has not been sufficiently investigated in this study we aim to discuss the applicability of three ai models anns svr and lstm in predicting reservoir volumes we chose three different types of ai models a black box model anns a regression model svr and a deep learning model lstm we compared the performances of the models and discussed the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches finally we investigated the optimal parameters for each type of models and evaluated the importance of various parameters on model performance the training times and prediction accuracies of the models were analyzed for this purpose the analyses were conducted based on data obtained from two reservoirs ladik and yedikir reservoirs this study provides an important contribution to reservoir volume prediction to reservoir volume prediction by applying and comparing three ai approaches in addition it is expected to advance our knowledge of the lstm model which is a new type of ai model compared to traditional ann and svr models 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted to predict water volumes at the ladik and yedikir reservoirs located in the tersakan basin in t√ºrkiye fig 1 tersakan stream originate from ladik lake a regulator was constructed at the outlet of ladik lake in 1933 in 1986 the regulator was renewed for irrigation purposes t√ºbitak marmara research center 2010 the precipitation area at the outlet of the ladik reservoir is 145 km2 and the lake area and volume are 13 3 km2 and 4854x104 m3 respectively the annual average flow of ladik reservoir from the 145 km2 precipitation area is 55 8 hm3 and accordingly the annual average flow rate is 1 77 m3 s yedikir reservoir is an irrigation reservoir constructed on the tersakan river in 1986 the volume of yedikir reservoir is 5710x104 m3 and its surface area is 5 93 km2 yedikir reservoir provides irrigation service to an area of 7403 ha the annual average precipitation in the region is 428 mm in the range of 297 654 mm and the annual average air temperature is 12 c in the range of 10 13 c based on data from the 2010 2017 period annual precipitation and annual average air temperature during the 1975 to 2019 period are shown in fig 2 the region has continental climatic characteristics with hot and dry summers and cold and wet winters 2 2 data used in this study ann svr and lstm models were used to predict water volumes at the ladik and yedikir reservoirs the models were developed on the monthly timescale by using data from the 2010 2017 period 96 months the model inputs included meteorological data precipitation maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation and the previous month s reservoir volume the model output is the current reservoir volume the data were divided into training and testing sets 80 of the data was used for training and 20 for testing normalization was done for all data used in the models original values were transformed to the range of 0 0 1 0 after min max normalization equation 1 was used for normalization 1 x x ori x min x max x min where x x ori x min and x max are the normalized original minimum and maximum original values respectively in this study 3d 3 dimensional inputs were used for the ann svr and lstm models the input data were reshaped into samples time step and features respectively 3d inputs corresponded to 3d space for a vector 2 3 description of ai models in this study we apply ann svr and lstm models for prediction of reservoir volumes below we provide a brief overview of these techniques a ann model ann is a mathematical model which is based on the brain cells interconnected structure this model is known to be more flexible faster more adaptive to a new environment jain et al 1999 an ann consists of an input layer one or more hidden layers and an output layer the important issues in the ann modelling are the number of hidden layers neurons and the transfer function zhang et al 2018 in this study we selected to use an ann architecture consisting of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer fig 3 we used the sigmoid activation function in this model adaptive moment estimation adam optimizer was selected kingma and ba 2015 adam keeps the momentum changes as well as the learning rates of each of the optimization parameters in a cache this algorithm is a popular and used in many machine learning models bock and weiŒ≤ 2019 adam optimizer was chosen for the ann model in order to be compatible with the lstm model in the ann model we seek to optimize different parameters i e the numbers of neurons in the hidden layer and the number of epochs we tested four different numbers of neurons i e 5 10 15 and 20 in combination with different number of epochs i e 100 200 300 and 400 therefore 16 sets of parameterizations were evaluated the parameters were determined based on the available literature amini et al 2022 chen and chang 2009 mojtahedi et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 and the preliminary analysis run with the models first the parameters were tested for various values since the change in model performance was observed the number of neurons was between 5 and 20 and the number of epochs was between 100 and 400 b svr model svr is a technique derived from svm smola and sch√∂lkopf 2004 vapnik 1995 in general the methodology is similar to svm with a few minor differences yang et al 2017 svr maps the primary data nonlinearly and analyzes the linear regression problem in an advanced dimensional feature space fig 4 svr solves the problem in the form of linear regression on a higher dimensional feature space after organizing the initial data input space non linearly thus the svr needs to create an appropriate function to describe the nonlinear relationship function f x i is shown in equation 2 and it describes the nonlinear relationship between target value y i and feature x i 2 f x i w œÜ x i b in the function w is the weight vector œÜ x i is the transformation function and b is the bias regularized risk function r w is described in the following equation 3 and b and w are estimated this equation 3 r w 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n l Œµ y i f x i in equation 2 c is called the penalty coefficient 1 2 w 2 is regularization term l Œµ y i f x i represents Œµ insensitive loss function and is calculated with equation 4 4 l Œµ y i f x i m a x 0 y i f x i Œµ where Œµ is the permitted error threshold if the predicted value is within the threshold Œµ will be ignored or else the loss equals greater than Œµ there are two slack factors Œæ and Œæ as solve the optimization boundary equation 5 the lagrange

the polynomial term in this study different d Œ≥ and c values were evaluated according to the geometric progression of c and Œ≥ parameters 20 different values were selected between 0 0001 and 10000 the d parameter was chosen as 2 3 and 4 thus 20 400 and 1200 sets of parameterizations were tested for the linear rbf and polynomial kernel functions respectively c lstm model long short term memory is a special type of recurrent neural networks rnns and was developed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the long term dependency problem in the rnn model was solved in the lstm gers et al 2000 defined in the lstm block which consists of a memory cell an input gate an output gate and a forget gate fig 5 the data used in this study are time series data lstm was chosen because it is proved to be successful in modeling time series problems the equations 11 15 show the method in detail with input vector x to a hidden vector h in these equations f t is the forget gate i t is the input gate c

in the prediction model memory cell of 1 month and adam optimizer parameter were selected the model was tested for different number of epochs including 50 75 100 and 200 in combination with different number of neurons in the forget gate 10 20 30 40 and 50 therefore 20 sets of parameterizations of lstm model were evaluated for two reservoirs the parameters were determined similar to the ann model based on the available literature amini et al 2022 chen and chang 2009 mojtahedi et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 and the preliminary analysis run with the models 2 4 evaluation of model performances we quantify the success of model simulations using three different performance measures these were the root mean square error rmse equation 18 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse equation 19 and the determination coefficient r2 equation 20 rmse measures the difference or error between the predicted with observed values nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 specifically evaluates the harmony between the peaks values close to 0 indicate that the simulation results are successful the model performance can be considered satisfactory if nse 0 5 morias et al 2007 yang et al 2017 r2 krause et al 2005 ranges between 0 and 1 and defines how much of the observed distribution is predicted a value of zero means there is no correlation while a value of 1 means that the distribution of the prediction is equal to the distribution of the observation since we are comparing two reservoirs with different capacities we also presented the results in relative terms scaled by the mean values in this we used the normalized root mean squared error nrmse armstrong and collopy 1992 equation 21 as the model performance evaluation criterion the nrmse model performance can be classified as follows nrmse 10 is very good 10 nrmse 20 is good 20 nrmse 30 is satisfactory and nrmse 30 is unsatisfactory jamieson et al 1991 18 r m s e i 0 n e prediction e observed 2 n 19 nse 1 i 1 n e observed e prediction 2 i 1 n

of data 3 results and discussion parameter selection is among the most important steps in ai model development in this study we investigate the effect of different parameter combinations with three models we also compare the best results of each model with each other 3 1 performance of the ann model the ann model was optimized based on the number of epochs and the number of neurons in the hidden layer table 1 these parameters were tested in different combinations and the effects of them on prediction of reservoir volumes were investigated the best rmse r2 nse and nrmse values calculated between the observed and predicted reservoir volumes for the ladik reservoir were found to be 3 843 million m3 0 920 0 919 and 26 4 respectively the best rmse r2 nse and nrmse values for the yedikir reservoir were found to be 6 424 million m3 0 831 0 794 and 44 1 respectively another important parameter in model performance is the training time of the model the best model performance for the ladik reservoir was obtained when the number of epochs was 400 and the number of neurons in the hidden layer was 10 for the yedikir reservoir the model with 400 epochs and 15 neurons in the hidden layer provided the best results fig 6 shows the box plots drawn to examine the effects of different parameter combinations on the performance of the ann model the rmse value shows the difference between the actual reservoir volume and the predicted reservoir volume in the box graphs the line in the middle of the boxes shows the median and the dashed line shows the mean of the all rmse data boxes were drawn by determining the line starting point of the upper box in the first quarter and the starting point of the lower box by the second quarter values the symbols shown with dots above and below the boxes are the lowest and the highest values of the dataset respectively the box plots show that the number of epochs had a significant impact on the model performance for both reservoirs the increase in the number of epochs improved the model performance in general however the increase in the number of neurons in the hidden layer did not produce consistent outputs however it is seen that the number of neurons selected suitable for the model affects the model performance zhang et al 2018 stated that the appropriate number of neurons in the hidden layer can significantly improve the performance of the model but the effect on accuracy is unpredictable therefore the number of neurons in the hidden layer has been one of the important research areas in developing an ann model yao 1999 mentioned that the number of neurons in an ann model should be designed with an appropriate training algorithm and lippmann 1987 indicated that input and output parameters can be effective in determining the number of neurons our results are in agreement with these studies 3 2 performance of the svr model to establish the svr model we evaluated the effects of penalty coefficient c structural parameter …£ and degree d together with different kernel functions on the model performance table 3 results showed that the model performance ranking was rbf kernel polynomial kernel linear kernel for the ladik reservoir polynomial kernel linear kernel rbf kernel for the yedikir reservoir table 2 the best rmse r2 nse and nrmse values for the ladik reservoir were found as 12 579 million m3 0 609 0 506 and 86 4 respectively for yedikir reservoir these values are 14 530 million m3 0 468 0 376 and 90 2 respectively when the kernel functions are ordered in terms of training time of the model the result was found as polynomial kernel rbf kernel linear kernel for both reservoirs when the results obtained according to the statistical results tested in the model were evaluated the best result for the ladik reservoir was found in the rbf kernel function when the c and …£ values were 0 233572 and 1 623776 respectively for the yedikir reservoir the best result was found with the polynomial kernel function when d c and …£ values were 4 29 7635 and 0 233572 respectively as shown in table 2 although the nse and r2 values for the ladik reservoir were satisfactory with nse and r2 values above 0 50 the results were not satisfactory for the yedikir reservoir the results obtained with the linear kernel function was the worst for both reservoirs in the study the best results were found with rbf for ladik reservoir and polynomial kernel for yedikir reservoir yaseen et al 2015 reported that in majority of the hydrological studies rbf kernels were more suitable as the kernel function because they have fewer tuning parameters than other models they can better capture nonlinear situations and they assume smoothness however they emphasized that any kernel function has weaknesses as well as strengths yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 su et al 2014 developed svm with various genetic algorithms modeling reservoir volumes and they emphasized that svm technology is still developing and further improvements should be made with the methods such as parameter optimization of the kernel function in this study svr did not provide satisfactory results in reservoir volume simulation the model could be improved by using different algorithms or by changing model inputs meteorological data reservoir inflow outflow or irrigation water use 3 3 performance of the lstm model the lstm model developed for ladik and yedikƒ±r reservoirs were tested with different number of epochs and neurons table 3 the best rmse r2 nse and nrmse values for the ladik reservoir were found as 3 641 million m3 0 930 0 927 and 25 0 respectively for the yedikir reservoir these values were 6 131 million m3 0 862 0 812 and 38 1 respectively in table 3 the best results are shown in bold we did not identify much difference in model training times the number of data used in model training is an important factor in the training times of the model in this study the dataset was not very large therefore the training times were found to be small the best model result for the ladik and yedikir reservoirs was found when the number of epochs were 200 and the number of neurons were 10 in both reservoirs we can say that the lstm model is a suitable model for reservoir volume estimation as it provided the best performance for the same parameter values for both reservoirs fig 7 shows the box plots drawn to examine the effects of different parameter combinations used in the study on the lstm model performance according to the graphics the model performance increases as the number of epoch increases from 50 to 200 as the difference between the lstm model output value and the observation value decreases the model error tends to decrease so an increase in the number of iterations does not significantly improve the model result zhang et al 2018 therefore the number of epochs was not increased further as it was determined that there was no further improvement in the result when the number of epochs exceeded 200 in the model although the number of epochs was effective on the accuracy of the model the effectiveness of the number of neurons was not clear there are very few studies in the literature examining the effect of the number of neurons on the lstm model of reservoirs zhang et al 2018 examined the effect of the number of maximum iterations on the model performance and stated that while the number of iterations was constant the number of neurons has limited impact on changing the accuracy of the model simulation performance in this study when the simulation results were examined it was determined that the effect of the number of neurons was weaker and inconsistent for both reservoirs 3 4 comparison of the results of the ann svr and lstm models in this study three different ai models were tested for predicting reservoirs volumes the graphs drawn according to the best results are shown in fig 8 for three models and two reservoirs according to the model performances the best results ranking was found as the lstm model ann model svr model in both reservoirs zhang et al 2018 on the other hand found that the performance of the models could be ordered as lstm model svr model ann model in their study for the reservoir outflow estimation in this study the svr model was the model that showed the lowest performance su et al 2014 examined the performance of svr for reservoir volume estimation they also used svm in their studies but integrated it with various genetic algorithms these results show that svr has some limitation in simulating reservoir volumes when the models were compared based on the training times the models can be ordered as ann model lstm model svr model for the ladik reservoir and ann model svr model lstm model for the yedikir reservoir the number of data is an important parameter in determining the training time this study used a small dataset so there was no significant difference in training times between the models however for application using large datasets the training time is an important and limiting parameter the main reason for the limitations in ann models are the long time consumption required when extracting independent features from the network zhang et al 2018 the applicable conditions of svr are similar to ann models on the other hand the lstm model produces very fast and accurate results in large datasets therefore lstm is more advantageous than traditional models for creating medium and long term predictions for reservoirs in this study when the results of three models for two reservoirs are compared we see that the reservoir volumes predicted for the ladik reservoir were better than those predicted for the yedikir reservoir ladik reservoir is located at the upstream of the tersakan basin and therefore it is affected less by the anthropogenic impacts such as irrigation yedikir reservoir is located to the central basin and is more exposed to anthropogenic effects fig 1 since the waters are used for different purposes such as irrigation until they reach the yedikir reservoir it is thought that the reservoir volume simulation results are lower than ladik reservoir if we had data on irrigation water use better results could be obtained by adding them to the models as input ouyang et al 2021 studied the reservoir operation model of the lstm model for a large dataset consisting of 3557 basins at continental scale under anthropogenic effects they calculated the nse value of the lstm model they trained as 0 74 and stated that this value was the highest result in the studies conducted until that time as seen in this study there are major challenges in predicting water volumes for lakes reservoirs affected by anthropogenic impacts anthropogenic impacts on the hydrologic system could affect the success of all ai approaches when we examine the literature on the subject anthropogenic effects have been mentioned indirectly if not directly for example mojtahedi et al 2022 emphasized that they added two more parameters to the ann models in order to reflect the human anthropogenic effect in their studies abhishek et al 2021 studied water storage dynamics in the chao phraya river basin using the ann model they emphasized that the dynamics of water storage in the basins reservoirs and groundwater should be evaluated in their anthropogenic effects sun et al 2014 on the other hand worked on an ann model to simulate runoff in semi arid regions they emphasized that semi arid areas tend to be more vulnerable to anthropogenic influences which can affect basin responses and flow regimes dadaser celik and cengiz 2013 used ann models predict water levels in a highly altered wetland ecosystem and found that performance of the model was comparatively lower than that of similar studies 4 conclusions predicting reservoir volumes is essential for the sustainability of reservoir management reservoir volumes can be predicted with physically based models or data driven or ai models physically based models require high resolution data on watershed characteristics and water use practices and professional experience ai models have learning abilities to reservoir operation rules from historical data so they can deal with complex factors much better this study investigated the lstm model which is a new type of ai model and compared the results obtained with traditional ann and svr models for reservoir volume prediction detailed recommendations and discussions on model performances and parameter settings for two reservoirs were provided the main findings of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 our results showed that the number of epochs is very important for the performance of the ann and lstm models therefore the selection of the number of epoch should be prioritized for these models in contrast the number of neurons in the hidden layer do not affect model performance significantly svr model performance is affected by the kernel function type but in this study the svr model was not as successful as the other two models for prediction of reservoir volumes to reduce the effects of model parameters on model performance and determine the optimum parameters the models should be trained repeatedly 2 anns can be an alternative technique if the model can learn the operation principle of a reservoir from a small dataset and the anthropogenic factors that affect reservoir volumes are not important however if a large dataset is available regarding the reservoir and reservoir operation is uncertain anns may not provide satisfactory results the long training time requirements when extracting network independent features is the main factor limiting the performance of the ann models this paper used a small dataset so that there was no significant difference in training times between the models however the training time is important and limiting parameter for the ann and svr models one of the most important features that make the lstm model superior to traditional models ann and svr is that it produces fast and accurate results even in large datasets 3 in this study the performances of the ann svm and lstm models were compared by using data from two reservoirs ladik and yedikir the reservoirs are located in the same basin and have similar hydrological characteristics however the performances of the three models for the yedikir reservoir were lower than those of the ladik reservoir ladik reservoir is located at the upstream of the tersakan river while yedikir reservoir is located towards the basin outlet therefore has been exposed to more anthropogenic effects it has been determined that this situation causes difference in the model performance between the two reservoirs but the lstm model performance is less affected by ann and svr models in the yedikir reservoir this result shows that the lstm model is more successful in coping with anthropogenic effects compared to the

2588,the soil and water assessment tool swat model has been widely applied for simulating the water cycle and quantifying the influence of climate change and anthropogenic activities on hydrological processes a major uncertainty of swat stems from the poor representation of vegetation dynamics due to the use of a simplistic vegetation growth and development module using long term remote sensing based phenological data the swat model s vegetation module was improved by adding a dynamic growth start date and the dynamic heat requirement for vegetation growth rather than using constant values the new swat model was verified in the han river basin china and found its performance was much improved in comparison with that of the original swat model specifically the accuracy of the leaf area index lai simulation improved notably coefficient of determination r2 increased by 0 193 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse increased by 0 846 and percent bias decreased by 42 18 and that of runoff simulation improved modestly r2 increased by 0 05 and nse was similar additionally it is found that the original swat model substantially underestimated evapotranspiration penman monteith method in comparison with the new swat model 65 09 mm or 22 17 for forests 92 27 mm or 32 for orchards and 96 16 mm or 36 4 for farmland primarily due to the inaccurate representation of lai dynamics our results suggest that an accurate representation of phenological dates in the vegetation growth module is important for improving the swat model performance in terms of estimating terrestrial water and energy balance keywords vegetation phenology runoff swat modification lai simulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction vegetation as the key factor connecting the soil and the atmosphere in a terrestrial ecosystem plays a crucial role in the hydrological cycle rodriguez iturbe 2000 sprenger et al 2016 vegetation dynamics have many crucial effects on the terrestrial water cycle such as rainfall interception soil water transport evapotranspiration and soil property change kergoat 1998 tesemma et al 2015 webb and kathuria 2012 wei and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2018 the soil and water assessment tool swat model considers vegetation dynamics using a simplified version of the environmental policy impact climate epic growth module which simulates the seasonal leaf area index lai by employing a day length threshold and heat unit theory arnold et al 2012 williams et al 1989 although previous studies yang and zhang 2016 yang et al 2019 improved the swat model for simulating biomass accumulation of forests it is not applicable to all regions because vegetation dormancy is affected by other complex environmental factors in addition to day length rajib et al 2020 strauch and volk 2013 wagner et al 2011 consequently large uncertainties exist in the assessment of the terrestrial water cycle conducted using such hydrological models zhang et al 2020 therefore it is essential to improve the vegetation simulation module used in hydrological models to improve our understanding of ecosystem hydrological response to ongoing climate change the growth dynamics of terrestrial vegetation are substantially influenced by ongoing climate change over recent decades shukla et al 2019 for example vegetated regions are exhibiting enhanced greening piao et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 and phenology variation such as spring advancement and autumn postponement is occurring on the global scale gill et al 2015 jeong et al 2011 piao et al 2019 one of the major shortcomings of the swat model attributable to the use of the simplified epic module is that the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of vegetation is ignored which introduces challenges regarding the simulation of vegetation dynamics by introducing either the soil moisture index or precipitation to track vegetation in the new growing season the performance of swat model in the simulation of vegetation dynamics has been improved to a certain extent strauch and volk 2013 valencia et al 2021 however such improvement is observed mainly evergreen forest vegetation in tropical areas in swat defined as regions within latitudes between 20 s and 20 n so widespread regional applicability is limited the improved scheme of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis lai based on remote sensing observations has wide regional applicability but it requires high quality remote sensing data and increases the structural complexity of swat model simulations igder et al 2022 ma et al 2019 paul et al 2021 rajib et al 2020 the approach to defining vegetation growth dormancy using remote sensing based or observed vegetation phenology strikes a balance between model complexity and performance making it a promising candidate to improve the performance of vegetation dynamics and hydrologic simulation by the swat model in this study remote sensing based global inventory modeling and mapping studies 3rd generation gimms3g normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data was used to extract dates of phenological events with five different methods including threshold methods e g gaussian spline and savitzky golay and change ratio methods e g hants harmonic analysis of time series model and polyfit chen et al 2004 cong et al 2012 savitzky and golay 1964 and the phenological data was further linked with hydrological response units hrus using area weighted methods and modified the dormancy criteria of the vegetation module in the swat model specifically the extracted phenological dates based on satellite data were used as input to determine vegetation dormancy in the hrus instead of simply using latitude and day length to determine vegetation dormancy meanwhile on the basis of remote sensing based phenological dates of each hru the accumulated heat unit required for vegetation growth in the current year is calculated and the static accumulated heat unit constant in the vegetation database of the original swat model is replaced by the dynamic accumulated heat unit to verify the applicability of the modified swat model the model was tested for simulating lai and runoff for the han river basin china this study aims to achieve three specific objectives 1 obtain dates of vegetation phenology and its spatiotemporal patterns at the watershed scale 2 improve the simulation accuracy and applicability of the swat model in terms of vegetation growth by improving the dormancy module through the addition of the dynamic accumulated heat unit module and 3 explore the variation of vegetation related hydrological parameters and their rationalities in the changed vegetation growth module 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the han river

service is a semi distributed hydrological model based on physical processes arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 it can simulate different fluxes within the hydrological cycle such as evapotranspiration et surface runoff percolation lateral flow groundwater flow transmission and ponding over long periods in the swat model an entire river basin is divided into many hrus based on slope soil type and land use type the model simulates the spatial variation of the river basin on the basis of hydrological dynamics of each hru and then performs water routing for the river channel arnold et al 2012 current research on improving the vegetation growth module of the swat model is mainly based on defining dry and wet seasons through the soil moisture index or precipitation thereby tracking the beginning of new vegetation growing season and better simulating vegetation growth dynamics alemayehu et al 2017 ma et al 2019 rajib et al 2020 strauch and volk 2013 valencia et al 2021 vegetation dynamics play an important part in the hydrological cycle the swat model simulates annual lai dynamics of different vegetation types warm season annual legumes cold season annual legumes perennial legumes warm season annuals cold season annuals perennials and trees in each hru to reflect the vegetation dynamics within the river basin to a certain extent the vegetation module of the swat model is a simplified version of the epic model which simulates vegetation growth mainly on the basis of two theories heat unit theory and day length threshold theory williams et al 1989 2 3 1 plant growth module in swat temperature is one of the most important of the various factors that control plant growth each plant has a temperature range suitable for growth id est the lowest most suitable and highest temperatures at which plant growth can occur for each plant the minimum or base temperature must be reached before the plant will begin to grow generally above the base temperature the higher the temperature the faster the growth rate jobling 1997 however once the optimum temperature for plant growth is exceeded the rate of growth begins to slow and when the maximum temperature is reached growth stops the heat unit theory assumes that the plant growth trajectory such as plant maturation is proportional to the temperature increment when the average temperature is lower than the base temperature the plant will no longer grow and when the daily average temperature exceeds the base temperature the plant will grow boswell 1926 magoon and culpepper 1932 heat units in the swat model are calculated using a direct summation index with one heat unit for each degree celsius of daily mean temperature above the base temperature however the application of the heat unit theory in the swat model does not consider the influence of harmful high temperatures on plants instead it is assumed that all temperatures higher than the base temperature will accelerate the growth and development of crops the heat accumulation unit for a given day is calculated as follows 1 hu t av t base t av t base where hu is the heat unit accumulated on a given day t av is the average daily temperature and t base represents the base or minimum temperature required for plant growth the total heat units required for a plant to reach maturity is calculated as follows 2 phu d 1 m hu where phu denotes the total heat units required for a plant to reach maturity hu is the accumulated heat unit on day d where d 1 represents the sowing date or the end date of the dormant period and m is the number of days needed for the plant to reach maturity it should be noted that phu could also represent potential heat units in the swat model the dormant date is defined by the day length threshold theory when the day length reaches the calculated threshold for a given location plant dormancy will occur the day length threshold is calculated as follows 3 t dl t h r t dl m n t dorm t dl t h r is the threshold of day length at the beginning of the dormant period h t dl m n is the shortest day length in a year in the river basin h and t dorm is the hibernation threshold h in autumn when the day length is shorter plants in the catchment except warm season annuals enter a dormant period the dormant threshold t dorm varies with latitude as follows 4 t dorm 1 0 œï 40 n o r s 5 t dorm œï 20 20 20 n o r s œï 40 n o r s 6 t dorm 0 0 œï 20 n o r s where t dorm denotes the dormancy threshold which is used to reflect the difference of dormancy time at different latitudes h and œï denotes the latitude in positive values there are theoretical uncertainties in the two theories mentioned above when simulating the growth process of vegetation first the dormant period of vegetation is judged simply on the basis of latitude and photoperiod whereas complex interactions between different environmental factors actually determine the dormancy period and the starting conditions rohde and bhalerao 2007 the current approach in swat ignores the differences in the dormancy period of vegetation at different locations at the same latitude second the accumulated heat unit demand of each plant of a particular land use land cover lulc is given as a constant value which is inconsistent with the findings of previous studies showing that heat requirements change with growing conditions for instance a warmer winter can enhance the accumulated heat unit requirements of plants by reducing the chilling period of vegetation wang et al 2020 yu et al 2010 the accumulated heat units required by vegetation change annually and the use of a fixed accumulated heat unit requirement can lead to large uncertainties in the length of the simulated growing season 2 3 2 developments of the growth module in swat recognizing the aforementioned limitations vegetation growth cycles should be initiated dynamically rather than through management operations e g plant and kill that prescribe the dates or fractions of phu for each simulation year thus the vegetation dormancy was modified and the heat unit requirement was accumulated from the original swat2012 model version 681 https swat tamu edu so that no management operation was applied during the set up of the modified model in the following sections the specific principles and details of model improvements were explained fig s1 2 3 2 1 phenology extraction the dates of occurrence of phenological events are critical in the vegetation growing season in this research five different phenological extraction methods i e the hants maximum method spline midpoint method gaussian midpoint method timesat sg method and polyfit maximum method cong et al 2012 savitzky and golay 1964 were used to estimate spring start of growing season sos and autumn end of growing season eos phenological events in the han river basin using the gimms3g ndvi data two processes were applied to extract the phenology data 1 application of smoothing and interpolation to obtain daily time series ndvi data and 2 use of the phenological phase extraction method based either on the threshold value here 0 5 and 0 2 as the threshold for sos and eos respectively or the maximum rate of change piao et al 2006 reed et al 1994 white et al 2009 white et al 1997 due to the different fitting methods interpolation methods and threshold settings of different extraction methods the extracted phenology results are often different from the in situ vegetation phenology observations in the present studies cong et al 2012 fu et al 2021 mostly through the average of multiple methods to reduce the differences as with most ways this study used the average of five methods as the phenology extraction results to reduce the uncertainty caused by a single method to reduce uncertainties associated with a single method the mean value of the extracted phenological indexes from the five methods was used as the observed phenology data for the studied river basin 2 3 2 2 mapping grid phenology value into hrus the phenological events derived from remote sensing ndvi data have a spatial resolution of 0 05 whereas the simulation of the hydrological cycle process in the swat model is based on hrus providing annual phenological records to each hru by linking the phenological data with each hru is the premise for further model improvement the technology of the swat modflow method was leveraged kim et al 2008 to build a fishnet in arcgis 10 2 software to match the gridded data with the spatial position of each hru and generate statistics for the grid cells by averaging the gridded values over each hru fig 2 the average phenological dates i e sos and eos for each hru were estimated on the basis of weighted coefficients calculated from the area size of the overlapped region to reconcile the spatial mismatch between the grid phenology data and the irregular polygons of the hrus used in the swat model simulation the area weight of the hru phenological period was determined as follows 7 hr u phenology i 1 n g r i d v a l u e i o v e r l a p a r e a i t o t a l a r e a hru where hr u phenology stands for the phenology date i e sos or eos of a year for a given hru t o t a l a r e a hru denotes the total area of a given hru g r i d v a l u e i represents the phenology data value of the grid in which the i th subblock of the hru is located o v e r l a p a r e a i represents the area occupied by the i th subblock and n is the number of overlapping subblocks into which the hru is divided 2 3 2 3 dormant module modification in this study the source code of the plant dormancy module of the swat model dormant f used for determining the dormant status of vegetation was modified for trees with a vegetation type index of 7 e g frst and orcd the day length threshold is no longer used to determine whether the trees are at the critical point between the dormancy period and the growing season instead the extracted phenology data were used to determine the growth state of trees on a simulated day and the accuracy of the model simulation was optimized on the basis of the actual growth state of trees the lai modeling during leaf senescence for perennials was also modified using the approach introduced by strauch and volk 2013 fig 3 8 lai la i mx l a i min 1 e t 9 witht 12 r 0 5 a n d r 1 f r phu 1 f r phu s e n f r phu f r phu s e n where the term used as the exponent is a function of time t and t ranges from 6 to 6 lai is the leaf area index for a given day that declines at rate r la i mx and la i min are the maximum and minimum alai min minimum lai for the plant during the dormant period m2 m2 lai values respectively and f r phu s e n is the fraction of the growing season phu over which senescence becomes the dominant growth process 2 3 2 4 dynamic heat unit requirement in the modified swat model the accumulated heat unit requirement i e the average daily temperature above base temperature base t between sos and eos for annual vegetation growth was calculated using the remote sensing vegetation phenology the calculated value phu plt was used to replace the fixed accumulated heat unit requirement for specific plants in the plant parameters database plant dat fig 4 2 3 2 5 model calibration and validation in this study the stepwise calibration method was adopted for the modeled lai and runoff in the modified model calibration of runoff and lai was conducted for 2004 2010 and validation was performed for 2011 2014 for the original model only runoff was calibrated but the time series used for calibration and validation were the same as those used for the modified model to obtain comparable results and for the assessment of the effect of inaccurate representation of vegetation dynamics the original swat model was not calibrated for lai which is not an unusual practice alemayehu et al 2017 rajib et al 2020 valencia et al 2021 three years were added at the beginning of each simulation as a spin up period necessary to approximate initial conditions especially for soil moisture envi 5 3 software was used to clip the glass lai with three main lulc types frst orcd and agrl using the hrus as borders and all raster data belonging to the same lulc type were extracted and their average values were taken as the observed lai values in the study area the first step of the stepwise calibration was to do lai calibration calibration of lai which through a combination of manual trial and error process and automatic pso particle swarm optimization marini and walczak 2015 methods was performed to determine the optimum parameters in the plant database plant dat for the initialization of parameters the parameters were restricted to be generated within truly acceptable intervals e g alai min bali dlai frgrw1 frgrw2 laimx1 laimx2 and t base it should be noted that phu plt the total number of heat units or growing degree days needed to bring plants to maturity does not need to be calibrated because it is a dynamic value determined by the accumulated heat unit module to evaluate the agreement between the simulated and observed lai values three performance criteria were used which include the coefficient of determination r2 describes the proportion of the variance in measured data explained by the model percent bias pbias measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than the observations and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse which is calculated as one minus the ratio of the error variance of the modeled time series divided by the variance of the observed time series and applied as the objective function for the model optimization the second step of the stepwise calibration method was runoff calibration both the modified and the original swat model were calibrated and the settings of the calibration process were kept consistent for two versions of the model to exclude any artificial differences in the models performance due to the calibration settings in swat cup 2019 version 5 2 1 abbaspour 2008 arnold et al 2012 the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm was used to conduct sensitivity analysis uncertainty analysis propagation of the uncertainties in the parameters leads to uncertainties in the model output variables which are expressed as the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu and the 95ppu envelop gets smaller with the iteration and the uncertainty gets smaller and automatic parameter calibration process abbaspour et al 2004 for sensitivity analysis following the literature 26 parameters that have greatest impact on the hydrological process were selected and then 12 of the most sensitive parameters were yielded for model calibration the value range of each of these parameters was defined within an acceptable true and reliable range the sufi 2 algorithm was used to calibrate model parameters for daily runoff data in each iteration 1000 simulations were applied and the parameter ranges were updated with the next iteration selection via latin hypercube sampling stein 1987 and the uncertainty of runoff simulation was indicated using p factor and r factor fig s2 to compare the differences in runoff simulation performance between the original swat model and the modified swat model the performance criteria proposed by moriasi 2007 that included nse the objective function r2 and pbias table s1 were adopted moriasi et al 2007 3 results 3 1 phenology in the han river basin there are some numerical differences among the phenology extraction results obtained from five extraction methods but they all have similar spatial patterns and the phenology extraction results of five methods indicate that there is clear spatial heterogeneity of vegetation phenology in the han river basin figs 5 and s3 for the entire basin the sos ranged from day of year doy 81 118 average doy 104 with a 37 day s difference and the eos ranged from doy 280 341 average doy 325 with a 61 day s difference the spatial distribution pattern of vegetation phenology was similar to that of lulc type fig 1c the earliest sos occurs in agrl followed by frst and then orcd and the same orders for eos there was no significant difference in eos between frst and orcd the mann kendall trend analysis method croitoru et al 2012 was used to estimate the trends in phenological changes and we further investigated the spatial pattern of the trends in han river basin the results show that the sos of the entire han river basin had experienced significant advance 0 52 day year during 1982 2015 whereas the eos had not shown an obvious trend of change 0 02 day year figs 5 and s4 significant eos delays were found in small parts of the upper and lower reaches of the han river basin while significant eos advances were found in the middle reaches at the same latitude there were evident differences in vegetation phenology and in the same region grid phenology can also change markedly over time which uninsistent the assumptions made in the epic model regarding the dominant role of latitude in plant dormancy arnold et al 2012 williams et al 1989 see fig 5 3 2 lai calibration and validation the optimum calibrated parameters in the swat plant database plant dat are listed in supplementary table s2 the performance of the original swat model in simulating lai was worse than that of the modified swat model and the original swat model failed to represent the observed lai curve and extreme values as evidenced by the high biases and negative or low correlations table 2 moreover the original swat model could not match the remote sensing data in terms of either the value or the key time nodes of the lai curve of the vegetation growth period there are two principal shortcomings in the performance of the original swat model fig 6 1 inaccuracy in the lai extreme value simulation and 2 inaccuracy in the simulation of both the growing season length and the time nodes of the dormant period with regard to the first the simulated highest and lowest lai values were different from the observed lai determined the swat model assumes that lai is zero at the beginning of each simulation year which is unrealistic for vegetation dynamics with regard to the second the growing season of the simulated lai curve of the original swat model did not correspond well to the growing season of the remote sensing lai curve there was a mismatch between the start and end dates of the growing season and the length of the growing season was not in accord with the actual situation in contrast the modified swat model improved the simulation performance more in frst and orcd consist with observed lai than that in agrl some uncertainties remain overall the modified swat model outperformed the original swat model in reproducing lai observations and intra annual lai variations as indicated by the correlation values 3 3 runoff calibration and validation the original and modified swat models were both calibrated for runoff by varying 12 of the most sensitive runoff related parameters determined by sensitivity analysis supplementary table s3 it is found that the sensitivity of runoff to these parameters changed to differing degrees after the modification of the swat model which meant that the order of the 12 most sensitive parameters was not the same for the two models the best fit parameters when the objective function nse value reaches the optimal value of two swat models and their acceptable ranges i e the ranges of parameter values in each simulation that were acceptable for reality after calibration are listed in supplementary table s4 comparison of daily original swat model and modified swat model simulated runoff and multiple criteria evaluation results with observations for the calibration 2004 2010 and validation 2011 2014 periods are presented in fig 7 the calibration period has considered different precipitation regimes as it included wet normal and dry years and the evaluation period also considered both wet and normal year both the original and modified simulated hydrographs presented a reasonable reproduction of observations while the differences between modified and original model simulated runoff show that the modified model simulated smaller runoff in spring and larger runoff in summer than the original model which is closely linked to vegetation dynamics the r2 nse and pbias multiple criteria results showed that both the original and the modified swat models could be considered good 0 65 nse 0 75 0 65 r2 0 75 maybe limited by uncertainty induced by the gauging station number and more gauging stations may provide better model performance and the runoff simulation of both swat models showed better performance in the validation period than in the calibration period the modified swat model was modestly superior to the original swat model in terms of runoff simulation as evidenced by the higher r2 and nse values in the calibration and similar in the validation periods nevertheless the original swat model can show high performance in reproducing runoff by applying different parameter values with the same effect despite having low capability in simulating lai dynamics figs 6 and 7 fig 8 3 4 impact of improved lai simulation on evapotranspiration in basin scale hydrological simulation vegetation dynamics mainly regulate the hydrological cycle process by influencing et there are three main methods for swat to simulate et the penman monteith method allen 1986 allen et al 1989 monteith 1965 priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 and hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 the penman monteith method is a popular method that has been used in many previous studies abiodun et al 2018 parajuli et al 2018 the penman monteith method includes the energy required to maintain evaporation length of path of water vapor transport aerodynamic factors and surface impedance factors primarily vegetation influences et by influencing aerodynamic impedance and vegetation canopy impedance parameters theoretically a more accurate simulation of vegetation dynamics and a more realistic lai should bring more accurate performance in et simulation the difference in the et simulation results between the modified swat model and the original swat model is believed caused by the difference attributable to dynamic simulation of vegetation growth it is found that the simulated et value of the modified swat model was higher 65 09 mm 22 17 for frst 92 27 mm 32 for orcd and 96 16 mm 36 4 for agrl than that of the original swat model and that this difference occurred mainly in spring and autumn figs 8 and s5 moreover there was a significant underestimation of et in the original swat model simulation compared with the modified swat model especially in spring and autumn 4 discussion 4 1 changes of phenology on the basin scale in this study the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of phenology in the han river basin were extracted fig 5 and the results revealed that phenology had a multiyear change trend and spatial dissimilation that was universal in different regions of the northern hemisphere badeck et al 2004 pe√±uelas and filella 2009 piao et al 2019 phenology shows different patterns with consistent but differing degrees of trend i e sos advance and eos delay in different climatic zones and their responses to climate change were different owing to complex interactions among various environmental factors e g temperature photoperiod precipitation and radiation delbart et al 2008 fu et al 2015 richardson et al 2006 richardson et al 2013 yuan et al 2020 the phenological distribution and variation characteristics of vegetation were closely related to climatic zone and vegetation type in the simulation of vegetation growth dynamics on the basin scale a single and simple method which calculates vegetation phenology based on fixed day length threshold and neglects corresponding multi process and multi factor impacts cannot accurately track the spatial and temporal variation of characteristics of vegetation phenology would increase the simulation error and uncertainty liu et al 2018 thus the simulation of the entire hydrological energy cycle could be influenced by the effect on et and other processes 4 2 advantages of the modified swat over the default swat model there are notable differences between the modified and original swat models in terms of their capability in reproducing vegetation dynamics through lai fig 6 for example the simulation performance of the modified swat model for both frst and orcd was better than that for agrl which was primarily because only the dynamic accumulated heat unit was considered in agrl and no management operation was set in this study in fact irrigation and other management operations existed in agrl and orcd while irrigation and other management operations affect agrl more than orcd for in orcd lai is mainly decided by the tree canopy management operations are usually not concerned about the growth of tree leaves unless there are plant diseases and insect pests and in agrl lai is closely related to the growth and development stage and state of crops controlled by sowing irrigation harvesting and other management measures moreover the modified swat model also improved the simulation accuracy of runoff modestly fig 7 although the modified and original swat models both achieved good runoff simulation performance two different sets of model parameters were obtained in the process of runoff calibration this is because one of the shortcomings of reverse modeling is that there could be cases where different sets of parameters in the model produce the same effect beven 2002 ruddell et al 2019 the differences of model parameter sets induce to the differences of hydrological intermediate process which regulate the water balance of different components in those processes the accurate simulation of runoff and vegetation dynamics can optimize the simulation of hydrological intermediate processes especially eco hydrological processes by comparing the differences between simulation and gleam v3 3a soil moisture content the results show that the modified model has greater advantages than the original model in the simulation of soil moisture content especially in frst and orcd the original model was underestimated by 22 4 frst 18 2 orcd and 24 9 agrl than gleam v3 3a soil water content respectively while the modified model has 1 97 overestimation in orcd 1 90 underestimation in frst and 7 62 underestimation in agrl than gleam v3 3a soil water content fig 9 accurate simulation of vegetation dynamics can guide the calibration algorithm to converge to a reliable parameter set that can accurately simulate the eco hydrological process and reduce the model structural uncertainty the regression relationship between annual et and growing season length simulated by the original and modified swat models revealed that the original swat model not only had considerable uncertainty in terms of the simulation of growing season length but also the relationship between et and growing season length in the simulation results were inconsistent with that of previous studies et increase with the extension of gsl geng et al 2020 and the modified swat model revealed that growing season extended one day will increase evapotranspiration by 11 1 mm across forests frst and orcd fig 10 the improved model resolved these two problems that strongly limit the capability of hydrological models i e the original swat model in the present case to produce reliable results that could support informed decision making kirchner 2006 valencia et al 2021 determining the dormant period of vegetation using vegetation phenology extracted from remote sensing rather than by indirectly tracking that using environmental factors e g precipitation and soil moisture index alemayehu et al 2017 strauch and volk 2013 valencia et al 2021 means that there was no need to consider differences in plant sensitivity to environmental factors in different regions and can lead to more accurate simulation of vegetation growth dynamics in a wider region although coupling the remote sensing based phenology datasets substantially improved the swat performance two limitations of the present study need to be pointed out first the simplified epic model based on accumulated heat unit was still used in this study to simulate vegetation growth dynamics whereas more complete vegetation growth model should be used in subsequent studies second in this research the swat model was modified by integrating observed phenology data but we could not predict the hydrological processes under future climate change here we explored the importance of phenology for hydrology process based models and note that the next step is to further improve the model prediction of phenological events under future climate change conditions the hydrological processes can be investigated by combining the phenology data which was simulated by phenological model under future climate change context however the accuracy of the current phenological model still needs to be improved fu et al 2020 liu et al 2016 richardson et al 2012 therefore we caution that in the subsequent studies we need to improve the accuracy of phenological model and couple it with hydrological models to ensure an accurate simulation of ecohydrology process under future climate change conditions chuine and r√©gni√®re 2017 fan et al 2020 hufkens et al 2018 5 conclusions in this study the vegetation growth module of the swat model was improved using remote sensing based vegetation phenology by optimizing the determination plant dormancy and the use of dynamic accumulated heat unit requirement by plants the modified swat model was compared with the original swat model in the han river basin the results show that the modified model greatly improved the simulation of vegetation growth dynamics and modestly improved runoff simulation it is also found that the original swat model significantly underestimated et in different lulc types as compared with the modified swat model analysis of the relationship between annual et and growing season length simulated by the original and modified swat models revealed that the original swat model was unable to accurately describe the intermediate process variables of the hydrological cycle process based hydrological models should be configured to consider the accuracy of plant growth dynamics simulation which could reduce the number of calibration parameter and help avoid overparameterization for runoff simulation at the cost of other hydrological processes the vegetation growth module and algorithms used to combine remote sensing data with the swat model can be generalized to other watershed models and be applied to support water resources planning and management that require understanding of the coupled ecological and hydrological processes data availability details of relevant meteorological driving data and measured

2588,the soil and water assessment tool swat model has been widely applied for simulating the water cycle and quantifying the influence of climate change and anthropogenic activities on hydrological processes a major uncertainty of swat stems from the poor representation of vegetation dynamics due to the use of a simplistic vegetation growth and development module using long term remote sensing based phenological data the swat model s vegetation module was improved by adding a dynamic growth start date and the dynamic heat requirement for vegetation growth rather than using constant values the new swat model was verified in the han river basin china and found its performance was much improved in comparison with that of the original swat model specifically the accuracy of the leaf area index lai simulation improved notably coefficient of determination r2 increased by 0 193 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse increased by 0 846 and percent bias decreased by 42 18 and that of runoff simulation improved modestly r2 increased by 0 05 and nse was similar additionally it is found that the original swat model substantially underestimated evapotranspiration penman monteith method in comparison with the new swat model 65 09 mm or 22 17 for forests 92 27 mm or 32 for orchards and 96 16 mm or 36 4 for farmland primarily due to the inaccurate representation of lai dynamics our results suggest that an accurate representation of phenological dates in the vegetation growth module is important for improving the swat model performance in terms of estimating terrestrial water and energy balance keywords vegetation phenology runoff swat modification lai simulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction vegetation as the key factor connecting the soil and the atmosphere in a terrestrial ecosystem plays a crucial role in the hydrological cycle rodriguez iturbe 2000 sprenger et al 2016 vegetation dynamics have many crucial effects on the terrestrial water cycle such as rainfall interception soil water transport evapotranspiration and soil property change kergoat 1998 tesemma et al 2015 webb and kathuria 2012 wei and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2018 the soil and water assessment tool swat model considers vegetation dynamics using a simplified version of the environmental policy impact climate epic growth module which simulates the seasonal leaf area index lai by employing a day length threshold and heat unit theory arnold et al 2012 williams et al 1989 although previous studies yang and zhang 2016 yang et al 2019 improved the swat model for simulating biomass accumulation of forests it is not applicable to all regions because vegetation dormancy is affected by other complex environmental factors in addition to day length rajib et al 2020 strauch and volk 2013 wagner et al 2011 consequently large uncertainties exist in the assessment of the terrestrial water cycle conducted using such hydrological models zhang et al 2020 therefore it is essential to improve the vegetation simulation module used in hydrological models to improve our understanding of ecosystem hydrological response to ongoing climate change the growth dynamics of terrestrial vegetation are substantially influenced by ongoing climate change over recent decades shukla et al 2019 for example vegetated regions are exhibiting enhanced greening piao et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 and phenology variation such as spring advancement and autumn postponement is occurring on the global scale gill et al 2015 jeong et al 2011 piao et al 2019 one of the major shortcomings of the swat model attributable to the use of the simplified epic module is that the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of vegetation is ignored which introduces challenges regarding the simulation of vegetation dynamics by introducing either the soil moisture index or precipitation to track vegetation in the new growing season the performance of swat model in the simulation of vegetation dynamics has been improved to a certain extent strauch and volk 2013 valencia et al 2021 however such improvement is observed mainly evergreen forest vegetation in tropical areas in swat defined as regions within latitudes between 20 s and 20 n so widespread regional applicability is limited the improved scheme of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis lai based on remote sensing observations has wide regional applicability but it requires high quality remote sensing data and increases the structural complexity of swat model simulations igder et al 2022 ma et al 2019 paul et al 2021 rajib et al 2020 the approach to defining vegetation growth dormancy using remote sensing based or observed vegetation phenology strikes a balance between model complexity and performance making it a promising candidate to improve the performance of vegetation dynamics and hydrologic simulation by the swat model in this study remote sensing based global inventory modeling and mapping studies 3rd generation gimms3g normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data was used to extract dates of phenological events with five different methods including threshold methods e g gaussian spline and savitzky golay and change ratio methods e g hants harmonic analysis of time series model and polyfit chen et al 2004 cong et al 2012 savitzky and golay 1964 and the phenological data was further linked with hydrological response units hrus using area weighted methods and modified the dormancy criteria of the vegetation module in the swat model specifically the extracted phenological dates based on satellite data were used as input to determine vegetation dormancy in the hrus instead of simply using latitude and day length to determine vegetation dormancy meanwhile on the basis of remote sensing based phenological dates of each hru the accumulated heat unit required for vegetation growth in the current year is calculated and the static accumulated heat unit constant in the vegetation database of the original swat model is replaced by the dynamic accumulated heat unit to verify the applicability of the modified swat model the model was tested for simulating lai and runoff for the han river basin china this study aims to achieve three specific objectives 1 obtain dates of vegetation phenology and its spatiotemporal patterns at the watershed scale 2 improve the simulation accuracy and applicability of the swat model in terms of vegetation growth by improving the dormancy module through the addition of the dynamic accumulated heat unit module and 3 explore the variation of vegetation related hydrological parameters and their rationalities in the changed vegetation growth module 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the han river

service is a semi distributed hydrological model based on physical processes arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 it can simulate different fluxes within the hydrological cycle such as evapotranspiration et surface runoff percolation lateral flow groundwater flow transmission and ponding over long periods in the swat model an entire river basin is divided into many hrus based on slope soil type and land use type the model simulates the spatial variation of the river basin on the basis of hydrological dynamics of each hru and then performs water routing for the river channel arnold et al 2012 current research on improving the vegetation growth module of the swat model is mainly based on defining dry and wet seasons through the soil moisture index or precipitation thereby tracking the beginning of new vegetation growing season and better simulating vegetation growth dynamics alemayehu et al 2017 ma et al 2019 rajib et al 2020 strauch and volk 2013 valencia et al 2021 vegetation dynamics play an important part in the hydrological cycle the swat model simulates annual lai dynamics of different vegetation types warm season annual legumes cold season annual legumes perennial legumes warm season annuals cold season annuals perennials and trees in each hru to reflect the vegetation dynamics within the river basin to a certain extent the vegetation module of the swat model is a simplified version of the epic model which simulates vegetation growth mainly on the basis of two theories heat unit theory and day length threshold theory williams et al 1989 2 3 1 plant growth module in swat temperature is one of the most important of the various factors that control plant growth each plant has a temperature range suitable for growth id est the lowest most suitable and highest temperatures at which plant growth can occur for each plant the minimum or base temperature must be reached before the plant will begin to grow generally above the base temperature the higher the temperature the faster the growth rate jobling 1997 however once the optimum temperature for plant growth is exceeded the rate of growth begins to slow and when the maximum temperature is reached growth stops the heat unit theory assumes that the plant growth trajectory such as plant maturation is proportional to the temperature increment when the average temperature is lower than the base temperature the plant will no longer grow and when the daily average temperature exceeds the base temperature the plant will grow boswell 1926 magoon and culpepper 1932 heat units in the swat model are calculated using a direct summation index with one heat unit for each degree celsius of daily mean temperature above the base temperature however the application of the heat unit theory in the swat model does not consider the influence of harmful high temperatures on plants instead it is assumed that all temperatures higher than the base temperature will accelerate the growth and development of crops the heat accumulation unit for a given day is calculated as follows 1 hu t av t base t av t base where hu is the heat unit accumulated on a given day t av is the average daily temperature and t base represents the base or minimum temperature required for plant growth the total heat units required for a plant to reach maturity is calculated as follows 2 phu d 1 m hu where phu denotes the total heat units required for a plant to reach maturity hu is the accumulated heat unit on day d where d 1 represents the sowing date or the end date of the dormant period and m is the number of days needed for the plant to reach maturity it should be noted that phu could also represent potential heat units in the swat model the dormant date is defined by the day length threshold theory when the day length reaches the calculated threshold for a given location plant dormancy will occur the day length threshold is calculated as follows 3 t dl t h r t dl m n t dorm t dl t h r is the threshold of day length at the beginning of the dormant period h t dl m n is the shortest day length in a year in the river basin h and t dorm is the hibernation threshold h in autumn when the day length is shorter plants in the catchment except warm season annuals enter a dormant period the dormant threshold t dorm varies with latitude as follows 4 t dorm 1 0 œï 40 n o r s 5 t dorm œï 20 20 20 n o r s œï 40 n o r s 6 t dorm 0 0 œï 20 n o r s where t dorm denotes the dormancy threshold which is used to reflect the difference of dormancy time at different latitudes h and œï denotes the latitude in positive values there are theoretical uncertainties in the two theories mentioned above when simulating the growth process of vegetation first the dormant period of vegetation is judged simply on the basis of latitude and photoperiod whereas complex interactions between different environmental factors actually determine the dormancy period and the starting conditions rohde and bhalerao 2007 the current approach in swat ignores the differences in the dormancy period of vegetation at different locations at the same latitude second the accumulated heat unit demand of each plant of a particular land use land cover lulc is given as a constant value which is inconsistent with the findings of previous studies showing that heat requirements change with growing conditions for instance a warmer winter can enhance the accumulated heat unit requirements of plants by reducing the chilling period of vegetation wang et al 2020 yu et al 2010 the accumulated heat units required by vegetation change annually and the use of a fixed accumulated heat unit requirement can lead to large uncertainties in the length of the simulated growing season 2 3 2 developments of the growth module in swat recognizing the aforementioned limitations vegetation growth cycles should be initiated dynamically rather than through management operations e g plant and kill that prescribe the dates or fractions of phu for each simulation year thus the vegetation dormancy was modified and the heat unit requirement was accumulated from the original swat2012 model version 681 https swat tamu edu so that no management operation was applied during the set up of the modified model in the following sections the specific principles and details of model improvements were explained fig s1 2 3 2 1 phenology extraction the dates of occurrence of phenological events are critical in the vegetation growing season in this research five different phenological extraction methods i e the hants maximum method spline midpoint method gaussian midpoint method timesat sg method and polyfit maximum method cong et al 2012 savitzky and golay 1964 were used to estimate spring start of growing season sos and autumn end of growing season eos phenological events in the han river basin using the gimms3g ndvi data two processes were applied to extract the phenology data 1 application of smoothing and interpolation to obtain daily time series ndvi data and 2 use of the phenological phase extraction method based either on the threshold value here 0 5 and 0 2 as the threshold for sos and eos respectively or the maximum rate of change piao et al 2006 reed et al 1994 white et al 2009 white et al 1997 due to the different fitting methods interpolation methods and threshold settings of different extraction methods the extracted phenology results are often different from the in situ vegetation phenology observations in the present studies cong et al 2012 fu et al 2021 mostly through the average of multiple methods to reduce the differences as with most ways this study used the average of five methods as the phenology extraction results to reduce the uncertainty caused by a single method to reduce uncertainties associated with a single method the mean value of the extracted phenological indexes from the five methods was used as the observed phenology data for the studied river basin 2 3 2 2 mapping grid phenology value into hrus the phenological events derived from remote sensing ndvi data have a spatial resolution of 0 05 whereas the simulation of the hydrological cycle process in the swat model is based on hrus providing annual phenological records to each hru by linking the phenological data with each hru is the premise for further model improvement the technology of the swat modflow method was leveraged kim et al 2008 to build a fishnet in arcgis 10 2 software to match the gridded data with the spatial position of each hru and generate statistics for the grid cells by averaging the gridded values over each hru fig 2 the average phenological dates i e sos and eos for each hru were estimated on the basis of weighted coefficients calculated from the area size of the overlapped region to reconcile the spatial mismatch between the grid phenology data and the irregular polygons of the hrus used in the swat model simulation the area weight of the hru phenological period was determined as follows 7 hr u phenology i 1 n g r i d v a l u e i o v e r l a p a r e a i t o t a l a r e a hru where hr u phenology stands for the phenology date i e sos or eos of a year for a given hru t o t a l a r e a hru denotes the total area of a given hru g r i d v a l u e i represents the phenology data value of the grid in which the i th subblock of the hru is located o v e r l a p a r e a i represents the area occupied by the i th subblock and n is the number of overlapping subblocks into which the hru is divided 2 3 2 3 dormant module modification in this study the source code of the plant dormancy module of the swat model dormant f used for determining the dormant status of vegetation was modified for trees with a vegetation type index of 7 e g frst and orcd the day length threshold is no longer used to determine whether the trees are at the critical point between the dormancy period and the growing season instead the extracted phenology data were used to determine the growth state of trees on a simulated day and the accuracy of the model simulation was optimized on the basis of the actual growth state of trees the lai modeling during leaf senescence for perennials was also modified using the approach introduced by strauch and volk 2013 fig 3 8 lai la i mx l a i min 1 e t 9 witht 12 r 0 5 a n d r 1 f r phu 1 f r phu s e n f r phu f r phu s e n where the term used as the exponent is a function of time t and t ranges from 6 to 6 lai is the leaf area index for a given day that declines at rate r la i mx and la i min are the maximum and minimum alai min minimum lai for the plant during the dormant period m2 m2 lai values respectively and f r phu s e n is the fraction of the growing season phu over which senescence becomes the dominant growth process 2 3 2 4 dynamic heat unit requirement in the modified swat model the accumulated heat unit requirement i e the average daily temperature above base temperature base t between sos and eos for annual vegetation growth was calculated using the remote sensing vegetation phenology the calculated value phu plt was used to replace the fixed accumulated heat unit requirement for specific plants in the plant parameters database plant dat fig 4 2 3 2 5 model calibration and validation in this study the stepwise calibration method was adopted for the modeled lai and runoff in the modified model calibration of runoff and lai was conducted for 2004 2010 and validation was performed for 2011 2014 for the original model only runoff was calibrated but the time series used for calibration and validation were the same as those used for the modified model to obtain comparable results and for the assessment of the effect of inaccurate representation of vegetation dynamics the original swat model was not calibrated for lai which is not an unusual practice alemayehu et al 2017 rajib et al 2020 valencia et al 2021 three years were added at the beginning of each simulation as a spin up period necessary to approximate initial conditions especially for soil moisture envi 5 3 software was used to clip the glass lai with three main lulc types frst orcd and agrl using the hrus as borders and all raster data belonging to the same lulc type were extracted and their average values were taken as the observed lai values in the study area the first step of the stepwise calibration was to do lai calibration calibration of lai which through a combination of manual trial and error process and automatic pso particle swarm optimization marini and walczak 2015 methods was performed to determine the optimum parameters in the plant database plant dat for the initialization of parameters the parameters were restricted to be generated within truly acceptable intervals e g alai min bali dlai frgrw1 frgrw2 laimx1 laimx2 and t base it should be noted that phu plt the total number of heat units or growing degree days needed to bring plants to maturity does not need to be calibrated because it is a dynamic value determined by the accumulated heat unit module to evaluate the agreement between the simulated and observed lai values three performance criteria were used which include the coefficient of determination r2 describes the proportion of the variance in measured data explained by the model percent bias pbias measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than the observations and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse which is calculated as one minus the ratio of the error variance of the modeled time series divided by the variance of the observed time series and applied as the objective function for the model optimization the second step of the stepwise calibration method was runoff calibration both the modified and the original swat model were calibrated and the settings of the calibration process were kept consistent for two versions of the model to exclude any artificial differences in the models performance due to the calibration settings in swat cup 2019 version 5 2 1 abbaspour 2008 arnold et al 2012 the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm was used to conduct sensitivity analysis uncertainty analysis propagation of the uncertainties in the parameters leads to uncertainties in the model output variables which are expressed as the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu and the 95ppu envelop gets smaller with the iteration and the uncertainty gets smaller and automatic parameter calibration process abbaspour et al 2004 for sensitivity analysis following the literature 26 parameters that have greatest impact on the hydrological process were selected and then 12 of the most sensitive parameters were yielded for model calibration the value range of each of these parameters was defined within an acceptable true and reliable range the sufi 2 algorithm was used to calibrate model parameters for daily runoff data in each iteration 1000 simulations were applied and the parameter ranges were updated with the next iteration selection via latin hypercube sampling stein 1987 and the uncertainty of runoff simulation was indicated using p factor and r factor fig s2 to compare the differences in runoff simulation performance between the original swat model and the modified swat model the performance criteria proposed by moriasi 2007 that included nse the objective function r2 and pbias table s1 were adopted moriasi et al 2007 3 results 3 1 phenology in the han river basin there are some numerical differences among the phenology extraction results obtained from five extraction methods but they all have similar spatial patterns and the phenology extraction results of five methods indicate that there is clear spatial heterogeneity of vegetation phenology in the han river basin figs 5 and s3 for the entire basin the sos ranged from day of year doy 81 118 average doy 104 with a 37 day s difference and the eos ranged from doy 280 341 average doy 325 with a 61 day s difference the spatial distribution pattern of vegetation phenology was similar to that of lulc type fig 1c the earliest sos occurs in agrl followed by frst and then orcd and the same orders for eos there was no significant difference in eos between frst and orcd the mann kendall trend analysis method croitoru et al 2012 was used to estimate the trends in phenological changes and we further investigated the spatial pattern of the trends in han river basin the results show that the sos of the entire han river basin had experienced significant advance 0 52 day year during 1982 2015 whereas the eos had not shown an obvious trend of change 0 02 day year figs 5 and s4 significant eos delays were found in small parts of the upper and lower reaches of the han river basin while significant eos advances were found in the middle reaches at the same latitude there were evident differences in vegetation phenology and in the same region grid phenology can also change markedly over time which uninsistent the assumptions made in the epic model regarding the dominant role of latitude in plant dormancy arnold et al 2012 williams et al 1989 see fig 5 3 2 lai calibration and validation the optimum calibrated parameters in the swat plant database plant dat are listed in supplementary table s2 the performance of the original swat model in simulating lai was worse than that of the modified swat model and the original swat model failed to represent the observed lai curve and extreme values as evidenced by the high biases and negative or low correlations table 2 moreover the original swat model could not match the remote sensing data in terms of either the value or the key time nodes of the lai curve of the vegetation growth period there are two principal shortcomings in the performance of the original swat model fig 6 1 inaccuracy in the lai extreme value simulation and 2 inaccuracy in the simulation of both the growing season length and the time nodes of the dormant period with regard to the first the simulated highest and lowest lai values were different from the observed lai determined the swat model assumes that lai is zero at the beginning of each simulation year which is unrealistic for vegetation dynamics with regard to the second the growing season of the simulated lai curve of the original swat model did not correspond well to the growing season of the remote sensing lai curve there was a mismatch between the start and end dates of the growing season and the length of the growing season was not in accord with the actual situation in contrast the modified swat model improved the simulation performance more in frst and orcd consist with observed lai than that in agrl some uncertainties remain overall the modified swat model outperformed the original swat model in reproducing lai observations and intra annual lai variations as indicated by the correlation values 3 3 runoff calibration and validation the original and modified swat models were both calibrated for runoff by varying 12 of the most sensitive runoff related parameters determined by sensitivity analysis supplementary table s3 it is found that the sensitivity of runoff to these parameters changed to differing degrees after the modification of the swat model which meant that the order of the 12 most sensitive parameters was not the same for the two models the best fit parameters when the objective function nse value reaches the optimal value of two swat models and their acceptable ranges i e the ranges of parameter values in each simulation that were acceptable for reality after calibration are listed in supplementary table s4 comparison of daily original swat model and modified swat model simulated runoff and multiple criteria evaluation results with observations for the calibration 2004 2010 and validation 2011 2014 periods are presented in fig 7 the calibration period has considered different precipitation regimes as it included wet normal and dry years and the evaluation period also considered both wet and normal year both the original and modified simulated hydrographs presented a reasonable reproduction of observations while the differences between modified and original model simulated runoff show that the modified model simulated smaller runoff in spring and larger runoff in summer than the original model which is closely linked to vegetation dynamics the r2 nse and pbias multiple criteria results showed that both the original and the modified swat models could be considered good 0 65 nse 0 75 0 65 r2 0 75 maybe limited by uncertainty induced by the gauging station number and more gauging stations may provide better model performance and the runoff simulation of both swat models showed better performance in the validation period than in the calibration period the modified swat model was modestly superior to the original swat model in terms of runoff simulation as evidenced by the higher r2 and nse values in the calibration and similar in the validation periods nevertheless the original swat model can show high performance in reproducing runoff by applying different parameter values with the same effect despite having low capability in simulating lai dynamics figs 6 and 7 fig 8 3 4 impact of improved lai simulation on evapotranspiration in basin scale hydrological simulation vegetation dynamics mainly regulate the hydrological cycle process by influencing et there are three main methods for swat to simulate et the penman monteith method allen 1986 allen et al 1989 monteith 1965 priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 and hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 the penman monteith method is a popular method that has been used in many previous studies abiodun et al 2018 parajuli et al 2018 the penman monteith method includes the energy required to maintain evaporation length of path of water vapor transport aerodynamic factors and surface impedance factors primarily vegetation influences et by influencing aerodynamic impedance and vegetation canopy impedance parameters theoretically a more accurate simulation of vegetation dynamics and a more realistic lai should bring more accurate performance in et simulation the difference in the et simulation results between the modified swat model and the original swat model is believed caused by the difference attributable to dynamic simulation of vegetation growth it is found that the simulated et value of the modified swat model was higher 65 09 mm 22 17 for frst 92 27 mm 32 for orcd and 96 16 mm 36 4 for agrl than that of the original swat model and that this difference occurred mainly in spring and autumn figs 8 and s5 moreover there was a significant underestimation of et in the original swat model simulation compared with the modified swat model especially in spring and autumn 4 discussion 4 1 changes of phenology on the basin scale in this study the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of phenology in the han river basin were extracted fig 5 and the results revealed that phenology had a multiyear change trend and spatial dissimilation that was universal in different regions of the northern hemisphere badeck et al 2004 pe√±uelas and filella 2009 piao et al 2019 phenology shows different patterns with consistent but differing degrees of trend i e sos advance and eos delay in different climatic zones and their responses to climate change were different owing to complex interactions among various environmental factors e g temperature photoperiod precipitation and radiation delbart et al 2008 fu et al 2015 richardson et al 2006 richardson et al 2013 yuan et al 2020 the phenological distribution and variation characteristics of vegetation were closely related to climatic zone and vegetation type in the simulation of vegetation growth dynamics on the basin scale a single and simple method which calculates vegetation phenology based on fixed day length threshold and neglects corresponding multi process and multi factor impacts cannot accurately track the spatial and temporal variation of characteristics of vegetation phenology would increase the simulation error and uncertainty liu et al 2018 thus the simulation of the entire hydrological energy cycle could be influenced by the effect on et and other processes 4 2 advantages of the modified swat over the default swat model there are notable differences between the modified and original swat models in terms of their capability in reproducing vegetation dynamics through lai fig 6 for example the simulation performance of the modified swat model for both frst and orcd was better than that for agrl which was primarily because only the dynamic accumulated heat unit was considered in agrl and no management operation was set in this study in fact irrigation and other management operations existed in agrl and orcd while irrigation and other management operations affect agrl more than orcd for in orcd lai is mainly decided by the tree canopy management operations are usually not concerned about the growth of tree leaves unless there are plant diseases and insect pests and in agrl lai is closely related to the growth and development stage and state of crops controlled by sowing irrigation harvesting and other management measures moreover the modified swat model also improved the simulation accuracy of runoff modestly fig 7 although the modified and original swat models both achieved good runoff simulation performance two different sets of model parameters were obtained in the process of runoff calibration this is because one of the shortcomings of reverse modeling is that there could be cases where different sets of parameters in the model produce the same effect beven 2002 ruddell et al 2019 the differences of model parameter sets induce to the differences of hydrological intermediate process which regulate the water balance of different components in those processes the accurate simulation of runoff and vegetation dynamics can optimize the simulation of hydrological intermediate processes especially eco hydrological processes by comparing the differences between simulation and gleam v3 3a soil moisture content the results show that the modified model has greater advantages than the original model in the simulation of soil moisture content especially in frst and orcd the original model was underestimated by 22 4 frst 18 2 orcd and 24 9 agrl than gleam v3 3a soil water content respectively while the modified model has 1 97 overestimation in orcd 1 90 underestimation in frst and 7 62 underestimation in agrl than gleam v3 3a soil water content fig 9 accurate simulation of vegetation dynamics can guide the calibration algorithm to converge to a reliable parameter set that can accurately simulate the eco hydrological process and reduce the model structural uncertainty the regression relationship between annual et and growing season length simulated by the original and modified swat models revealed that the original swat model not only had considerable uncertainty in terms of the simulation of growing season length but also the relationship between et and growing season length in the simulation results were inconsistent with that of previous studies et increase with the extension of gsl geng et al 2020 and the modified swat model revealed that growing season extended one day will increase evapotranspiration by 11 1 mm across forests frst and orcd fig 10 the improved model resolved these two problems that strongly limit the capability of hydrological models i e the original swat model in the present case to produce reliable results that could support informed decision making kirchner 2006 valencia et al 2021 determining the dormant period of vegetation using vegetation phenology extracted from remote sensing rather than by indirectly tracking that using environmental factors e g precipitation and soil moisture index alemayehu et al 2017 strauch and volk 2013 valencia et al 2021 means that there was no need to consider differences in plant sensitivity to environmental factors in different regions and can lead to more accurate simulation of vegetation growth dynamics in a wider region although coupling the remote sensing based phenology datasets substantially improved the swat performance two limitations of the present study need to be pointed out first the simplified epic model based on accumulated heat unit was still used in this study to simulate vegetation growth dynamics whereas more complete vegetation growth model should be used in subsequent studies second in this research the swat model was modified by integrating observed phenology data but we could not predict the hydrological processes under future climate change here we explored the importance of phenology for hydrology process based models and note that the next step is to further improve the model prediction of phenological events under future climate change conditions the hydrological processes can be investigated by combining the phenology data which was simulated by phenological model under future climate change context however the accuracy of the current phenological model still needs to be improved fu et al 2020 liu et al 2016 richardson et al 2012 therefore we caution that in the subsequent studies we need to improve the accuracy of phenological model and couple it with hydrological models to ensure an accurate simulation of ecohydrology process under future climate change conditions chuine and r√©gni√®re 2017 fan et al 2020 hufkens et al 2018 5 conclusions in this study the vegetation growth module of the swat model was improved using remote sensing based vegetation phenology by optimizing the determination plant dormancy and the use of dynamic accumulated heat unit requirement by plants the modified swat model was compared with the original swat model in the han river basin the results show that the modified model greatly improved the simulation of vegetation growth dynamics and modestly improved runoff simulation it is also found that the original swat model significantly underestimated et in different lulc types as compared with the modified swat model analysis of the relationship between annual et and growing season length simulated by the original and modified swat models revealed that the original swat model was unable to accurately describe the intermediate process variables of the hydrological cycle process based hydrological models should be configured to consider the accuracy of plant growth dynamics simulation which could reduce the number of calibration parameter and help avoid overparameterization for runoff simulation at the cost of other hydrological processes the vegetation growth module and algorithms used to combine remote sensing data with the swat model can be generalized to other watershed models and be applied to support water resources planning and management that require understanding of the coupled ecological and hydrological processes data availability details of relevant meteorological driving data and measured

2589,duo to the influence of anthropogenic and climate change the traditional drought or hot event identification indices under the stationary assumption of the probabilistic behavior of a hydrometeorological variable could be no longer valid this study proposed a nonstationary framework for the identification of compound dry hot extremes and risk assessment considering climate change for the warm season during the period 1901 2017 in weihe river basin wrb and fenhe river basin frb china the proposed framework is composed of three phases 1 calculating nonstationary precipitation index nspi and standardized temperature index nsti by incorporating large scale climate indices as covariates of fitted distribution parameters 2 calculating nonstationary compound dry hot index ncdh based on nonstationary copula models and 3 bivariate nonstationary risk analysis of compound dry hot events through two regional characteristics called relative affected area ra and mean severity of area msa the proposed ncdh using climate indices as covariates was found to be superior in capturing compound dry hot characteristics and revealing the trend of temporal and spatial changes of wrb over the period of 1901 2017 based on the nonstationary risk assessment of regional characteristics the occurrence risk of compound extremes in sub basin 1 of wrb was less than that in the other two sub basins considering the importance of nonstationarity during the above three modelling phases the nonstationarity in the 1st phase modelling of average precipitation ap and average temperature at to derive nspi and nsti could have a greater impact on the final results of nonstationary risk assessment of compound dry hot events than nonstationarity in the other two phases this nonstationary compound dry hot index provides a new insight into compound extreme identification and risk assessment that can adapt to a changing environment keywords compound dry hot extremes dynamic copula nonstationarity risk multivariate data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction frequencies and intensities of extreme events in the context of an anthropogenic warming climate especially hot extremes and drought events have experienced a substantial increase on a wide range of temporal and spatial scales all over the world zscheischler et al 2018 miralles et al 2019 alizadeh et al 2020 wang et al 2020 abatzoglou et al 2021 wang et al 2021 owing to the significantly adverse impacts triggered by these extreme events individually the occurrence probabilities of hazardous states of one corresponding variable at a time have commonly been quantified by conventional climate risk analyses zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 the concurrence of extreme hydroclimatic events i e compound dry hot extremes causes more disastrous impacts on agricultural productivity human health and ecosystem than does a single extreme event guerreiro et al 2018 as a result assessment of dynamic variations of compound dry and hot events is essential for determining potential driving forces which control the evolution of these concurrent events wu et al 2020 systematic integration of climatic information from multiple related to the properties of these compound dry hot events helps reflect their multivariate nature leonard et al 2014 much of the literature has quantitatively assessed the compound drought heatwave events from two perspectives 1 a certain threshold based frequency variability assessment by extracting frequencies of concurrences of drought and hot extremes for the period of interest mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 miao et al 2016 zscheischler et al 2018 chen et al 2019 ribeiro et al 2020 2 a joint index covering multiple extremes or events which can quantify different properties such as severity level and spatial extent for compound dry hot extremes gallant et al 2014 wu et al 2019 wu et al 2020 hao et al 2020 for instance the climate extremes index cei proposed by gallant et al 2014 can be established by integrating multiple extremes with linear averaging of the areas covered by different extreme indicators in recent years copulas accounting for the dependence structure of multiple contributing variables have been employed to measure the overall severity of compound droughts and hot extremes for example hao et al 2019 2020 first proposed the standardized compound event indicator scei at a monthly scale to quantify the potential severity of compound dry hot events by normalizing the joint cumulative probability of dry hot events li et al 2021 applied a daily scale joint index called the standardized compound drought and heat index scdhi to quantify sub monthly characteristics of compound dry and hot events and to monitor their initiation development and decay with these above systematic joint indexes the frequency severity duration and intensity of compound dry hot events can be quantified the above mentioned joint indexes assessing the compound dry hot events are all based on the underlying assumption that the hydrological processes and meteorological time series are stationary as a result of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions climate is changing altering the composition of earth s atmosphere which has not only increased the complexity of hydrometeorological simulations but has also necessitated the incorporation of nonstationarities in modelling hydrometeorological variables milly et al 2008 xiong et al 2015 bl√∂schl et al 2017 kundzewicz et al 2018 xu et al 2020a 2020b therefore recent literature has focused on nonstationarity of hydrometeorological variables caused by significant trend abrupt changes or periodicity razmi et al 2017 salas and obeysekera 2014 vasiliades et al 2015 zeng et al 2017 for meteorological drought quantified by standardized precipitation index spi some researchers have applied nonstationary spi nspi to assess temporal variations of drought which assume that the scale parameter of gamma distribution for spi can change with time li et al 2015 park et al 2019 russo et al 2013 song et al 2020 in the context of climate change nonstationarity has been incorporated in not only drought analysis but also the hazard assessment of extreme precipitation and floods in which the parameter set of potential best fitted distribution exhibits a linear or nonlinear relation with time bender et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 rosner et al 2014 salas and obeysekera 2014 sarhadi et al 2016 sarhadi and soulis 2017 yan et al 2017 xu et al 2020b or some physical covariates e g large scale climate driving factors agilan and umamahesh 2017 liu et al 2017 gu et al 2019 razmi et al 2017 su and chen 2019 vasiliades et al 2015 villarini et al 2009 xiong et al 2015 xu et al 2020a yilmaz et al 2017 parallel to the potential nonstationarity existing in a drought index it is essential to incorporate the nonstationary characteristics into the standardized compound dry hot event indicator cdh monitoring the compound dry hot conditions several studies in china have focused on a systematic understanding of compound dry hot events at different temporal and spatial scales chen et al 2019 hao et al 2019 wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 however they have mostly focused on the frequency and severity of compound dry hot events under stationary assumption therefore it is necessary to apply the nonstationary cdh index to detect and monitor the compound dry hot events with consideration of environmental changes the main objective of this study therefore was to develop a dynamic extreme joint index nonstationary compound dry hot event index ncdh for detecting compound droughts and hot extremes with the use of time varying copula models sarhadi et al 2016 xu et al 2020a 2020b accounting for the dependence of multiple variables we also applied dynamic copula based bivariate frequency analysis considering the severity and affected area of compound dry hot events these two properties severity and area of compound dry hot events were extracted from the grid based hydrometeorological dataset of weihe river basin of china by the nonstationary monitoring index ncdh since there are teleconnections between larger scale climate indices and drought or heatwaves in many regions across the world climate indices were incorporated as covariates of ncdh 2 study area and dataset weihe river basin which is located in northwest china fig 1 embraces fragile ecological environment and experiences frequent natural disasters compound dry hot extreme events have posed a significant impact on the regional economic structure and the rational development and utilization of water resources according to the water system distribution characteristics the whole basin can be divided into three sub basins the main stream of the weihe river sub basin 3 in fig 1 the jinghe river basin sub basin 2 in fig 1 and the beiluo river basin sub basin 1 in fig 1 in order to distinguish the effects of compound dry hot extreme events over three sub basins grid based datasets were used to make nonstationary risk assessment of compound dry hot extreme events at regional scale considering climate change monthly precipitation and temperature data peng et al 2019 at 0 0083333 1 km spatial resolution ranging from 1901 to 2017 were applied which were obtained from loess plateau science data center national earth system science data sharing infrastructure national science technology infrastructure china https loess geodata cn for quantifying significant impacts of compound dry hot events on humanity and agriculture in summer the average precipitation ap and temperature at during june july august jja at each grid were first calculated and then the ncdh under nonstationary conditions was derived using eqs 4 and 5 3 methodology a dynamic copula based framework for the identification of compound dry hot events and risk assessment considering nonstationarity is presented in fig 2 as shown in this figure the proposed methodology involves three phases of nonstationary modelling of the average precipitation ap and temperature at time series extracted from grid based data 1 k m 1 k m 1 1st phase ns m1 applying dynamic gamma distribution for ap and normal distribution for at through the likelihood ratio lr test in order to realize the nonstationary identification of drought events by nonstationary standard precipitation index nspi and hot events by nonstationary standard temperature index nsti 2 2nd phase ns m2 deriving the compound dry hot events index ncdh from the joint probability of nspi or spi and nsti sti obtained from dynamic copula fitting 3 3nd phase ns m3 applying nonstationary copula modelling for the dependence structure between two characteristics of dry hot events relative affected area ra and mean severity of area msa which were from extracted grid based ncdh data under a certain threshold value of ncdh as shown in the flowchart the lr tests were run through all three phases of modelling in order to assure the rationality of nonstationary detection a time varying joint return period under the and scenario was implemented for nonstationary risk assessment salvadori and de michele 2004 it is known that the hydrometeorological system is influenced by large scale climate patterns such as el ni√±o southern oscillation enso southern oscillation index soi and north atlantic oscillation nao wang et al 2015 sarhadi and soulis 2017 el ni√±o 3 southern oscillation enso which is derived from the large scale ocean atmosphere interactions had been found been critical driver to the droughts in the yellow river basin dong and ren 1996 wang et al 2006 studies showed that precipitation in east asia could be influenced by the surface temperature sst anomalies in the north pacific ocean and indian ocean which would lead to the variations of wet dry conditions in the yellow river basin moy et al 2002 wang et al 2019 applied the cross wavelet approach to verify the finding that drought in the yrb are highly correlated with enso the northern atlantic oscillation is correlated with the warm phase of the north atlantic sst which would be conducive to easterly wind anomalies in northern china and less precipitation or more frequent droughts in the semi arid subarea in the upper reaches of the yellow river yu et al 2014 have revealed that fluctuations in nao in yrb could significantly influence climatic factors such as air temperature precipitation the soi is the index of enso events like el ni√±o and la ni√±a events and has certain effects on precipitation in yrb fu et al 2007 li et al 2016 meng et al 2021 the ni√±o 3 sea surface temperature sst was used as a measure of the amplitude of el ni√±o 3 southern oscillation enso the ni√±o 3 sst index nino3 was defined as the seasonal sst averaged over the central pacific 5 s to 5 n 90 150 w in order to reflect the impact of climate change over compound dry hot events we employed the three phases of nonstationary modelling including marginal fitting and copula fitting with distribution parameters incorporating large scale climate indicators nao soi and nino3 as covariates to derive the nonstationary compound dry hot extreme index ncdh given the ncdh index nonstationary risk assessment of the compound dry hot events for each sub basin at regional scale described by relative affected area ra and mean severity of area msa is made 3 1 construction of a nonstationary spi sti considering climate change the traditional paradigm of spi and sti calculations mckee et al 1993 involved gamma and normal distributions fitted for different time scales of precipitation and temperature series respectively on the basis of stationary hypothesis due to substantial anthropogenic activities as well as climate change the applicability of stationary hypothesis has been challenged milly et al 2008 instead of considering the time scale effect of precipitation and temperature data the nonstationary spi and sti based on average precipitation ap and temperature at during june july august jja respectively was calculated because of the emphasis on dry hot events during the summer season for economy of space we only show the procedure for calculating nspi while nsti was calculated in the same way let s represents the precipitation series then its dynamic probability density function based on the two parameter gamma distribution can be described as follows 1 f x 1 œÉ t Œ∫ t s Œ∫ t 1 exp s Œ∫ t Œ≥ Œ∫ t œÉ t 0 Œ∫ t 0 where œÉ t and Œ∫ t denote the scale and shape parameters respectively and Œ≥ is the mathematical function Œ∏ t œÉ t Œ∫ t here Œ∏ t is the parameter set composed of œÉ t and Œ∫ t since we incorporated the large scale climate indicators as covariates of gamma distribution parameters the assumed linear relation between the large scale climate indicators and Œ∏ t was established as 2 Œ∏ t constant Œ∏ 0 Œ∏ 1 t Œ∏ 0 Œ∏ 1 c o v t where cov t is the time varying large scale climate indicator time is also assumed as a potential covariate of the parameter sets in terms of the time lagging effect on the relation between extreme variables average precipitation ap and large scale climate indicators he and guan 2014 the nao soi nino3 value with 1 month to 3 months prior to the average precipitation series of jja was considered since the focus was on grid based data many types of assumed stationary and nonstationary gamma models table s1 a were checked by the lr test for each grid based ap time series in considerations of the combined effect of all above covariates climate drivers and time we used step wise model selecting strategy to derive the best fitted nonstationary models 1 the corrected akaike information criterion aic c combined with lr tests to select the potential models sga nsga1 nsga30 in the first step 2 for the potential models whose aic c value of nonstationary model nsga1 nsga30 is less than that of stationary model sga the linear superposition effect of the covariates belonging to the potential nonstationary model in first step by substituting the problem of univariate linear regression eq 2 into multivariate linear regression problem is considered for secondary optimization analysis through aicc criterion and lr tests then the best selected nonstationary gamma distribution was transformed into the standard normal distribution to derive the nspi value for each grid let sgau represent the stationary gamma model for ap while ngaui be a certain time varying model with trend existing in the parameter the lr test was applied to check whether potential trend caused nonstationarity would exist or not coles 2001 xu et al 2020a 2020b 3 lr 2 ll n g a u 1 i ll sgau where ll n g a u 1 i represents the maximum likelihood value of every potential nonstationary model here ngaui and ll sgau is the maximum likelihood value of the stationary model ll sgau denotes the null trend assumption the rejection of the null trend assumption stands for the situation when the p value of lr test was smaller than that at the significance level of 5 the nonstationary models which can pass the lr tests should also experience the dynamic goodness of fit gof k s tests based on the kolmogorov smirnov k s test at a significance level of 5 to verify the fit of the potential nonstationary or stationary gamma models the corrected akaike information criterion aic c was employed to quantify the goodness of fit of the distribution models the metrics of the best fitted gamma distribution should correspond to the smallest aicc and a relatively smaller or bigger p value of lr 5 and k s 5 tests after the best fitted dynamic gamma model selection the cumulative probability of ap series was transformed into nspi through the standard normal distribution parallel to the approach to derive the nspi index the nsti index calculation also involves the nonstationary normal distribution modelling based on the lr and k s tests and aicc criterion the potential nonstationary normal distributions are presented in table s1 b 3 2 construction of a nonstationary compound dry hot index ncdh considering climate change hao et al 2019 and wu et al 2019 2020 first proposed the compound dry hot index cdh by establishing the joint probability of bivariate random variables spi and sti here under stationary hypothesis parallel to the nonstationary spi sti calculation the nonstationarity should also be incorporated in the process of deriving the cdh index due to the potential link between large scale climate indicators and extreme events considering nonstationarity let x and y represent the drought events quantified by nspi and the hot events quantified by nsti respectively since the evaluation of compound dry hot events focuses on the situation that nspi is lower than or equal to a particular threshold x x while nsti is bigger than or equal to a particular threshold y y another variable z y is defined here to simplify the calculation process the joint probability distribution of f x z x z with time varying parameters can be defined as follows 4 f x y x z p x x z z c u v Œ∏ c t where Œ∏ c t is the dynamic copula parameters of joint distribution fitted for dependence structure between nspi and nsti time series uandv are the marginal distributions of x and z respectively parallel to the way of calculating the dynamic gamma parameters as shown in eq 2 the large scale climate indicators are also assumed as potential covariates of copula parameters the corrected akaike information criterion aic c and lr test were employed to quantify the goodness of fit of the distributions the maximum likelihood method was used to estimate the dynamic copula parameters the gaussian copula was found suitable to model both positive and negative dependences among multiple variables hao et al 2017 van de vyver and van den bergh 2018 so 11 kinds of nonstationary gaussian copula table s2 were selected as the potential copula models to illustrate the joint distribution function the dynamic joint probability distribution f x z x z can be employed as a metrics to quantify the joint status of dry and hot extreme events under nonstationary conditions the joint probability distribution f x z x z was then transformed to a uniform distribution by using the empirical gringorten eg plotting position formula which was then standardized as a normal index to quantify the severity of compound dry and hot events thus the nonstationary compound drought hot extreme index ncdh based on the standardization of the above eg can be expressed as 5 ncdh œÜ 1 e g f x z x z where the lower n c d h value shows the condition with lower precipitation and higher temperature with negative effects which is of practical interest since nonstationarity has been incorporated into the cdh index the variations of large scale climate indicators would lead to the evolution of compound dry hot extreme event status 3 3 definition of compound dry hot events and their characteristics after ncdh is derived thresholds must be set to distinguish individual compound dry hot events similar to the thresholds of spi to characterize different categories of drought compound dry and hot conditions can also be classified into several groups according to thresholds details of the upper and lower boundary set for the conditions can be found in wu et al 2019 2020 in this study we set the threshold value as 0 5 to focus on the abnormal compound dry hot condition ncdh 0 5 two kinds of regional characteristics called relative affected area ra and mean severity of area msa were used to quantify the risk of compound dry hot extreme events corresponding to each sub basin theoretically the minimum value of affected area is zero and the maximum affected area is the total area of each sub basin for convenience of risk assessment in the following section we defined the relative affected area ra and the mean severity of area msa as follows 6 m t n grid t n total 7 r a t l n 1 m t 1 m min 8 m s a t i 1 n grid t ncdh i n grid t where n grid t is the number of grids which corresponds to the abnormal compound dry hot condition with ncdh smaller than 0 5 in year t while n total is the total number of grids of each sub basin m t is the relative area of the t th year if we have 60 years of data m min is the minimum value of m t t 1 2 60 in order to make the range of m t fall in 0 eq 6 is transformed into eq 7 to get r a t 3 4 joint probability distribution for ra and msa here dynamic copula models were used second time to construct the joint distribution of ra and msa 9 h r a m s a p r a ra 0 m s a msa 0 c u v Œ∏ c t where u and v are the marginal distributions of ra and msa here ra0 and msa0 is a random quantile pair of regional characteristics before constructing the joint distribution the nonstationary marginal distribution of ra and msa should be determined first gamma normal log normal and gev generalized extreme value distributions were assumed as potential margins with dynamic distribution parameters eq 2 with the same procedure as for diagnosing the nonstationarity for gamma distribution in section 2 1 90 kinds of nonstationary functions table s1 a d were considered to ascertain the nonstationarity of ra and msa with large scale climate indices as shown in section 2 3 11 kinds of nonstationary gaussian copula table s2 were selected as potential copula models to illustrate the joint distribution function 3 5 bivariate risk assessment of compound dry hot events at regional scale since compound dry hot events have two characteristics the return period from marginal point considering only one characteristic is not enough on the other hand due to climate change the static return period may not be appropriate which leads to a bivariate time varying joint return period expressing the risk of compound dry hot events that was calculated here in the multivariate frequency analysis different types of joint return period jrp including jrp and jrp or jrp sur have been suggested in literature salvadori et al 2013 shiau 2006 there is still discussion on which form of the jrp could be more appropriate in water resources planning and project design we selected the commonly used jrp and to make a comparison of risk assessment between the stationary and nonstationary cases the joint return period of ra and msa under nonstationary conditions can be defined as 10 jrp t and œâ 1 f ra t f msa t c f ra t f msa t Œ∏ c t where f ra t a n d f msa t are the time varying marginal distributions of ra and msa respectively c f ra t f msa t Œ∏ c t is the dynamic copula distribution with time varying copula parameter œâ is the rate of the number of years in the study period to the number of compound dry hot events 4 results 4 1 optimal selection of nonstationary models for nspi nsti and ncdh calculation here we show results of the first phase and the second phase of nonstationary modelling in order to derive the ncdh index to quantify the severity of compound dry hot events for each grid based data a nonstationary gamma and normal model combined with lr gof test and aicc optimizing criteria eqs 1 3 was established for average precipitation and temperature records during summer time jja respectively since there were 190 975 grids in this study three typical grids grids a b and c in fig 1 were chosen to show the detailed information of the nonstationary models in order to evaluate the model uncertainty the parametric bootstrap method was used to analyze the uncertainty of the fitted models serinaldi and kilsby 2015 considering the potential link between large scale climate indices and ap or at almost 30 kinds of nonstationary gamma and normal models incorporating different climate indices and time as covariates of distribution parameters were considered table s1 a b for all three grids a c nsga3 with both parameters showing a linear relation with time year in this study proved to be the most suitable model for fitting the average precipitation ap observations different from nonstationary normal distribution for at in grid a with distribution parameters showing a linear relation with time two parameters of the nonstationary normal model for at in grid b and c showed a linear relation with 3 month time lagging north atlantic oscillation nao 3 shown in table s1 the slope value of gamma parameters for grid a œÉ 2 0 01 Œ∫ 2 0 01 for ap was relatively smaller than that of grid b œÉ 2 0 013 Œ∫ 2 0 014 for ap and c œÉ 2 0 0318 Œ∫ 2 0 0512 for ap which showed that the degree of trend caused nonstationarity in ap of grid b and c was stronger than that in ap of grid a once the first phase of nonstationary modeling of ap and at was done the nspi and nsti indices were derived by transforming the cumulative probability of ap and at series under nonstationary conditions into the standard normal distribution in the second phase of nonstationary modelling a dynamic copula was fitted for the dependence structure of nspi and nsti table 1 the nonstationary gaussian copula with 2 month time lagging north atlantic oscillation nao 2 as covariates of copula parameter was the best model fitted for the dependence structure between nspi and nsti in grids a and b nao 3 was the significant climate index for grid c in order to show the quality of model fitting visual analysis based on worm plot and diagonal plot for copula for marginal distribution and copula are shown in fig 3 respectively which helped verify the rationality of nonstationary models with large scale climate indices as covariates as shown in fig 3 the selected nonstationary marginal models and gaussian copula for grid a b and c showed a reasonable model fitting efficiency fig 4 summarizes the optimal nonstationary models incorporating different climate indices as significant covariates of distribution parameters for ap and at observed at all 190 975 grids of weihe river basin for at modelling 2 15 of grids in sub basin 1 did not show significant nonstationarity while 64 27 in sub basin 2 and 30 39 in sub basin 3 did not show significant nonstationarity time plays a leading role in reproducing the undulating behavior exhibited by the average temperature observations in sub basin 1 model nsnm2 occupied 48 36 and nsnm3 occupied 49 48 except for 64 27 of grids fitted by stationary normal models in sub basin 2 nonstationary models incorporating time and nao 3 as significant covariates occupied 20 9 and 14 75 respectively for grids in sub basin 3 nao 3 was the main significant covariate for the location parameter of the normal distribution fitted to at different from the model patterns for at with only nao 3 and time as significant covariates nao 2 nino 1 and nino 3 became the significant covariates in gamma parameters fitted to ap in the whole river basin for nonstationary modelling of the dependence structure of nspi and nsti nao 3 played a leading role in causing time varying variations of relation between drought and hot events as shown in fig 4 a c the significant covariates for each grid were different from each other due to the spatial variation in precipitation and temperature over the river basin owing to the spatial heterogeneity of the nonstationary models fitted for at ap and their dependence structure most of study area showed the necessity of using nonstationary index ncdh to quantify the severity of compound dry hot events only 6 9 of sub basin 2 and 8 49 of sub basin 3 showed cdh 4 2 comparison of two indices cdh and ncdh to better illustrate the differences among the two indices we present the time series of compound dry hot event index for three selected grids in fig 1 grid a 36 23 n 109 12 e in sub basin 1 grid b 35 39 n 107 02 e in sub basin 2 and grid c 34 89 n 106 90 e in sub basin 3 from 1901 to 2017 see figs 1 and 5 totally speaking the similar pattern of temporal variations shown by fig 5 demonstrates the consistency of cdh and ncdh indexes in exhibiting the dry hot event propagation process however the severity of compound dry hot events quantified by the two indices distinguished from each other in several years 1939 1945 1997 2006 especially in peak regions of series for instance the compound dry hot condition in 2006 was assigned to be the extreme level by cdh 1 67 while the severe level by ncdh 1 33 for grid a belonging to sub basin 1 for grid c belonging to sub basin 3 the compound dry hot condition in 2006 was assigned to be the severe level by cdh 1 38 while the extreme level by ncdh 1 64 according cheng et al 2014 and ji duan 2020 the extreme level of compound dry hot condition happened during may to august in sub basin 3 while severe level of compound dry hot condition happened during summer time in sub basin 1 the difference in severity of compound dry hot events happened in these two sub basins are attributed to the return of farmland to forest implemented in sub basin 1 ji duan 2020 since the cdh and ncdh were derived from spi nspi and sti nsti the difference of probability density function pdf fitted for ap and at under stationary and nonstationary conditions would pose a great impact on disparities between cdh and ncdh fig 6 evident differences can be observed in the pdf of precipitation or temperature series for example in 1924 1944 at grid a in 1924 2004 at grid b and in 1924 1944 1984 and 2004 at grid c which is in accordance with differences of the compound dry hot indices series shown in fig 5 the pdf curve of selected grids clearly indicated the difference between nspi and spi or nsti and sti which led to the difference between cdh and ncdh we further compared the differences between the two indices of cdh and ncdh from a spatial perspective in fig 7 fig 7 a shows a similar spatial pattern exhibited by these two indices with a high correlation value in 1934 1943 1957 1969 1982 1994 and 2016 in fig 7 b focusing on year 2016 the condition of compound dry hot events in sub basin 1 was in the abnormal level by ncdh while the condition was in the extreme level by cdh focusing on sub basin 3 in 2016 quantified by cdh the affected area in the upper reaches of sub basin 3 was significantly higher than that in the lower reaches while ncdh showed the opposite situation from historical records ji duan 2020 more area suffered from dry hot events in the downstream of sub basin 3 in 2016 than that of upper stream due to higher economic growth and the intensification of urbanization in the downstream over the past few years overall the nonstationarity of precipitation or temperature to derive spi and sti cannot be ignored in compound dry hot extreme assessment under climate change since remarkable difference was observed between stationary index cdh and nonstationary indices ncdh furthermore accurate description of the time distribution of cdh can be derived to help provide more information about the trend of compound dry hot extremes in time and space 4 3 nonstationary copula modelling for ra and msa before copula modelling of the dependence structure between ra and msa pre experiment of investigating the correlation between them was conducted to check whether ra and msa can be analyzed jointly or not the correlation value between ra and msa corresponding to sub basins 1 2 3 were 0 821 0 819 and 0 795 respectively which showed that the above two characteristics of compound dry hot events can be further analyzed by copula the same optimization process of best fitted margins and copula as in section 4 1 was re operated here for ra and msa in table 2 ra and msa extracted from sub basin 1 showed no nonstationarity in the process of marginal distribution or copula modelling when it came to sub basin 2 the dependence structure between ra and msa exhibited nonstationarity with the gaussian copula parameter incorporating nao 2 as covariates for sub basin 3 only the marginal distribution for ra satisfied the nonstationary situation with soi 2 as a covariate although almost all grids of the study area showed nonstationarity in the process of deriving ncdh section 4 1 the regional features of abnormal compound dry hot events showed a lower degree of nonstationary characteristics two of nine margins and dependence structure showed nonstationarity 4 4 nonstationary risk assessment of ra and msa with the joint distribution selected in view of nonstationarity for each sub basin the nonstationary risk assessment was analyzed the design values of indexes characterizing the compound dry hot events that happened in each sub basin were computed based on the and joint return period jrp figs 8 a b present the jrp isolines of the two characteristics at return levels equaling 50 20 and 10 years for the three sub basins a parametric bootstrap method combined with 90 ellipse confidence interval gu et al 2020 was adopted in this study to quantify the uncertainty of design values since stationary margins and stationary copula were the best fitted models for sub basin 1 table 2 stationary jrp isolines of the two characteristics belonging to sub basin 1 are plotted in fig 8 a focusing on ellipse confidence bands at different jrp isolines bigger ellipse confidence bands fell on high level jrp isolines which means that uncertainty was negatively proportional to risk of occurrence of compound dry hot event the jrp isolines of sub basin 2 showed little or no obvious changes especially in the range scale of marginal design values among four selected years which were caused by the stationary features of marginal distributions and only copula was found to have nonstationarity when it came to jrp isolines of sub basin 3 the design values of ra varied over time due to the nonstationary gamma distribution with climate indicator soi 2 as a covariate for ra from the horizontal perspective of plots i e the variation of ra values the jrp isolines moved leftward first from 1929 to 1950 and then rightward from 1950 to 2002 due to the limited number of plots we just present here the overall variation of the design value of ra changing with time varying soi 2 and the exact pattern of the variation of joint distribution can be addressed from the complete set of plots comparing jrp isolines between sub basins 2 and 3 the nonstationarity in the marginal distribution nonstationary gamma model for ra of sub basin 3 could cause more time varying variations of design values at each return level than that in the dependence structure nonstationary gaussian copula for ra msa of sub basin 2 between ra and msa 4 5 discussion of different kinds of nonstationary scenarios over risk assessment results since the nonstationary risk assessment of compound dry hot events was applied based on three phases of nonstationary modelling 1 1st phase ns m1 nonstationary gamma distribution for ap and normal distribution for at to calculate nspi and nsti respectively 2 2nd phase ns m2 using dynamic copula 1st time for fitting the dependence structure between nspi and nsti to derive ncdh using eqs 4 and 5 and 3 3nd phase ns m3 using the dynamic copula 2nd time for the dependence structure between ra and msa it is of great interest to investigate how the final risk assessment results would be influenced by considering nonstationarity or not during the 1st and 2nd modelling phases as a result five kinds of scenarios were considered to answer the above issue 1 scenario 0 the stationary modelling was implemented in all three phases s m1 s m2 s m3 2 scenario 1 nonstationary modelling was implemented in all three phases ns m1 ns m2 ns m3 which has been realized in section 4 4 3 scenario 2 stationary modelling was implemented in the 1st and 2nd phases while nonstationary modelling was implemented in the 3rd phase s m1 s m2 ns m3 4 scenario 3 stationary modelling was implemented in the 1st phase while nonstationary modelling was implemented in the 2nd and 3rd phases s m1 ns m2 ns m3 and 5 scenario 4 nonstationary modelling was implemented in the 1st phase while stationary modelling was implemented in the 2nd and 3rd phases ns m1 s m2 ns m3 we used scenario 0 as a benchmark to show the time varying jrp isolines detailed information of modelling results in the 3rd phase of nonstationary modelling of ra and msa under scenarios 2 4 is shown in table s3 a c and results of the jrp isolines corresponding to scenarios 0 2 3 and 4 are exhibited in fig s1 a e based on the results of table s1 a the occurrence risk of compound dry hot events in sub basin 1 was significantly lower than that in the other two basins which was because the design values of msa and ra in sub basin 1 at the same joint return level were smaller than those of the other two basins comparison of nonstationary modelling results and results of the jrp isolines between scenarios 1 and 4 would help identify the effect of considering nonstationarity in the 2nd modelling phase over results of risk assessment focusing on the nine cases of modelling results in table 2 and table s3 c the similar results of the 3rd nonstationary modelling existed between scenarios 1 and 4 the dependence structure of msa and ra in sub basin 2 and marginal distribution of ra in sub basin 3 both showed nonstationarity with the same climate indices as covariates nao 2 for copula parameter of sub basin 2 and soi 2 for the scale parameter of sub basin 3 other seven cases of three sub basins under scenarios 1 and 4 showed no nonstationarity comparison of jrp isolines under these two scenarios figs 8 a b and fig s1 d e also showed the similar pattern of time varying variations of design values at return levels of 10 20 and 50 years in the same way comparisons of jrp isolines and results of 3rd modelling results under scenarios 1 and 3 would investigate the effect of considering nonstationarity in the 1st modelling phase over results of risk assessment as shown in the nine cases of modelling results in table 2 and table s3 b 5 cases of modelling results showed nonstationarity under scenario 3 which was significantly distinguished from those only t20 cases under scenario 1 the same conclusion can be drawn through visual comparison of jrp isolines between fig 8 and fig s1 c as shown in table 2 and table s3 b considering nonstationarity caused by climate indices in average precipitation and temperature series during the 1st modelling phase would help reduce the complexity of subsequent risk analysis based on characteristic variables of compound extreme events which was because of less cases showing nonstationarity in the 3rd modelling phase under scenario 1 in summary whether considering nonstationarity in the 2nd phase modelling or not would pose little impact on the nonstationary risk assessment results of compound dry hot event while nonstationarity in the 1st phase modelling of average precipitation and temperature could make a difference over nonstationary risk assessment of compound dry hot events in other words nonstationarity in average precipitation and temperature should be consequently recognized as the more dominant factor in nonstationary risk analysis of compound dry hot events than the nonstationarity in the dependence structure between spi and sti 5 discussion this study proposed the dynamic copula model to link the spi and sti index to identify and make the risk evaluation of compound dry hot events from the perspective of nonstationarity as the drought or dryness monitoring and assessing index the standardized precipitation index spi are derived from precipitation only which showed a potentially significant limitation of omission of evapotranspiration vicente serrano et al 2010 potop et al 2012 chen et al 2016 um et al 2017 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei proposed by vicente serrano et al 2010 could offer better performance of drought impact evaluation begueria et al 2014 gao et al 2017 parsons et al 2019 pei et al 2019 instead of focusing on average precipitation ap during jja june july august for spi in this study the time series of average water balance awb of jja which is difference between precipitation and potential evaporation et0 needs to be investigated by the lr tests to verify the potential nonstationarity the nonstationarity of awb time series would also be a key factor to influence the nonstationary compound dry hot index ncdh as the emphasis of this work was on the impact of the identification and risk assessment of compound dry hot events imposed by the potential nonstationarity existed in the precipitation and temperature series the nonstationary spei index considering precipitation and evaporation comprehensively would be addressed in our future study of compound dry hot events in order to explore the rationality of the nonstationary compound dry hot index adopted in this study the proposed compound index was also addressed in another catchment fenhe river basin frb fig s2 to check whether one would expect the index to be consistent in space for nearby catchments as shown in fig s3 a c nonstationary gamma models nsga32 occupied 71 8 of grids for ap series while nonstationary normal models nsnm5 47 3 and nsnm34 52 7 was the best fitted models at all grids for at series in frb although only 4 1 of grids for dependence structure between nspi and nsti recommended nonstationary gaussian copula nsgau15 models the nonstationary compound dry hot index should be taken into consideration for the whole catchment because of the nonstationarity existed at all grids for at series fig s4 helped verify the consensus spatially the nonstationarity of precipitation or temperature to derive spi and sti cannot be ignored in compound dry hot extreme assessment under climate change since remarkable difference could be identified for the comparison of cdh and ncdh index in frb we could make a short term prediction of compound dry hot events as follows since the larger scale climate indexes were the climate indicators of the previous 1 3 months the nonstationary ncdh based models can be used to make 1 3 month lead prediction of the likelihood of the regional compound dry hot extreme events once we get the value of climate indicators at present for a long term prediction of the compound dry hot events a systematic projection of the compound dry hot events would be feasible with the help of the global climate model gcm simulations involved in coupled model inter comparison project phase 6 cmip6 6 conclusions in this study a nonstationary framework for the identification of compound dry hot extremes and risk assessment is proposed to explore the potential evolution regime over the past 117 years in weihe river basin wrb and fenhe river basin frb it consists of three phases of nonstationary modelling of the average precipitation ap and temperature at time series extracted from grid based data 1 k m 1 k m the first phase modelling of nonstationary gamma distribution of ap and normal distribution of at with large scale climate indices as covariates was implemented to derive the nonstationary spi nspi and sti nsti respectively the first time nonstationary copula modelling of dependence structure between nsti and nsoi was applied to derive the nonstationary compound dry hot extreme index ncdh in the 2nd phase based on nonstationary modelling of the first two phases comparison of ncdh and cdh to identify historical compound dry hot events were also made in this study with the threshold value of ncdh being set as 0 5 two regional characteristics of compound extremes relative affected area ra and mean severity of area msa could be extracted from the grid based datasets the second time nonstationary copula modelling of dependence structure between ra and msa was investigated to make nonstationary risk assessment of compound dry hot events in the wrb the main findings of this study can be summarized as follows 1 from the results of nonstationary modelling in the 1st and 2nd phases most area of wrb showed the necessity of using nonstationary index ncdh to quantify the severity of compound dry hot events only 6 9 of sub basin 2 and 8 49 of sub basin 3 showed cdh due to the spatial heterogeneity of nonstationary models fitted for at ap and their dependence structure 2 compared with stationary cdh hao et al 2019 wu et al 2019 2020 the main properties of ncdh can be concluded as follows a ncdh combines large scale climate indices with lead times of 1 3 months nao soi nino3 thus incorporating climate change in calculating ncdh b the performance of reconstructing historical compound extremes by ncdh was better than that by cdh c due to the dynamic response to the evolution of the probability distribution function pdf over time the proposed ncdh provided more robustness and rationality for drought assessment under climate change 3 based on jrp isolines of ra and msa in the three sub basins the nonstationarity in the marginal distributions had a more impact on the design values at each return level than that in the dependence structure the uncertainty was negatively proportional to risk of occurrence of compound dry hot event 4 based on different kinds of nonstationary scenarios over nonstationary risk assessment nonstationarity in average precipitation and temperature should be paid more attention in the 1st modelling phase to derive spi and sti indexes compared to nonstationarity in the 1st modelling phase nonstationarity in the dependence structure between spi and sti which was the 2nd modeling phase had a less impact over risk assessment we used the time varying copula based model incorporating different large scale climate indices as covariates mainly to make the dynamic identification and risk assessment of compound dry hot events in wrb the proposed framework identified compound dry hot events with high efficiency as well as their evolution tracks and the nonstationary feature of compound dry hot frequency analysis helps understand the evolution and characteristics of compound dry hot events more comprehensively much expansive work should be carried out to overcome the potential deficiency of this framework for instance other physically induced indexes such as gdp and land use related index should also be considered in this study spi and sti were used to derive the nonstationary compound dry hot monitoring index ncdh other standardized indexes like spei considering evapotranspiration effect should also be considered to calculate ncdh in a

2589,duo to the influence of anthropogenic and climate change the traditional drought or hot event identification indices under the stationary assumption of the probabilistic behavior of a hydrometeorological variable could be no longer valid this study proposed a nonstationary framework for the identification of compound dry hot extremes and risk assessment considering climate change for the warm season during the period 1901 2017 in weihe river basin wrb and fenhe river basin frb china the proposed framework is composed of three phases 1 calculating nonstationary precipitation index nspi and standardized temperature index nsti by incorporating large scale climate indices as covariates of fitted distribution parameters 2 calculating nonstationary compound dry hot index ncdh based on nonstationary copula models and 3 bivariate nonstationary risk analysis of compound dry hot events through two regional characteristics called relative affected area ra and mean severity of area msa the proposed ncdh using climate indices as covariates was found to be superior in capturing compound dry hot characteristics and revealing the trend of temporal and spatial changes of wrb over the period of 1901 2017 based on the nonstationary risk assessment of regional characteristics the occurrence risk of compound extremes in sub basin 1 of wrb was less than that in the other two sub basins considering the importance of nonstationarity during the above three modelling phases the nonstationarity in the 1st phase modelling of average precipitation ap and average temperature at to derive nspi and nsti could have a greater impact on the final results of nonstationary risk assessment of compound dry hot events than nonstationarity in the other two phases this nonstationary compound dry hot index provides a new insight into compound extreme identification and risk assessment that can adapt to a changing environment keywords compound dry hot extremes dynamic copula nonstationarity risk multivariate data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction frequencies and intensities of extreme events in the context of an anthropogenic warming climate especially hot extremes and drought events have experienced a substantial increase on a wide range of temporal and spatial scales all over the world zscheischler et al 2018 miralles et al 2019 alizadeh et al 2020 wang et al 2020 abatzoglou et al 2021 wang et al 2021 owing to the significantly adverse impacts triggered by these extreme events individually the occurrence probabilities of hazardous states of one corresponding variable at a time have commonly been quantified by conventional climate risk analyses zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 the concurrence of extreme hydroclimatic events i e compound dry hot extremes causes more disastrous impacts on agricultural productivity human health and ecosystem than does a single extreme event guerreiro et al 2018 as a result assessment of dynamic variations of compound dry and hot events is essential for determining potential driving forces which control the evolution of these concurrent events wu et al 2020 systematic integration of climatic information from multiple related to the properties of these compound dry hot events helps reflect their multivariate nature leonard et al 2014 much of the literature has quantitatively assessed the compound drought heatwave events from two perspectives 1 a certain threshold based frequency variability assessment by extracting frequencies of concurrences of drought and hot extremes for the period of interest mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 miao et al 2016 zscheischler et al 2018 chen et al 2019 ribeiro et al 2020 2 a joint index covering multiple extremes or events which can quantify different properties such as severity level and spatial extent for compound dry hot extremes gallant et al 2014 wu et al 2019 wu et al 2020 hao et al 2020 for instance the climate extremes index cei proposed by gallant et al 2014 can be established by integrating multiple extremes with linear averaging of the areas covered by different extreme indicators in recent years copulas accounting for the dependence structure of multiple contributing variables have been employed to measure the overall severity of compound droughts and hot extremes for example hao et al 2019 2020 first proposed the standardized compound event indicator scei at a monthly scale to quantify the potential severity of compound dry hot events by normalizing the joint cumulative probability of dry hot events li et al 2021 applied a daily scale joint index called the standardized compound drought and heat index scdhi to quantify sub monthly characteristics of compound dry and hot events and to monitor their initiation development and decay with these above systematic joint indexes the frequency severity duration and intensity of compound dry hot events can be quantified the above mentioned joint indexes assessing the compound dry hot events are all based on the underlying assumption that the hydrological processes and meteorological time series are stationary as a result of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions climate is changing altering the composition of earth s atmosphere which has not only increased the complexity of hydrometeorological simulations but has also necessitated the incorporation of nonstationarities in modelling hydrometeorological variables milly et al 2008 xiong et al 2015 bl√∂schl et al 2017 kundzewicz et al 2018 xu et al 2020a 2020b therefore recent literature has focused on nonstationarity of hydrometeorological variables caused by significant trend abrupt changes or periodicity razmi et al 2017 salas and obeysekera 2014 vasiliades et al 2015 zeng et al 2017 for meteorological drought quantified by standardized precipitation index spi some researchers have applied nonstationary spi nspi to assess temporal variations of drought which assume that the scale parameter of gamma distribution for spi can change with time li et al 2015 park et al 2019 russo et al 2013 song et al 2020 in the context of climate change nonstationarity has been incorporated in not only drought analysis but also the hazard assessment of extreme precipitation and floods in which the parameter set of potential best fitted distribution exhibits a linear or nonlinear relation with time bender et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 rosner et al 2014 salas and obeysekera 2014 sarhadi et al 2016 sarhadi and soulis 2017 yan et al 2017 xu et al 2020b or some physical covariates e g large scale climate driving factors agilan and umamahesh 2017 liu et al 2017 gu et al 2019 razmi et al 2017 su and chen 2019 vasiliades et al 2015 villarini et al 2009 xiong et al 2015 xu et al 2020a yilmaz et al 2017 parallel to the potential nonstationarity existing in a drought index it is essential to incorporate the nonstationary characteristics into the standardized compound dry hot event indicator cdh monitoring the compound dry hot conditions several studies in china have focused on a systematic understanding of compound dry hot events at different temporal and spatial scales chen et al 2019 hao et al 2019 wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 however they have mostly focused on the frequency and severity of compound dry hot events under stationary assumption therefore it is necessary to apply the nonstationary cdh index to detect and monitor the compound dry hot events with consideration of environmental changes the main objective of this study therefore was to develop a dynamic extreme joint index nonstationary compound dry hot event index ncdh for detecting compound droughts and hot extremes with the use of time varying copula models sarhadi et al 2016 xu et al 2020a 2020b accounting for the dependence of multiple variables we also applied dynamic copula based bivariate frequency analysis considering the severity and affected area of compound dry hot events these two properties severity and area of compound dry hot events were extracted from the grid based hydrometeorological dataset of weihe river basin of china by the nonstationary monitoring index ncdh since there are teleconnections between larger scale climate indices and drought or heatwaves in many regions across the world climate indices were incorporated as covariates of ncdh 2 study area and dataset weihe river basin which is located in northwest china fig 1 embraces fragile ecological environment and experiences frequent natural disasters compound dry hot extreme events have posed a significant impact on the regional economic structure and the rational development and utilization of water resources according to the water system distribution characteristics the whole basin can be divided into three sub basins the main stream of the weihe river sub basin 3 in fig 1 the jinghe river basin sub basin 2 in fig 1 and the beiluo river basin sub basin 1 in fig 1 in order to distinguish the effects of compound dry hot extreme events over three sub basins grid based datasets were used to make nonstationary risk assessment of compound dry hot extreme events at regional scale considering climate change monthly precipitation and temperature data peng et al 2019 at 0 0083333 1 km spatial resolution ranging from 1901 to 2017 were applied which were obtained from loess plateau science data center national earth system science data sharing infrastructure national science technology infrastructure china https loess geodata cn for quantifying significant impacts of compound dry hot events on humanity and agriculture in summer the average precipitation ap and temperature at during june july august jja at each grid were first calculated and then the ncdh under nonstationary conditions was derived using eqs 4 and 5 3 methodology a dynamic copula based framework for the identification of compound dry hot events and risk assessment considering nonstationarity is presented in fig 2 as shown in this figure the proposed methodology involves three phases of nonstationary modelling of the average precipitation ap and temperature at time series extracted from grid based data 1 k m 1 k m 1 1st phase ns m1 applying dynamic gamma distribution for ap and normal distribution for at through the likelihood ratio lr test in order to realize the nonstationary identification of drought events by nonstationary standard precipitation index nspi and hot events by nonstationary standard temperature index nsti 2 2nd phase ns m2 deriving the compound dry hot events index ncdh from the joint probability of nspi or spi and nsti sti obtained from dynamic copula fitting 3 3nd phase ns m3 applying nonstationary copula modelling for the dependence structure between two characteristics of dry hot events relative affected area ra and mean severity of area msa which were from extracted grid based ncdh data under a certain threshold value of ncdh as shown in the flowchart the lr tests were run through all three phases of modelling in order to assure the rationality of nonstationary detection a time varying joint return period under the and scenario was implemented for nonstationary risk assessment salvadori and de michele 2004 it is known that the hydrometeorological system is influenced by large scale climate patterns such as el ni√±o southern oscillation enso southern oscillation index soi and north atlantic oscillation nao wang et al 2015 sarhadi and soulis 2017 el ni√±o 3 southern oscillation enso which is derived from the large scale ocean atmosphere interactions had been found been critical driver to the droughts in the yellow river basin dong and ren 1996 wang et al 2006 studies showed that precipitation in east asia could be influenced by the surface temperature sst anomalies in the north pacific ocean and indian ocean which would lead to the variations of wet dry conditions in the yellow river basin moy et al 2002 wang et al 2019 applied the cross wavelet approach to verify the finding that drought in the yrb are highly correlated with enso the northern atlantic oscillation is correlated with the warm phase of the north atlantic sst which would be conducive to easterly wind anomalies in northern china and less precipitation or more frequent droughts in the semi arid subarea in the upper reaches of the yellow river yu et al 2014 have revealed that fluctuations in nao in yrb could significantly influence climatic factors such as air temperature precipitation the soi is the index of enso events like el ni√±o and la ni√±a events and has certain effects on precipitation in yrb fu et al 2007 li et al 2016 meng et al 2021 the ni√±o 3 sea surface temperature sst was used as a measure of the amplitude of el ni√±o 3 southern oscillation enso the ni√±o 3 sst index nino3 was defined as the seasonal sst averaged over the central pacific 5 s to 5 n 90 150 w in order to reflect the impact of climate change over compound dry hot events we employed the three phases of nonstationary modelling including marginal fitting and copula fitting with distribution parameters incorporating large scale climate indicators nao soi and nino3 as covariates to derive the nonstationary compound dry hot extreme index ncdh given the ncdh index nonstationary risk assessment of the compound dry hot events for each sub basin at regional scale described by relative affected area ra and mean severity of area msa is made 3 1 construction of a nonstationary spi sti considering climate change the traditional paradigm of spi and sti calculations mckee et al 1993 involved gamma and normal distributions fitted for different time scales of precipitation and temperature series respectively on the basis of stationary hypothesis due to substantial anthropogenic activities as well as climate change the applicability of stationary hypothesis has been challenged milly et al 2008 instead of considering the time scale effect of precipitation and temperature data the nonstationary spi and sti based on average precipitation ap and temperature at during june july august jja respectively was calculated because of the emphasis on dry hot events during the summer season for economy of space we only show the procedure for calculating nspi while nsti was calculated in the same way let s represents the precipitation series then its dynamic probability density function based on the two parameter gamma distribution can be described as follows 1 f x 1 œÉ t Œ∫ t s Œ∫ t 1 exp s Œ∫ t Œ≥ Œ∫ t œÉ t 0 Œ∫ t 0 where œÉ t and Œ∫ t denote the scale and shape parameters respectively and Œ≥ is the mathematical function Œ∏ t œÉ t Œ∫ t here Œ∏ t is the parameter set composed of œÉ t and Œ∫ t since we incorporated the large scale climate indicators as covariates of gamma distribution parameters the assumed linear relation between the large scale climate indicators and Œ∏ t was established as 2 Œ∏ t constant Œ∏ 0 Œ∏ 1 t Œ∏ 0 Œ∏ 1 c o v t where cov t is the time varying large scale climate indicator time is also assumed as a potential covariate of the parameter sets in terms of the time lagging effect on the relation between extreme variables average precipitation ap and large scale climate indicators he and guan 2014 the nao soi nino3 value with 1 month to 3 months prior to the average precipitation series of jja was considered since the focus was on grid based data many types of assumed stationary and nonstationary gamma models table s1 a were checked by the lr test for each grid based ap time series in considerations of the combined effect of all above covariates climate drivers and time we used step wise model selecting strategy to derive the best fitted nonstationary models 1 the corrected akaike information criterion aic c combined with lr tests to select the potential models sga nsga1 nsga30 in the first step 2 for the potential models whose aic c value of nonstationary model nsga1 nsga30 is less than that of stationary model sga the linear superposition effect of the covariates belonging to the potential nonstationary model in first step by substituting the problem of univariate linear regression eq 2 into multivariate linear regression problem is considered for secondary optimization analysis through aicc criterion and lr tests then the best selected nonstationary gamma distribution was transformed into the standard normal distribution to derive the nspi value for each grid let sgau represent the stationary gamma model for ap while ngaui be a certain time varying model with trend existing in the parameter the lr test was applied to check whether potential trend caused nonstationarity would exist or not coles 2001 xu et al 2020a 2020b 3 lr 2 ll n g a u 1 i ll sgau where ll n g a u 1 i represents the maximum likelihood value of every potential nonstationary model here ngaui and ll sgau is the maximum likelihood value of the stationary model ll sgau denotes the null trend assumption the rejection of the null trend assumption stands for the situation when the p value of lr test was smaller than that at the significance level of 5 the nonstationary models which can pass the lr tests should also experience the dynamic goodness of fit gof k s tests based on the kolmogorov smirnov k s test at a significance level of 5 to verify the fit of the potential nonstationary or stationary gamma models the corrected akaike information criterion aic c was employed to quantify the goodness of fit of the distribution models the metrics of the best fitted gamma distribution should correspond to the smallest aicc and a relatively smaller or bigger p value of lr 5 and k s 5 tests after the best fitted dynamic gamma model selection the cumulative probability of ap series was transformed into nspi through the standard normal distribution parallel to the approach to derive the nspi index the nsti index calculation also involves the nonstationary normal distribution modelling based on the lr and k s tests and aicc criterion the potential nonstationary normal distributions are presented in table s1 b 3 2 construction of a nonstationary compound dry hot index ncdh considering climate change hao et al 2019 and wu et al 2019 2020 first proposed the compound dry hot index cdh by establishing the joint probability of bivariate random variables spi and sti here under stationary hypothesis parallel to the nonstationary spi sti calculation the nonstationarity should also be incorporated in the process of deriving the cdh index due to the potential link between large scale climate indicators and extreme events considering nonstationarity let x and y represent the drought events quantified by nspi and the hot events quantified by nsti respectively since the evaluation of compound dry hot events focuses on the situation that nspi is lower than or equal to a particular threshold x x while nsti is bigger than or equal to a particular threshold y y another variable z y is defined here to simplify the calculation process the joint probability distribution of f x z x z with time varying parameters can be defined as follows 4 f x y x z p x x z z c u v Œ∏ c t where Œ∏ c t is the dynamic copula parameters of joint distribution fitted for dependence structure between nspi and nsti time series uandv are the marginal distributions of x and z respectively parallel to the way of calculating the dynamic gamma parameters as shown in eq 2 the large scale climate indicators are also assumed as potential covariates of copula parameters the corrected akaike information criterion aic c and lr test were employed to quantify the goodness of fit of the distributions the maximum likelihood method was used to estimate the dynamic copula parameters the gaussian copula was found suitable to model both positive and negative dependences among multiple variables hao et al 2017 van de vyver and van den bergh 2018 so 11 kinds of nonstationary gaussian copula table s2 were selected as the potential copula models to illustrate the joint distribution function the dynamic joint probability distribution f x z x z can be employed as a metrics to quantify the joint status of dry and hot extreme events under nonstationary conditions the joint probability distribution f x z x z was then transformed to a uniform distribution by using the empirical gringorten eg plotting position formula which was then standardized as a normal index to quantify the severity of compound dry and hot events thus the nonstationary compound drought hot extreme index ncdh based on the standardization of the above eg can be expressed as 5 ncdh œÜ 1 e g f x z x z where the lower n c d h value shows the condition with lower precipitation and higher temperature with negative effects which is of practical interest since nonstationarity has been incorporated into the cdh index the variations of large scale climate indicators would lead to the evolution of compound dry hot extreme event status 3 3 definition of compound dry hot events and their characteristics after ncdh is derived thresholds must be set to distinguish individual compound dry hot events similar to the thresholds of spi to characterize different categories of drought compound dry and hot conditions can also be classified into several groups according to thresholds details of the upper and lower boundary set for the conditions can be found in wu et al 2019 2020 in this study we set the threshold value as 0 5 to focus on the abnormal compound dry hot condition ncdh 0 5 two kinds of regional characteristics called relative affected area ra and mean severity of area msa were used to quantify the risk of compound dry hot extreme events corresponding to each sub basin theoretically the minimum value of affected area is zero and the maximum affected area is the total area of each sub basin for convenience of risk assessment in the following section we defined the relative affected area ra and the mean severity of area msa as follows 6 m t n grid t n total 7 r a t l n 1 m t 1 m min 8 m s a t i 1 n grid t ncdh i n grid t where n grid t is the number of grids which corresponds to the abnormal compound dry hot condition with ncdh smaller than 0 5 in year t while n total is the total number of grids of each sub basin m t is the relative area of the t th year if we have 60 years of data m min is the minimum value of m t t 1 2 60 in order to make the range of m t fall in 0 eq 6 is transformed into eq 7 to get r a t 3 4 joint probability distribution for ra and msa here dynamic copula models were used second time to construct the joint distribution of ra and msa 9 h r a m s a p r a ra 0 m s a msa 0 c u v Œ∏ c t where u and v are the marginal distributions of ra and msa here ra0 and msa0 is a random quantile pair of regional characteristics before constructing the joint distribution the nonstationary marginal distribution of ra and msa should be determined first gamma normal log normal and gev generalized extreme value distributions were assumed as potential margins with dynamic distribution parameters eq 2 with the same procedure as for diagnosing the nonstationarity for gamma distribution in section 2 1 90 kinds of nonstationary functions table s1 a d were considered to ascertain the nonstationarity of ra and msa with large scale climate indices as shown in section 2 3 11 kinds of nonstationary gaussian copula table s2 were selected as potential copula models to illustrate the joint distribution function 3 5 bivariate risk assessment of compound dry hot events at regional scale since compound dry hot events have two characteristics the return period from marginal point considering only one characteristic is not enough on the other hand due to climate change the static return period may not be appropriate which leads to a bivariate time varying joint return period expressing the risk of compound dry hot events that was calculated here in the multivariate frequency analysis different types of joint return period jrp including jrp and jrp or jrp sur have been suggested in literature salvadori et al 2013 shiau 2006 there is still discussion on which form of the jrp could be more appropriate in water resources planning and project design we selected the commonly used jrp and to make a comparison of risk assessment between the stationary and nonstationary cases the joint return period of ra and msa under nonstationary conditions can be defined as 10 jrp t and œâ 1 f ra t f msa t c f ra t f msa t Œ∏ c t where f ra t a n d f msa t are the time varying marginal distributions of ra and msa respectively c f ra t f msa t Œ∏ c t is the dynamic copula distribution with time varying copula parameter œâ is the rate of the number of years in the study period to the number of compound dry hot events 4 results 4 1 optimal selection of nonstationary models for nspi nsti and ncdh calculation here we show results of the first phase and the second phase of nonstationary modelling in order to derive the ncdh index to quantify the severity of compound dry hot events for each grid based data a nonstationary gamma and normal model combined with lr gof test and aicc optimizing criteria eqs 1 3 was established for average precipitation and temperature records during summer time jja respectively since there were 190 975 grids in this study three typical grids grids a b and c in fig 1 were chosen to show the detailed information of the nonstationary models in order to evaluate the model uncertainty the parametric bootstrap method was used to analyze the uncertainty of the fitted models serinaldi and kilsby 2015 considering the potential link between large scale climate indices and ap or at almost 30 kinds of nonstationary gamma and normal models incorporating different climate indices and time as covariates of distribution parameters were considered table s1 a b for all three grids a c nsga3 with both parameters showing a linear relation with time year in this study proved to be the most suitable model for fitting the average precipitation ap observations different from nonstationary normal distribution for at in grid a with distribution parameters showing a linear relation with time two parameters of the nonstationary normal model for at in grid b and c showed a linear relation with 3 month time lagging north atlantic oscillation nao 3 shown in table s1 the slope value of gamma parameters for grid a œÉ 2 0 01 Œ∫ 2 0 01 for ap was relatively smaller than that of grid b œÉ 2 0 013 Œ∫ 2 0 014 for ap and c œÉ 2 0 0318 Œ∫ 2 0 0512 for ap which showed that the degree of trend caused nonstationarity in ap of grid b and c was stronger than that in ap of grid a once the first phase of nonstationary modeling of ap and at was done the nspi and nsti indices were derived by transforming the cumulative probability of ap and at series under nonstationary conditions into the standard normal distribution in the second phase of nonstationary modelling a dynamic copula was fitted for the dependence structure of nspi and nsti table 1 the nonstationary gaussian copula with 2 month time lagging north atlantic oscillation nao 2 as covariates of copula parameter was the best model fitted for the dependence structure between nspi and nsti in grids a and b nao 3 was the significant climate index for grid c in order to show the quality of model fitting visual analysis based on worm plot and diagonal plot for copula for marginal distribution and copula are shown in fig 3 respectively which helped verify the rationality of nonstationary models with large scale climate indices as covariates as shown in fig 3 the selected nonstationary marginal models and gaussian copula for grid a b and c showed a reasonable model fitting efficiency fig 4 summarizes the optimal nonstationary models incorporating different climate indices as significant covariates of distribution parameters for ap and at observed at all 190 975 grids of weihe river basin for at modelling 2 15 of grids in sub basin 1 did not show significant nonstationarity while 64 27 in sub basin 2 and 30 39 in sub basin 3 did not show significant nonstationarity time plays a leading role in reproducing the undulating behavior exhibited by the average temperature observations in sub basin 1 model nsnm2 occupied 48 36 and nsnm3 occupied 49 48 except for 64 27 of grids fitted by stationary normal models in sub basin 2 nonstationary models incorporating time and nao 3 as significant covariates occupied 20 9 and 14 75 respectively for grids in sub basin 3 nao 3 was the main significant covariate for the location parameter of the normal distribution fitted to at different from the model patterns for at with only nao 3 and time as significant covariates nao 2 nino 1 and nino 3 became the significant covariates in gamma parameters fitted to ap in the whole river basin for nonstationary modelling of the dependence structure of nspi and nsti nao 3 played a leading role in causing time varying variations of relation between drought and hot events as shown in fig 4 a c the significant covariates for each grid were different from each other due to the spatial variation in precipitation and temperature over the river basin owing to the spatial heterogeneity of the nonstationary models fitted for at ap and their dependence structure most of study area showed the necessity of using nonstationary index ncdh to quantify the severity of compound dry hot events only 6 9 of sub basin 2 and 8 49 of sub basin 3 showed cdh 4 2 comparison of two indices cdh and ncdh to better illustrate the differences among the two indices we present the time series of compound dry hot event index for three selected grids in fig 1 grid a 36 23 n 109 12 e in sub basin 1 grid b 35 39 n 107 02 e in sub basin 2 and grid c 34 89 n 106 90 e in sub basin 3 from 1901 to 2017 see figs 1 and 5 totally speaking the similar pattern of temporal variations shown by fig 5 demonstrates the consistency of cdh and ncdh indexes in exhibiting the dry hot event propagation process however the severity of compound dry hot events quantified by the two indices distinguished from each other in several years 1939 1945 1997 2006 especially in peak regions of series for instance the compound dry hot condition in 2006 was assigned to be the extreme level by cdh 1 67 while the severe level by ncdh 1 33 for grid a belonging to sub basin 1 for grid c belonging to sub basin 3 the compound dry hot condition in 2006 was assigned to be the severe level by cdh 1 38 while the extreme level by ncdh 1 64 according cheng et al 2014 and ji duan 2020 the extreme level of compound dry hot condition happened during may to august in sub basin 3 while severe level of compound dry hot condition happened during summer time in sub basin 1 the difference in severity of compound dry hot events happened in these two sub basins are attributed to the return of farmland to forest implemented in sub basin 1 ji duan 2020 since the cdh and ncdh were derived from spi nspi and sti nsti the difference of probability density function pdf fitted for ap and at under stationary and nonstationary conditions would pose a great impact on disparities between cdh and ncdh fig 6 evident differences can be observed in the pdf of precipitation or temperature series for example in 1924 1944 at grid a in 1924 2004 at grid b and in 1924 1944 1984 and 2004 at grid c which is in accordance with differences of the compound dry hot indices series shown in fig 5 the pdf curve of selected grids clearly indicated the difference between nspi and spi or nsti and sti which led to the difference between cdh and ncdh we further compared the differences between the two indices of cdh and ncdh from a spatial perspective in fig 7 fig 7 a shows a similar spatial pattern exhibited by these two indices with a high correlation value in 1934 1943 1957 1969 1982 1994 and 2016 in fig 7 b focusing on year 2016 the condition of compound dry hot events in sub basin 1 was in the abnormal level by ncdh while the condition was in the extreme level by cdh focusing on sub basin 3 in 2016 quantified by cdh the affected area in the upper reaches of sub basin 3 was significantly higher than that in the lower reaches while ncdh showed the opposite situation from historical records ji duan 2020 more area suffered from dry hot events in the downstream of sub basin 3 in 2016 than that of upper stream due to higher economic growth and the intensification of urbanization in the downstream over the past few years overall the nonstationarity of precipitation or temperature to derive spi and sti cannot be ignored in compound dry hot extreme assessment under climate change since remarkable difference was observed between stationary index cdh and nonstationary indices ncdh furthermore accurate description of the time distribution of cdh can be derived to help provide more information about the trend of compound dry hot extremes in time and space 4 3 nonstationary copula modelling for ra and msa before copula modelling of the dependence structure between ra and msa pre experiment of investigating the correlation between them was conducted to check whether ra and msa can be analyzed jointly or not the correlation value between ra and msa corresponding to sub basins 1 2 3 were 0 821 0 819 and 0 795 respectively which showed that the above two characteristics of compound dry hot events can be further analyzed by copula the same optimization process of best fitted margins and copula as in section 4 1 was re operated here for ra and msa in table 2 ra and msa extracted from sub basin 1 showed no nonstationarity in the process of marginal distribution or copula modelling when it came to sub basin 2 the dependence structure between ra and msa exhibited nonstationarity with the gaussian copula parameter incorporating nao 2 as covariates for sub basin 3 only the marginal distribution for ra satisfied the nonstationary situation with soi 2 as a covariate although almost all grids of the study area showed nonstationarity in the process of deriving ncdh section 4 1 the regional features of abnormal compound dry hot events showed a lower degree of nonstationary characteristics two of nine margins and dependence structure showed nonstationarity 4 4 nonstationary risk assessment of ra and msa with the joint distribution selected in view of nonstationarity for each sub basin the nonstationary risk assessment was analyzed the design values of indexes characterizing the compound dry hot events that happened in each sub basin were computed based on the and joint return period jrp figs 8 a b present the jrp isolines of the two characteristics at return levels equaling 50 20 and 10 years for the three sub basins a parametric bootstrap method combined with 90 ellipse confidence interval gu et al 2020 was adopted in this study to quantify the uncertainty of design values since stationary margins and stationary copula were the best fitted models for sub basin 1 table 2 stationary jrp isolines of the two characteristics belonging to sub basin 1 are plotted in fig 8 a focusing on ellipse confidence bands at different jrp isolines bigger ellipse confidence bands fell on high level jrp isolines which means that uncertainty was negatively proportional to risk of occurrence of compound dry hot event the jrp isolines of sub basin 2 showed little or no obvious changes especially in the range scale of marginal design values among four selected years which were caused by the stationary features of marginal distributions and only copula was found to have nonstationarity when it came to jrp isolines of sub basin 3 the design values of ra varied over time due to the nonstationary gamma distribution with climate indicator soi 2 as a covariate for ra from the horizontal perspective of plots i e the variation of ra values the jrp isolines moved leftward first from 1929 to 1950 and then rightward from 1950 to 2002 due to the limited number of plots we just present here the overall variation of the design value of ra changing with time varying soi 2 and the exact pattern of the variation of joint distribution can be addressed from the complete set of plots comparing jrp isolines between sub basins 2 and 3 the nonstationarity in the marginal distribution nonstationary gamma model for ra of sub basin 3 could cause more time varying variations of design values at each return level than that in the dependence structure nonstationary gaussian copula for ra msa of sub basin 2 between ra and msa 4 5 discussion of different kinds of nonstationary scenarios over risk assessment results since the nonstationary risk assessment of compound dry hot events was applied based on three phases of nonstationary modelling 1 1st phase ns m1 nonstationary gamma distribution for ap and normal distribution for at to calculate nspi and nsti respectively 2 2nd phase ns m2 using dynamic copula 1st time for fitting the dependence structure between nspi and nsti to derive ncdh using eqs 4 and 5 and 3 3nd phase ns m3 using the dynamic copula 2nd time for the dependence structure between ra and msa it is of great interest to investigate how the final risk assessment results would be influenced by considering nonstationarity or not during the 1st and 2nd modelling phases as a result five kinds of scenarios were considered to answer the above issue 1 scenario 0 the stationary modelling was implemented in all three phases s m1 s m2 s m3 2 scenario 1 nonstationary modelling was implemented in all three phases ns m1 ns m2 ns m3 which has been realized in section 4 4 3 scenario 2 stationary modelling was implemented in the 1st and 2nd phases while nonstationary modelling was implemented in the 3rd phase s m1 s m2 ns m3 4 scenario 3 stationary modelling was implemented in the 1st phase while nonstationary modelling was implemented in the 2nd and 3rd phases s m1 ns m2 ns m3 and 5 scenario 4 nonstationary modelling was implemented in the 1st phase while stationary modelling was implemented in the 2nd and 3rd phases ns m1 s m2 ns m3 we used scenario 0 as a benchmark to show the time varying jrp isolines detailed information of modelling results in the 3rd phase of nonstationary modelling of ra and msa under scenarios 2 4 is shown in table s3 a c and results of the jrp isolines corresponding to scenarios 0 2 3 and 4 are exhibited in fig s1 a e based on the results of table s1 a the occurrence risk of compound dry hot events in sub basin 1 was significantly lower than that in the other two basins which was because the design values of msa and ra in sub basin 1 at the same joint return level were smaller than those of the other two basins comparison of nonstationary modelling results and results of the jrp isolines between scenarios 1 and 4 would help identify the effect of considering nonstationarity in the 2nd modelling phase over results of risk assessment focusing on the nine cases of modelling results in table 2 and table s3 c the similar results of the 3rd nonstationary modelling existed between scenarios 1 and 4 the dependence structure of msa and ra in sub basin 2 and marginal distribution of ra in sub basin 3 both showed nonstationarity with the same climate indices as covariates nao 2 for copula parameter of sub basin 2 and soi 2 for the scale parameter of sub basin 3 other seven cases of three sub basins under scenarios 1 and 4 showed no nonstationarity comparison of jrp isolines under these two scenarios figs 8 a b and fig s1 d e also showed the similar pattern of time varying variations of design values at return levels of 10 20 and 50 years in the same way comparisons of jrp isolines and results of 3rd modelling results under scenarios 1 and 3 would investigate the effect of considering nonstationarity in the 1st modelling phase over results of risk assessment as shown in the nine cases of modelling results in table 2 and table s3 b 5 cases of modelling results showed nonstationarity under scenario 3 which was significantly distinguished from those only t20 cases under scenario 1 the same conclusion can be drawn through visual comparison of jrp isolines between fig 8 and fig s1 c as shown in table 2 and table s3 b considering nonstationarity caused by climate indices in average precipitation and temperature series during the 1st modelling phase would help reduce the complexity of subsequent risk analysis based on characteristic variables of compound extreme events which was because of less cases showing nonstationarity in the 3rd modelling phase under scenario 1 in summary whether considering nonstationarity in the 2nd phase modelling or not would pose little impact on the nonstationary risk assessment results of compound dry hot event while nonstationarity in the 1st phase modelling of average precipitation and temperature could make a difference over nonstationary risk assessment of compound dry hot events in other words nonstationarity in average precipitation and temperature should be consequently recognized as the more dominant factor in nonstationary risk analysis of compound dry hot events than the nonstationarity in the dependence structure between spi and sti 5 discussion this study proposed the dynamic copula model to link the spi and sti index to identify and make the risk evaluation of compound dry hot events from the perspective of nonstationarity as the drought or dryness monitoring and assessing index the standardized precipitation index spi are derived from precipitation only which showed a potentially significant limitation of omission of evapotranspiration vicente serrano et al 2010 potop et al 2012 chen et al 2016 um et al 2017 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei proposed by vicente serrano et al 2010 could offer better performance of drought impact evaluation begueria et al 2014 gao et al 2017 parsons et al 2019 pei et al 2019 instead of focusing on average precipitation ap during jja june july august for spi in this study the time series of average water balance awb of jja which is difference between precipitation and potential evaporation et0 needs to be investigated by the lr tests to verify the potential nonstationarity the nonstationarity of awb time series would also be a key factor to influence the nonstationary compound dry hot index ncdh as the emphasis of this work was on the impact of the identification and risk assessment of compound dry hot events imposed by the potential nonstationarity existed in the precipitation and temperature series the nonstationary spei index considering precipitation and evaporation comprehensively would be addressed in our future study of compound dry hot events in order to explore the rationality of the nonstationary compound dry hot index adopted in this study the proposed compound index was also addressed in another catchment fenhe river basin frb fig s2 to check whether one would expect the index to be consistent in space for nearby catchments as shown in fig s3 a c nonstationary gamma models nsga32 occupied 71 8 of grids for ap series while nonstationary normal models nsnm5 47 3 and nsnm34 52 7 was the best fitted models at all grids for at series in frb although only 4 1 of grids for dependence structure between nspi and nsti recommended nonstationary gaussian copula nsgau15 models the nonstationary compound dry hot index should be taken into consideration for the whole catchment because of the nonstationarity existed at all grids for at series fig s4 helped verify the consensus spatially the nonstationarity of precipitation or temperature to derive spi and sti cannot be ignored in compound dry hot extreme assessment under climate change since remarkable difference could be identified for the comparison of cdh and ncdh index in frb we could make a short term prediction of compound dry hot events as follows since the larger scale climate indexes were the climate indicators of the previous 1 3 months the nonstationary ncdh based models can be used to make 1 3 month lead prediction of the likelihood of the regional compound dry hot extreme events once we get the value of climate indicators at present for a long term prediction of the compound dry hot events a systematic projection of the compound dry hot events would be feasible with the help of the global climate model gcm simulations involved in coupled model inter comparison project phase 6 cmip6 6 conclusions in this study a nonstationary framework for the identification of compound dry hot extremes and risk assessment is proposed to explore the potential evolution regime over the past 117 years in weihe river basin wrb and fenhe river basin frb it consists of three phases of nonstationary modelling of the average precipitation ap and temperature at time series extracted from grid based data 1 k m 1 k m the first phase modelling of nonstationary gamma distribution of ap and normal distribution of at with large scale climate indices as covariates was implemented to derive the nonstationary spi nspi and sti nsti respectively the first time nonstationary copula modelling of dependence structure between nsti and nsoi was applied to derive the nonstationary compound dry hot extreme index ncdh in the 2nd phase based on nonstationary modelling of the first two phases comparison of ncdh and cdh to identify historical compound dry hot events were also made in this study with the threshold value of ncdh being set as 0 5 two regional characteristics of compound extremes relative affected area ra and mean severity of area msa could be extracted from the grid based datasets the second time nonstationary copula modelling of dependence structure between ra and msa was investigated to make nonstationary risk assessment of compound dry hot events in the wrb the main findings of this study can be summarized as follows 1 from the results of nonstationary modelling in the 1st and 2nd phases most area of wrb showed the necessity of using nonstationary index ncdh to quantify the severity of compound dry hot events only 6 9 of sub basin 2 and 8 49 of sub basin 3 showed cdh due to the spatial heterogeneity of nonstationary models fitted for at ap and their dependence structure 2 compared with stationary cdh hao et al 2019 wu et al 2019 2020 the main properties of ncdh can be concluded as follows a ncdh combines large scale climate indices with lead times of 1 3 months nao soi nino3 thus incorporating climate change in calculating ncdh b the performance of reconstructing historical compound extremes by ncdh was better than that by cdh c due to the dynamic response to the evolution of the probability distribution function pdf over time the proposed ncdh provided more robustness and rationality for drought assessment under climate change 3 based on jrp isolines of ra and msa in the three sub basins the nonstationarity in the marginal distributions had a more impact on the design values at each return level than that in the dependence structure the uncertainty was negatively proportional to risk of occurrence of compound dry hot event 4 based on different kinds of nonstationary scenarios over nonstationary risk assessment nonstationarity in average precipitation and temperature should be paid more attention in the 1st modelling phase to derive spi and sti indexes compared to nonstationarity in the 1st modelling phase nonstationarity in the dependence structure between spi and sti which was the 2nd modeling phase had a less impact over risk assessment we used the time varying copula based model incorporating different large scale climate indices as covariates mainly to make the dynamic identification and risk assessment of compound dry hot events in wrb the proposed framework identified compound dry hot events with high efficiency as well as their evolution tracks and the nonstationary feature of compound dry hot frequency analysis helps understand the evolution and characteristics of compound dry hot events more comprehensively much expansive work should be carried out to overcome the potential deficiency of this framework for instance other physically induced indexes such as gdp and land use related index should also be considered in this study spi and sti were used to derive the nonstationary compound dry hot monitoring index ncdh other standardized indexes like spei considering evapotranspiration effect should also be considered to calculate ncdh in a
