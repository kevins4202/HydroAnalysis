balance of a watershed however limited understanding exists of the temperature precipitation and streamflow trends in the syr darya watershed under the influence of climate change due to the uncertainties associated with climate change and the incompleteness of observational data in this study a multi gcms based statistical ensemble analysis mgsea method is developed to effectively reflect the uncertainty of climate predictions and comprehensively assess the impact of climate change on the syr darya watershed during the period from 2021 to 2100 new hydrological insights for the region the variations in temperature precipitation and streamflow were assessed by analyzing the projection results of various scenario combinations compared to the baseline 1960 2005 the findings reveal a rise in the annual average temperature ranging from 0 2 to 3 8 for rcp 4 5 and from 1 4 to 5 5 for rcp 8 5 in the 2080s additionally the research confirms a downward trend in annual

learning syr darya watershed data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years the impacts of global climate change have intensified leading to a growing body of research examining the effects of climate change in various region he et al 2019a 2019b arantes et al 2021 the watershed is a critical area that is significantly impacted by climate change zhang et al 2020 this region serves as an intersection between natural ecosystems and human activities making it vulnerable to the effects of climate change including changes in precipitation patterns availability of water resources and an increased risk of floods and droughts ahmadi et al 2019 li et al 2022 the hydrological processes in watersheds can also be affected resulting in altered water levels in rivers and lakes and an overall disturbance to the ecosystem yang et al 2020 lian et al 2021 therefore it is imperative to investigate the impact of climate change on these processes to enhance our understanding of how it influences water resources ecological systems social and economic aspects and human health in the watershed this research can assist in formulating adaptive and mitigative measures thereby developing strategies to reduce the impact of climate change advancing our comprehension of the impact of climate change on hydrological processes in watersheds is crucial for devising approaches to mitigate and adapt to its effects previously lots of research works have been conducted to explore the impact of climate change on the hydrological situation in watersheds farsi and mahjouri 2019 huq and abdul aziz 2021 for instance guan et al 2021 analyzed the changing trends of key hydro meteorological variables and runoff in 10 major river zones in china using the climate elasticity method to quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities and provided projections of future runoff using climate model ensemble simulations under different socioeconomic pathways santos et al 2021 evaluated the future impacts of land use and climate change on streamflow and sediment yield in the tapacurá river basin in brazil using a combination of approaches including a global circulation model and a multilayer perceptron algorithm in general with the help of robust simulation models the characteristics of climate and hydrological elements under climate change can be effectively analyzed however large scale climate models and physical mechanism models have limited applicability in small scale areas such as syr darya watershed where data is scarce or limited cai et al 2022 due to the uncertainty of climate change predictions and the inherent nonlinearity and complexity of climatic hydrological processes especially in many arid basins the impacts of climate change are difficult to investigate shi et al 2022 ding et al 2022 there are structural differences in the initialization and mathematical parameterization of various physical processes in atmospheric circulation models so the climate change predictions such as temperature and precipitation produced by atmospheric circulation models are often uncertain fortunately multi gcm ensemble analysis can effectively reflect the uncertainty of climate models and has been widely applied in climate change research accurately assessing the impacts of climate change on arid basins is complex due to large climate heterogeneity lack of data and the dynamic response of glaciers snowmelt water to climate change chen et al 2014 øygarden et al 2014 he et al 2019b in hydrological models the relationship between hydrological outputs such as streamflow and hydro meteorological inputs such as precipitation and temperature is essentially nonlinear complex and time varying which poses challenges for streamflow simulation statistical hydrological models such as machine learning based hydrological models can effectively deal with discrete and nonlinear systems by characterizing the relationship between inputs and outputs wu et al 2022 korsic et al 2023 ditthakit et al 2023 it has strong applicability to different regions and handles the nonlinear relationship between continuous and or discrete variables samantaray et al 2022 however due to the differences in the relationships characterized by different algorithms multi model ensemble analysis is worth expecting chu et al 2016 gao et al 2020 liu et al 2021 the difficulty of forecasting future streamflow is exacerbated in arid watersheds with limited data availability such as the syr darya basin currently most studies in the syr darya basin rely on historical hydrological analysis which lacks research on trends in temperature precipitation and streamflow changes under climate change jia et al 2020 wang et al 2021 klimaszyk et al 2022 there is a research gap in the study of changes in climatic variables and hydrological processes of syr darya watershed sdw in the upstream syr darya basin under future climate change therefore it is necessary to fully consider the current research methods and the status quo of the study area to address the above research gap this study develops a mixed ensemble of multiple climate models and multiple machine learning algorithms named as multi gcms based statistical ensemble analysis mgsea method to analyze future changes in climate elements and streamflow of sdw mgsea is capable of reflecting the uncertainty between different climate models and the differences in simulations among different machine learning algorithms and providing a comprehensive estimation of the impacts of future climate change on sdw which can provide scientific support for water resources management in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 study area as shown in fig 1 the syr darya watershed sdw is located in aral sea basin central asia as a major river of the aral sea basin syr darya river rises in the tianshan mountains and flows through the turan lowlands into the aral sea afanasyev et al 2020 the streamflow in the upper reaches of the syr darya river mainly comes from the confluence of naryn and karadarya the climate of the study area is a temperate continental feature howells et al 2021 in the catchment the average annual precipitation is about 465 95 mm and the mean temperature is about 17 9 22 7 sorg et al 2014 shi et al 2020 as a result of climate change the monthly average streamflow in the upstream syr darya river basin decreased from 667 08 m3 s in 1960 262 88 m3 s in 1985 a decrease of nearly 60 58 this has caused serious ecological environmental problems such as a decline in biodiversity land salinization and vegetation degradation upstream streamflow has important influence on downstream ecological security environmental stability and sustainable development therefore the effective assessment of the impact of climate change on streamflow over sdw is desirable for taking scientific intervention measures 2 1 2 data

the representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 lower emission scenario and rcp8 5 higher emission scenario are considered in this research by obtaining climate variables in two climate scenarios the response of climate variables to different climate fluctuations can be intuitively analyzed 2 2 2 statistical downscaling model the original climate variables of global climate models gcms are not enough to really present the regional climate information and effectively reflect the regional climate characteristics an efficient downscaling analysis method is urgently expected to convert the outputs of gcm models into regional scale information in this research the statistical downscaling model sdsm is used for downscaling the original climate variables data to the regional level the sdsm software can be downloaded from the website freely http www sdsm org uk as a hybrid statistical downscaling model it includes weather generator and multiple linear regression though identifying the cross scale relationship the sdsm model can effectively construct the function between the large scale gcm and the regional climate element e g precipitation and temperature in this research the reanalyzed atmospheric dataset predictor obtained from national centers for environmental prediction ncep and the observed data predictand meteorological station are used for calibrating the sdsm model the information meteorological station over sdw can be confirmed in table 2 the performance of different gcm models for simulating the climate variables can be evaluated through taylor diagram

including support vector machine svm random forest rf adaptive boosting ada and extreme gradient boosting xgb the statistical hydrological model is constructed by integrating different machine learning methods into an ensemble framework the ensemble method can fully reflect the differences between different modeling methods and improve the robustness of streamflow prediction svm is a machine learning algorithm based on statistical theory kriti et al 2016 svm uses risk minimization criteria in the modeling process to avoid over learning and improve the generalization ability of the model chen et al 2017 under different model parameter settings svm is used for solving classification and regression problems through constructing a regression tree svm can be used for dealing with the regression problem and the regression form of svm can be described as support vector regression svr in this study the svm based hydrological model can be formulated as two functions the first part is the simulation model eq 1 and the second part is the error function eq 2 the detailed function can be expressed as follows 4 f x ω t x b 5 y f x 0 i f y f x ε y f x ε ζ o t h e r w i s e where y represent as the observed streamflow f x is the output value of the svm based hydrological model ω is the weight of the forcing data e g temperature and precipitation t is the transpose operator ε and ζ is model sensitivity function and penalty respectively through forcing observed data and downscaled future data the simulation and prediction streamflow of svm based hydrological model can be obtained rf is one of widely used ensemble learning methods which generates predicted value through integrating numbers of decision trees into a forest sangjun et al 2019 kim et al 2021 as a special bagging method the decision tree is used as the module within a modeling of rf through using the bootstrap method the training datasets generated effectively thus rfis widely used for solving the classification and regression problem following the feature of regression a rf based hydrological model can be formulated through developing the regression tree in this study the simulated streamflow can be obtained from a rf based hydrological model the model can be expressed as follows 6 y x i f x i λ δ where y x i is the simulated streamflow x i is a range of climate variables of the watershed λ is the frame parameter of rf model and δ is the parameters of decision trees through inputting the climate variables the simulated value of streamflow can be procured from the well calibrated rf based hydrological model ada was proposed by yoav freund and robert schapire in 1995 as a self adaptation machine learning algorithm ada is widely used in classification and regression by updating the weight of samples and classifiers the sample weight is calculated according to the current model error complex regression problems can be effectively solved by constantly adjusting the weights of samples and classifiers in a modeling process of ada in this research an ada based hydrological model can be expressed as 7 y m x s i g n m m α m g m x m 1 m g x l n 1 α m where y m x is the simulation value from the ada based hydrological model g x is the medium value of α m y m x m 1 2 3 m and α m is the coefficient of weak learner for streamflow regression problem the weighted value from the ensemble of classifiers is taken as the final predicted value of ada based hydrological model xgb as an improved gradient boosting algorithm can efficiently solve the problem of data science computing sheridan et al 2016 in this study the xgb based hydrological model to simulate streamflow in the outlet of sdw can be presented as 8 y ˆ i t y ˆ i t 1 f t x i where y ˆ i t y i u u t is

precipitation changes a well calibrated statistical downscaling model was utilized to produce climate variables e g temperature and precipitation of the syr darya watershed sdw for the period of 2021 2100 using future climate predictors from six general circulation models gcms the prediction performance of different gcm models was evaluated through taylor diagrams effectively reflecting the uncertainty and heterogeneity of climate models during the downscaling process the correlation coefficient of temperature simulation ranges from 0 94 to 0 96 and the model with the strongest simulation capabilities is the multi model ensemble mme which is identified near the reference value observation however the simulation of precipitation by different gcm models is not as accurate with the correlation coefficient ranging from 0 72 to 0 78 due to the complexity of the meteorological conditions affecting rainfall and the endogenous uncertainties overall the simulation results of the selected gcm model and mme fall within the acceptable range and can be used to predict future maximum temperature minimum temperature average temperature and precipitation with mme exhibiting high simulation robustness under different scenarios based on different climate model data various combinations of future temperature and precipitation data can be obtained by driving sdsm model the detailed estimated temperature and precipitation combinations are shown in table 4 fig 4 shows the monthly changes in temperature and precipitation from 2021 to 2100 under different gcms and rcps results indicate a dynamic disparity in both precipitation and temperature minimum maximum and average under different climate models compared with the baseline period 1960 2005 for example under rcp 8 5 precipitation in february would increase by 36 54 38 65 can and nor but decrease by 14 26 39 92 cmc cnr and mpi in general the predicted monthly variations of rainfall under different climate models show significant differences integrated analysis of multiple climate models can effectively reflect the uncertainties between different climate models mme results indicate that future precipitation would increase in january february july august and december but decrease in other months under rcp8 5 the projected temperature under most gcms would increase in both rcp 4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios absolute changes in average temperature compared with baseline 1960 2005 are high under rcp 8 5 for example in march the average temperature would increase by 4 88 cmc under rcp8 5 and by 3 17 cmc under rcp4 5 in general projected average temperature changes largely under high emission pathway climate scenarios temperature projections have great uncertainty and fluctuation under different gcm models for instance in january the average temperature would increase by 1 81 3 17 cmc and mpi but decrease by 2 36 3 61 can cnr and nor under rcp 4 5 the mme can effectively reflect such uncertainty under mme the high average temperature is in june july and august and the low temperature is in other months respectively the trends in monthly climate factors were examined by computing the sen s slope of meteorological variables for each month fig 5 illustrates the sen s slope of monthly temperature and precipitation during the period of 2021 2100 under different gcms and rcps the trend analysis results showed that the change rate in meteorological variables exhibits significant variability among different gcms for instance under rcp8 5 the precipitation change rate in april was calculated at 0 028 mm month for cnr whereas for can it was estimated at 0 091 mm month this variation can be attributed to the dissimilarities in rainfall patterns and the uncertainty of climate models regarding temperature the temperature change rate is higher in the rcp8 5 scenario than in the rcp4 5 scenario the positive and negative values of sen s slope in each month indicate that the average temperature changes in november december january and february are substantial whereas the average temperature changes in may june and july are minor generally the change trend of monthly climate factors fluctuates considerably and there are uncertainties and discrepancies among different gcm models the majority of climate models display an upward trend in temperature and an upward trend in the rcp4 5 scenario under the rcp8 5 scenario in order to further evaluate the variability of climate variables two time intervals 2040 s 2021 2070 and 2080 s 2071 2100 are selected for the future period fig 6 shows the mean projection of seasonal changes of climate variables for multiple gcm models under different climate scenarios compared with the baseline period 1960 2005 the results of the projected climate values exhibit significant seasonality and the variation for the rcp8 5 emission scenario is more pronounced than for rcp4 5 for precipitation the overall mean precipitation would decrease in almost all gcm models under different climate scenarios and the precipitation variation under different gcm models shows significant differences to mitigate the impact of essential differences between gcms on the results more effective changes can be obtained through statistical analysis of the results of different gcm models where the mme results can be used as a control screening rules are formulated according to the mode principle specifically according to the results of the other five gcm models under rcp4 5 in spring the precipitation would decrease by 29 87 76 70 mm e g can decrease 29 87 cmc decrease 55 15 cnr decrease 75 54 mpi decrease 76 70 and nor decrease 43 88 in summer the precipitation would decrease by 7 55 36 42 mm e g can decrease 36 42 cmc decrease 7 55 cnr decrease 8 59 mpi increase 1 15 and nor decrease 30 65 in mme precipitation would decrease in spring summer autumn snowmelt and the annual period in 2040s under rcp4 5 but increase in winter and frozen periods according to the results of the statistical analysis of different gcm models the mean precipitation would decrease in both climate emission scenarios for temperature the projection mean variation values for the 2080s are more pronounced than those for the 2040s in both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios showing a significant upward trend overall the temperature in the syr darya river basin has shown an increasing trend while the precipitation has shown a decreasing trend which is consistent with the spatial results of the study by issanova et al 2015 therefore the projected results of temperature and precipitation have certain scientific and practical significance 3 2 evaluation of machine learning based hydrological model the hydrological models based on four machine learning methods adaboost random forest support vector machine and xgboost were trained smoothly using 75 of observed data 1960 2005 from meteorological and hydrological stations during the calibration period and the remaining 25 of observed data was reserved for testing the trained models performance during the validation period the nse rmse and pbs were computed to obtain the calibration and validation results of the four machine learning based hydrological models as depicted in fig 7 these models could effectively capture the runoff variation characteristics during calibration but their performance during validation was unsatisfactory for example during calibration the support vector machine svm based hydrological model exhibited an nse of 0 9329 an rmse of 78 48 and a pbs of 0 39 whereas during validation the nse rmse and pbs were 0 5793 213 61 and 0 72 respectively the limitations of statistical hydrological models overfitting problem and the multiple uncertainties of hydrological processes are the primary reasons for this performance disparity the absolute error represents the extent of deviation between the model simulation value and the observed value the overall performance of the statistical models was acceptable as indicated by the absolute error results of the four machine learning based hydrological models which can be utilized for subsequent streamflow forecasting 3 3 ensemble analysis of future streamflow variation the analysis indicates a pronounced decrease trend in precipitation and a significant increase trend in overall temperature including minimum maximum and average for both monthly and seasonal periods given the complex intrinsic correlation between climate variables and hydrological processes the projected variation trend of streamflow over sdw for the future period 2021 2100 is investigated by forcing downscaled climate data into the machine learning based hydrological model fig 8 illustrates the results of projected streamflow over four machine learning based hydrological models under different gcms and rcps the findings demonstrate that streamflow variation differs significantly under different emission scenarios using the identical hydrological model for example under rcp 4 5 the ada based hydrological model estimates projected streamflow to range from 272 90 m3 s nor to 576 32 m3 s cmc between different gcm projections with an annual average of 364 66 m3 s can 412 06 m3 s cmc 388 98 m3 s cnr 410 76 m3 s mpi 369 40 m3 s nor and 396 93 m3 s mme respectively under rcp 8 5 the projected streamflow over the ada based hydrological model is estimated to range from 256 64 m3 s can to 651 91 m3 s cmc between different gcm projections with an annual average of 394 80 m3 s can 426 40 m3 s cmc 345 60 m3 s cnr 419 98 m3 s mpi 383 21 m3 s nor and 387 74 m3 s mme respectively as depicted in table 5 the overall projected streamflow under rcp 8 5 is higher than that under rcp 4 5 the temperature rise trend under high emission scenarios may significantly increase glacier melting leading to streamflow variation in order to quantify the monthly difference in streamflow responses to climate change under different general circulation models gcms and representative concentration pathways rcps sen s slope is utilized to evaluate the variation trend of projected streamflow obtained from the machine learning based hydrological model as depicted in fig 9 the results indicate that the pronounced increase trends mainly occur from may to september reflecting the sensitivity of streamflow to climate change in different months moreover in the same month the variation trends of streamflow exhibit significant differences under different emission scenarios for instance in march under rcp 4 5 the variation trend of projected streamflow ranges from 0 0399 m3 s month mpi xgb to 1 2806 m3 s month can svm among different forecast combinations with an average of 0 2513 m3 s month under rcp 8 5 the variation trend of projected streamflow ranges from 0 3999 m3 s month cmc xgb to 1 0110 m3 s month mme svm among different forecast combinations with an average of 0 3354 m3 s month generally the overall average variation trend of projected streamflow under rcp 8 5 is higher than that under rcp 4 5 and the changes in streamflow in future warmer months may be more pronounced than in cooler months the relative changes in seasonal streamflow under different gcms and rcps are presented in fig 10 with a comparison to the baseline period 1960 2005 the estimated streamflow responses to climate change vary seasonally under different rcp scenarios significant increases in seasonal streamflow for the 2040s and 2080s periods are observed during winter and autumn under both emission scenarios however the results of the streamflow ensemble projections indicate pronounced decreases in seasonal streamflow for the two future periods during spring and summer under different emission scenarios to effectively reflect the variation trend of projected streamflow compared with the baseline period the frequency statistics method is used to observe the streamflow change trend under different emission scenarios for example as described in table 6 in the 2080s period streamflow decreases by 1 5 28 3 for most scenario combinations under rcp 8 5 scenario with the exception of an increase trend for cmc rf 2 1 cmc xgb 0 2 and mme xgb 0 6 during spring thus the variation trend of projected streamflow compared with the baseline period can be described as a decreasing trend during spring under rcp 8 5 scenario in the 2080s period furthermore the analysis of the variation trend under different climate scenarios indicates that the decrease trends in projected streamflow are observed during spring summer snowmelt and the annual period under both scenarios while the increase trends in projected streamflow are observed during autumn winter and frozen periods under both scenarios 3 4 uncertainty analysis of projected streamflow with the exacerbation of climate change uncertainties and dynamics are likely to emerge in future streamflow the dynamic variation of projected streamflow can be well analyzed by fitting an optimal distribution in this study three distributions namely the normal distribution chi square distribution and gamma distribution are used to fit the optimal distribution under different climate scenarios as depicted in table 7 the optimal distribution for each scenario combination can be obtained under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios by comparing the evaluation indicators sse aic bic ks statistical and p value of each distribution the results indicate that the frequency of the gamma distribution is high in both climate scenarios this suggests that the variation of future streamflow over sdw is likely to be characterized by a gamma distribution additionally in order to effectively capture the multiple uncertainties in hydrological processes the probability density variations of projected annual streamflow from 24 scenario combinations are computed under different climate scenarios as shown in fig 11 the results indicate that significant differences in projected streamflow are generally observed among multiple gcm models for instance under rcp8 5 the mean values of projected annual streamflow obtained from xgb based hydrological model in the future period 2021 2100 are 374 2 m3 s can xgb 415 2 m3 s cmc xgb 399 7 m3 s cnr xgb 405 9 m3 s mpi xgb 391 3 m3 s nor xgb and 404 0 m3 s mme xgb respectively the maximum variation of annual mean streamflow under different gcm models reaches up to 41 m3 s the primary reason for this is the multiple uncertainties of temperature and precipitation over different gcm models furthermore in the same gcm model by comparing the variation of projected streamflow over four machine learning hydrological models the results show that the capture capacity for streamflow is significantly different among the four statistical hydrological models for example under rcp 8 5 in canesm2 the variation of projected streamflow would be 284 4 482 1 m3 s for ada 336 0 468 6 m3 s for rf 276 5 582 9 m3 s for svm and 302 4 452 8 m3 s for xgb the primary reason for this is that structural differences and parameter discrepancies exist among machine learning methods 4 conclusions in this study a multi gcms based statistical ensemble analysis mgsea method is applied to the syr darya watershed sdw for analyzing the change trend of temperature precipitation and streamflow in the future period the mgsea method considers six gcms two emission scenarios and four machine learning methods in the general framework several findings are summarized as follows i the variation characteristics of precipitation and temperature over the sdw can be well captured by mgsea with correlation coefficients r of temperature minimum maximum and average temperature greater than 0 94 and r of precipitation greater than 0 71 ii under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios the increase trends of minimum temperature maximum temperature and average temperature are observed in the future period with an amplification of t max t ave t min iii the increase trend of temperature during winter is higher than other seasons e g summer spring and autumn iv under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios compared with the baseline period future precipitation shows significant dynamic change characteristics with a pronounced decrease trend of 3 7 47 7 for interannual v mgsea can effectively simulate the variation of monthly streamflow over the sdw with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse greater than 0 57 in the validation period vi compared with the baseline period under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios the decrease trend of overall streamflow is observed for interannual and the amplitude reduction is greater in 2080s than in 2040s vii the streamflow over the sdw would increase in autumn and winter and decrease in summer and spring and the streamflow variation in winter is relatively small the findings of this study which analyzed the variations of temperature precipitation and streamflow under different climate scenarios can provide scientific support for subsequent research on water resources management in the sdw furthermore the developed methodology can be applied to other river basins for assessing the impact of hydrological processes under varying climate scenarios although mgsea has demonstrated strong applicability in sdw enabling effective reflection of uncertainties associated with gcm outputs and hydrological simulations several deficiencies and limitations remain for instance this study has only utilized five gcm models along with an average gcm model future research should consider a broader range of gcms and climate scenarios furthermore only four machine learning based hydrological models were employed in capturing streamflow variations integrating hydrological mechanism modules into the statistical hydrological model can improve the simulation accuracy of streamflow credit authorship contribution statement x b zhai investigation

balance of a watershed however limited understanding exists of the temperature precipitation and streamflow trends in the syr darya watershed under the influence of climate change due to the uncertainties associated with climate change and the incompleteness of observational data in this study a multi gcms based statistical ensemble analysis mgsea method is developed to effectively reflect the uncertainty of climate predictions and comprehensively assess the impact of climate change on the syr darya watershed during the period from 2021 to 2100 new hydrological insights for the

learning syr darya watershed data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years the impacts of global climate change have intensified leading to a growing body of research examining the effects of climate change in various region he et al 2019a 2019b arantes et al 2021 the watershed is a critical area that is significantly impacted by climate change zhang et al 2020 this region serves as an intersection between natural ecosystems and human activities making it vulnerable to the effects of climate change including changes in precipitation patterns availability of water resources and an increased risk of floods and droughts ahmadi et al 2019 li et al 2022 the hydrological processes in watersheds can also be affected resulting in altered water levels in rivers and lakes and an overall disturbance to the ecosystem yang et al 2020 lian et al 2021 therefore it is imperative to investigate the impact of climate change on these processes to enhance our understanding of how it influences water resources ecological systems social and economic aspects and human health in the watershed this research can assist in formulating adaptive and mitigative measures thereby developing strategies to reduce the impact of climate change advancing our comprehension of the impact of climate change on hydrological processes in watersheds is crucial for devising approaches to mitigate and adapt to its effects previously lots of research works have been conducted to explore the impact of climate change on the hydrological situation in watersheds farsi and mahjouri 2019 huq and abdul aziz 2021 for instance guan et al 2021 analyzed the changing trends of key hydro meteorological variables and runoff in 10 major river zones in china using the climate elasticity method to quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities and provided projections of future runoff using climate model ensemble simulations under different socioeconomic pathways santos et al 2021 evaluated the future impacts of land use and climate change on streamflow and sediment yield in the tapacurá river basin in brazil using a combination of approaches including a global circulation model and a multilayer perceptron algorithm in general with the help of robust simulation models the characteristics of climate and hydrological elements under climate change can be effectively analyzed however large scale climate models and physical mechanism models have limited applicability in small scale areas such as syr darya watershed where data is scarce or limited cai et al 2022 due to the uncertainty of climate change predictions and the inherent nonlinearity and complexity of climatic hydrological processes especially in many arid basins the impacts of climate change are difficult to investigate shi et al 2022 ding et al 2022 there are structural differences in the initialization and mathematical parameterization of various physical processes in atmospheric circulation models so the climate change predictions such as temperature and precipitation produced by atmospheric circulation models are often uncertain fortunately multi gcm ensemble analysis can effectively reflect the uncertainty of climate models and has been widely applied in climate change research accurately assessing the impacts of climate change on arid basins is complex due to large climate heterogeneity lack of data and the dynamic response of glaciers snowmelt water to climate change chen et al 2014 øygarden et al 2014 he et al 2019b in hydrological models the relationship between hydrological outputs such as streamflow and hydro meteorological inputs such as precipitation and temperature is essentially nonlinear complex and time varying which poses challenges for streamflow simulation statistical hydrological models such as machine learning based hydrological models can effectively deal with discrete and nonlinear systems by characterizing the relationship between inputs and outputs wu et al 2022 korsic et al 2023 ditthakit et al 2023 it has strong applicability to different regions and handles the nonlinear relationship between continuous and or discrete variables samantaray et al 2022 however due to the differences in the relationships characterized by different algorithms multi model ensemble analysis is worth expecting chu et al 2016 gao et al 2020 liu et al 2021 the difficulty of forecasting future streamflow is exacerbated in arid watersheds with limited data availability such as the syr darya basin currently most studies in the syr darya basin rely on historical hydrological analysis which lacks research on trends in temperature precipitation and streamflow changes under climate change jia et al 2020 wang et al 2021 klimaszyk et al 2022 there is a research gap in the study of changes in climatic variables and hydrological processes of syr darya watershed sdw in the upstream syr darya basin under future climate change therefore it is necessary to fully consider the current research methods and the status quo of the study area to address the above research gap this study develops a mixed ensemble of multiple climate models and multiple machine learning algorithms named as multi gcms based statistical ensemble analysis mgsea method to analyze future changes in climate elements and streamflow of sdw mgsea is capable of reflecting the uncertainty between different climate models and the differences in simulations among different machine learning algorithms and providing a comprehensive estimation of the impacts of future climate change on sdw which can provide scientific support for water resources management in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 study area as shown in fig 1 the syr darya watershed sdw is located in aral sea basin central asia as a major river of the aral sea basin syr darya river rises in the tianshan mountains and flows through the turan lowlands into the aral sea afanasyev et al 2020 the streamflow in the upper reaches of the syr darya river mainly comes from the confluence of naryn and karadarya the climate of the study area is a temperate continental feature howells et al 2021 in the catchment the average annual precipitation is about 465 95 mm and the mean temperature is about 17 9 22 7 sorg et al 2014 shi et al 2020 as a result of climate change the monthly average streamflow in the upstream syr darya river basin decreased from 667 08 m3 s in 1960 262 88 m3 s in 1985 a decrease of nearly 60 58 this has caused serious ecological environmental problems such as a decline in biodiversity land salinization and vegetation degradation upstream streamflow has important influence on downstream ecological security environmental stability and sustainable development therefore the effective assessment of the impact of climate change on streamflow over sdw is desirable for taking scientific intervention measures 2 1 2 data

the representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 lower emission scenario and rcp8 5 higher emission scenario are considered in this research by obtaining climate variables in two climate scenarios the response of climate variables to different climate fluctuations can be intuitively analyzed 2 2 2 statistical downscaling model the original climate variables of global climate models gcms are not enough to really present the regional climate information and effectively reflect the regional climate characteristics an efficient downscaling analysis method is urgently expected to convert the outputs of gcm models into regional scale information in this research the statistical downscaling model sdsm is used for downscaling the original climate variables data to the regional level the sdsm software can be downloaded from the website freely http www sdsm org uk as a hybrid statistical downscaling model it includes weather generator and multiple linear regression though identifying the cross scale relationship the sdsm model can effectively construct the function between the large scale gcm and the regional climate element e g precipitation and temperature in this research the reanalyzed atmospheric dataset predictor obtained from national centers for environmental prediction ncep and the observed data predictand meteorological station are used for calibrating the sdsm

including support vector machine svm random forest rf adaptive boosting ada and extreme gradient boosting xgb the statistical hydrological model is constructed by integrating different machine learning methods into an ensemble framework the ensemble method can fully reflect the differences between different modeling methods and improve the robustness of streamflow prediction svm is a machine learning algorithm based on statistical theory kriti et al 2016 svm uses risk minimization criteria in the modeling process to avoid over learning and improve the generalization ability of the model chen et al 2017 under different model parameter settings svm is used for solving classification and regression problems through constructing a regression tree svm can be used for dealing with the regression problem and the regression form of svm can be described as support vector regression svr in this study the svm based hydrological model can be formulated as two functions the first part is the simulation model eq 1 and the second part is the error function eq 2 the detailed function can be expressed as follows 4 f x ω t x b 5 y f x 0 i f y f x ε y f x ε ζ o t h e r w i s e where y

ζ is model sensitivity function and penalty respectively through forcing observed data and downscaled future data the simulation and prediction streamflow of svm based hydrological model can be obtained rf is one of widely used ensemble learning methods which generates predicted value through integrating numbers of decision trees into a forest sangjun et al 2019 kim et al 2021 as a special bagging method the decision tree is used as the module within a modeling of rf through using the bootstrap method the training datasets generated effectively thus rfis widely used for solving the classification and regression problem following the feature of regression a rf based hydrological model can be formulated through developing the regression tree in this study the simulated streamflow can be obtained from a rf based hydrological model the model can be expressed as follows 6 y x i f x i λ δ where y x i is the simulated streamflow x i is a range of climate variables of the watershed λ is the frame parameter of rf model and δ is the parameters of decision trees through inputting the climate variables the simulated value of streamflow can be procured from the well calibrated rf based hydrological model ada was proposed by yoav freund and robert schapire in 1995 as a self adaptation machine learning algorithm ada is widely used in classification and regression by updating the weight of samples and classifiers the sample weight is calculated according to the current model error complex regression problems can be effectively solved by constantly adjusting the weights of samples and classifiers in a modeling process of ada in this research an ada based hydrological model can be expressed as 7 y m x s i g n m m α m g m x m 1 m g x l n 1 α m where y m x is the simulation value from the ada based hydrological model g x is the medium value of α m y m x m 1 2 3 m and α m is the coefficient of weak learner for streamflow regression problem the weighted value from the ensemble of classifiers is taken as the final predicted value of ada based hydrological model xgb as an improved gradient boosting algorithm can efficiently solve the problem of data science computing sheridan et al 2016 in this study the xgb based hydrological model to simulate streamflow in the outlet of sdw can be presented as 8 y ˆ i t y ˆ i t 1 f t x i where y ˆ i t y i u u t is

precipitation changes a well calibrated statistical downscaling model was utilized to produce climate variables e g temperature and precipitation of the syr darya watershed sdw for the period of 2021 2100 using future climate predictors from six general circulation models gcms the prediction performance of different gcm models was evaluated through taylor diagrams effectively reflecting the uncertainty and heterogeneity of climate models during the downscaling process the correlation coefficient of temperature simulation ranges from 0 94 to 0 96 and the model with the strongest simulation capabilities is the multi model ensemble mme which is identified near the reference value observation however the simulation of precipitation by different gcm models is not as accurate with the correlation coefficient ranging from 0 72 to 0 78 due to the complexity of the meteorological conditions affecting rainfall and the endogenous uncertainties overall the simulation results of the selected gcm model and mme fall within the acceptable range and can be used to predict future maximum temperature minimum temperature average temperature and precipitation with mme exhibiting high simulation robustness under different scenarios based on different climate model data various combinations of future temperature and precipitation data can be obtained by driving sdsm model the detailed estimated temperature and precipitation combinations are shown in table 4 fig 4 shows the monthly changes in temperature and precipitation from 2021 to 2100 under different gcms and rcps results indicate a dynamic disparity in both precipitation and temperature minimum maximum and average under different climate models compared with the baseline period 1960 2005 for example under rcp 8 5 precipitation in february would increase by 36 54 38 65 can and nor but decrease by 14 26 39 92 cmc cnr and mpi in general the predicted monthly variations of rainfall under different climate models show significant differences integrated analysis of multiple climate models can effectively reflect the uncertainties between different climate models mme results indicate that future precipitation would increase in january february july august and december but decrease in other months under rcp8 5 the projected temperature under most gcms would increase in both rcp 4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios absolute changes in average temperature compared with baseline 1960 2005 are high under rcp 8 5 for example in march the average temperature would increase by 4 88 cmc under rcp8 5 and by 3 17 cmc under rcp4 5 in general projected average temperature changes largely under high emission pathway climate scenarios temperature projections have great uncertainty and fluctuation under different gcm models for instance in january the average temperature would increase by 1 81 3 17 cmc and mpi but decrease by 2 36 3 61 can cnr and nor under rcp 4 5 the mme can effectively reflect such uncertainty under mme the high average temperature is in june july and august and the low temperature is in other months respectively the trends in monthly climate factors were examined by computing the sen s slope of meteorological variables for each month fig 5 illustrates the sen s slope of monthly temperature and precipitation during the period of 2021 2100 under different gcms and rcps the trend analysis results showed that the change rate in meteorological variables exhibits significant variability among different gcms for instance under rcp8 5 the precipitation change rate in april was calculated at 0 028 mm month for cnr whereas for can it was estimated at 0 091 mm month this variation can be attributed to the dissimilarities in rainfall patterns and the uncertainty of climate models regarding temperature the temperature change rate is higher in the rcp8 5 scenario than in the rcp4 5 scenario the positive and negative values of sen s slope in each month indicate that the average temperature changes in november december january and february are substantial whereas the average temperature changes in may june and july are minor generally the change trend of monthly climate factors fluctuates considerably and there are uncertainties and discrepancies among different gcm models the majority of climate models display an upward trend in temperature and an upward trend in the rcp4 5 scenario under the rcp8 5 scenario in order to further evaluate the variability of climate variables two time intervals 2040 s 2021 2070 and 2080 s 2071 2100 are selected for the future period fig 6 shows the mean projection of seasonal changes of climate variables for multiple gcm models under different climate scenarios compared with the baseline period 1960 2005 the results of the projected climate values exhibit significant seasonality and the variation for the rcp8 5 emission scenario is more pronounced than for rcp4 5 for precipitation the overall mean precipitation would decrease in almost all gcm models under different climate scenarios and the precipitation variation under different gcm models shows significant differences to mitigate the impact of essential differences between gcms on the results more effective changes can be obtained through statistical analysis of the results of different gcm models where the mme results can be used as a control screening rules are formulated according to the mode principle specifically according to the results of the other five gcm models under rcp4 5 in spring the precipitation would decrease by 29 87 76 70 mm e g can decrease 29 87 cmc decrease 55 15 cnr decrease 75 54 mpi decrease 76 70 and nor decrease 43 88 in summer the precipitation would decrease by 7 55 36 42 mm e g can decrease 36 42 cmc decrease 7 55 cnr decrease 8 59 mpi increase 1 15 and nor decrease 30 65 in mme precipitation would decrease in spring summer autumn snowmelt and the annual period in 2040s under rcp4 5 but increase in winter and frozen periods according to the results of the statistical analysis of different gcm models the mean precipitation would decrease in both climate emission scenarios for temperature the projection mean variation values for the 2080s are more pronounced than those for the 2040s in both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios showing a significant upward trend overall the temperature in the syr darya river basin has shown an increasing trend while the precipitation has shown a decreasing trend which is consistent with the spatial results of the study by issanova et al 2015 therefore the projected results of temperature and precipitation have certain scientific and practical significance 3 2 evaluation of machine learning based hydrological model the hydrological models based on four machine learning methods adaboost random forest support vector machine and xgboost were trained smoothly using 75 of observed data 1960 2005 from meteorological and hydrological stations during the calibration period and the remaining 25 of observed data was reserved for testing the trained models performance during the validation period the nse rmse and pbs were computed to obtain the calibration and validation results of the four machine learning based hydrological models as depicted in fig 7 these models could effectively capture the runoff variation characteristics during calibration but their performance during validation was unsatisfactory for example during calibration the support vector machine svm based hydrological model exhibited an nse of 0 9329 an rmse of 78 48 and a pbs of 0 39 whereas during validation the nse rmse and pbs were 0 5793 213 61 and 0 72 respectively the limitations of statistical hydrological models overfitting problem and the multiple uncertainties of hydrological processes are the primary reasons for this performance disparity the absolute error represents the extent of deviation between the model simulation value and the observed value the overall performance of the statistical models was acceptable as indicated by the absolute error results of the four machine learning based hydrological models which can be utilized for subsequent streamflow forecasting 3 3 ensemble analysis of future streamflow variation the analysis indicates a pronounced decrease trend in precipitation and a significant increase trend in overall temperature including minimum maximum and average for both monthly and seasonal periods given the complex intrinsic correlation between climate variables and hydrological processes the projected variation trend of streamflow over sdw for the future period 2021 2100 is investigated by forcing downscaled climate data into the machine learning based hydrological model fig 8 illustrates the results of projected streamflow over four machine learning based hydrological models under different gcms and rcps the findings demonstrate that streamflow variation differs significantly under different emission scenarios using the identical hydrological model for example under rcp 4 5 the ada based hydrological model estimates projected streamflow to range from 272 90 m3 s nor to 576 32 m3 s cmc between different gcm projections with an annual average of 364 66 m3 s can 412 06 m3 s cmc 388 98 m3 s cnr 410 76 m3 s mpi 369 40 m3 s nor and 396 93 m3 s mme respectively under rcp 8 5 the projected streamflow over the ada based hydrological model is estimated to range from 256 64 m3 s can to 651 91 m3 s cmc between different gcm projections with an annual average of 394 80 m3 s can 426 40 m3 s cmc 345 60 m3 s cnr 419 98 m3 s mpi 383 21 m3 s nor and 387 74 m3 s mme respectively as depicted in table 5 the overall projected streamflow under rcp 8 5 is higher than that under rcp 4 5 the temperature rise trend under high emission scenarios may significantly increase glacier melting leading to streamflow variation in order to quantify the monthly difference in streamflow responses to climate change under different general circulation models gcms and representative concentration pathways rcps sen s slope is utilized to evaluate the variation trend of projected streamflow obtained from the machine learning based hydrological model as depicted in fig 9 the results indicate that the pronounced increase trends mainly occur from may to september reflecting the sensitivity of streamflow to climate change in different months moreover in the same month the variation trends of streamflow exhibit significant differences under different emission scenarios for instance in march under rcp 4 5 the variation trend of projected streamflow ranges from 0 0399 m3 s month mpi xgb to 1 2806 m3 s month can svm among different forecast combinations with an average of 0 2513 m3 s month under rcp 8 5 the variation trend of projected streamflow ranges from 0 3999 m3 s month cmc xgb to 1 0110 m3 s month mme svm among different forecast combinations with an average of 0 3354 m3 s month generally the overall average variation trend of projected streamflow under rcp 8 5 is higher than that under rcp 4 5 and the changes in streamflow in future warmer months may be more pronounced than in cooler months the relative changes in seasonal streamflow under different gcms and rcps are presented in fig 10 with a comparison to the baseline period 1960 2005 the estimated streamflow responses to climate change vary seasonally under different rcp scenarios significant increases in seasonal streamflow for the 2040s and 2080s periods are observed during winter and autumn under both emission scenarios however the results of the streamflow ensemble projections indicate pronounced decreases in seasonal streamflow for the two future periods during spring and summer under different emission scenarios to effectively reflect the variation trend of projected streamflow compared with the baseline period the frequency statistics method is used to observe the streamflow change trend under different emission scenarios for example as described in table 6 in the 2080s period streamflow decreases by 1 5 28 3 for most scenario combinations under rcp 8 5 scenario with the exception of an increase trend for cmc rf 2 1 cmc xgb 0 2 and mme xgb 0 6 during spring thus the variation trend of projected streamflow compared with the baseline period can be described as a decreasing trend during spring under rcp 8 5 scenario in the 2080s period furthermore the analysis of the variation trend under different climate scenarios indicates that the decrease trends in projected streamflow are observed during spring summer snowmelt and the annual period under both scenarios while the increase trends in projected streamflow are observed during autumn winter and frozen periods under both scenarios 3 4 uncertainty analysis of projected streamflow with the exacerbation of climate change uncertainties and dynamics are likely to emerge in future streamflow the dynamic variation of projected streamflow can be well analyzed by fitting an optimal distribution in this study three distributions namely the normal distribution chi square distribution and gamma distribution are used to fit the optimal distribution under different climate scenarios as depicted in table 7 the optimal distribution for each scenario combination can be obtained under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios by comparing the evaluation indicators sse aic bic ks statistical and p value of each distribution the results indicate that the frequency of the gamma distribution is high in both climate scenarios this suggests that the variation of future streamflow over sdw is likely to be characterized by a gamma distribution additionally in order to effectively capture the multiple uncertainties in hydrological processes the probability density variations of projected annual streamflow from 24 scenario combinations are computed under different climate scenarios as shown in fig 11 the results indicate that significant differences in projected streamflow are generally observed among multiple gcm models for instance under rcp8 5 the mean values of projected annual streamflow obtained from xgb based hydrological model in the future period 2021 2100 are 374 2 m3 s can xgb 415 2 m3 s cmc xgb 399 7 m3 s cnr xgb 405 9 m3 s mpi xgb 391 3 m3 s nor xgb and 404 0 m3 s mme xgb respectively the maximum variation of annual mean streamflow under different gcm models reaches up to 41 m3 s the primary reason for this is the multiple uncertainties of temperature and precipitation over different gcm models furthermore in the same gcm model by comparing the variation of projected streamflow over four machine learning hydrological models the results show that the capture capacity for streamflow is significantly different among the four statistical hydrological models for example under rcp 8 5 in canesm2 the variation of projected streamflow would be 284 4 482 1 m3 s for ada 336 0 468 6 m3 s for rf 276 5 582 9 m3 s for svm and 302 4 452 8 m3 s for xgb the primary reason for this is that structural differences and parameter discrepancies exist among machine learning methods 4 conclusions in this study a multi gcms based statistical ensemble analysis mgsea method is applied to the syr darya watershed sdw for analyzing the change trend of temperature precipitation and streamflow in the future period the mgsea method considers six gcms two emission scenarios and four machine learning methods in the general framework several findings are summarized as follows i the variation characteristics of precipitation and temperature over the sdw can be well captured by mgsea with correlation coefficients r of temperature minimum maximum and average temperature greater than 0 94 and r of precipitation greater than 0 71 ii under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios the increase trends of minimum temperature maximum temperature and average temperature are observed in the future period with an amplification of t max t ave t min iii the increase trend of temperature during winter is higher than other seasons e g summer spring and autumn iv under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios compared with the baseline period future precipitation shows significant dynamic change characteristics with a pronounced decrease trend of 3 7 47 7 for interannual v mgsea can effectively simulate the variation of monthly streamflow over the sdw with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse greater than 0 57 in the validation period vi compared with the baseline period under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios the decrease trend of overall streamflow is observed for interannual and the amplitude reduction is greater in 2080s than in 2040s vii the streamflow over the sdw would increase in autumn and winter and decrease in summer and spring and the streamflow variation in winter is relatively small the findings of this study which analyzed the variations of temperature precipitation and streamflow under different climate scenarios can provide scientific support for subsequent research on water resources management in the sdw furthermore the developed methodology can be applied to other river basins for assessing the impact of hydrological processes under varying climate scenarios although mgsea has demonstrated strong applicability in sdw enabling effective reflection of uncertainties associated with gcm outputs and hydrological simulations several deficiencies and limitations remain for instance this study has only utilized five gcm models along with an average gcm model future research should consider a broader range of gcms and climate scenarios furthermore only four machine learning based hydrological models were employed in capturing streamflow variations integrating hydrological mechanism modules into the statistical hydrological model can improve the simulation accuracy of streamflow credit authorship contribution statement x b zhai investigation

7691,study region the aswan region is a vast plateau in the south of egypt located 150 m above mean sea level amsl within this region the tourist city of aswan is egypt s southernmost city located on the east bank of the nile river study focus the occurrence of flash floods can severely impact low lying and densely populated areas therefore highly vulnerable areas require effective mitigation measures to guarantee public safety and preserve archeological sites of great importance this study investigates the interaction between the soil surface water and groundwater in the aswan region of egypt based on the rainfall analysis and the watershed hydrology six different scenarios were run using the modflow and watershed modeling system wms software which simulated rainfall recurrence intervals of 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 years new hydrological insights for the region the model s results indicated that an increase in the recurrence interval produced a rise in the groundwater level gwl up to 8 82 m amsl therefore constructing three dams was proposed as a solution at the three basins of al haytah al kimab and umm buwayrat the proposed solution allows the storage of large volumes of water upstream it mitigates gwl s rise within and near aswan city the presented study can be applied to vulnerable watersheds in arid and semi arid regions it can help policymakers to integrate additional sustainable solutions into construction dams and their implementation in development plans graphical abstract ga1 keywords aswan flash floods groundwater modflow storage dam hydrograph data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction rising groundwater levels are a chronic problem for highly populated residential areas at low elevation sites selim et al 2014 many countries worldwide have experienced rising groundwater levels gwl in recent decades with remarkable economic and environmental impacts on regional and urban environments niu et al 2014 sahoo et al 2021 this problem is exacerbated in arid and semi arid regions such as aswan egypt due to persistent intra seasonal drought and infrequent intense rainfall causing extremely damaging flash floods ghazavi et al 2012 because of insufficient rainfall groundwater is the only available resource for interdisciplinary development around the nile valley elbeih 2015 groundwater is vital for many purposes including water supply systems irrigation livestock watering and industrial commercial mining and thermo electric power production el tahlawi et al 2008 groundwater is the only reliable drinking and irrigation water source in many localities in egypt this vital resource is vulnerable to contamination and is increasingly threatened by various pollutants from landfills soil treatment systems septic tanks and subsurface disposal wells the natural groundwater balance in aswan city egypt is overturned into an unbalance where the input to the water table is comparatively much more than the natural groundwater flow toward the nile river abd elaty et al 2022 chen 2022 raising the groundwater level from 2009 to now is flooding the urban areas and the infrastructure and reflects vital current environmental problems the dynamic response of the gwl depends on climatic conditions surface water groundwater interaction groundwater consumption and other human activities minville et al 2010 the rainfall distribution in arid and semi arid areas is typically bimodal and skewed with peaks in winter and spring ngigi et al 2008 more intense rainfall may cause extensive overland flow ghazavi et al 2012 the interaction between surface waters and groundwater is complex it must account for land use climate change water quality and agricultural water use tian et al 2015 al sefry and şen 2006 investigated the risk of groundwater rising in major cities of arid lands in jeddah kingdom of saudi arabia ksa the results showed that the water returned to surface cesspools the leakages from the insufficient sewage system and the water supply system leakages caused a raise of the gwl fakharinia et al 2012 simulated the gwl using modflow software due to the construction of the subsurface dam in the shahrekord aquifer iran the authors found that the subsurface dam raised the water table by 0 50 m at a 4 km distance upstream of the dam bob et al 2016 studied the problem of the shallow groundwater table rise in madinah city saudi arabia using drilling wells accordingly the authors recommended a dewatering system to lower the shallow groundwater table rise consequently avoiding increased water levels in the water logging of aswan city and flash flooding influences have been serious challenges in sites such as archaeological and urban areas chen 2022 in 2021 aswan city was subjected to flash floods which damaged the infrastructures buildings and temples fig 1 the waterlogging is due to the continuously rising groundwater levels in the aswan plain and wetlands observed in several parts of aswan city groundwater levels were studied by el shinawi et al 2022 the study investigated the interactions between groundwater and surface water for demand purposes abd elaty et al 2022 studied the vulnerability of the groundwater due to the stoppage of pumping from the quaternary aquifer at the el shalal kema area aswan the results showed that the turnoff of pumping caused an increase in the groundwater levels in the city selim et al 2014 examined the rising gwl in aswan city its causes and solutions the results showed that due to leakages or infiltrations from different sources the natural groundwater balance is overturned into an unbalance where the input to the water table is comparatively much more than the natural groundwater flow towards the nile river hossen et al 2022 developed an artificial neural network ann model for monitoring the changes in gwl due to the construction of the naga hammadi barrage megahed et al 2021 used chemical analysis and remote sensing data to assess the environmental impacts of rising groundwater near aswan the results showed that since 2009 15 productive drinking water wells were closed causing a rise in gwl and salinity the study detected and calculated the area influenced by groundwater seepage urbanization and agricultural reclamation abu seif et al 2022 the groundwater usage in aswan city is limited as the nile river water is used and the limited amount that groundwater is used for public water supply selim et al 2014 unsuccessful groundwater management and urban planning have led to a continuous rise in gwl in the last half century causing increased waterlogging in the aswan plain abd elaty et al 2022 thus effective solutions are needed to facilitate sustainable development and minimize environmental hazards for archaeological and densely populated sites the study investigates the management of gwl rises through the construction of dams to reduce the impact of flash floods in many areas of the aswan plain to significantly enhance the protection management soil physical properties were determined for geo environmental assessment el shinawi and naymushina 2015 the soil characterization watershed and groundwater modeling and storage dams have proven effective in environmental and hydrogeological studies el shinawi et al 2021 othman et al 2022 this study hypothesizes that the dam construction will mitigate gwl rise in the aswan region different scenarios of dam construction are investigated to understand if such measures can considerably mitigate gwl rise and protect the lowland part from flash floods 2 study site the aswan region is bounded by the mountain in the northeast the nile river in the north west and the high aswan dam in the south the study area can be divided into three main units fig 2 including i the lowland aswan plain is almost flat with a slope from the south to the north including the western and the eastern plain the plain surface is underlain by sand gravel and slit of the quaternary ii highlands by the mountainous and underlain by basement rocks and or by nubian sandstones extend in the eastern side with elevations varying from 164 m to 188 m amsl and dissected with several wadis from east to west including wadi al hayatah wadi al hayatah wadi al kimba and wadi umm buwayrat the highland occupies in the central parts with elevations vary from 142 m to 167 m amsl also the other are small highlands are located to the west and close to the nile river as gebel tagug 150 m and el karor 135 m amsl and iii the nile river in the western of aswan city aswan dam has a water reservoir in the south of aswan city with water levels ranging between 106 m and 118 m amsl elhossainy et al 2021 the climate of aswan city is characterized by a very high summer and a mild winter climate on average the area receives occasional thunderstorms that may penetrate the area once every 10 15 years mahmoud et al 2021 in urban regions quantifying groundwater recharge is especially challenging because the urban environment is quite complex a large variety of land uses and land covers coexist and overlap due to the heterogeneity of the shallow underground selim et al 2014 2 1 topography and geomorphology the vast plateau of the aswan region has an average height of 150 m amsl near the nile valley and it rises towards the east to 200 m amsl the level of the nile valley in the aswan region is about 100 m amsl and the study area consists of irregularly shaped hills separated by some drainage lines khor the topography of the urban region plays a key role in the groundwater levels rise problem in a large plateau at 150 m amsl in which the levels of low elevated lands are high influence by the rising of the water table compared with the high elevated lands the mainstream starts from the valley and ascends the slope to the plateau s surface through a section from north to south goharian et al 2022 thus geomorphologically the aswan region can be divided into three main areas low uplands aswan plain 150 m high elevated lands 200 m and the bed of the nile river 100 m fig 2 fig 3 presents the changing in surface water levels in kima pond from years 2009 2021 due to changing the hydrological conditions in the city for the abstraction and recharge rates 2 2 geology of the study area geologically the study area is mainly covered by sediments belonging to pre cambrian to cretaceous and quaternary fig 4a the precambrian rocks are metamorphic and igneous rocks with thickness ranges between 35 m and 40 m and represent the oldest and mainly exposed rocks they have many fractures and can play an important role in the accretion of water in many parts of the study area abu seif et al 2022 leila et al 2021 the cretaceous represented by nubian sandstone is exposed in the central and eastern parts of the study area it overlies the pre cambrian rocks unconformably these sediments comprise conglomerates pebbles kaolinitic clays and sandstones in variable thickness ranges between 20 m and 85 m the nubian sandstone series is divided into the upper cretaceous age s lower middle and upper the quaternary sediments cover a large extent on the eastern side of the aswan area these pleistocene sediments are composed of sand and gravel a thick bed of pliocene clays underlines them floodplain deposits at shallow depths on the eastern side of aswan city are composed of clayey sand and clays with alluvial and aeolian deposits in some places see fig 4a 2 3 hydrogeological setting the quaternary aquifer mainly consists of unconsolidated sands gravels and clay intercalation material the impermeable layers do not cover it in a major part of the area therefore it is under unconfined conditions the transmissivity t values of the quaternary aquifer range between 1996 m2 day 1 and 3029 m2 day 1 which classifies the aquifer as a high potential class hamdan and rady 2013 the thickness of the quaternary aquifer varies from 100 m in the southern part to 137 m in the central part underlined by the pliocene clay the basement rocks represent the eastern border of the quaternary water bearing sediments caped with nubian sandstone at the same time the highland of the el sheik haroon plateau bounds westward the width of the aquifer is small and ranges between 2 05 km northward and 1 37 km southward the natural recharge to the quaternary aquifer is from the surface water system by the aswan dam lake which has a water level ranging between 108 m and 118 m amsl towards the city s urban areas the first source of artificial recharge is the infiltration from unlined ponds of the fish hatchery in the el shallal area with about 4 66 million cubic meters per year mcm year 1 fig 3a the second source of recharge is the leakage from the sewage system or septic tanks reaching annually 4 27 mcm 4 15 mcm 9 72 mcm 9 93 mcm and 10 01 mcm in years 2017 2018 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively also the total annual recharge reached 9 04 mcm 8 92 mcm 14 49 mcm 14 70 mcm and 14 78 mcm from 2017 to 2021 respectively this increase in leakage quantities led to increased groundwater logging in aswan city the third source is the seepage from the aswan dam reservoir where the water level ranges between 106 m and 112 m amsl depending on the water income from the high dam and the water demands downstream of the reservoir the fourth source is the seepage of surface water for irrigation in the cultivated lands i e in the far west because of the old irrigation method the fifth source is the flash flood from mountains in the west which is variable and depends on the rainfall rates intensity and duration fig 5a the aquifer is discharged through the natural groundwater outflow to the nile river in the northern part of the city and groundwater is abstracted by pumping at kima and el shallal areas the source of abstraction in the study area is contributed to continuous withdrawal due to industrial and domestic use especially in the kima and el shalal areas reaching 13 28 mcm year 1 and 12 44 mcm year 1 respectively fig 5b with a total abstraction of 25 72 mcm after 2009 the el shallal pumping wells stopped completely and the production of kima pumping wells decreased to 9 12 mcm year 1 the last period saw part of the el shallal wells beginning to operate with a production capacity of 0 13 mcm year 1 and the continuation of kima wells with a production capacity of 9 12 mcm in 2020 and 2021 the total abstraction reached 9 12 mcm 9 12 mcm 9 12 mcm 9 25 mcm and 9 25 mcm from 2017 to 2021 respectively fig 5b fig 5c presents the fluctuation in groundwater levels in aswan city in the central part of the study area from 1971 to 2021 the water level was raised from 1971 to 2009 with low changes a rapid rise was done from year 2009 to 2010 fig 3a 3b due to the shutoff of the pumping wells at the el shall region and the reduction of the abstraction rates in kima pond from the year 2010 2017 the groundwater level was raised to the maximum levels and then returned to fall from the year 2015 2019 fig 3c due to the digging of pumping wells by government agencies to abstract the floods groundwater from the basements from the year 2015 2021 fig 3d the groundwater was returned to raised due to the abstracted wells were stopped in a reason to the sewage networks capacity compare with the abstracted groundwater abd elaty et al 2022 from the above section the groundwater levels in the study area are high influence by the surface water system including the seepage from the aswan high dam lake the infiltration from unlined ponds of the fish hatchery in the el shallal area the leakage from drinking and wastewater network also the groundwater abstraction from kima and el shalal areas this link between the hydrological parameters for flow to the aquifer and the abstraction using production pumping wells led to groundwater and surface water dynamics over the years also the current study must investigate the dynamic effect of flash flooding on the groundwater levels to manage the water logging problem 3 materials and methods 3 1 soil sampling representative soil samples were collected from 8 boreholes distributed across the aswan urban areas i e floodplain deposits fig 2 undisturbed samples were collected from the different boreholes at 1 m to represent lithological changes sufficiently an overall depth varying between 10 m and 20 m was reached subsequent laboratory analyses included the determination of particle size distribution astmd 2487 2018 bulk density dry density specific gravity water content wc effective porosity e and total porosity n and degree of saturation sr astmd854 14 2016 the data used in the hydrological model predict the groundwater heads and direction 3 2 hydrological data meteorological data from 1960 to 2021 were obtained from the luxor meteorological station the average minimum and maximum temperature values in the selected time interval were 25 c and 34 c the number of rainy days per year was below four except for 1980 82 fig 6a the measured total annual precipitation was lower in the first years at the same time more important rainy events occurred from 1990 with the highest annual precipitation peak reaching 172 mm in year 2021 the trend for the maximum daily precipitation generally followed that of the total annual precipitation with the highest value recorded in 2021 the monthly distribution of the precipitation is bimodal with peaks in march and april fig 6b the lowest total precipitation during the selected period was recorded in august september the hydrological frequency analysis hyfran plus software version v2 1 was used to identify the rainfall data distribution the results indicated that the selected rainfall data followed a gamma distribution based on this a recurrence interval for 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 years with precipitation of 5 80 cm 20 90 cm 34 30 cm 53 20 cm 68 20 cm and 83 50 cm were estimated the intensity duration frequency idf curve for the current study area is presented in fig 6c which shows the relation between the storm duration of 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 and 120 min with the rainfall intensity in mm per hour the following equation was used to calculate the instantaneous rainfall intensity at any point during the storm duration chow et al 1988 1 i t 60 x p t t where it instantaneous rainfall intensity mm hr 1 pt is precipitation depth recorded mm and t is the time passed from the storm start min 3 3 watershed modeling description the study area was delineated using watershed modeling system wms software to develop watershed hydrologic and hydraulic modeling in particular the terrain module was used to delineate the watershed of the study area using the digital elevation model dem with 30 m resolution the drainage module used the topographic parameterization program topaz program to produce the drainage basins and streams where the watershed was delineated and subdivided into sub watersheds also the geological and topographic maps fig 2 with land use and soil type data were used to confirm the watershed streams the hydrologic modeling module defined relationships between precipitation and runoff based on watershed characteristics the runoff was determined by using the curve number method which computed the rainfall excess at the outlet of the catchments gülbaz et al 2019 while the water discharge and volume were estimated using the soil conservation service scs unit hydrograph approach el fakharany and mansour 2021 kazezyılmaz alhan et al 2020 the precipitation values for different recurrence intervals in the study area were used as input data for the wms model as presented in table 1 these precipitation values were developed in wms using the scs type ii where extreme storms last more than three hours on average which is suitable for deriving the 24 h time distribution during extreme events in many regions awadallah and younan 2012 wheater et al 2007 the loss values used the curve number method according to the soil type for the geological formation and land use of the study area the curve number cn of sub basins was calculated and ranged from 75 to 85 which is suitable for the current study area as input data for wms the wms uses the time of concentration and lag time to compute the hydrograph time to peak and peak flow the main flood factors for the delineated watershed area were calculated using the scs method liu et al

watershed to the outlet or design point fig 7a presents the study area s topography using dem data where the elevation ranges between 80 m and 332 m amsl moreover the three sub watershed areas are presented in fig 7b to reach 13 04 26 11 and 108 25 km2 for al sub basin haytah al kimab and umm buwayrat respectively the different basin s topography and slopes were affected by losses water storage volume and peak discharge of dams where the steep slope has a greater peak discharge than the flat slope 3 4 groundwater modeling modflow s 3d groundwater flow model based on finite differences was used to simulate groundwater flow at the same time the water budget was calculated using groundwater modeling system gms as a graphical user interface hyman et al 2022 singh and ghosh 2022 the partial

coordinate axes lt 1 h is the potentiometric head l ss is specific storage of the porous material l 1 t is time t and q is volumetric flux per unit volume representing source sink terms with q 0 for flow out of the groundwater system and q 0 for flow in t 1 3 4 1 aquifer geometry and boundary conditions the model domain extended to the aswan high dam in the south the city of aswan in the north the heights of the mountains in the east and the nile river in the west fig 8a the defined grid covered 7 465 km x 8 850 km and consisted of active and passive cells spread over 192 rows and 160 columns the model included seven layers of aquifers the quaternary aquifer mainly comprises asymmetric sand gravel and clay material groundwater depths range from 7 50 m to 16 30 m the direction of groundwater movement is generally from the south to the north because of the low groundwater level in the highland areas in the southern part its thickness varies between 82 m and 114 m with a general increase from south to the north the base rocks delimited the aquifer from the northeast where there was little or no lateral groundwater inflow thus a no flow condition was assigned fig 8 i a no flow boundary condition was also assigned to the base of the aquifer base rock ii a constant head was given to the aswan dam lake with a head of 105 50 m amsl iii the nile package assigned the northwest boundary with a head of 85 70 m amsl 3 4 2 hydraulic parameters the hydraulic parameters vary according to the soil type that makes up the aquifer layers in the aswan aquifer the hydraulic parameters of each layer of the aquifer system including the permeable layer composed mainly of sand and gravel showed non significant horizontal changes along the typical area scale the anisotropy was assumed to be intrinsically homogeneous with equal hydraulic conductivity k in the x and y directions and one order of magnitude less in the z direction the kx and ky values ranged between 1 m day 1 and 125 m day 1 based on the aquifer test and laboratory analysis estimates by selim et al 2014 the flow to the aquifer from the infiltration by unlined ponds of the fish hatchery in the el shallal area the leakage from drinking and wastewater network as recharge rate was assigned and ranged from 75 mm year 1 to 1600 mm year 1 with total recharge of 14 78 mcm using trial and error to fitting the recharge values and the field water levels in the observation wells while the total abstraction was applied to reach 9 25 mcm in 2021 hyman et al 2022 3 4 3 model calibration based on field data the model was initially calibrated using recorded data in year 2021 with 26 observational wells distributed within the aswan reservoir fig 8c the sensitivity analysis was developed by trial and error to match the groundwater level calculated by modflow to the observed groundwater level using a piezometric map and changing hydraulic parameters including hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient and porosity values listed in table 1 attempts were also made to change the values of boundary conditions such as water levels in confinement i e the water area sandwiched between the high dam and the aswan dam and changing the surface water level in the nile river and recharge values to reach the best calibration of the model the calibrated parameters are listed in table 1 and fig 8 using the 18 observational wells model the model was validated with an independent data set using many eight observation wells fig 8a compares the groundwater level calculated by modflow and the observed groundwater level from field data and the difference between the observed and calculated the calibrated model results showed that the residual ranges between 1 625 m to 0 032 m and the mean residual and absolute lateral mean were 0 097 m and 0 685 m respectively also the standard error of the estimation is 0 163 m with a root mean square rms of 0 82 m and a normalized rms of 4 806 also the validation results for eight observation wells are presented in fig 8b the distribution of groundwater heads in aswan is shown in fig 8d the figure also shows that the groundwater flows from the south aswan dam lake to the north the nile river where the flow directions are equivalent to the discharge into the nile river 4 results 4 1 soil investigation lithologically the investigated area is mainly covered by quaternary sediments composed of fluvial clays with sand deposits see fig 4b in contrast the soil sequence started with the upper surficial compact clay layer with calcareous materials with a thickness reaching a depth of 4 m this layer underlined by the sandy clay layer reaches 13 m resting on a thick sand layer i e 7 m thickness stretching to 20 m depth accordingly the two main types of soil samples were identified in the particle size distributions of soil samples the topsoil layer was classified as compact clays with calcareous sands with clay content varying from 20 to 50 the lower soil zone was classified as well graded sand with a fine content of 4 3 as listed however this sandy region may be considered a fast pathway for flash flood seepage from the barrier clay soils at the top forming open drains in sandy soil due to the high hydraulic connection additionally near surface high clay content in the topsoil layer could play an important role in infiltration velocity acting as an impermeable barrier in the low vertical infiltration the slope primarily controls the horizontal flow direction furthermore the surface gradient which represents wadis in this region as seen in fig 2 increases the rate of runoff percolation toward the northeast the slope forming the largest overflow in the direction of aswan city in low elevation lands and leading to increasing the waterlogging bodies in the slope direction 4 2 physical properties and hydraulic conductivity the results of laboratory measurements from soil samples at shallow depths reaching 3 m indicate high water content of 15 with high fines of 38 50 high total porosity reaching 58 49 with effective porosity of 31 and a high degree of saturation consequently the topsoil at shallow depths indicates low hydraulic conductivity reaching 0 02 m day 1 due to high fines content and moderate swelling of 60 el fakharany and mansour 2021 kramarenko et al 2016 the lower soil zone reaching 20 m depth can be classified as well graded sands with fines reaching 23 6 table 2 and the grain size slightly increases with depth in contrast the well graded sand is characterized by high water content reaching 20 total porosity from 33 85 to 58 49 and effective porosity reaching 29 thus this soil zone is classified as having high hydraulic conductivity reaching 0 0001 m day 1 to 0 0004 m s 1 due to lower fines varying from 21 3 to 23 6 the infiltration rate is closely linked to hydraulic conductivity in the z direction where the kz is one order of magnitude less el shinawi et al 2021 accordingly the near surface clay layer will be sandwiched from the upper by el seil runoff and sand layer this reflects environmental problems existing in many areas of low elevation lands where it creates waterlogging bodies and affects many buildings where these results are accompanied by previous studies and recommendations in the aswan area as is shown in el seil phatemic graves khorawada el aqad buildings blood bank military building el shallal and kima factory area el shinawi et al 2021 selim et al 2014 4 3 estimation of the watershed hydrograph the watershed results were presented in table 3 at different recurrence intervals of 2 5 10 25 50 100 and 200 years the precipitation depths reached 0 cm 20 90 cm 34 30 cm 53 20 cm 683 20 cm and 83 50 cm respectively the peak discharge reached 0 m3 s 1 0 39 m3 s 1 4 04 m3 s 1 14 24 m3 s 1 24 75 m3 s 1 and 36 66 m3 s 1 for al the haytah basin and al kimab basin reached 0 m3 s 1 0 88 m3 s 1 7 11 m3 s 1 23 50 m3 s 1 40 41 m3 s 1 and 59 67 m3 s 1 in contrast it reached 2 34 m3 s 1 16 81 m3 s 1 53 62 m3 s 1 91 43 m3 s 1 and 134 69 m3 s 1 for the umm buwayrat basin respectively as shown in fig 9 moreover the flood volume for al the haytah basin reached 0 m3 12259 m3 71655 m3 206132 m3 338306 m3 and 487827 m3 while it reached 0 m3 33863 m3 197965 m3 569503 m3 934664 m3 and 1347748 m3 the al kimab basin reached 0 m3 101218 m3 592441 m3 1704971 m3 2798594 m3 and 4035822 m3 for the umm buwayrat basin at different recurrence intervals by 2 5 10 25 50 100 and 200 years respectively as presented in table 3 the total rainwater harvesting reached 147340 m3 862061 m3 2480606 m3 4071564 m3 and 5871397 m3 table 4 the results showed that the time to peak reached 0 min 885 min 825 min 810 min 810 min and 810 min at recurrence intervals of 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 years for al the haytah basin also the al kimab basin reached 0 1020 945 915 915 and 915 min moreover it reached 0 min 1155 min 1050 min 1020 min 1005 min and 1005 min for the umm buwayrat basin moreover the annual peak discharge reached 0 m3 s 1 runoff volume was 0 m3 time to peak was 0 min at recurrence intervals by two years with annual precipitation of 5 80 mm indicating that all precipitation goes as losses in the study area increasing the recurrence intervals increased the flood peak flow and volume and decreased the peak time in the first 25 years additionally the flood volume of 0 m3 at recurrence intervals of 2 years with annual precipitation of 5 80 mm means all precipitation goes as losses 4 4 impact of recurrence interval on groundwater level difference the results showed that a recurrence interval of 5 10 25 50 and 100 years increased the groundwater level to 107 86 m 107 88 m 108 08 m 110 43 m and 113 03 m amsl fig 10 is presented the increment in groundwater level difference gwld the maximum increase in observation wells 19 20 22 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 and 35 which locates behind the sub basin watershed received the recharge the gwld reached 0 0 07 m 1 35 m 3 87 m 6 21 m and 8 82 m in the observation well 32 recurrence interval of 5 10 25 50 and 100 years this can cause water logging in aswan city 4 5 protection of city using storage dams three dams were developed at the basin to protect aswan city from flash floods see fig 10a the first is al haytah with an elevation from 89 m to 102 m amsl the second at al kimab basin with an elevation from 104 m to 126 m amsl and the third at umm buwayrat with an elevation ranging from 108 m to 126 m amsl fig 11b presents the storage dam volume at different elevations the collected amounts of water reached 487827 1347748 and 4035822 m3 at the three dams the construction of the protection dams will store the flooding in the reservoirs this storage volume can be used for two scenarios the first is using this storage in developing high levels of land for agriculture and industrial activities also the second is the drainage of this storage to the nile river through the construction of artificial canals these scenarios can mitigate the effect of flash floods on the rising groundwater in aswan city 5 discussion the current study aims to investigate the impact of flash flooding on the problem of groundwater logging in aswan city egypt which is causing an environmental problem for the infrastructures buildings and temples abd elaty et al 2022 showed that the sources of recharge in the aswan aquifer from the flash flood mountains are variable and depend on the intensity and duration of rainfall the study area was delineated using the watershed modeling system wms to develop a watershed s hydrologic and hydraulic modeling subdivided into sub watersheds to produce the drainage basins streams peak flow and volumes ikirri et al 2021 the study was developed with five scenarios for the recurrence intervals for 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 years the study showed that flash flooding significantly impacts watershed basin volume and peak flow the total rainwater harvesting in the study area reached 147340 m3 862061 m3 2480606 m3 4071564 m3 and 5871397 m3 this volume is estimated by flash flooding in which the coverage topsoil layer is classified as compact clays with calcareous sand and clay the lower soil zone is classified as well graded sand with little fines however this sandy region may be considered a fast pathway for flash flood seepage from the barrier clay soils at the top forming open drains in sandy soil due to the high hydraulic connection abu seif et al 2022 the great variation in elevations of aswan plain with a general slope from the south to the north controls the water pathway consequently this water pathway is controlled by great variation in elevations of aswan plain with a general slope from south to the north especially with the presence of irregularly shaped hills separated by drainage lines khor and highlands surrounding the plain on both sides hossen et al 2022 it increases the rate of runoff percolation toward the northeast the slope forms the largest overflow in aswan city s direction in low elevation lands it leads to increasing the waterlogging bodies in the slope direction also for the proposed recurrence interval of 5 10 25 50 and 100 years on the other hand the groundwater modeling using modflow software showed that an increase in the recurrence interval led to an increase in the groundwater levels in the study area in the problem of water logging in aswan city to 107 86 m 107 88 m 108 08 m 110 43 m and 113 03 m and presented the increment in gwld as shown in fig 10 the max gwld reached 0 m 0 07 m 1 35 m 3 87 m 6 21 m and 8 82 m for recurrence intervals of 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 years respectively these results agreed with abd elaty et al 2022 and chen 2022 in which increased aquifer recharge leads to increased waterlogging groundwater logging protection was developed using a storage dam to collect the flooding water which could be used in developing an arid region like egypt which agrees with hamedo et al 2021 additionally three dams were suggested at the basin to protect aswan city from flash floods the first is al haytah with an elevation from 89 m to 102 m amsl the second at al kimab basin with an elevation from 104 m to 126 m and the third at umm buwayrat with an elevation ranging from 108 m to 126 m amsl fig 11b presents the storage dam volume at different elevations different basins topography and slopes influence dams losses water storage volume and peak discharge the steep slope has a greater peak discharge than the flat slope hossen et al 2022 the collected amounts of water reached 487827 m3 1 347748 m3 and 4035822 m3 at the three dams moreover the water logging problem required management from the other recharge sources which depends on the fish hatchery in the el shallal area with about 4 66 million cubic meters per year mcm year 1 till now these ponds are unlined which leads to water infiltration towards aswan city the other source of recharge is the leakage from the sewage system or septic tanks up to 10 01 mcm year 1 in the year 2021 goher et al 2021 also the total recharge reached 14 78 mcm year 1 in 2021 additionally the seepage of surface water is used for irrigation in cultivated lands i e in the far west megahed et al 2021 the current study focuses on managing aswan city s water logging from flash flooding in contrast the other recharge sources in this current study can be mange using future studies and applying different protection methods moreover based on the topography and soil map of the aswan basin and from our point of our view the study suggests the suitable solution for flash floods in this study area is protection dams also in another case study with high water using natural recharge by the pond or artificial wells could be suitable to protect against flash flooding hazards the current study s limitations are the cost feasibility of constructing dams reservoirs and canals for lowering the groundwater levels in aswan city compared with the dewatering system without any protection structures 6 conclusions this study investigated the interactions between the soil surface water and groundwater in the aswan region to identify effective measures against groundwater logging a geotechnical investigation used eight boreholes to distinguish the soil sequence in the affected urban areas by a flash flood additionally a hydrology study was carried out using watershed modeling system wms to estimate the watershed parameters including peak flow and volume the modflow software study was developed on the aswan basin to investigate the groundwater levels under the recharge recurrence intervals by 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 years respectively the results showed that the flash flood accelerated the groundwater level gwl rise in the study area and affected the building and infrastructure water logging the groundwater level differences reached 0 m 0 07 m 1 35 m 3 87 m 6 21 m and 8 82 m respectively to protect aswan city from flash floods the construction of three storage dams was simulated the collected amounts of water reached 487827 m3 1347748 m3 and 4035822 m3 at the three dams and caused a groundwater level rise of 102 m 126 m and 126 m amsl respectively overall the solution presented in this study can effectively manage gwl rise in vulnerable areas minimizing environmental hazards for important archaeological and dense population sites the approach presented in this study could be used worldwide in comparable vulnerable watersheds and help local

7691,study region the aswan region is a vast plateau in the south of egypt located 150 m above mean sea level amsl within this region the tourist city of aswan is egypt s southernmost city located on the east bank of the nile river study focus the occurrence of flash floods can severely impact low lying and densely populated areas therefore highly vulnerable areas require effective mitigation measures to guarantee public safety and preserve archeological sites of great importance this study investigates the interaction between the soil surface water and groundwater in the aswan region of egypt based on the rainfall analysis and the watershed hydrology six different scenarios were run using the modflow and watershed modeling system wms software which simulated rainfall recurrence intervals of 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 years new hydrological insights for the region the model s results indicated that an increase in the recurrence interval produced a rise in the groundwater level gwl up to 8 82 m amsl therefore constructing three dams was proposed as a solution at the three basins of al haytah al kimab and umm buwayrat the proposed solution allows the storage of large volumes of water upstream it mitigates gwl s rise within and near aswan city the presented study can be applied to vulnerable watersheds in arid and semi arid regions it can help policymakers to integrate additional sustainable solutions into construction dams and their implementation in development plans graphical abstract ga1 keywords aswan flash floods groundwater modflow storage dam hydrograph data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction rising groundwater levels are a chronic problem for highly populated residential areas at low elevation sites selim et al 2014 many countries worldwide have experienced rising groundwater levels gwl in recent decades with remarkable economic and environmental impacts on regional and urban environments niu et al 2014 sahoo et al 2021 this problem is exacerbated in arid and semi arid regions such as aswan egypt due to persistent intra seasonal drought and infrequent intense rainfall causing extremely damaging flash floods ghazavi et al 2012 because of insufficient rainfall groundwater is the only available resource for interdisciplinary development around the nile valley elbeih 2015 groundwater is vital for many purposes including water supply systems irrigation livestock watering and industrial commercial mining and thermo electric power production el tahlawi et al 2008 groundwater is the only reliable drinking and irrigation water source in many localities in egypt this vital resource is vulnerable to contamination and is increasingly threatened by various pollutants from landfills soil treatment systems septic tanks and subsurface disposal wells the natural groundwater balance in aswan city egypt is overturned into an unbalance where the input to the water table is comparatively much more than the natural groundwater flow toward the nile river abd elaty et al 2022 chen 2022 raising the groundwater level from 2009 to now is flooding the urban areas and the infrastructure and reflects vital current environmental problems the dynamic response of the gwl depends on climatic conditions surface water groundwater interaction groundwater consumption and other human activities minville et al 2010 the rainfall distribution in arid and semi arid areas is typically bimodal and skewed with peaks in winter and spring ngigi et al 2008 more intense rainfall may cause extensive overland flow ghazavi et al 2012 the interaction between surface waters and groundwater is complex it must account for land use climate change water quality and agricultural water use tian et al 2015 al sefry and şen 2006 investigated the risk of groundwater rising in major cities of arid lands in jeddah kingdom of saudi arabia ksa the results showed that the water returned to surface cesspools the leakages from the insufficient sewage system and the water supply system leakages caused a raise of the gwl fakharinia et al 2012 simulated the gwl using modflow software due to the construction of the subsurface dam in the shahrekord aquifer iran the authors found that the subsurface dam raised the water table by 0 50 m at a 4 km distance upstream of the dam bob et al 2016 studied the problem of the shallow groundwater table rise in madinah city saudi arabia using drilling wells accordingly the authors recommended a dewatering system to lower the shallow groundwater table rise consequently avoiding increased water levels in the water logging of aswan city and flash flooding influences have been serious challenges in sites such as archaeological and urban areas chen 2022 in 2021 aswan city was subjected to flash floods which damaged the infrastructures buildings and temples fig 1 the waterlogging is due to the continuously rising groundwater levels in the aswan plain and wetlands observed in several parts of aswan city groundwater levels were studied by el shinawi et al 2022 the study investigated the interactions between groundwater and surface water for demand purposes abd elaty et al 2022 studied the vulnerability of the groundwater due to the stoppage of pumping from the quaternary aquifer at the el shalal kema area aswan the results showed that the turnoff of pumping caused an increase in the groundwater levels in the city selim et al 2014 examined the rising gwl in aswan city its causes and solutions the results showed that due to leakages or infiltrations from different sources the natural groundwater balance is overturned into an unbalance where the input to the water table is comparatively much more than the natural groundwater flow towards the nile river hossen et al 2022 developed an artificial neural network ann model for monitoring the changes in gwl due to the construction of the naga hammadi barrage megahed et al 2021 used chemical analysis and remote sensing data to assess the environmental impacts of rising groundwater near aswan the results showed that since 2009 15 productive drinking water wells were closed causing a rise in gwl and salinity the study detected and calculated the area influenced by groundwater seepage urbanization and agricultural reclamation abu seif et al 2022 the groundwater usage in aswan city is limited as the nile river water is used and the limited amount that groundwater is used for public water supply selim et al 2014 unsuccessful groundwater management and urban planning have led to a continuous rise in gwl in the last half century causing increased waterlogging in the aswan plain abd elaty et al 2022 thus effective solutions are needed to facilitate sustainable development and minimize environmental hazards for archaeological and densely populated sites the study investigates the management of gwl rises through the construction of dams to reduce the impact of flash floods in many areas of the aswan plain to significantly enhance the protection management soil physical properties were determined for geo environmental assessment el shinawi and naymushina 2015 the soil characterization watershed and groundwater modeling and storage dams have proven effective in environmental and hydrogeological studies el shinawi et al 2021 othman et al 2022 this study hypothesizes that the dam construction will mitigate gwl rise in the aswan region different scenarios of dam construction are investigated to understand if such measures can considerably mitigate gwl rise and protect the lowland part from flash floods 2 study site the aswan region is bounded by the mountain in the northeast the nile river in the north west and the high aswan dam in the south the study area can be divided into three main units fig 2 including i the lowland aswan plain is almost flat with a slope from the south to the north including the western and the eastern plain the plain surface is underlain by sand gravel and slit of the quaternary ii highlands by the mountainous and underlain by basement rocks and or by nubian sandstones extend in the eastern side with elevations varying from 164 m to 188 m amsl and dissected with several wadis from east to west including wadi al hayatah wadi al hayatah wadi al kimba and wadi umm buwayrat the highland occupies in the central parts with elevations vary from 142 m to 167 m amsl also the other are small highlands are located to the west and close to the nile river as gebel tagug 150 m and el karor 135 m amsl and iii the nile river in the western of aswan city aswan dam has a water reservoir in the south of aswan city with water levels ranging between 106 m and 118 m amsl elhossainy et al 2021 the climate of aswan city is characterized by a very high summer and a mild winter climate on average the area receives occasional thunderstorms that may penetrate the area once every 10 15 years mahmoud et al 2021 in urban regions quantifying groundwater recharge is especially challenging because the urban environment is quite complex a large variety of land uses and land covers coexist and overlap due to the heterogeneity of the shallow underground selim et al 2014 2 1 topography and geomorphology the vast plateau of the aswan region has an average height of 150 m amsl near the nile valley and it rises towards the east to 200 m amsl the level of the nile valley in the aswan region is about 100 m amsl and the study area consists of irregularly shaped hills separated by some drainage lines khor the topography of the urban region plays a key role in the groundwater levels rise problem in a large plateau at 150 m amsl in which the levels of low elevated lands are high influence by the rising of the water table compared with the high elevated lands the mainstream starts from the valley and ascends the slope to the plateau s surface through a section from north to south goharian et al 2022 thus geomorphologically the aswan region can be divided into three main areas low uplands aswan plain 150 m high elevated lands 200 m and the bed of the nile river 100 m fig 2 fig 3 presents the changing in surface water levels in kima pond from years 2009 2021 due to changing the hydrological conditions in the city for the abstraction and recharge rates 2 2 geology of the study area geologically the study area is mainly covered by sediments belonging to pre cambrian to cretaceous and quaternary fig 4a the precambrian rocks are metamorphic and igneous rocks with thickness ranges between 35 m and 40 m and represent the oldest and mainly exposed rocks they have many fractures and can play an important role in the accretion of water in many parts of the study area abu seif et al 2022 leila et al 2021 the cretaceous represented by nubian sandstone is exposed in the central and eastern parts of the study area it overlies the pre cambrian rocks unconformably these sediments comprise conglomerates pebbles kaolinitic clays and sandstones in variable thickness ranges between 20 m and 85 m the nubian sandstone series is divided into the upper cretaceous age s lower middle and upper the quaternary sediments cover a large extent on the eastern side of the aswan area these pleistocene sediments are composed of sand and gravel a thick bed of pliocene clays underlines them floodplain deposits at shallow depths on the eastern side of aswan city are composed of clayey sand and clays with alluvial and aeolian deposits in some places see fig 4a 2 3 hydrogeological setting the quaternary aquifer mainly consists of unconsolidated sands gravels and clay intercalation material the impermeable layers do not cover it in a major part of the area therefore it is under unconfined conditions the transmissivity t values of the quaternary aquifer range between 1996 m2 day 1 and 3029 m2 day 1 which classifies the aquifer as a high potential class hamdan and rady 2013 the thickness of the quaternary aquifer varies from 100 m in the southern part to 137 m in the central part underlined by the pliocene clay the basement rocks represent the eastern border of the quaternary water bearing sediments caped with nubian sandstone at the same time the highland of the el sheik haroon plateau bounds westward the width of the aquifer is small and ranges between 2 05 km northward and 1 37 km southward the natural recharge to the quaternary aquifer is from the surface water system by the aswan dam lake which has a water level ranging between 108 m and 118 m amsl towards the city s urban areas the first source of artificial recharge is the infiltration from unlined ponds of the fish hatchery in the el shallal area with about 4 66 million cubic meters per year mcm year 1 fig 3a the second source of recharge is the leakage from the sewage system or septic tanks reaching annually 4 27 mcm 4 15 mcm 9 72 mcm 9 93 mcm and 10 01 mcm in years 2017 2018 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively also the total annual recharge reached 9 04 mcm 8 92 mcm 14 49 mcm 14 70 mcm and 14 78 mcm from 2017 to 2021 respectively this increase in leakage quantities led to increased groundwater logging in aswan city the third source is the seepage from the aswan dam reservoir where the water level ranges between 106 m and 112 m amsl depending on the water income from the high dam and the water demands downstream of the reservoir the fourth source is the seepage of surface water for irrigation in the cultivated lands i e in the far west because of the old irrigation method the fifth source is the flash flood from mountains in the west which is variable and depends on the rainfall rates intensity and duration fig 5a the aquifer is discharged through the natural groundwater outflow to the nile river in the northern part of the city and groundwater is abstracted by pumping at kima and el shallal areas the source of abstraction in the study area is contributed to continuous withdrawal due to industrial and domestic use especially in the kima and el shalal areas reaching 13 28 mcm year 1 and 12 44 mcm year 1 respectively fig 5b with a total abstraction of 25 72 mcm after 2009 the el shallal pumping wells stopped completely and the production of kima pumping wells decreased to 9 12 mcm year 1 the last period saw part of the el shallal wells beginning to operate with a production capacity of 0 13 mcm year 1 and the continuation of kima wells with a production capacity of 9 12 mcm in 2020 and 2021 the total abstraction reached 9 12 mcm 9 12 mcm 9 12 mcm 9 25 mcm and 9 25 mcm from 2017 to 2021 respectively fig 5b fig 5c presents the fluctuation in groundwater levels in aswan city in the central part of the study area from 1971 to 2021 the water level was raised from 1971 to 2009 with low changes a rapid rise was done from year 2009 to 2010 fig 3a 3b due to the shutoff of the pumping wells at the el shall region and the reduction of the abstraction rates in kima pond from the year 2010 2017 the groundwater level was raised to the maximum levels and then returned to fall from the year 2015 2019 fig 3c due to the digging of pumping wells by government agencies to abstract the floods groundwater from the basements from the year 2015 2021 fig 3d the groundwater was returned to raised due to the abstracted wells were stopped in a reason to the sewage networks capacity compare with the abstracted groundwater abd elaty et al 2022 from the above section the groundwater levels in the study area are high influence by the surface water system including the seepage from the aswan high dam lake the infiltration from unlined ponds of the fish hatchery in the el shallal area the leakage from drinking and wastewater network also the groundwater abstraction from kima and el shalal areas this link between the hydrological parameters for flow to the aquifer and the abstraction using production pumping wells led to groundwater and surface water dynamics over the years also the current study must investigate the dynamic effect of flash flooding on the groundwater levels to manage the water logging problem 3 materials and methods 3 1 soil sampling representative soil samples were collected from 8 boreholes distributed across the aswan urban areas i e floodplain deposits fig 2 undisturbed samples were collected from the different boreholes at 1 m to represent lithological changes sufficiently an overall depth varying between 10 m and 20 m was reached subsequent laboratory analyses included the determination of particle size distribution astmd 2487 2018 bulk density dry density specific gravity water content wc effective porosity e and total porosity n and degree of saturation sr astmd854 14 2016 the data used in the hydrological model predict the groundwater heads and direction 3 2 hydrological data meteorological data from 1960 to 2021 were obtained from the luxor meteorological station the average minimum and maximum temperature values in the selected time interval were 25 c and 34 c the number of rainy days per year was below four except for 1980 82 fig 6a the measured total annual precipitation was lower in the first years at the same time more important rainy events occurred from 1990 with the highest annual precipitation peak reaching 172 mm in year 2021 the trend for the maximum daily precipitation generally followed that of the total annual precipitation with the highest value recorded in 2021 the monthly distribution of the precipitation is bimodal with peaks in march and april fig 6b the lowest total precipitation during the selected period was recorded in august september the hydrological frequency analysis hyfran plus software version v2 1 was used to identify the rainfall data distribution the results indicated that the selected rainfall data followed a gamma distribution based on this a recurrence interval for 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 years with precipitation of 5 80 cm 20 90 cm 34 30 cm 53 20 cm 68 20 cm and 83 50 cm were estimated the intensity duration frequency idf curve for the current study area is presented in fig 6c which shows the relation between the storm duration of 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 and 120 min with the rainfall intensity in mm per hour the following equation was used to calculate the instantaneous rainfall intensity at any point during the storm duration chow et al 1988 1 i t 60 x p t t where it instantaneous rainfall intensity mm hr 1 pt is precipitation depth recorded mm and t is the time passed from the storm start min 3 3 watershed modeling description the study area was delineated using watershed modeling system wms software to develop watershed hydrologic and hydraulic modeling in particular the terrain module was used to delineate the watershed of the study area using the digital elevation model dem with 30 m resolution the drainage module used the topographic parameterization program topaz program to produce the drainage basins and streams where the watershed was delineated and subdivided into sub watersheds also the geological and topographic maps fig 2 with land use and soil type data were used to confirm the watershed streams the hydrologic modeling module defined relationships between precipitation and runoff based on watershed characteristics the runoff was determined by using the curve number method which computed the rainfall excess at the outlet of the catchments gülbaz et al 2019 while the water discharge and volume were estimated using the soil conservation service scs unit hydrograph approach el fakharany and mansour 2021 kazezyılmaz alhan et al 2020 the precipitation values for different recurrence intervals in the study area were used as input data for the wms model as presented in table 1 these precipitation values were developed in wms using the scs type ii where extreme storms last more than three hours on average which is suitable for deriving the 24 h time distribution during extreme events in many regions awadallah and younan 2012 wheater et al 2007 the loss values used the curve number method according to the soil type for the geological formation and land use of the study area the curve number cn of sub basins was calculated and ranged from 75 to 85 which is suitable for the current study area as input data for wms the wms uses the time of concentration and lag time to compute the hydrograph time to peak and peak flow the main flood factors for the delineated watershed area were calculated using the scs method liu et al

watershed to the outlet or design point fig 7a presents the study area s topography using dem data where the elevation ranges between 80 m and 332 m amsl moreover the three sub watershed areas are presented in fig 7b to reach 13 04 26 11 and 108 25 km2 for al sub basin haytah al kimab and umm buwayrat respectively the different basin s topography and slopes were affected by losses water storage volume and peak discharge of dams where the steep slope has a greater peak discharge than the flat slope 3 4 groundwater modeling modflow s 3d groundwater flow model based on finite differences was used to simulate groundwater flow at the same time the water budget was calculated using groundwater modeling system gms as a graphical user interface hyman et al 2022 singh and ghosh 2022 the partial differential equation of groundwater flow used in modflow mcdonard 1988 10 x k x h x y k y h y z k z h z q s s h t where kx ky and kz are values of hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z coordinate axes lt 1 h is the potentiometric head l ss is specific storage of the porous material l 1 t is time t and q is volumetric flux per unit volume representing source sink terms with q 0 for flow out of the groundwater system and q 0 for flow in t 1 3 4 1 aquifer geometry and boundary conditions the model domain extended to the aswan high dam in the south the city of aswan in the north the heights of the mountains in the east and the nile river in the west fig 8a the defined grid covered 7 465 km x 8 850 km and consisted of active and passive cells spread over 192 rows and 160 columns the model included seven layers of aquifers the quaternary aquifer mainly comprises asymmetric sand gravel and clay material groundwater depths range from 7 50 m to 16 30 m the direction of groundwater movement is generally from the south to the north because of the low groundwater level in the highland areas in the southern part its thickness varies between 82 m and 114 m with a general increase from south to the north the base rocks delimited the aquifer from the northeast where there was little or no lateral groundwater inflow thus a no flow condition was assigned fig 8 i a no flow boundary condition was also assigned to the base of the aquifer base rock ii a constant head was given to the aswan dam lake with a head of 105 50 m amsl iii the nile package assigned the northwest boundary with a head of 85 70 m amsl 3 4 2 hydraulic parameters the hydraulic parameters vary according to the soil type that makes up the aquifer layers in the aswan aquifer the hydraulic parameters of each layer of the aquifer system including the permeable layer composed mainly of sand and gravel showed non significant horizontal changes along the typical area scale the anisotropy was assumed to be intrinsically homogeneous with equal hydraulic conductivity k in the x and y directions and one order of magnitude less in the z direction the kx and ky values ranged between 1 m day 1 and 125 m day 1 based on the aquifer test and laboratory analysis estimates by selim et al 2014 the flow to the aquifer from the infiltration by unlined ponds of the fish hatchery in the el shallal area the leakage from drinking and wastewater network as recharge rate was assigned and ranged from 75 mm year 1 to 1600 mm year 1 with total recharge of 14 78 mcm using trial and error to fitting the recharge values and the field water levels in the observation wells while the total abstraction was applied to reach 9 25 mcm in 2021 hyman et al 2022 3 4 3 model calibration based on field data the model was initially calibrated using recorded data in year 2021 with 26 observational wells distributed within the aswan reservoir fig 8c the sensitivity analysis was developed by trial and error to match the groundwater level calculated by modflow to the observed groundwater level using a piezometric map and changing hydraulic parameters including hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient and porosity values listed in table 1 attempts were also made to change the values of boundary conditions such as water levels in confinement i e the water area sandwiched between the high dam and the aswan dam and changing the surface water level in the nile river and recharge values to reach the best calibration of the model the calibrated parameters are listed in table 1 and fig 8 using the 18 observational wells model the model was validated with an independent data set using many eight observation wells fig 8a compares the groundwater level calculated by modflow and the observed groundwater level from field data and the difference between the observed and calculated the calibrated model results showed that the residual ranges between 1 625 m to 0 032 m and the mean residual and absolute lateral mean were 0 097 m and 0 685 m respectively also the standard error of the estimation is 0 163 m with a root mean square rms of 0 82 m and a normalized rms of 4 806 also the validation results for eight observation wells are presented in fig 8b the distribution of groundwater heads in aswan is shown in fig 8d the figure also shows that the groundwater flows from the south aswan dam lake to the north the nile river where the flow directions are equivalent to the discharge into the nile river 4 results 4 1 soil investigation lithologically the investigated area is mainly covered by quaternary sediments composed of fluvial clays with sand deposits see fig 4b in contrast the soil sequence started with the upper surficial compact clay layer with calcareous materials with a thickness reaching a depth of 4 m this layer underlined by the sandy clay layer reaches 13 m resting on a thick sand layer i e 7 m thickness stretching to 20 m depth accordingly the two main types of soil samples were identified in the particle size distributions of soil samples the topsoil layer was classified as compact clays with calcareous sands with clay content varying from 20 to 50 the lower soil zone was classified as well graded sand with a fine content of 4 3 as listed however this sandy region may be considered a fast pathway for flash flood seepage from the barrier clay soils at the top forming open drains in sandy soil due to the high hydraulic connection additionally near surface high clay content in the topsoil layer could play an important role in infiltration velocity acting as an impermeable barrier in the low vertical infiltration the slope primarily controls the horizontal flow direction furthermore the surface gradient which represents wadis in this region as seen in fig 2 increases the rate of runoff percolation toward the northeast the slope forming the largest overflow in the direction of aswan city in low elevation lands and leading to increasing the waterlogging bodies in the slope direction 4 2 physical properties and hydraulic conductivity the results of laboratory measurements from soil samples at shallow depths reaching 3 m indicate high water content of 15 with high fines of 38 50 high total porosity reaching 58 49 with effective porosity of 31 and a high degree of saturation consequently the topsoil at shallow depths indicates low hydraulic conductivity reaching 0 02 m day 1 due to high fines content and moderate swelling of 60 el fakharany and mansour 2021 kramarenko et al 2016 the lower soil zone reaching 20 m depth can be classified as well graded sands with fines reaching 23 6 table 2 and the grain size slightly increases with depth in contrast the well graded sand is characterized by high water content reaching 20 total porosity from 33 85 to 58 49 and effective porosity reaching 29 thus this soil zone is classified as having high hydraulic conductivity reaching 0 0001 m day 1 to 0 0004 m s 1 due to lower fines varying from 21 3 to 23 6 the infiltration rate is closely linked to hydraulic conductivity in the z direction where the kz is one order of magnitude less el shinawi et al 2021 accordingly the near surface clay layer will be sandwiched from the upper by el seil runoff and sand layer this reflects environmental problems existing in many areas of low elevation lands where it creates waterlogging bodies and affects many buildings where these results are accompanied by previous studies and recommendations in the aswan area as is shown in el seil phatemic graves khorawada el aqad buildings blood bank military building el shallal and kima factory area el shinawi et al 2021 selim et al 2014 4 3 estimation of the watershed hydrograph the watershed results were presented in table 3 at different recurrence intervals of 2 5 10 25 50 100 and 200 years the precipitation depths reached 0 cm 20 90 cm 34 30 cm 53 20 cm 683 20 cm and 83 50 cm respectively the peak discharge reached 0 m3 s 1 0 39 m3 s 1 4 04 m3 s 1 14 24 m3 s 1 24 75 m3 s 1 and 36 66 m3 s 1 for al the haytah basin and al kimab basin reached 0 m3 s 1 0 88 m3 s 1 7 11 m3 s 1 23 50 m3 s 1 40 41 m3 s 1 and 59 67 m3 s 1 in contrast it reached 2 34 m3 s 1 16 81 m3 s 1 53 62 m3 s 1 91 43 m3 s 1 and 134 69 m3 s 1 for the umm buwayrat basin respectively as shown in fig 9 moreover the flood volume for al the haytah basin reached 0 m3 12259 m3 71655 m3 206132 m3 338306 m3 and 487827 m3 while it reached 0 m3 33863 m3 197965 m3 569503 m3 934664 m3 and 1347748 m3 the al kimab basin reached 0 m3 101218 m3 592441 m3 1704971 m3 2798594 m3 and 4035822 m3 for the umm buwayrat basin at different recurrence intervals by 2 5 10 25 50 100 and 200 years respectively as presented in table 3 the total rainwater harvesting reached 147340 m3 862061 m3 2480606 m3 4071564 m3 and 5871397 m3 table 4 the results showed that the time to peak reached 0 min 885 min 825 min 810 min 810 min and 810 min at recurrence intervals of 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 years for al the haytah basin also the al kimab basin reached 0 1020 945 915 915 and 915 min moreover it reached 0 min 1155 min 1050 min 1020 min 1005 min and 1005 min for the umm buwayrat basin moreover the annual peak discharge reached 0 m3 s 1 runoff volume was 0 m3 time to peak was 0 min at recurrence intervals by two years with annual precipitation of 5 80 mm indicating that all precipitation goes as losses in the study area increasing the recurrence intervals increased the flood peak flow and volume and decreased the peak time in the first 25 years additionally the flood volume of 0 m3 at recurrence intervals of 2 years with annual precipitation of 5 80 mm means all precipitation goes as losses 4 4 impact of recurrence interval on groundwater level difference the results showed that a recurrence interval of 5 10 25 50 and 100 years increased the groundwater level to 107 86 m 107 88 m 108 08 m 110 43 m and 113 03 m amsl fig 10 is presented the increment in groundwater level difference gwld the maximum increase in observation wells 19 20 22 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 and 35 which locates behind the sub basin watershed received the recharge the gwld reached 0 0 07 m 1 35 m 3 87 m 6 21 m and 8 82 m in the observation well 32 recurrence interval of 5 10 25 50 and 100 years this can cause water logging in aswan city 4 5 protection of city using storage dams three dams were developed at the basin to protect aswan city from flash floods see fig 10a the first is al haytah with an elevation from 89 m to 102 m amsl the second at al kimab basin with an elevation from 104 m to 126 m amsl and the third at umm buwayrat with an elevation ranging from 108 m to 126 m amsl fig 11b presents the storage dam volume at different elevations the collected amounts of water reached 487827 1347748 and 4035822 m3 at the three dams the construction of the protection dams will store the flooding in the reservoirs this storage volume can be used for two scenarios the first is using this storage in developing high levels of land for agriculture and industrial activities also the second is the drainage of this storage to the nile river through the construction of artificial canals these scenarios can mitigate the effect of flash floods on the rising groundwater in aswan city 5 discussion the current study aims to investigate the impact of flash flooding on the problem of groundwater logging in aswan city egypt which is causing an environmental problem for the infrastructures buildings and temples abd elaty et al 2022 showed that the sources of recharge in the aswan aquifer from the flash flood mountains are variable and depend on the intensity and duration of rainfall the study area was delineated using the watershed modeling system wms to develop a watershed s hydrologic and hydraulic modeling subdivided into sub watersheds to produce the drainage basins streams peak flow and volumes ikirri et al 2021 the study was developed with five scenarios for the recurrence intervals for 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 years the study showed that flash flooding significantly impacts watershed basin volume and peak flow the total rainwater harvesting in the study area reached 147340 m3 862061 m3 2480606 m3 4071564 m3 and 5871397 m3 this volume is estimated by flash flooding in which the coverage topsoil layer is classified as compact clays with calcareous sand and clay the lower soil zone is classified as well graded sand with little fines however this sandy region may be considered a fast pathway for flash flood seepage from the barrier clay soils at the top forming open drains in sandy soil due to the high hydraulic connection abu seif et al 2022 the great variation in elevations of aswan plain with a general slope from the south to the north controls the water pathway consequently this water pathway is controlled by great variation in elevations of aswan plain with a general slope from south to the north especially with the presence of irregularly shaped hills separated by drainage lines khor and highlands surrounding the plain on both sides hossen et al 2022 it increases the rate of runoff percolation toward the northeast the slope forms the largest overflow in aswan city s direction in low elevation lands it leads to increasing the waterlogging bodies in the slope direction also for the proposed recurrence interval of 5 10 25 50 and 100 years on the other hand the groundwater modeling using modflow software showed that an increase in the recurrence interval led to an increase in the groundwater levels in the study area in the problem of water logging in aswan city to 107 86 m 107 88 m 108 08 m 110 43 m and 113 03 m and presented the increment in gwld as shown in fig 10 the max gwld reached 0 m 0 07 m 1 35 m 3 87 m 6 21 m and 8 82 m for recurrence intervals of 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 years respectively these results agreed with abd elaty et al 2022 and chen 2022 in which increased aquifer recharge leads to increased waterlogging groundwater logging protection was developed using a storage dam to collect the flooding water which could be used in developing an arid region like egypt which agrees with hamedo et al 2021 additionally three dams were suggested at the basin to protect aswan city from flash floods the first is al haytah with an elevation from 89 m to 102 m amsl the second at al kimab basin with an elevation from 104 m to 126 m and the third at umm buwayrat with an elevation ranging from 108 m to 126 m amsl fig 11b presents the storage dam volume at different elevations different basins topography and slopes influence dams losses water storage volume and peak discharge the steep slope has a greater peak discharge than the flat slope hossen et al 2022 the collected amounts of water reached 487827 m3 1 347748 m3 and 4035822 m3 at the three dams moreover the water logging problem required management from the other recharge sources which depends on the fish hatchery in the el shallal area with about 4 66 million cubic meters per year mcm year 1 till now these ponds are unlined which leads to water infiltration towards aswan city the other source of recharge is the leakage from the sewage system or septic tanks up to 10 01 mcm year 1 in the year 2021 goher et al 2021 also the total recharge reached 14 78 mcm year 1 in 2021 additionally the seepage of surface water is used for irrigation in cultivated lands i e in the far west megahed et al 2021 the current study focuses on managing aswan city s water logging from flash flooding in contrast the other recharge sources in this current study can be mange using future studies and applying different protection methods moreover based on the topography and soil map of the aswan basin and from our point of our view the study suggests the suitable solution for flash floods in this study area is protection dams also in another case study with high water using natural recharge by the pond or artificial wells could be suitable to protect against flash flooding hazards the current study s limitations are the cost feasibility of constructing dams reservoirs and canals for lowering the groundwater levels in aswan city compared with the dewatering system without any protection structures 6 conclusions this study investigated the interactions between the soil surface water and groundwater in the aswan region to identify effective measures against groundwater logging a geotechnical investigation used eight boreholes to distinguish the soil sequence in the affected urban areas by a flash flood additionally a hydrology study was carried out using watershed modeling system wms to estimate the watershed parameters including peak flow and volume the modflow software study was developed on the aswan basin to investigate the groundwater levels under the recharge recurrence intervals by 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 years respectively the results showed that the flash flood accelerated the groundwater level gwl rise in the study area and affected the building and infrastructure water logging the groundwater level differences reached 0 m 0 07 m 1 35 m 3 87 m 6 21 m and 8 82 m respectively to protect aswan city from flash floods the construction of three storage dams was simulated the collected amounts of water reached 487827 m3 1347748 m3 and 4035822 m3 at the three dams and caused a groundwater level rise of 102 m 126 m and 126 m amsl respectively overall the solution presented in this study can effectively manage gwl rise in vulnerable areas minimizing environmental hazards for important archaeological and dense population sites the approach presented in this study could be used worldwide in comparable vulnerable watersheds and help local authorities to meet environmental economic and social needs credit authorship contribution statement ismail abd elaty conceptualization methodology investigation formal analysis data curation

7692,study region the western amazon basin at tamshiyacu gauging station near the iquitos city hosts floodplain agriculture that can be affected by the sudden reversal in direction of water levels known as repiquetes that produce intermittent flooding study focus this study assesses repiquete flooding risk in riparian crop areas based on statistical analyses of repiquete events registered from 1996 to 2018 hydraulic modeling to estimate flooded extension and assessment of climatological characteristics during the formation of repiquetes new hydrological insights floods 20 cm produced by repiquetes in riparian crop areas between 83 00 and 88 00 m above sea level masl occur 1 8 times per year however not all elevation ranges have the same flooding risk to crops terrain elevations between 85 31 and 87 00 masl have a reduced flooding risk of 0 35 per year likewise areas with elevations between 87 00 and 88 00 masl 43 of the total area were not affected by repiquetes extreme repiquetes study cases of 2002 and 2008 have been influenced by the increase of atmospheric moisture flux convergence and precipitation over both the northern ucayali and marañón basins through the six previous days flood impacts from the extreme event of 2002 2008 could have reached 40 25 of the available area for agriculture at the initiation of the repiquete graphical abstract ga1 keywords repiquetes riparian agriculture rainfall flooding risk western amazon data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the amazon basin hosts biodiversity of aquatic and terrestrial plants and animals these species have dynamic interactions due to the hydrological regime of their rivers including variations in the flows and water levels between low water and high water periods sioli 1984 the hydrological regimes of the amazon rivers provide opportunities for agricultural activities in the amazon basin communities have been established in high terrain elevations to prevent flooding and near the floodplains that have a great potential for agriculture coomes et al 2016 denevan 1996 gorenstein 2023 hiraoka 1985 jakovac et al 2017 jardim et al 2020 winklerprins 2022 due to these areas are enriched by nutrients from the andes transported by rivers ronchail et al 2018 2016 the intensification of agriculture in the amazon floodplain has increased due to population growth around cities and market demand for crops such as cassava and beans in brazil and rice in peru chibnik 1994 coomes et al 2016 jakovac et al 2017 nevertheless agriculture along the floodplain is exposed to natural hazards principally by river stage reversal or sudden floodings repiquetes as well as edaphic conditions that affect the economy of the riparian farmer families list and coomes 2017 repiquetes are events that can interfere with the cultivation of crops i e they can remove and carry seeds downriver shorten their vegetative period flood agricultural areas and destroy harvests this study focused on analyzing flooding risks produced by repiquetes on floodplains used for agriculture in the amazon basin in the western amazon basin agriculture is primarily developed on the floodplains and islands formed by the meandering river during the transition from the wet to the dry season this occurs between june and october espinoza et al 2011 lavado casimiro et al 2013 during that season the water elevation drops by up to 7 m at the tamshiyacu gauging station in the amazon river exposing the terrain available to recessional agriculture ronchail et al 2018 2016 in the lowland of the western amazon basin specifically in the loreto department 49 of the western amazon basin up to peruvian tamshiyacu station fig 1a rice is sown on average in 34 600 ha 2000 2010 70 of which are floodplains dia 2011 inia 2005 in the ucayali province this value is 6000 ha labarta et al 2007 repiquetes are unpredictable and sudden reversals in the direction of river levels both when the river level rises and falls coomes et al 2016 however for floodplains or recessional agriculture repiquetes in the transition from wet to dry season are important and occur due to abundant rainfall episodes in the northern part of the western amazon basin marañón basin these episodes are associated with changes in the direction of the low level meridional winds over the andes amazon transition zone figueroa et al 2020 repiquete flooding can seriously affect crop productivity thus compromising the economy and food security of many riverine communities a repiquete event on 28 june 2012 06 july 2002 could have flooded 59 88 and 14 52 of the lateral silt bar used for recessional agriculture in the communities of dos de mayo and augusto freyre near the city of iquitos respectively list and coomes 2017 recent work list and coomes 2019 found that the mean potential production of rice in regions of the peruvian amazon along the muyuy anabranching structure around the city of iquitos decreased by 50 in 2012 due to both crop inundation and reduction of the growing time influenced by repiquetes the occurrence of repiquetes has been estimated at 3 2 times per year coomes et al 2016 figueroa et al 2020 ronchail et al 2018 however not all repiquetes will flood agricultural areas depending on the repiquete magnitude risk magnitude of flooding date of occurrence and terrain elevation previous studies have analyzed this phenomenon by considering hydrological or climatological approaches separately however the nature of the phenomenon suggests that both approaches should be used together taking into account the climatological characteristics that allow the formation of these events as well as the impacts on agricultural areas and the analysis of extreme events in order to investigate the repiquete phenomenon two study questions were defined as follows are repiquetes which have the potential to cause flooding to agricultural areas produced by precipitation over the north of the western studied amazon basin or is there another part of the basin influencing their occurrence and is it feasible to determine a secure zone for cultivation and assess flooding risk based on analyses of repiquetes answering these questions can support farmers in their decision making process toward reducing or mitigating riparian crop loss in the western amazon river basin thus this paper reports a broad assessment of repiquetes that include i identifying repiquetes with risk magnitude of flooding and extreme events ii assessing the flooding risk by repiquetes based on terrain elevation of croplands and estimating the flooded areas as a function of the risk magnitude of repiquete iii characterizing the climatological behavior of repiquete formation that could be used to identify future events and iv assessing the probable flooding impact produced by extreme repiquete events a combined approach was used to answer the study questions and objectives the approach includes statistical analyses of repiquetes remote sensing detailed topography survey hydraulic modeling and climatological assessment the results could help develop risk maps to guarantee floodplain agriculture which could be handed to regional authorities 2 data and methods 2 1 study area and atmospheric and hydrology features the amazon river is the largest fluvial system in the world in terms of the volume of water exported to the ocean 209 000 m3 s its drainage area of 6 2 106 km2 callède et al 2010 and its suspended sediment export 1200 mt yr armijos et al 2020 it is the backbone of the natural amazon ecosystem with high biodiversity in flora and fauna foley et al 2007 the principal sources of food and economic revenue for human settlements established along the river margins are agriculture rice manioc peanuts and fishing gorenstein 2023 jakovac et al 2017 labarta et al 2007 list and coomes 2017 the amazon basin drains into the tamshiyacu gauging station at the mainstream amazon river which is downstream of the confluence of the marañón and ucayali rivers figs 1a 1b it covers an area of approximately 750 000 km2 in the peruvian and ecuadorian amazon armijos et al 2013 in the western amazon basin region around tamshiyacu city the flooding risk zone has an extension of 4 km along the left bank of the amazon river fig 1c the spatiotemporal rainfall variability in the western amazon basin is associated with the meridional extension of the region its tropical location and the complex topography delineated by the transition between the andean highlands and the western forest these can all influence the atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics of the region costa et al 2021 figueroa and nobre 1990 the rainy season occurs during the austral summer december february along the southern region this rainfall is related to the late phase of the south american monsoon system sams and regional features such as the bolivian high and the south american low level jet llj espinoza et al 2020 marengo et al 2004 satyamurty et al 1998 vera et al 2006 the northern region practically lacks a dry season june august and bimodalities are registered in the annual cycle influenced by the intertropical convergence zone itcz and the climatological westward moisture transport laraque et al 2007 segura et al 2019 a strong gradient of precipitation depth conditioned by the topography and exposure to easterly winds has been documented over the andes amazon transition zone ranging from 250 to 6000 mm yr in the southern region peaks of precipitation called rainfall hotspots regions are found around the 1000 masl and are related to llj the dynamics and thermodynamics of local features driven by the orography and thermal heating chavez and takahashi 2017 espinoza et al 2015 junquas et al 2018 the northwest equatorial region is also one of the rainiest zones with over 3000 mm yr espinoza et al 2009 regarding rainfall dynamics in the region an organized evolution of northerly to southerly regimes of atmospheric circulation phases also named circulation patterns are related to the northward propagation of rainfall espinoza et al 2021 2012 paccini et al 2018 these changes in circulation are associated with alternating negative to positive geopotential anomalies over the south american continent and surrounding oceans these anomalies are driven by the intrusion of extratropical systems into subtropical and tropical areas this process destabilizes the atmosphere along their path at intra seasonal time scales mainly 30 90 days this region is also influenced by the eastward propagation of the madden julian oscillation mjo as described in previous studies mayta et al 2019 recalde coronel et al 2020 other studies in the western amazon basin have established relationships between convection activity rainfalls and the meridional and zonal regimes for example the southerly cross equatorial regimes have been found to enhance convection and precipitation over the northern amazon jones and carvalho 2002 wang and fu 2002 the rainfall variability in the western amazon produces high river flow discharges at the tamshiyacu station from april to june and low flow discharges from august to october with a mean discharge of 32 000 m3 s espinoza et al 2013 2009 peak flows are usually observed at the beginning of may and the lowest discharges are observed in mid september ronchail et al 2018 the minimum and maximum mean levels discharges at the study station from 1985 to 2019 are 81 42 masl 12 600 m3 s and 89 72 masl 46 300 m3 s respectively the highest and lowest historical levels discharge observed at this station were respectively 91 32 masl 55 400 m3 s on 19 april 2012 espinoza et al 2013 and 79 64 masl 8300 m3 s on 05 september 2010 espinoza et al 2011 the channel of the amazon river along the segment between the tamshiyacu and iquitos gauging stations fig 1 is made of fine sands with a median particle size d50 of around 0 3 mm mendoza et al 2016 the channel has an average water slope of 0 00004 m m 2 2 dataset description the daily discharges and water level time series used in this study were obtained from the so hybam database from 01 january 1996 31 december 2018 these datasets are available at https hybam obs mip fr es website under development 3 daily precipitation was obtained from climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps using a spatial resolution of 0 25 from 01 january 1996 31 december 2018 available at https data chc ucsb edu products chirps 2 0 chirps dataset was selected for this study instead of another source of datasets due to its better performance when retrospectively evaluating extreme hydrological events in the amazon basin wongchuig correa et al 2017 in addition the analysis of precipitation datasets which combine both reanalysis data satellite estimates and in situ observations together with circulations and meteorological variables throughout the troposphere is a common practice gonzález rojí et al 2022 paccini et al 2018 atmospheric data were analyzed using winds and specific humidity at 1000 300 hpa from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 over the study region the vertical system of reference used here is the benchmark network developed by so hybam based on the earth gravitational model of 2008 egm08 to determine the extent of the riparian agricultural zone and the flooding risk to crops a digital elevation model dem of 1 m spatial resolution was generated for the area of interest it was composed by adding the photogrammetric topography of the left bank developed using a remotely piloted aircraft system rpas with real time kinematic positioning a bathymetry surveying of the channel bottom using a single beam echosounder by sending an acoustic signal with cross section separation of 250 m and the digitizing of the 10 m spatial resolution sentinel 2 satellite imagery for the right bank twelve ground control points were positioned for the rpas flight these were performed 60 m above the ground considering an 80 longitudinal and transversal overlap the ground sampling distance was 1 64 cm per pixel a total of 1325 photographs were taken generating a cloud of 967 million points to represent the terrain surface the mean vertical error of the photogrammetric dem was 5 cm 2 3 repiquete characterization a repiquete has been defined as a reversal in the water level of rivers greater than 1 cm coomes et al 2016 this study focused on repiquete events that occur during the transition from the wet to dry season and when the water level increase is equal to or greater than 20 cm because these changes could represent a crop risk the peak elevation of a repiquete is the highest elevation of the water level observed during an event for agriculture along the riparian zone of the amazon river the peak elevation could be harmful if it reaches the elevations being used for crops the magnitude of a repiquete is defined by the difference between its peak and initial water elevation the risk magnitude of each repiquete was defined as the portion of the magnitude equal to or greater than 20 cm developed in the agricultural elevations the 73 repiquetes equal to or greater than 20 cm reported by figueroa et al 2020 between 01 january 1996 and 31 december 2018 table s1 were used here to identify the repiquetes with risk magnitude along the riparian zone of the amazon river at tamshiyacu city after identifying the repiquetes and their peak elevations the area available for crop production and the frequency of occurrence of the repiquetes associated with percentiles of peak elevations were used to define the flooding risk for elevation ranges percentiles from the 70th to the 100th were considered to guarantee the major available area for crop production and the least flooding risk extreme repiquete events have been identified considering the mean risk magnitudes plus one standard deviation two extreme events have been selected as case studies based on their risk magnitude and duration the first event is the highest repiquete in terms of risk magnitude the second is a repiquete representing the remaining extreme repiquetes regarding risk magnitude 2 4 climatologic assessment of repiquetes to look for atmospheric conditions related to the beginning of repiquetes with a potential for flooding crops a composite of integrated vertical humidity flux and precipitation anomalies was computed at each grid point by subtracting the first harmonics from the 1981 2010 period this step used daily horizontal components of wind and specific humidity at 1000 300 hpa from the era interim reanalysis 0 25 dee et al 2011 daily precipitation registers from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps v 2 0 25 funk et al 2015 were also analyzed furthermore mean daily precipitation and its distribution over the region were computed for each repiquete selected these were initiated and raised above the minimum elevation farmers have used for rice cultivation along the riparian zone of the amazon river similar analyses were used to assess extreme repiquetes events 2 5 repiquete simulation the us army corps of engineers usace hydrologic engineering center river analysis system hec ras 1d model v6 1 was used to simulate the possible flooding caused by the studied repiquete to obtain the flooding boundary caused by the repiquete peak in agricultural areas the hec ras 1d model was selected following a comparison with its 2d counterpart for the analyzed straight reach of the amazon river the performance of the hec ras 1d model in estimating the extent of flooded areas was found to be similar to that of the hec ras 2d model determining the flooding boundary is necessary to estimate the impact of the repiquetes on crops by assessing the percentage of the area flooded by the repiquete versus the available area at the beginning of the repiquete peak elevations associated with each percentile were simulated under steady flow conditions along a 4 km stretch of the amazon river at the tamshiyacu gauging station similarly an unsteady flow simulation was performed to represent the hydrograph of the two extreme repiquetes previously identified to establish the model 74 cross sections were extracted from the dem considering a cross section spacing of 50 m the initial manning roughness coefficient was determined based on the composition of the river bottom and banks flow discharges and elevations were determined using the rating curve of the tamshiyacu gauging station which has been used as the downstream boundary condition of the model 3 results 3 1 available areas and repiquetes events from the photogrammetric survey the elevations of the riparian zone used by farmers to plant rice crops along the study area were estimated and ranged from 83 to 88 masl the area has an average width of 50 m and an extent of about 180 000 m2 the average topographic gradient of the area used for rice cultivation is 0 1 m m the relationship between the percentage of available area for rice crops and the land elevation for the recession period is shown in fig 2 the available area for rice cultivation increases as the water level drops if the water level drops from 88 to 87 masl only 1 m then 43 of the total available area is exposed due to its small topographic gradient 0 05 m m however the water level needs to drop 4 m 87 83 masl to expose the remaining 57 of the total available area an average rate of 3 2 repiquetes per year was estimated from 01 january 1996 31 december 2018 of the 73 repiquetes only 42 with a ratio of 1 8 repiquetes per year had a risk magnitude orange bars equal to or greater than 20 cm in fig 3 and could potentially flood crops based on the impact of their magnitude in the agricultural zone 83 88 masl repiquetes 53 and 65 circled in red in fig 3 have not been considered in the analysis because they occurred before the rice crop planting dates and did not imply impacts on agriculture the mean risk magnitude of the 42 repiquetes was 0 68 m with a standard deviation of 0 47 considering intervals of risk magnitudes of 20 cm for the total 42 repiquetes 31 2 13 repiquetes have a risk magnitude between 0 20 and 0 40 m 28 8 12 repiquetes between 0 40 and 0 60 m and the remaining 40 0 17 repiquetes are distributed between 0 6 m y 2 4 m additionally 41 repiquetes have a risk magnitude of less than 1 4 m and only one repiquete has a risk magnitude of 2 34 m repiquete of the 2002 year fig 4 extreme values of risk magnitude of the repiquetes have been identified by referencing the mean plus one standard deviation 1 15 m repiquetes observed in the years 1998 1 28 m no 7 2000 1 4 m no 12 2002 2 34 m no 16 2008 1 29 m no 36 2010 1 35 m no 43 and 2018 1 22 m no 72 have been identified as repiquetes with extreme risk magnitude fig 3 3 2 flooding risk areas fig 5a shows the relationship between the risk magnitude of the 42 repiquetes with the potential risk of flooding croplands and the flooded area of the cropland the fitted linear relationship indicates that a mean cropland area of approximately 13 829 m2 is flooded by a repiquete with a mean risk magnitude of 0 68 m representing 8 of the total cultivation area a repiquete with a risk magnitude of 1 41 m would flood an average of 32 360 m2 of cropland representing 18 of the total agricultural area available along the riparian zone we next compared the flooded area estimated by the hydraulic simulation 62 796 m2 with the predicted flooded area for the highest risk magnitude event that occurred on 06 july 2002 the linear relationship underestimates this value by around 6824 m2 10 of the flooded area certainly the flooded area depends on the topographic gradient of the elevation range where the repiquete is developing the percentage of the area flooded by a repiquete to evaluate the flooding impact depends on the available area at the initiation of the repiquete fig 2 the flooding risk area is related to the percentiles of the peak elevation for the 42 repiquetes with risk magnitudes that potentially flood croplands the area available for crops and the frequency of the repiquetes fig 5b a negative correlation r2 0 97 between the percentile of peak elevations and the frequency of repiquetes indicates that higher values of percentiles result in lower values of frequency of the repiquetes thus referencing a low flooding risk of the riparian zone area above the elevation associated with that percentile similarly a negative correlation r2 0 99 exists between the peak elevation and the area available for rice cultivation over the percentile the area available for rice cultivation related to crop productivity is smaller for higher percentiles of peak elevation table 1 the assessment of the flooding risk associated with the frequency of occurrence of repiquetes with risk magnitude shows that the frequency of occurrence of repiquete events that could affect crops is 0 35 repiquetes per year i e one time per 3 years for terrain elevations above 85 31 masl 80th percentile of peak elevations however the area below 85 31 masl has a flooding risk of 1 47 repiquetes per year i e three times per 2 years similarly for terrain elevations above 85 91 masl 90th percentile of peak elevations the flooding risk associated with the frequency of occurrence is reduced to 0 26 repiquetes per year terrain elevations over the 87 01 masl do not present flooding risk per occurrence of repiquetes and as mentioned before these elevations represent 43 of the total available area for agriculture the flooding boundary corresponding to the 80th and 85th percentiles obtained by hydraulic modeling is shown in fig 5c 3 3 formation of repiquetes with risk magnitude to describe the formation of repiquetes with risk magnitude that potentially flood croplands at the study site a composite of vertically integrated moisture flux and precipitation anomalies was computed from the 42 events with risk magnitude that affected the area used to grow rice based on the day of a repiquete initiation at the tamshiyacu gauging station d0 high values of moisture convergence were found between the sixth and the third preceding days d 6 and d 3 to the north of 7 s this convergence was driven by the increase in an easterly moisture flux anomaly of 55 kg m s fig 6 the same days registered the maximum precipitation anomalies over the northwest sub basins of the marañón basin 3 4 evaluation of repiquetes with an extreme magnitude of risk two cases of the six repiquetes were identified with extreme flooding risk the selection was based on the high risk magnitude and long duration of repiquetes that potentially generate impacts on agricultural production in the region the repiquete observed on 06 july 2002 has the highest risk magnitude 2 34 m in the analyzed period 1996 2018 the repiquete observed on 17 june 2008 has a magnitude 1 29 m similar to the mean of the remaining five extreme repiquetes with a high risk magnitude mean risk magnitude 1 31 m the repiquetes of 06 july 2002 and 17 june 2008 are shown in table 2 and fig 7a flooded areas for the 2002 purple and 2008 oranges repiquetes are shown in figs 7b and 7c respectively the flooded areas were determined based on the non steady hydraulic simulation considering the hydrographs shown in fig 7a the 2002 extreme repiquete event had a risk magnitude of 2 34 m an average inundation width of 15 m and a duration of 42 days fig 7b the flooded area caused by this repiquete was estimated at 62 796 m2 representing 40 of the area available for agriculture at the initiation of the repiquete 157 000 m2 this repiquete event was initiated with a heavy precipitation intensity over the northern marañón pastaza sub basin and northern ucayali basins on 01 july d 5 and was reflected at the tamshiyacu gauging station on 06 july d0 the magnitude of the repiquete increased via the precipitation over the marañón basin from 02 july d 4 to 16 july d 10 precipitation exceeded the 90th percentile of the jja june august period in the northern marañón basin predominantly over the pastaza and tigre sub basins on 17 july d 11 and 18 july d 12 these precipitation events led to a peak of the repiquete observed at the tamshiyacu gauging station between 23 july d 17 and 24 july d 18 precipitation over the northern marañón basin pastaza morona santiago and nieva sub basins exceeded the 90th and 99th percentiles on july 23rd and 24th respectively these precipitation events and the one that occurred on 26 july d 20 kept the magnitude of the peak of the repiquete relatively stable for almost 2 weeks fig s1 during the days that preceded the dates of the studied repiquete the easterly vertically integrated moisture flux was higher than 250 kg m s and the convergence to the west of 74 w was intense over the northern area of the basin after the repiquete the flux was 200 kg m s the contribution of the marañón s sub basins is greater than the ucayali sub basins when considering both the mean areal daily and the accumulated precipitacion for the days before the event fig 8a and c at the beginning of the event the northern watersheds registered the maximum accumulation of rainfall although watersheds below 1500 masl within the ucayali basin also contributed in addition a major contribution by the northern watersheds was noticed during the 2002 event fig 8d on the other hand the 2008 extreme repiquete had a risk magnitude of 1 29 m d 16 and lasted 23 days the area flooded by this repiquete was estimated to be 35 800 m2 or a quarter of the area available for cropping along the riparian zone at that time 142 000 m2 the average inundation width was 9 m fig 7c and its origin was related to both the main tributary basins of the peruvian amazon river the event of 2008 was initiated on 17 june d0 at the tamshiyacu station due to a combination of precipitation over the northern ucayali basin on 10 june d 7 as well as values over the northern low marañón basin in subsequent days from 11 june d 6 to the 21 june d 4 the precipitation over the ucayali and marañón basin increased the water elevation at the tamshiyacu gauging station the accumulated precipitation in june exceeded the 95th percentile of the jja period over the marañón tigre pastaza morona santa and nieva sub basins and the northwest ucayali sub basins on 22 june d 5 and 24 june d 7 respectively fig 8b the peak of the repiquete at the tamshiyacu gauging station was observed on 02 july d 15 fig s2 these days are consistent with the moisture convergence observed to the west of 72 w along the watershed the easterly vertically integrated moisture flux with values higher than 200 250 kg m s was identified in d 6 d 1 and d 7 the peak of the 2008 repiquete could be related to a later dynamic wave due to a major precipitation contribution of the western watersheds fig 8e and f or an influence of lateral humid zones that drain into the riverbed 4 discussions the analyses of this study are based on remote sensing field measurements hydraulic simulations and climatological assessments they provide new insights into how repiquetes impact riparian croplands in the recession period of the western amazon basin here 42 of the 73 repiquetes 1996 2018 identified by figueroa et al 2020 with risk magnitudes up to 2 34 m had the potential to flood riparian agriculture here 41 of these repiquetes have a risk magnitude smaller than 1 41 m and only one exception exceeds this risk magnitude our results focused on the 42 repiquetes that complement previous studies on this region coomes et al 2016 figueroa et al 2020 list and coomes 2017 ronchail et al 2018 this prior work determined the flooding risk of riparian croplands based on terrain elevation the characterization of climatological behavior of repiquete formation and the likelihood of probable flooding impact produced by extreme repiquete events rice crops in the lower amazon region of peru departments of loreto and ucayali cover an area of 25 000 ha of silt and sand bars dia 2011 inia 2005 thus to avoid the 40 losses by farmers related to flooding in these areas the national institute of agrarian innovation inia 2007 2005 has developed the ecoarroz and jar i special rice varieties for the lowlands of the amazon basin whose main characteristic is the reduction of the vegetative period 102 105 days with a high yield 5 6 tons ha surveys carried out with farmers in tamshiyacu city n 29 reported that 52 of them used seeds of the variety esperanza and 38 were of the variety capirona developed for highland regions of the amazon basin these varieties were adapted to amazon highland soils and are resistant to pests they have a high vegetative period of 120 and 150 days and potential yields between 9 and 11 tons ha however the productivity decreases to 2 6 4 8 tons ha in low lying areas due to the difference in climates and soils condition inia 2010 2001 list and coomes 2019 importantly there are currently no government programs that provide technical assistance to farmers on seed variety selection this likely explains why this community does not use the variety and certified seeds adapted to the flooding and only 30 of farmers know about the events of repiquetes therefore selected varieties of rice seeds could be used by farmers based on a range of terrain elevations as well as the frequency of occurrence of repiquetes to reduce crop losses and obtain better productivity in this study area 43 of the riparian area available for crop establishment 83 88 masl is located between 87 and 88 masl and is considered a secure zone for cultivation because it would not be affected by repiquetes due to the low terrain gradient this riparian area could be exposed in about 2 weeks considering that the water level falls at 7 4 cm day as determined for elevations of 84 75 87 55 masl ronchail et al 2018 farmers could use this 43 area for seeding the high vegetative period as capirona variety this strategy can lead to better productivity in terms of potential yield tons ha the flooding risk by repiquetes is present in the remaining 57 of the available area flooding risk by repiquetes increases when the elevation decreases for terrain elevations between 85 31 and 87 00 masl 80th percentile of peak elevations of repiquetes the repiquete rate is once every 3 years it is better to use short vegetative period seeds of rice variety as jar i in this area similarly coomes et al 2016 studied the muyuy and panguana anabranching structures 10 km on average downstream of tamshiyacu city on terrain elevations between 112 and 116 m of relative vertical datum equivalent to 82 77 86 77 masl based on egm08 these areas were used as cultivation rice areas and they found a lower probability of flooding by the repiquete for elevations above 114 m 84 77 masl the elevations farmers use in muyuy anabranching are lower than those determined in tamshiyacu city decreasing from upstream to downstream this implies that farmers consider the hydraulic gradient of the amazon river to select agricultural areas consequently the flooding risk by repiquetes based on percentiles could be extrapolated through 30 km downstream before the iquitos gauging station and 30 km upstream there is no important tributary in this area for this extrapolation one must consider the hydraulic gradient of the amazon river at this reach of 0 00004 m m for example 85 31 masl 80th percentile at the tamshiyacu gauging station would be 84 11 masl 30 km downstream due to the decrease in water level at this hydraulic gradient to extrapolate to a large reach i e tabatinga gauging station in brazil at 508 km downstream of tamshiyacu gauging station one must use intermediate gauging stations and evaluate the tributaries in the reach e g napo river ampiyacu river atacuari river loretoyacu river similarly one must use a hydrological distributed model for large basins such as the mgb model i e evaluating the wave propagation of the hydrograph over a large scale between tamshiyacu and tabatinga gauging stations representing repiquetes events collischonn et al 2007 pontes et al 2017 wongchuig correa et al 2017 zubieta et al 2015 risk magnitudes of repiquetes smaller than 0 60 m are common in the study area 25 of 42 repiquetes the linear regression between the risk magnitude and the flooded area identified here indicates that the agricultural areas flooded by repiquetes with risk magnitudes of 0 40 m and 0 60 m are 4 and 7 respectively of the total available area the occurrence of several independent repiquetes events with a small risk magnitude in a single year can be as significant as an extreme repiquete event for instance in 2013 four independent repiquetes events with risk magnitude were identified the total sum of the magnitudes of each repiquetes event that occurred on 16 july 0 62 m 22 august 0 88 m 04 september 0 56 m and 26 september 0 56 m 2013 was 2 62 m which exceeded in terms of magnitude the highest extreme repiquete event of 2 34 m the sum of the percentages of the flooded area by each repiquete could rise to 35 of the total available area however to estimate the actual crop losses by the occurrence of repiquetes one must analyze these events individually considering the available area at initiating the repiquete the formation of repiquetes with the risk magnitude analyzed here is associated with high moisture transport and precipitation values over the northwestern andes amazon sub basins of the marañón basin until 6 days before the initiation of the repiquetes these results agree with figueroa et al 2020 and ronchail et al 2018 during the days that preceded the dates of the studied repiquete the easterly vertically integrated moisture flux was higher than 250 200 kg m s and the convergence to the west of 74 w was intense over the northern area of the basin after the repiquete the flux was 200 kg m s northeasterly and southeasterly fluxes are predominant climatological characteristics for the lower and mid levels of the study region during jja poveda et al 2014 trachte 2018 anomalies of the moisture flux convergence are around 50 kg m s during these days which could increase the equivalent potential temperature at low levels and eventually trigger convection wright et al 2017 generally the mesoscale convective systems mcss formed in the andes amazon transition regions of peru and ecuador campozano et al 2018 migrate towards the lowland forest and those that form between the northern area of peru brazil and colombia migrate to the west or southwest during jja rehbein et al 2018 versus the 2008 repiquete the high magnitude and duration of the 2002 repiquete were probably induced by the higher precipitation distributed over the region that held over in the northern marañón basin however these case studies of repiquetes with extreme risk magnitudes show the importance of the northern ucayali basin where a regional precipitation hotspot is located between 8 and 9 5 s and to the east of 74 w fig 8 this part of the basin also influences the initiation and the peak of the repiquetes with extreme risk magnitudes this finding is particularly important considering the nature of precipitation during extreme repiquetes including large convective zones over the peruvian amazon lowland and orographic forced precipitation as documented by figueroa et al 2020 what modulates the high precipitation events that occur successively and thus amplify the characteristics of the repiquetes the answer to this question is mainly limited by the lack of measurement of environmental variables in the vertical of the region that could be contrasted and thus improve the outputs provided by models for example there are no radiosonde records in the entire study area and towards 3 n zhou et al 2021 overall high values of moisture convergence induced by an increase of anomaly moisture flux and precipitations over the northern marañón and ucayali basins were the principal characteristics that defined the initiation and the risk magnitude of repiquetes this spatial pattern of rainfall anomalies agrees well with the propagation of the convective core of the mjo in western tropical south america that is characterized by positive rainfall anomalies in the northern marañón and ucayali basins particularly during the phases 8 1 of mjo according to fig 3 in recalde coronel et al 2020 similar to what was proposed by previous studies the use of ensemble forecasts that feed calibrated hydrological models seems to be one of the best alternatives it can be complemented with recent data based models in addition the atmospheric patterns defined in this study for repiquetes with risk magnitude could help forecast repiquetes 6 days before the water level starts to rise at the tamshiyacu gauging station these days can be used to warn farmers of potential floods and prevent the loss of seeds since farmers sow as the river s water level decreases an increase in water level could remove the seeds and carry them downstream hydraulic simulations showed that for the 2002 2 34 m of risk magnitude and 2008 1 29 m of risk magnitude repiquetes probably flooded 40 estimated in 25 tons of rice and 25 16 tons of rice of the available cultivation area at the initiation of repiquete respectively a previous study list and coomes 2017 based on repiquetes registered at the iquitos gauging station determined that the repiquete of 2002 would have flooded between 88 and 52 of silt bars in the muyuy anabranching structure downstream of tamshiyacu city the 2013 shortfalls had different hazards considering repiquete between the most important this was estimated at 3 7 tons per farmer the difference in flooding impacts by repiquetes between list and coomes 2017 and this study could be related to the topographic gradient of floodplain elevations and the influence of precipitation over the itaya river subbasin that influences the magnitude of repiquetes in the iquitos gaging station itaya river the positive and negative trends of dry days frequency in the southern and northern amazon basins respectively espinoza et al 2016 langenbrunner et al 2019 wongchuig correa et al 2017 and projections of increment in precipitation over the northwestern amazon basin sorribas et al 2016 zulkafli et al 2016 could affect the frequency of repiquete events however deforestation in the amazon influences rainfall reduction over the basin sierra et al 2022 staal et al 2020 thus affecting the role of forest transpiration that produces around one third of amazon rainfall staal et al 2018 similarly deforestation could affect the shallow convection produced by forests that moisten and destabilize the atmosphere before the arrival of the intertropical convergence zone itcz wright et al 2017 prior work ronchail et al 2018 indicated probably better conditions for riparian agriculture based on the positive trend of the low water period and the negative trend of low water level espinoza et al 2011 lavado casimiro et al 2012 wongchuig correa et al 2017 which would increase the available area for agriculture when the water level starts to drop however it is still unclear how future changes in climate variability could affect the occurrence of repiquetes this unsolved question could be answered in future research flooded extent areas by repiquetes were estimated using the 1d hec ras model instead of the 2d hec ras version considering the facility of application the reduced time simulation the morphology of the amazon river reach straight reach without complex morphological structures and the hydrographs of repiquetes less than the extreme flows similar results of flood extent in floodplains are obtained between the 1d and 2d models alzahrani 2017 horritt and bates 2002 considering the extension of the floodplains and the limitations of the model version however due to the complex meandering of other reaches of the amazon river one must evaluate the application of the 2d model trigg et al 2009 to simulate repiquete events a limitation to extrapolating this study s findings is that the flooded area results are subject to the topography of the cultivation area and their changes throughout the length of the amazon river additional topography studies are needed to replicate this study in another river area however considering the hydraulic gradient the flooded risk associated with water level and peak elevations of repiquetes can be used in another part of the amazon river to apply this methodology in another river such as the ucayali river one must also obtain daily water level time series and grid precipitation data 5 conclusions this study investigates the flooding risk of croplands produced by reversal water levels known as repiquetes in the peruvian tamshiyacu gauging station in the western amazon basin field survey data satellite based data statistical analysis hydraulic simulations and atmospheric assessments were used to understand the risk of repiquete flooding the results indicate that floodplain agriculture areas located between 83 and 88 masl in our studied region are impacted by the occurrence of repiquetes at 1 8 events per year on average 1996 2018 however the flooding risk is particularly high for the low elevation range below 85 31 masl thus percentiles of peak elevations of repiquetes have been determined in floodplain areas while terrain elevations between 85 31 and 87 00 masl have a reduced flooding risk of 0 35 per year elevations between 87 00 and 88 00 masl corresponding to 43 of the total area are unaffected by repiquetes extreme repiquetes that occurred in 2002 and 2008 are analyzed in more detail in this study these extreme events could seriously affect farmland by flooding up to 40 of the available area at the initiation of the event for up to 42 days extreme events are primarily related to high precipitation rates over the northern marañón basin including the andes amazon transition zone and the northern ucayali basin changes in the low level wind circulations intensify the atmospheric moisture flux and its convergence over these regions producing extreme precipitations through the six previous days these results could be a tool for farmers in the region to select seed rice varieties short or large vegetative period as a function of the terrain elevation and the potential risk of flooding by repiquetes identified in this study considering that 43 of the area is unaffected by flooding repiquetes farmers could use large vegetative period seeds in this area to improve productivity in addition farmers could be trained to identify flood risk zones on the ground while the water level is falling thus referencing the water level measured at the gauging station therefore disseminating and communicating these findings to the local farming community is a key challenge for the scientific community to consider the study was limited by a lack of information on daily water levels and the low density of gauging stations in the western amazon basin there were also challenges in obtaining terrain elevation with high accuracy due to poor accessibility in addition the relationship between repiquetes and climatological forcing brings up the question of how climatic change will affect these repiquetes events which is currently unclear finally overcoming these limitations could help to establish an early warning system based on remote sensing precipitation and real time gauging stations that identify repiquetes before they reach the agricultural floodplains credit authorship contribution statement jonathan valenzuela conceptualization

7692,study region the western amazon basin at tamshiyacu gauging station near the iquitos city hosts floodplain agriculture that can be affected by the sudden reversal in direction of water levels known as repiquetes that produce intermittent flooding study focus this study assesses repiquete flooding risk in riparian crop areas based on statistical analyses of repiquete events registered from 1996 to 2018 hydraulic modeling to estimate flooded extension and assessment of climatological characteristics during the formation of repiquetes new hydrological insights floods 20 cm produced by repiquetes in riparian crop areas between 83 00 and 88 00 m above sea level masl occur 1 8 times per year however not all elevation ranges have the same flooding risk to crops terrain elevations between 85 31 and 87 00 masl have a reduced flooding risk of 0 35 per year likewise areas with elevations between 87 00 and 88 00 masl 43 of the total area were not affected by repiquetes extreme repiquetes study cases of 2002 and 2008 have been influenced by the increase of atmospheric moisture flux convergence and precipitation over both the northern ucayali and marañón basins through the six previous days flood impacts from the extreme event of 2002 2008 could have reached 40 25 of the available area for agriculture at the initiation of the repiquete graphical abstract ga1 keywords repiquetes riparian agriculture rainfall flooding risk western amazon data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the amazon basin hosts biodiversity of aquatic and terrestrial plants and animals these species have dynamic interactions due to the hydrological regime of their rivers including variations in the flows and water levels between low water and high water periods sioli 1984 the hydrological regimes of the amazon rivers provide opportunities for agricultural activities in the amazon basin communities have been established in high terrain elevations to prevent flooding and near the floodplains that have a great potential for agriculture coomes et al 2016 denevan 1996 gorenstein 2023 hiraoka 1985 jakovac et al 2017 jardim et al 2020 winklerprins 2022 due to these areas are enriched by nutrients from the andes transported by rivers ronchail et al 2018 2016 the intensification of agriculture in the amazon floodplain has increased due to population growth around cities and market demand for crops such as cassava and beans in brazil and rice in peru chibnik 1994 coomes et al 2016 jakovac et al 2017 nevertheless agriculture along the floodplain is exposed to natural hazards principally by river stage reversal or sudden floodings repiquetes as well as edaphic conditions that affect the economy of the riparian farmer families list and coomes 2017 repiquetes are events that can interfere with the cultivation of crops i e they can remove and carry seeds downriver shorten their vegetative period flood agricultural areas and destroy harvests this study focused on analyzing flooding risks produced by repiquetes on floodplains used for agriculture in the amazon basin in the western amazon basin agriculture is primarily developed on the floodplains and islands formed by the meandering river during the transition from the wet to the dry season this occurs between june and october espinoza et al 2011 lavado casimiro et al 2013 during that season the water elevation drops by up to 7 m at the tamshiyacu gauging station in the amazon river exposing the terrain available to recessional agriculture ronchail et al 2018 2016 in the lowland of the western amazon basin specifically in the loreto department 49 of the western amazon basin up to peruvian tamshiyacu station fig 1a rice is sown on average in 34 600 ha 2000 2010 70 of which are floodplains dia 2011 inia 2005 in the ucayali province this value is 6000 ha labarta et al 2007 repiquetes are unpredictable and sudden reversals in the direction of river levels both when the river level rises and falls coomes et al 2016 however for floodplains or recessional agriculture repiquetes in the transition from wet to dry season are important and occur due to abundant rainfall episodes in the northern part of the western amazon basin marañón basin these episodes are associated with changes in the direction of the low level meridional winds over the andes amazon transition zone figueroa et al 2020 repiquete flooding can seriously affect crop productivity thus compromising the economy and food security of many riverine communities a repiquete event on 28 june 2012 06 july 2002 could have flooded 59 88 and 14 52 of the lateral silt bar used for recessional agriculture in the communities of dos de mayo and augusto freyre near the city of iquitos respectively list and coomes 2017 recent work list and coomes 2019 found that the mean potential production of rice in regions of the peruvian amazon along the muyuy anabranching structure around the city of iquitos decreased by 50 in 2012 due to both crop inundation and reduction of the growing time influenced by repiquetes the occurrence of repiquetes has been estimated at 3 2 times per year coomes et al 2016 figueroa et al 2020 ronchail et al 2018 however not all repiquetes will flood agricultural areas depending on the repiquete magnitude risk magnitude of flooding date of occurrence and terrain elevation previous studies have analyzed this phenomenon by considering hydrological or climatological approaches separately however the nature of the phenomenon suggests that both approaches should be used together taking into account the climatological characteristics that allow the formation of these events as well as the impacts on agricultural areas and the analysis of extreme events in order to investigate the repiquete phenomenon two study questions were defined as follows are repiquetes which have the potential to cause flooding to agricultural areas produced by precipitation over the north of the western studied amazon basin or is there another part of the basin influencing their occurrence and is it feasible to determine a secure zone for cultivation and assess flooding risk based on analyses of repiquetes answering these questions can support farmers in their decision making process toward reducing or mitigating riparian crop loss in the western amazon river basin thus this paper reports a broad assessment of repiquetes that include i identifying repiquetes with risk magnitude of flooding and extreme events ii assessing the flooding risk by repiquetes based on terrain elevation of croplands and estimating the flooded areas as a function of the risk magnitude of repiquete iii characterizing the climatological behavior of repiquete formation that could be used to identify future events and iv assessing the probable flooding impact produced by extreme repiquete events a combined approach was used to answer the study questions and objectives the approach includes statistical analyses of repiquetes remote sensing detailed topography survey hydraulic modeling and climatological assessment the results could help develop risk maps to guarantee floodplain agriculture which could be handed to regional authorities 2 data and methods 2 1 study area and atmospheric and hydrology features the amazon river is the largest fluvial system in the world in terms of the volume of water exported to the ocean 209 000 m3 s its drainage area of 6 2 106 km2 callède et al 2010 and its suspended sediment export 1200 mt yr armijos et al 2020 it is the backbone of the natural amazon ecosystem with high biodiversity in flora and fauna foley et al 2007 the principal sources of food and economic revenue for human settlements established along the river margins are agriculture rice manioc peanuts and fishing gorenstein 2023 jakovac et al 2017 labarta et al 2007 list and coomes 2017 the amazon basin drains into the tamshiyacu gauging station at the mainstream amazon river which is downstream of the confluence of the marañón and ucayali rivers figs 1a 1b it covers an area of approximately 750 000 km2 in the peruvian and ecuadorian amazon armijos et al 2013 in the western amazon basin region around tamshiyacu city the flooding risk zone has an extension of 4 km along the left bank of the amazon river fig 1c the spatiotemporal rainfall variability in the western amazon basin is associated with the meridional extension of the region its tropical location and the complex topography delineated by the transition between the andean highlands and the western forest these can all influence the atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics of the region costa et al 2021 figueroa and nobre 1990 the rainy season occurs during the austral summer december february along the southern region this rainfall is related to the late phase of the south american monsoon system sams and regional features such as the bolivian high and the south american low level jet llj espinoza et al 2020 marengo et al 2004 satyamurty et al 1998 vera et al 2006 the northern region practically lacks a dry season june august and bimodalities are registered in the annual cycle influenced by the intertropical convergence zone itcz and the climatological westward moisture transport laraque et al 2007 segura et al 2019 a strong gradient of precipitation depth conditioned by the topography and exposure to easterly winds has been documented over the andes amazon transition zone ranging from 250 to 6000 mm yr in the southern region peaks of precipitation called rainfall hotspots regions are found around the 1000 masl and are related to llj the dynamics and thermodynamics of local features driven by the orography and thermal heating chavez and takahashi 2017 espinoza et al 2015 junquas et al 2018 the northwest equatorial region is also one of the rainiest zones with over 3000 mm yr espinoza et al 2009 regarding rainfall dynamics in the region an organized evolution of northerly to southerly regimes of atmospheric circulation phases also named circulation patterns are related to the northward propagation of rainfall espinoza et al 2021 2012 paccini et al 2018 these changes in circulation are associated with alternating negative to positive geopotential anomalies over the south american continent and surrounding oceans these anomalies are driven by the intrusion of extratropical systems into subtropical and tropical areas this process destabilizes the atmosphere along their path at intra seasonal time scales mainly 30 90 days this region is also influenced by the eastward propagation of the madden julian oscillation mjo as described in previous studies mayta et al 2019 recalde coronel et al 2020 other studies in the western amazon basin have established relationships between convection activity rainfalls and the meridional and zonal regimes for example the southerly cross equatorial regimes have been found to enhance convection and precipitation over the northern amazon jones and carvalho 2002 wang and fu 2002 the rainfall variability in the western amazon produces high river flow discharges at the tamshiyacu station from april to june and low flow discharges from august to october with a mean discharge of 32 000 m3 s espinoza et al 2013 2009 peak flows are usually observed at the beginning of may and the lowest discharges are observed in mid september ronchail et al 2018 the minimum and maximum mean levels discharges at the study station from 1985 to 2019 are 81 42 masl 12 600 m3 s and 89 72 masl 46 300 m3 s respectively the highest and lowest historical levels discharge observed at this station were respectively 91 32 masl 55 400 m3 s on 19 april 2012 espinoza et al 2013 and 79 64 masl 8300 m3 s on 05 september 2010 espinoza et al 2011 the channel of the amazon river along the segment between the tamshiyacu and iquitos gauging stations fig 1 is made of fine sands with a median particle size d50 of around 0 3 mm mendoza et al 2016 the channel has an average water slope of 0 00004 m m 2 2 dataset description the daily discharges and water level time series used in this study were obtained from the so hybam database from 01 january 1996 31 december 2018 these datasets are available at https hybam obs mip fr es website under development 3 daily precipitation was obtained from climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps using a spatial resolution of 0 25 from 01 january 1996 31 december 2018 available at https data chc ucsb edu products chirps 2 0 chirps dataset was selected for this study instead of another source of datasets due to its better performance when retrospectively evaluating extreme hydrological events in the amazon basin wongchuig correa et al 2017 in addition the analysis of precipitation datasets which combine both reanalysis data satellite estimates and in situ observations together with circulations and meteorological variables throughout the troposphere is a common practice gonzález rojí et al 2022 paccini et al 2018 atmospheric data were analyzed using winds and specific humidity at 1000 300 hpa from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 over the study region the vertical system of reference used here is the benchmark network developed by so hybam based on the earth gravitational model of 2008 egm08 to determine the extent of the riparian agricultural zone and the flooding risk to crops a digital elevation model dem of 1 m spatial resolution was generated for the area of interest it was composed by adding the photogrammetric topography of the left bank developed using a remotely piloted aircraft system rpas with real time kinematic positioning a bathymetry surveying of the channel bottom using a single beam echosounder by sending an acoustic signal with cross section separation of 250 m and the digitizing of the 10 m spatial resolution sentinel 2 satellite imagery for the right bank twelve ground control points were positioned for the rpas flight these were performed 60 m above the ground considering an 80 longitudinal and transversal overlap the ground sampling distance was 1 64 cm per pixel a total of 1325 photographs were taken generating a cloud of 967 million points to represent the terrain surface the mean vertical error of the photogrammetric dem was 5 cm 2 3 repiquete characterization a repiquete has been defined as a reversal in the water level of rivers greater than 1 cm coomes et al 2016 this study focused on repiquete events that occur during the transition from the wet to dry season and when the water level increase is equal to or greater than 20 cm because these changes could represent a crop risk the peak elevation of a repiquete is the highest elevation of the water level observed during an event for agriculture along the riparian zone of the amazon river the peak elevation could be harmful if it reaches the elevations being used for crops the magnitude of a repiquete is defined by the difference between its peak and initial water elevation the risk magnitude of each repiquete was defined as the portion of the magnitude equal to or greater than 20 cm developed in the agricultural elevations the 73 repiquetes equal to or greater than 20 cm reported by figueroa et al 2020 between 01 january 1996 and 31 december 2018 table s1 were used here to identify the repiquetes with risk magnitude along the riparian zone of the amazon river at tamshiyacu city after identifying the repiquetes and their peak elevations the area available for crop production and the frequency of occurrence of the repiquetes associated with percentiles of peak elevations were used to define the flooding risk for elevation ranges percentiles from the 70th to the 100th were considered to guarantee the major available area for crop production and the least flooding risk extreme repiquete events have been identified considering the mean risk magnitudes plus one standard deviation two extreme events have been selected as case studies based on their risk magnitude and duration the first event is the highest repiquete in terms of risk magnitude the second is a repiquete representing the remaining extreme repiquetes regarding risk magnitude 2 4 climatologic assessment of repiquetes to look for atmospheric conditions related to the beginning of repiquetes with a potential for flooding crops a composite of integrated vertical humidity flux and precipitation anomalies was computed at each grid point by subtracting the first harmonics from the 1981 2010 period this step used daily horizontal components of wind and specific humidity at 1000 300 hpa from the era interim reanalysis 0 25 dee et al 2011 daily precipitation registers from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps v 2 0 25 funk et al 2015 were also analyzed furthermore mean daily precipitation and its distribution over the region were computed for each repiquete selected these were initiated and raised above the minimum elevation farmers have used for rice cultivation along the riparian zone of the amazon river similar analyses were used to assess extreme repiquetes events 2 5 repiquete simulation the us army corps of engineers usace hydrologic engineering center river analysis system hec ras 1d model v6 1 was used to simulate the possible flooding caused by the studied repiquete to obtain the flooding boundary caused by the repiquete peak in agricultural areas the hec ras 1d model was selected following a comparison with its 2d counterpart for the analyzed straight reach of the amazon river the performance of the hec ras 1d model in estimating the extent of flooded areas was found to be similar to that of the hec ras 2d model determining the flooding boundary is necessary to estimate the impact of the repiquetes on crops by assessing the percentage of the area flooded by the repiquete versus the available area at the beginning of the repiquete peak elevations associated with each percentile were simulated under steady flow conditions along a 4 km stretch of the amazon river at the tamshiyacu gauging station similarly an unsteady flow simulation was performed to represent the hydrograph of the two extreme repiquetes previously identified to establish the model 74 cross sections were extracted from the dem considering a cross section spacing of 50 m the initial manning roughness coefficient was determined based on the composition of the river bottom and banks flow discharges and elevations were determined using the rating curve of the tamshiyacu gauging station which has been used as the downstream boundary condition of the model 3 results 3 1 available areas and repiquetes events from the photogrammetric survey the elevations of the riparian zone used by farmers to plant rice crops along the study area were estimated and ranged from 83 to 88 masl the area has an average width of 50 m and an extent of about 180 000 m2 the average topographic gradient of the area used for rice cultivation is 0 1 m m the relationship between the percentage of available area for rice crops and the land elevation for the recession period is shown in fig 2 the available area for rice cultivation increases as the water level drops if the water level drops from 88 to 87 masl only 1 m then 43 of the total available area is exposed due to its small topographic gradient 0 05 m m however the water level needs to drop 4 m 87 83 masl to expose the remaining 57 of the total available area an average rate of 3 2 repiquetes per year was estimated from 01 january 1996 31 december 2018 of the 73 repiquetes only 42 with a ratio of 1 8 repiquetes per year had a risk magnitude orange bars equal to or greater than 20 cm in fig 3 and could potentially flood crops based on the impact of their magnitude in the agricultural zone 83 88 masl repiquetes 53 and 65 circled in red in fig 3 have not been considered in the analysis because they occurred before the rice crop planting dates and did not imply impacts on agriculture the mean risk magnitude of the 42 repiquetes was 0 68 m with a standard deviation of 0 47 considering intervals of risk magnitudes of 20 cm for the total 42 repiquetes 31 2 13 repiquetes have a risk magnitude between 0 20 and 0 40 m 28 8 12 repiquetes between 0 40 and 0 60 m and the remaining 40 0 17 repiquetes are distributed between 0 6 m y 2 4 m additionally 41 repiquetes have a risk magnitude of less than 1 4 m and only one repiquete has a risk magnitude of 2 34 m repiquete of the 2002 year fig 4 extreme values of risk magnitude of the repiquetes have been identified by referencing the mean plus one standard deviation 1 15 m repiquetes observed in the years 1998 1 28 m no 7 2000 1 4 m no 12 2002 2 34 m no 16 2008 1 29 m no 36 2010 1 35 m no 43 and 2018 1 22 m no 72 have been identified as repiquetes with extreme risk magnitude fig 3 3 2 flooding risk areas fig 5a shows the relationship between the risk magnitude of the 42 repiquetes with the potential risk of flooding croplands and the flooded area of the cropland the fitted linear relationship indicates that a mean cropland area of approximately 13 829 m2 is flooded by a repiquete with a mean risk magnitude of 0 68 m representing 8 of the total cultivation area a repiquete with a risk magnitude of 1 41 m would flood an average of 32 360 m2 of cropland representing 18 of the total agricultural area available along the riparian zone we next compared the flooded area estimated by the hydraulic simulation 62 796 m2 with the predicted flooded area for the highest risk magnitude event that occurred on 06 july 2002 the linear relationship underestimates this value by around 6824 m2 10 of the flooded area certainly the flooded area depends on the topographic gradient of the elevation range where the repiquete is developing the percentage of the area flooded by a repiquete to evaluate the flooding impact depends on the available area at the initiation of the repiquete fig 2 the flooding risk area is related to the percentiles of the peak elevation for the 42 repiquetes with risk magnitudes that potentially flood croplands the area available for crops and the frequency of the repiquetes fig 5b a negative correlation r2 0 97 between the percentile of peak elevations and the frequency of repiquetes indicates that higher values of percentiles result in lower values of frequency of the repiquetes thus referencing a low flooding risk of the riparian zone area above the elevation associated with that percentile similarly a negative correlation r2 0 99 exists between the peak elevation and the area available for rice cultivation over the percentile the area available for rice cultivation related to crop productivity is smaller for higher percentiles of peak elevation table 1 the assessment of the flooding risk associated with the frequency of occurrence of repiquetes with risk magnitude shows that the frequency of occurrence of repiquete events that could affect crops is 0 35 repiquetes per year i e one time per 3 years for terrain elevations above 85 31 masl 80th percentile of peak elevations however the area below 85 31 masl has a flooding risk of 1 47 repiquetes per year i e three times per 2 years similarly for terrain elevations above 85 91 masl 90th percentile of peak elevations the flooding risk associated with the frequency of occurrence is reduced to 0 26 repiquetes per year terrain elevations over the 87 01 masl do not present flooding risk per occurrence of repiquetes and as mentioned before these elevations represent 43 of the total available area for agriculture the flooding boundary corresponding to the 80th and 85th percentiles obtained by hydraulic modeling is shown in fig 5c 3 3 formation of repiquetes with risk magnitude to describe the formation of repiquetes with risk magnitude that potentially flood croplands at the study site a composite of vertically integrated moisture flux and precipitation anomalies was computed from the 42 events with risk magnitude that affected the area used to grow rice based on the day of a repiquete initiation at the tamshiyacu gauging station d0 high values of moisture convergence were found between the sixth and the third preceding days d 6 and d 3 to the north of 7 s this convergence was driven by the increase in an easterly moisture flux anomaly of 55 kg m s fig 6 the same days registered the maximum precipitation anomalies over the northwest sub basins of the marañón basin 3 4 evaluation of repiquetes with an extreme magnitude of risk two cases of the six repiquetes were identified with extreme flooding risk the selection was based on the high risk magnitude and long duration of repiquetes that potentially generate impacts on agricultural production in the region the repiquete observed on 06 july 2002 has the highest risk magnitude 2 34 m in the analyzed period 1996 2018 the repiquete observed on 17 june 2008 has a magnitude 1 29 m similar to the mean of the remaining five extreme repiquetes with a high risk magnitude mean risk magnitude 1 31 m the repiquetes of 06 july 2002 and 17 june 2008 are shown in table 2 and fig 7a flooded areas for the 2002 purple and 2008 oranges repiquetes are shown in figs 7b and 7c respectively the flooded areas were determined based on the non steady hydraulic simulation considering the hydrographs shown in fig 7a the 2002 extreme repiquete event had a risk magnitude of 2 34 m an average inundation width of 15 m and a duration of 42 days fig 7b the flooded area caused by this repiquete was estimated at 62 796 m2 representing 40 of the area available for agriculture at the initiation of the repiquete 157 000 m2 this repiquete event was initiated with a heavy precipitation intensity over the northern marañón pastaza sub basin and northern ucayali basins on 01 july d 5 and was reflected at the tamshiyacu gauging station on 06 july d0 the magnitude of the repiquete increased via the precipitation over the marañón basin from 02 july d 4 to 16 july d 10 precipitation exceeded the 90th percentile of the jja june august period in the northern marañón basin predominantly over the pastaza and tigre sub basins on 17 july d 11 and 18 july d 12 these precipitation events led to a peak of the repiquete observed at the tamshiyacu gauging station between 23 july d 17 and 24 july d 18 precipitation over the northern marañón basin pastaza morona santiago and nieva sub basins exceeded the 90th and 99th percentiles on july 23rd and 24th respectively these precipitation events and the one that occurred on 26 july d 20 kept the magnitude of the peak of the repiquete relatively stable for almost 2 weeks fig s1 during the days that preceded the dates of the studied repiquete the easterly vertically integrated moisture flux was higher than 250 kg m s and the convergence to the west of 74 w was intense over the northern area of the basin after the repiquete the flux was 200 kg m s the contribution of the marañón s sub basins is greater than the ucayali sub basins when considering both the mean areal daily and the accumulated precipitacion for the days before the event fig 8a and c at the beginning of the event the northern watersheds registered the maximum accumulation of rainfall although watersheds below 1500 masl within the ucayali basin also contributed in addition a major contribution by the northern watersheds was noticed during the 2002 event fig 8d on the other hand the 2008 extreme repiquete had a risk magnitude of 1 29 m d 16 and lasted 23 days the area flooded by this repiquete was estimated to be 35 800 m2 or a quarter of the area available for cropping along the riparian zone at that time 142 000 m2 the average inundation width was 9 m fig 7c and its origin was related to both the main tributary basins of the peruvian amazon river the event of 2008 was initiated on 17 june d0 at the tamshiyacu station due to a combination of precipitation over the northern ucayali basin on 10 june d 7 as well as values over the northern low marañón basin in subsequent days from 11 june d 6 to the 21 june d 4 the precipitation over the ucayali and marañón basin increased the water elevation at the tamshiyacu gauging station the accumulated precipitation in june exceeded the 95th percentile of the jja period over the marañón tigre pastaza morona santa and nieva sub basins and the northwest ucayali sub basins on 22 june d 5 and 24 june d 7 respectively fig 8b the peak of the repiquete at the tamshiyacu gauging station was observed on 02 july d 15 fig s2 these days are consistent with the moisture convergence observed to the west of 72 w along the watershed the easterly vertically integrated moisture flux with values higher than 200 250 kg m s was identified in d 6 d 1 and d 7 the peak of the 2008 repiquete could be related to a later dynamic wave due to a major precipitation contribution of the western watersheds fig 8e and f or an influence of lateral humid zones that drain into the riverbed 4 discussions the analyses of this study are based on remote sensing field measurements hydraulic simulations and climatological assessments they provide new insights into how repiquetes impact riparian croplands in the recession period of the western amazon basin here 42 of the 73 repiquetes 1996 2018 identified by figueroa et al 2020 with risk magnitudes up to 2 34 m had the potential to flood riparian agriculture here 41 of these repiquetes have a risk magnitude smaller than 1 41 m and only one exception exceeds this risk magnitude our results focused on the 42 repiquetes that complement previous studies on this region coomes et al 2016 figueroa et al 2020 list and coomes 2017 ronchail et al 2018 this prior work determined the flooding risk of riparian croplands based on terrain elevation the characterization of climatological behavior of repiquete formation and the likelihood of probable flooding impact produced by extreme repiquete events rice crops in the lower amazon region of peru departments of loreto and ucayali cover an area of 25 000 ha of silt and sand bars dia 2011 inia 2005 thus to avoid the 40 losses by farmers related to flooding in these areas the national institute of agrarian innovation inia 2007 2005 has developed the ecoarroz and jar i special rice varieties for the lowlands of the amazon basin whose main characteristic is the reduction of the vegetative period 102 105 days with a high yield 5 6 tons ha surveys carried out with farmers in tamshiyacu city n 29 reported that 52 of them used seeds of the variety esperanza and 38 were of the variety capirona developed for highland regions of the amazon basin these varieties were adapted to amazon highland soils and are resistant to pests they have a high vegetative period of 120 and 150 days and potential yields between 9 and 11 tons ha however the productivity decreases to 2 6 4 8 tons ha in low lying areas due to the difference in climates and soils condition inia 2010 2001 list and coomes 2019 importantly there are currently no government programs that provide technical assistance to farmers on seed variety selection this likely explains why this community does not use the variety and certified seeds adapted to the flooding and only 30 of farmers know about the events of repiquetes therefore selected varieties of rice seeds could be used by farmers based on a range of terrain elevations as well as the frequency of occurrence of repiquetes to reduce crop losses and obtain better productivity in this study area 43 of the riparian area available for crop establishment 83 88 masl is located between 87 and 88 masl and is considered a secure zone for cultivation because it would not be affected by repiquetes due to the low terrain gradient this riparian area could be exposed in about 2 weeks considering that the water level falls at 7 4 cm day as determined for elevations of 84 75 87 55 masl ronchail et al 2018 farmers could use this 43 area for seeding the high vegetative period as capirona variety this strategy can lead to better productivity in terms of potential yield tons ha the flooding risk by repiquetes is present in the remaining 57 of the available area flooding risk by repiquetes increases when the elevation decreases for terrain elevations between 85 31 and 87 00 masl 80th percentile of peak elevations of repiquetes the repiquete rate is once every 3 years it is better to use short vegetative period seeds of rice variety as jar i in this area similarly coomes et al 2016 studied the muyuy and panguana anabranching structures 10 km on average downstream of tamshiyacu city on terrain elevations between 112 and 116 m of relative vertical datum equivalent to 82 77 86 77 masl based on egm08 these areas were used as cultivation rice areas and they found a lower probability of flooding by the repiquete for elevations above 114 m 84 77 masl the elevations farmers use in muyuy anabranching are lower than those determined in tamshiyacu city decreasing from upstream to downstream this implies that farmers consider the hydraulic gradient of the amazon river to select agricultural areas consequently the flooding risk by repiquetes based on percentiles could be extrapolated through 30 km downstream before the iquitos gauging station and 30 km upstream there is no important tributary in this area for this extrapolation one must consider the hydraulic gradient of the amazon river at this reach of 0 00004 m m for example 85 31 masl 80th percentile at the tamshiyacu gauging station would be 84 11 masl 30 km downstream due to the decrease in water level at this hydraulic gradient to extrapolate to a large reach i e tabatinga gauging station in brazil at 508 km downstream of tamshiyacu gauging station one must use intermediate gauging stations and evaluate the tributaries in the reach e g napo river ampiyacu river atacuari river loretoyacu river similarly one must use a hydrological distributed model for large basins such as the mgb model i e evaluating the wave propagation of the hydrograph over a large scale between tamshiyacu and tabatinga gauging stations representing repiquetes events collischonn et al 2007 pontes et al 2017 wongchuig correa et al 2017 zubieta et al 2015 risk magnitudes of repiquetes smaller than 0 60 m are common in the study area 25 of 42 repiquetes the linear regression between the risk magnitude and the flooded area identified here indicates that the agricultural areas flooded by repiquetes with risk magnitudes of 0 40 m and 0 60 m are 4 and 7 respectively of the total available area the occurrence of several independent repiquetes events with a small risk magnitude in a single year can be as significant as an extreme repiquete event for instance in 2013 four independent repiquetes events with risk magnitude were identified the total sum of the magnitudes of each repiquetes event that occurred on 16 july 0 62 m 22 august 0 88 m 04 september 0 56 m and 26 september 0 56 m 2013 was 2 62 m which exceeded in terms of magnitude the highest extreme repiquete event of 2 34 m the sum of the percentages of the flooded area by each repiquete could rise to 35 of the total available area however to estimate the actual crop losses by the occurrence of repiquetes one must analyze these events individually considering the available area at initiating the repiquete the formation of repiquetes with the risk magnitude analyzed here is associated with high moisture transport and precipitation values over the northwestern andes amazon sub basins of the marañón basin until 6 days before the initiation of the repiquetes these results agree with figueroa et al 2020 and ronchail et al 2018 during the days that preceded the dates of the studied repiquete the easterly vertically integrated moisture flux was higher than 250 200 kg m s and the convergence to the west of 74 w was intense over the northern area of the basin after the repiquete the flux was 200 kg m s northeasterly and southeasterly fluxes are predominant climatological characteristics for the lower and mid levels of the study region during jja poveda et al 2014 trachte 2018 anomalies of the moisture flux convergence are around 50 kg m s during these days which could increase the equivalent potential temperature at low levels and eventually trigger convection wright et al 2017 generally the mesoscale convective systems mcss formed in the andes amazon transition regions of peru and ecuador campozano et al 2018 migrate towards the lowland forest and those that form between the northern area of peru brazil and colombia migrate to the west or southwest during jja rehbein et al 2018 versus the 2008 repiquete the high magnitude and duration of the 2002 repiquete were probably induced by the higher precipitation distributed over the region that held over in the northern marañón basin however these case studies of repiquetes with extreme risk magnitudes show the importance of the northern ucayali basin where a regional precipitation hotspot is located between 8 and 9 5 s and to the east of 74 w fig 8 this part of the basin also influences the initiation and the peak of the repiquetes with extreme risk magnitudes this finding is particularly important considering the nature of precipitation during extreme repiquetes including large convective zones over the peruvian amazon lowland and orographic forced precipitation as documented by figueroa et al 2020 what modulates the high precipitation events that occur successively and thus amplify the characteristics of the repiquetes the answer to this question is mainly limited by the lack of measurement of environmental variables in the vertical of the region that could be contrasted and thus improve the outputs provided by models for example there are no radiosonde records in the entire study area and towards 3 n zhou et al 2021 overall high values of moisture convergence induced by an increase of anomaly moisture flux and precipitations over the northern marañón and ucayali basins were the principal characteristics that defined the initiation and the risk magnitude of repiquetes this spatial pattern of rainfall anomalies agrees well with the propagation of the convective core of the mjo in western tropical south america that is characterized by positive rainfall anomalies in the northern marañón and ucayali basins particularly during the phases 8 1 of mjo according to fig 3 in recalde coronel et al 2020 similar to what was proposed by previous studies the use of ensemble forecasts that feed calibrated hydrological models seems to be one of the best alternatives it can be complemented with recent data based models in addition the atmospheric patterns defined in this study for repiquetes with risk magnitude could help forecast repiquetes 6 days before the water level starts to rise at the tamshiyacu gauging station these days can be used to warn farmers of potential floods and prevent the loss of seeds since farmers sow as the river s water level decreases an increase in water level could remove the seeds and carry them downstream hydraulic simulations showed that for the 2002 2 34 m of risk magnitude and 2008 1 29 m of risk magnitude repiquetes probably flooded 40 estimated in 25 tons of rice and 25 16 tons of rice of the available cultivation area at the initiation of repiquete respectively a previous study list and coomes 2017 based on repiquetes registered at the iquitos gauging station determined that the repiquete of 2002 would have flooded between 88 and 52 of silt bars in the muyuy anabranching structure downstream of tamshiyacu city the 2013 shortfalls had different hazards considering repiquete between the most important this was estimated at 3 7 tons per farmer the difference in flooding impacts by repiquetes between list and coomes 2017 and this study could be related to the topographic gradient of floodplain elevations and the influence of precipitation over the itaya river subbasin that influences the magnitude of repiquetes in the iquitos gaging station itaya river the positive and negative trends of dry days frequency in the southern and northern amazon basins respectively espinoza et al 2016 langenbrunner et al 2019 wongchuig correa et al 2017 and projections of increment in precipitation over the northwestern amazon basin sorribas et al 2016 zulkafli et al 2016 could affect the frequency of repiquete events however deforestation in the amazon influences rainfall reduction over the basin sierra et al 2022 staal et al 2020 thus affecting the role of forest transpiration that produces around one third of amazon rainfall staal et al 2018 similarly deforestation could affect the shallow convection produced by forests that moisten and destabilize the atmosphere before the arrival of the intertropical convergence zone itcz wright et al 2017 prior work ronchail et al 2018 indicated probably better conditions for riparian agriculture based on the positive trend of the low water period and the negative trend of low water level espinoza et al 2011 lavado casimiro et al 2012 wongchuig correa et al 2017 which would increase the available area for agriculture when the water level starts to drop however it is still unclear how future changes in climate variability could affect the occurrence of repiquetes this unsolved question could be answered in future research flooded extent areas by repiquetes were estimated using the 1d hec ras model instead of the 2d hec ras version considering the facility of application the reduced time simulation the morphology of the amazon river reach straight reach without complex morphological structures and the hydrographs of repiquetes less than the extreme flows similar results of flood extent in floodplains are obtained between the 1d and 2d models alzahrani 2017 horritt and bates 2002 considering the extension of the floodplains and the limitations of the model version however due to the complex meandering of other reaches of the amazon river one must evaluate the application of the 2d model trigg et al 2009 to simulate repiquete events a limitation to extrapolating this study s findings is that the flooded area results are subject to the topography of the cultivation area and their changes throughout the length of the amazon river additional topography studies are needed to replicate this study in another river area however considering the hydraulic gradient the flooded risk associated with water level and peak elevations of repiquetes can be used in another part of the amazon river to apply this methodology in another river such as the ucayali river one must also obtain daily water level time series and grid precipitation data 5 conclusions this study investigates the flooding risk of croplands produced by reversal water levels known as repiquetes in the peruvian tamshiyacu gauging station in the western amazon basin field survey data satellite based data statistical analysis hydraulic simulations and atmospheric assessments were used to understand the risk of repiquete flooding the results indicate that floodplain agriculture areas located between 83 and 88 masl in our studied region are impacted by the occurrence of repiquetes at 1 8 events per year on average 1996 2018 however the flooding risk is particularly high for the low elevation range below 85 31 masl thus percentiles of peak elevations of repiquetes have been determined in floodplain areas while terrain elevations between 85 31 and 87 00 masl have a reduced flooding risk of 0 35 per year elevations between 87 00 and 88 00 masl corresponding to 43 of the total area are unaffected by repiquetes extreme repiquetes that occurred in 2002 and 2008 are analyzed in more detail in this study these extreme events could seriously affect farmland by flooding up to 40 of the available area at the initiation of the event for up to 42 days extreme events are primarily related to high precipitation rates over the northern marañón basin including the andes amazon transition zone and the northern ucayali basin changes in the low level wind circulations intensify the atmospheric moisture flux and its convergence over these regions producing extreme precipitations through the six previous days these results could be a tool for farmers in the region to select seed rice varieties short or large vegetative period as a function of the terrain elevation and the potential risk of flooding by repiquetes identified in this study considering that 43 of the area is unaffected by flooding repiquetes farmers could use large vegetative period seeds in this area to improve productivity in addition farmers could be trained to identify flood risk zones on the ground while the water level is falling thus referencing the water level measured at the gauging station therefore disseminating and communicating these findings to the local farming community is a key challenge for the scientific community to consider the study was limited by a lack of information on daily water levels and the low density of gauging stations in the western amazon basin there were also challenges in obtaining terrain elevation with high accuracy due to poor accessibility in addition the relationship between repiquetes and climatological forcing brings up the question of how climatic change will affect these repiquetes events which is currently unclear finally overcoming these limitations could help to establish an early warning system based on remote sensing precipitation and real time gauging stations that identify repiquetes before they reach the agricultural floodplains credit authorship contribution statement jonathan valenzuela conceptualization

7693,study region tai lake the third largest freshwater lake in china with a history of serious ecological pollution incidents study focus lake water quality prediction techniques are essential to ensure an early emergency response capability for sustainable water management herein an effective data driven ensemble model was developed for predicting lake dissolved oxygen do based on meteorological factors water quality indicators and spatial information first variation mode decomposition vmd was used to decompose data into multiple modal components and classify them into feature terms and self terms the feature terms were combined with relevant external features for multivariate prediction by convolutional neural network cnn and a bi directional long and short term memory bilstm with attention mechanism at as well as using the whale optimization algorithm woa to optimize the model hyperparameters the self terms form a secondary modal decomposition model finally the groupings were linearly summed to obtain outcome new hydrological insights for the region the proposed model has the highest prediction accuracy in tai lake as well as the best prediction effect using 0 5 days as the period this research also establishes a stepwise water temperature regulation mechanism where the output of the target do content value is achieved by changing the magnitude of water temperature and combining it with this prediction model thereby strengthening the protection of water resources and the management of fishery production graphical abstract ga1 keywords attention mechanism bi directional long short term memory deep learning improved whale optimization algorithm variational modal decomposition water quality prediction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is the necessary material basis for human survival and social development making it necessarily important to improve the monitoring and prediction ability of water quality wang et al 2022b due to the great differences in the distribution of water resources in time and space coupled with the vulnerability of the water quality to the interference of various external factors such as hydrometeorology and human activities the nonlinear and non stationary characteristics of water quality changes can be observed chen and xue 2023 therefore accurate prediction of water quality has become a challenging task de paul obade and moore 2018 destandau and zaiter 2020 secondly previous studies focused more on the change of dynamic river water quality but less on the relatively static lake water quality kachroud et al 2019 however with the increasing population the development of urbanization and industrialization has caused more and more serious pollution problems to nearby lakes and other surface water sources bhateria and jain 2016 chen et al 2023 in particular these lakes assume important functions such as drinking water source and aquaculture accurate prediction of these lakes will contribute to the rational planning and management of water resources as well as the establishment of a timely warning mechanism for water quality salerno et al 2018 in addition the controllable and adjustable water quality is a natural extension of the development of water quality prediction research which can make timely correction and compensation for the existing potential pollution in this case it may be of great value to whether manually adjust the external factors of the established lake water quality model so as to make the water quality change more beneficial w li et al 2022 l li et al 2022 chen et al 2022 the lake water quality can be evaluated by various parameters such as dissolved oxygen do water temperature wt conductivity turbidity total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and ph value among which do can not only be used as an indicator to reflect the water quality of the lake but also directly affects the related output level of agriculture and fishery at present the prediction method of the do content is mainly through water quality parameter modeling and the prediction model based on artificial intelligence ai wai et al 2022 rajaee et al 2020 the modeling of water quality parameters is often combined with some physical laws about water quality and is thus called physically driven models the physical model uses the physical mechanism of the internal movement of water flow to calculate the change trend of pollutants in time and space common lake water quality modeling includes through gis post et al 2018 vollenweider model magar and khatry 2017 kirchner dillon model rong et al 2019 three dimensional 3d hydrodynamic and ecosystem model zamani et al 2018 wasp wool et al 2020 and other methods given that the mechanism models for lake water quality prediction are usually built on the basis of understanding physical processes and factors the advantage of mechanism models is the strict physical explanations of their parameters hildebrandt et al 2020 however in the water quality prediction calculation many reaction mechanisms cannot be quantitatively described by certain formulas read et al 2019 in addition a large amount of water quality data should be collected from the field for the physically driven model to analyze the data features and determine the model parameters although this method can provide high precision data it is a work with high labor and high cost and it is impossible to obtain the water quality data with full coverage of the lake in the whole cycle due to the limitations of climate environment and other realistic factors thereby exposing the modeling process to the constraints of realistic conditions varadharajan et al 2022 regarding water quality prediction there are not only physically driven modeling prediction models but also data driven models the data driven model mainly applies artificial intelligence related prediction models to predict water quality data in recent years the prediction of the do content based on ai has received increasing attention this is a robust calculation algorithm that can be used to simulate complex nonlinear relationships when there is no explicit formal relationship between variables ai models are mainly divided into machine learning methods and deep learning methods compared to physically driven models data driven models may be an effective tool to overcome these limitations data driven models can handle nonlinear and high randomness predictions through dynamic adaptive correction of model elements effectively reducing the workload of modelers in addition unlike physically driven models data driven models only focus on input output relationships without considering causal relationships between parameters which can facilitate the modeling process for environmental managers therefore data driven models may to some extent replace physically driven models and be accepted as effective tools for future water quality prediction the machine learning model does not need to consider the complexity of the hydrological system so the attention can only be paid to the information contained in the data itself moreover it does not need a large number of hydrological and water quality data for modeling support further reducing the complexity of the model meanwhile machine learning model is broadly used in the field of water quality prediction with its advantages of easy realization easy understanding and mature theory common machine learning models include support vector machines svm li et al 2017 random forests rf jasmin et al 2022 extreme gradient boosting xgboost wu et al 2021b extreme learning machine elm yaqub and lee 2022 and multi layer perceptron mlp zhu and heddam 2020 however most of the learning mechanisms of machine learning models are shallow learning and the ability to capture the hidden information in the long time series in the problem of time series prediction is restricted xu et al 2021 making the effect of machine learning model in the field of long time series prediction not ideal enough especially for nonlinear and non stationary water quality change prediction to solve the deficiencies of these methods researchers have turned their attention to the deep learning model driven by data which also has strong learning ability and adaptability and performs excellently in time series prediction and other fields wang et al 2021 s zhu et al 2021 n zhu et al 2021 wu et al 2021a minaee et al 2021 guo and wang 2022 wu et al 2022 xu et al 2023a b zhou et al 2023 common deep learning models include long and short term memory lstm chen et al 2021 wu and wang 2022 wang et al 2022a bi directional long short term memory bilstm s zhu et al 2021 n zhu et al 2021 yang et al 2023 gated recurrent unit gru guo et al 2022 temporal convolutional network tcn fu et al 2021 convolutional neural network cnn li and zhang 2022 and other commonly used models in addition a combination model of deep learning has been developed for example barzegar et al 2020 developed lstm and cnn models as well as their hybrid model i e the cnn lstm model to predict do concentration the experimental results show that by integrating lstm and cnn models the mixed model successfully captures the low and high levels of water quality variables and has better prediction ability w li et al 2022 l li et al 2022 extracted the characteristics of the sequence in the time dimension using lstm and then combined it with tcn to establish the fusion prediction model of lstm tcn the experimental results prove the high accuracy of the combined method in do prediction as well as its efficiency in better grasping the features of historical data with the increase of the time window of historical do sequence due to the interaction between do in the spatiotemporal dimension it is necessary to consider the interaction between adjacent sites of do data therefore some studies have introduced relevant factors such as do data at adjacent sites as features to obtain interactive spatiotemporal relationships between multiple sites which can compensate for the shortcomings of single site research fukushima et al 2019 jasmin et al 2022 considered 17 meteorological factors and used three kinds of feature selection techniques to establish different datasets for model development resulting in excellent prediction results in addition deep learning models are usually combined with attention mechanism at which learns the weight distribution between spatiotemporal features of multi site interactions through local attention mechanism to improve prediction performance cao et al 2021 li et al 2023 for example liu et al 2019 applied an attention based recurrent neural network rnn method to capture temporal relationships while learning spatiotemporal relationships and applied it to the prediction of dissolved oxygen the experimental results indicate that attention based rnn can achieve more accurate do prediction in both short term and long term predictions therefore introducing multi site related factors and attention mechanisms will play an important role in extracting water quality features it is worth mentioning that the neural network model has a large number of parameters and there is no strict standard for the selection of various parameters of the neural network researchers generally select parameters through experience and usually fail to obtain the best parameters but the development of intelligent algorithms provides researchers with new methods to solve this problem researchers combine neural network models with intelligent algorithms to find the optimal parameters zhou et al in press for instance yang and liu 2022 predicted the do content in water using gru in order to determine the best parameters of the model whale optimization algorithm woa was used to optimize the parameters of the neural network the experimental results showed that the prediction effect of the gru model optimized by woa was better than that of the gru model therefore the deep learning model established after using optimization algorithm to optimize the parameters is more objective and reasonable effectively eliminating the influence of subjective preferences and bringing more accurate prediction results do content data are a kind of complex time series data the periodicity noise and randomness in the data may reduce the prediction accuracy of the neural network in view of the above problems some decomposition methods will be used to process the data and then neural network will be used to predict wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 liu et al 2016 common methods include wavelet decomposition wt xu et al 2021 empirical mode decomposition emd liang et al 2019 variational mode decomposition vmd song et al 2021 and complete set empirical mode decomposition ceemdan song and yao 2022 etc among the above methods vmd has a good effect in processing the original data set and can extract the features in nonlinear and non stationary data and ceemdan can effectively capture the spectral features of high frequency signals therefore the combination of these two is bound to improve the effect of modal decomposition mining information the interaction between lake do and external characteristics such as meteorological factors and other water quality indicators may lead to the randomness and complexity of do noori et al 2020 the selection and extraction of external features have an important impact on its accurate prediction in addition the do content will have a certain periodicity with the change of time and will present a nonlinear and non stationary trend due to the influence of many factors from the perspective of modeling the application of the lstm or the bilstm model alone will introduce noise that has nothing to do with water quality prediction and will also be affected by the maximum and minimum values in time series data although using the cnn model alone can extract local features of water quality better it is not sensitive to the time sequence of water quality information therefore to improve the effect of water quality prediction the fusion of cnn and bilstm called cnn bilstm model makes the best use of cnn s feature extraction ability and the sensitivity of bilstm to time series data inspired by the above research a combined model is hereby proposed based on external features quadratic decomposition intelligent optimization algorithm attention mechanism and cnn bilstm according to the characteristics of lake do content data the prediction process of decomposition grouping prediction adding result is designed and the model is woa cvmd cbilstm at f in this study do data are first decomposed by vmd and divided into feature items and self items according to the correlation between each component and external characteristics both feature items and self items adopt the combined forecasting model meanwhile at is added to the cnn bilstm model and the parameters are adjusted by woa to form the combined prediction model of woa cbilstm at the feature item needs to be combined with relevant external features to carry out multivariate prediction the prediction model is woa vmd cbilstm at f the self terms are decomposed twice by ceemdan and the prediction model is woa cvmd cbilstm at finally the above results are linearly added to yield the final prediction result the innovation points of this study include 1 this research combines external characteristics to predict the do content and the selection of characteristics is multi dimensional taking into account the spatial characteristics meteorological factors and water quality indicators 2 the vmd is changed and the super parameters of the model are determined using the central frequency method and the external characteristic correlation coefficient in addition the results of vmd decomposition in this study are divided into feature items and self items and the self items need to be decomposed twice through ceemdan 3 the proposed prediction model in this study integrates a variety of deep learning models and automatically adjusts parameters to overcome the randomness of subjective selection using the intelligent optimization algorithm 4 based on the woa cvmd cbilstm at f model a stepwise water temperature regulation mechanism is established to regulate the output of do content and realize the controllable and adjustable change of water quality 5 this study studies the prediction ability of the model in advance of multiple periods to judge the early warning ability of the model in a longer period taking into account the extremely short term 1 day short term 1 3 days and long term 7 28 days respectively 2 models and methods 2 1 whale optimization algorithm woa mirjalili and lewis 2016 proposed the woa a meta heuristic optimization algorithm that simulates the hunting behavior of humpback whales which has the characteristics of fast optimization speed strong global convergence and few parameters woa is usually used in the deep learning model to adjust the hyperparameter of the model so as to improve the performance of the deep learning model a detailed description of woa can be found in supplementary note 1 1 2 2 bi directional long short term memory bilstm 2 2 1 long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1996 proposed the artificial neural network for lstm given that it can obtain long term feature information it is usually used to process and predict events with long intervals and delays in time series gers et al 2001 wang et al 2023 wu et al 2023a in addition it also effectively solves the problems of long term dependence gradient disappearance and gradient explosion of rnn neural network ye et al 2019 cui et al 2023 the specific formulas and descriptions of the lstm model are given in supplementary note 1 2 2 2 2 bi directional long short term memory bilstm the lstm method can only process the forward information of data to obtain prediction results while the bilstm method can obtain prediction results through the forward and backward information neural network since the bilstm method comprehensively considers the positive and negative information rules of time series data the prediction accuracy of the bilstm model may be higher than that of lstm lee et al 2019 through its independent hidden layer past and future information can be captured at specific time steps zhao et al 2017 wu et al 2023b bisltm is composed of two lstm layers with the same number of neurons first the forward data are input into the forward lstm layer to obtain the output of the forward lstm layer then the data are input into the reverse lstm layer to obtain the reverse output finally the forward lstm layer output and the reverse lstm layer result are linearly superimposed according to a certain weight to obtain the eventual output result the detailed formulas and illustrations of the bilstm model are given in supplementary note 1 3 2 3 attention mechanism at in principle the attention mechanism is equivalent to the optional visual attention mechanism of the brain in the do content data series the importance of data at each time point is different the attention mechanism layer is added to strengthen the attention to the important short term characteristics of the input time series data after assigning appropriate weight coefficients to the input data hidden vector features can be obtained each time and then input into the model layer for learning training and prediction its calculation is shown in formulas 1 3 the core idea of the attention mechanism is to properly allocate the attention of each input information so that different weights can be assigned to the state of the hidden layer in the neural network besides its most prominent functions are to focus on the impact of important information on results diminish the loss of information and enhance the impact of key information zhan et al 2019 fuentealba et al 2019 tian et al 2018 1 e t utanh w h t b 2 a t exp e t j 1 t e t 3 s t t 1 n a t h t where e t denotes the distribution value of attention u and w the attention weight b the offset h t the state value of the hidden layer a t different weight values of each channel information in the model layer and s t the weighting result of the weight matrix and the output of the model layer 2 4 convolution neural network cnn herein cnn similar to the traditional neural network model is used to extract features from input data sets where there are different connections between neurons and their internal layers lecun et al 2015 the composition of the cnn model is shown in supplementary note 1 4 the prediction of the do content is a typical time series problem but it also has certain particularity considering the impact of the spatial characteristics on the do content of the reservoir the do content data of adjacent stations are hereby included in the reference characteristics in addition this research also considers the characteristics of meteorological factors and water quality indicators that is a multi dimensional feature is constructed the cnn convolution part of this study uses the conv2d structure to extract features and then extracts features in multi site and multi feature space using cnn afterwards the maximum pooling layer takes the characteristic matrix calculated by the convolution layer as the input uses the pooling window to slide on the matrix sequence takes the maximum value of the window for pooling each time and outputs a more expressive characteristic matrix finally the results are further processed through the full connection layer and the final results are output 2 5 hybrid cbilstm at model in this study cnn and bilstm form the cnn bilstm model cbilstm while cbilstm and at form the cbilstm at model the model is used for feature extraction to predict the do content and the cnn layer is used to extract multidimensional features to prevent the model from over fitting the dropout layer is hereby introduced between the cnn layer and the bilstm layer during model training the dropout layer will randomly disable the weights of some hidden layer nodes of the network temporarily to simplify the network model the bilstm layer is used to integrate the features collected on the input and then adopted for the prediction after the bilstm layer there comes the at layer which improves the prediction effect by learning the weight distribution between multi dimensional features eventually the prediction results of do content are output through the dense layer 2 6 complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise ceemdan torres et al 2011 proposed ceemdan which obtains intrinsic mode function imf by adding adaptive white noise and calculating the unique signal residual overcoming the shortcomings of emd and ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd ceemdan not only solves the problems of emd and eemd mode stacking as well as noise residues but also diminishes the reconstruction error by increasing the time of decomposition zhang et al 2022 predicted the water quality data using ceemdan and neural network models and the prediction results are relatively accurate the principles and formulas related to ceemdan can be found in the supplementary note 1 5 2 7 variational mode decomposition vmd dragomiretskiy and zosso 2013 proposed the vmd method which abandons the recursive filtering process of modal components in emd and redefines the imf as the amplitude frequency modulation signal at the same time vmd is a new adaptive decomposition method the constrained model is used to find the optimal solution and the original signal is decomposed into multiple decomposition components to obtain a series of imfs huang et al 2019 the relevant formulas and principles of vmd can be found in supplementary note 1 6 2 8 ceemdan vmd cvmd model do content data are decomposed by vmd and the imf obtained is divided into feature items and its own items according to the correlation coefficient with external characteristics feature items have a strong correlation with some external characteristics the numerical range is shown in table s2 and need to be combined with external characteristics to carry out multivariate prediction self items have no strong correlation with all external factors and can only be predicted through their own historical data as input the imf which belongs to its own item needs to be further decomposed and forecast through the ceemdan model 2 9 woa cvmd cbilstm at f model herein the woa cvmd cbilstm at f model is proposed where f represents the abbreviation of feature as shown in fig 1 the proposed prediction model is mainly divided into three stages i e the decomposition stage the group prediction stage and the addition stage first in the decomposition stage the do content data are decomposed into modal components with different frequencies using the vmd method and the appropriate super parameters are determined using the central frequency method according to their correlation coefficient with external factors after that the imf decomposed above is divided into feature items and its own items based on the presence of a strong correlation with external features then in the group prediction stage the basic model of both self items and feature items is woa vmd cbilstm at the role of woa is to automatically adjust the parameters related to the prediction model to enhance the prediction accuracy of the model the difference between the two is that the self terms will be further decomposed by ceemdan for the prediction while the feature terms are combined with strong correlation external features to carry out multivariate prediction additionally it is worth mentioning that this study also aims at exploring a water temperature regulation mechanism so the feature items can also be divided into water temperature feature items and other feature items as shown in fig 2 considering the large imf value with the lowest frequency its fluctuation has a great impact on the prediction results thus the lowest matching component is hereby treated as the characteristic term of water temperature the water temperature feature item filters features by setting the absolute value of the correlation coefficient between the imf and water temperature as a threshold while other feature items filter features by setting 0 6 as a threshold in addition the correlation coefficient between water temperature and characteristic term is often rather strong therefore if it is used as the threshold for screening features less external features will often be obtained thus making the model more sensitive to water temperature and facilitate subsequent water temperature regulation finally the addition stage is to add the prediction results of each component linearly to obtain the final prediction value 2 10 model performance indicators in this study four indicators namely mean absolute percentage error mape mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and r 2 are used to reveal the effect of the prediction method the relevant formulas and introduction of accuracy evaluation can be found in supplementary note 1 7 in order to more intuitively show the improvement of the prediction accuracy of the model proposed in this paper compared with other benchmark models the improvement rate of

referred to table s3 these six stations are located in six different cities in the tai lake basin so this study can predict the water quality of the tai lake from multiple directions in this study the dissolved oxygen data of xintang port station 119 5 n 32 0 e and changji bridge station 119 5 n 31 8 e located in the tai lake basin from november 1 2020 to february 28 2023 were selected as the research data in addition this study also continued to predict the other four stations in the tai lake basin and the results are presented in the supplementary note 2 1 see fig s6 for the relevant site map during this period each station will conduct observation every 4 h so 6 do observation data will be recorded every day in addition to the missing values in the dataset there are 5095 data in each site in this study the training set and test set of the model are constructed according to the 7 3 ratio of the data set as shown in fig s7 3 2 feature selection this study proposes a do content prediction model combining multi dimensional characteristics and selects external factors related to dissolved oxygen from three aspects namely water quality indicators meteorological factors and spatial characteristics this study combines external features from multiple dimensions which enables water quality prediction to consider multiple impacts in addition data driven models only focus on input and output relationships without considering causal relationships between parameters which can bring convenience to the subsequent modeling process many studies have confirmed that do content is related to water temperature and other characteristics of water while water quality index can represent the physical chemical and biological characteristics of water such as water temperature ph turbidity various ions etc najah et al 2011 antonopoulos and gianniou 2003 this research selects water temperature as the characteristic water quality indicator for the study the dissolved oxygen content is inversely proportional to the temperature of water that is when the water temperature is high the dissolved oxygen content is low in addition some studies have shown that dissolved oxygen is closely related to oxygen partial pressure atmospheric pressure temperature and other factors in the air so this study selects some relevant meteorological factors căluşaru constantin et al 2014 harvey et al 2011 there are two main meteorological factors that affect do the first is temperature such as air temperature surface temperature and dew point temperature the second is atmospheric pressure such as sea level pressure and ground pressure the above analysis analyzed the impact of water temperature on do content while surface water temperature is directly affected by temperature for air pressure the higher the pressure the higher the partial pressure of oxygen in the air and the higher the dissolution rate of do leading to an increase in do content based on the fluidity of the water circulation system there is a spatiotemporal linkage between the do content of the site and that of adjacent sites if the do content of adjacent sites is used as a feature it helps to analyze the spatiotemporal changes of the current site in addition the data of multiple city stations are combined to cover the whole area from point to point and the do data of the whole the tai lake basin is considered more comprehensively therefore the dissolved oxygen data of other stations in the same period in the tai lake basin are also taken as characteristics xintang port station changji bridge station and the other four stations are located in the tai lake basin and their geographical locations are very close so the do content of adjacent stations can be used as the spatial characteristic indicators in this study pearson correlation coefficient is used for model feature selection a strong correlation is observed when the absolute value of correlation coefficient is greater than or equal to 0 6 therefore 0 6 is hereby used as the threshold to screen the characteristics with strong correlation with the do and the final results are shown in table 1 besides it can be seen from fig 3 that the do content of xintang port station has a strong negative correlation with the surface temperature as well as a strong negative correlation with the water temperature air temperature and dew point temperature in addition it also has a strong positive correlation with sea level pressure ground pressure and the do content of nearby stations in the data set of changji bridge station its do content has a strong negative correlation with air temperature surface temperature and dew point temperature a strong negative correlation with water temperature also a strong positive correlation with sea level pressure ground pressure and the do content of nearby stations based on the above research the prediction model proposed in this article takes dissolved oxygen content and external characteristic variables including water temperature sea level pressure surface pressure air temperature surface temperature dew point temperature and dissolved oxygen content of adjacent sites as input variables and outputs do prediction values 3 3 results of cvmd decomposition the decomposition result of vmd is shown in fig 4 xintang port data set decomposes three imf and one residual res and the changji bridge dataset is the same it can be seen from table 2 that when the number of decompositions in xintang port data set is k 3 the central frequency of the last two imf and the central frequency of the last two imf with k 4 are very close with a difference of less than 0 01 in addition combined with fig 5 it can be found that when k 3 the imf does not have aliasing when the decomposition is the best when k 4 there is over decomposition similarly in the changji bridge site data set the decomposition is the best when k 3 in combination with fig 6a in xintang port data set the strong correlation of imf 1 imf 2 and imf 3 with external features can be observed and their correlation with features is even higher than that of original data and features similarly from fig 6b this feature is also reflected in the changji bridge data set besides both from the perspective of central frequency and that of feature correlation the results obtained by vmd are ideal according to the above vmd results and their correlation coefficient with external characteristics this paper will use the imf 1 imf 2 and imf 3 as the feature items in the xintang port station dataset imf 1 is the feature item of water temperature while imf 4 and res work as the self items in the changji bridge station dataset imf 1 and imf 2 work as the feature items imf 1 is the feature item of water temperature and imf 3 and res work as the self items the self items will be further decomposed through ceemdan as shown in fig 7 the imf 4 of xintang port dataset is decomposed 8 times and its res is decomposed 11 times the imf 3 of changji bridge dataset is decomposed 9 times and its res is decomposed 11 times meanwhile for feature items the threshold of correlation coefficient is hereby set for feature selection and the features selected for the feature items of each site are shown in table 3 3 4 prediction result of dissolved oxygen content to compare the prediction performance of the model in this study 8 other deep learning models are also used to predict the dissolved oxygen content the prediction results are shown in fig 8 and the prediction accuracy results are shown in table 4 the back propagation neural network model bp has the lowest prediction accuracy among all models lstm bilstm bilstm at and cbilstm at models are all non decomposed prediction models and the prediction accuracy of the cbilstm at model is the highest vmd cbilstm at adds vmd decomposition on the basis of cbilstm at model which not only improves the prediction accuracy but also divides the data into their own items and feature items for future research vmd cbilstm at f combines feature items with external features to carry out multivariate prediction not only improving the prediction accuracy but also excavating the relationship between dissolved oxygen data and external features the cvmd cbilstm at f model performs ceemdan processing on its own terms the results in table 4 indicate its improvement of the prediction accuracy finally based on the above model the proposed woa cvmd cbilstm at f model adjusts the parameters of the model parameters using woa further improving the prediction accuracy back propagation neural network bp is a very common model and its prediction accuracy is also the lowest of all models so it is regarded as the reference model of p mape p mae and p rmse indicators as shown in fig 9 the accuracy of lstm bilstm and bilstm at models is only slightly higher than that of bp and the improvement rate is within 20 the improvement rate of the bilstm at model is the largest among the three models with each accuracy index improved by about 20 cbilstm at is based on the bilstm at model the accuracy index of which is slightly improved and the improvement rate is increased to about 30 besides the improvement rate of the vmd cbilstm at model has been greatly improved since the beginning the average improvement rate of the three indicators of this model in xintang port data center is 57 which is more than twice the cbilstm at model on the basis of vmd cbilstm at the vmd cbilstm at f model is slightly improved and achieves an improvement rate of about 2 based on which the cvmd cbilstm at f model has been greatly improved and the model has been greatly improved in xintang port data set with an improvement rate of about 5 finally the woa cvmd cbilstm at f model is considered the most improved of all models and its improvement rate in both data sets is about 80 in addition the methods of linear fitting diagram and taylor diagram are also used to compare the prediction effects of each model from different angles as shown in fig 10 the scatter distribution of the predicted and observed values of the woa cvmd cbilstm at f model proposed in this study is relatively regular the slope of its fitting curve is the closest to 1 and the number of discrete points where the predicted value falls within the 95 confidence interval is also the largest fully proving the best prediction performance of woa cvmd cbilstm at f model as shown in fig 11 the star scattering in the taylor diagram represents each method the radiation line represents the correlation coefficient the horizontal and vertical axis represents the standard deviation and the dotted line represents the root mean square error additionally it is worth mentioning that the central position presenting the horizontal axis is the position with the best prediction accuracy from fig 11 it can be observed that the woa cvmd cbilstm at f model has the best prediction performance because it is the best location closest to the taylor chart 4 discussion 4 1 multivariable prediction the above experiments prove the good prediction performance of the cbilstm at model for dissolved oxygen without decomposition therefore this study will continue to use this model and carry out multivariate prediction by combining the external characteristic factors of the do herein the above selected features are further screened and the absolute value of their correlation coefficient with the do content of the site is taken as the threshold value which is 0 70 0 75 0 80 and 0 85 respectively the results in table 5 show that the prediction accuracy will not be improved when the model is used for multivariate prediction it is also noteworthy that when the threshold is set to 0 85 the prediction effect is relatively best and the number of features is also the minimum based on the above experiments this study allows the cbilstm at model to predict only one single feature at a time the results in table 6 show that the prediction accuracy of the model will be improved by combining single features p mape p mae and p rmse in the fig 12 take the cbilstm at model multivariate prediction in section 3 4 as the reference model it can be seen from fig 12a that the accuracy improvement of feature 1 is the largest in xintang port station which can be improved by about 8 while from fig 12b indicates that the accuracy improvement of xinfeng town is the largest in changji bridge station which can be improved by about 10 in addition it can be concluded by combining the correlation between these features and do content data that the characteristics with strong correlation have a large improvement range such as feature 1 similarly combined with the relatively low correlation the accuracy improvement is also low indicating its positive correlation with the characteristic correlation coefficient absolute value although the above multivariable experiments show that cbilstm at model combined with external features can improve the prediction accuracy of the model its defects are also obvious because only combining a single feature or a small number of features can achieve ideal prediction accuracy however the decomposition method and feature selection method proposed in section 3 3 can be combined with multiple features for the prediction and the effect of accuracy improvement is also significant 4 2 periodic research in order to better explore the performance of the proposed prediction model the influence of prediction period on prediction accuracy is also taken into consideration in this paper the prediction cycle is considered in terms of extremely short term short term and long term the time steps of 1 6 day 1 3 day and 1 2 day are selected for the extremely short time period while those of 1 day 2 days and 3 days are selected for the short time period and those of 7 days 14 days and 28 days are selected for the long time period as shown in table 7 when the period is 1 2 day the prediction accuracy of both stations is the highest if the precision data with a period of 1 day are taken as a reference changing the period to 1 2 day can increase mape by 23 28 mae by 23 25 and rmse by 17 09 in xintang port data set while in the changji bridge data set mape can be increased by 6 49 mae by 5 34 and rmse by 2 54 meanwhile it is worth mentioning that in table 7 the accuracy of each item with a period of 1 day is the second highest only to the accuracy with a period of 1 2 day as shown in fig 13 the prediction accuracy of the model in the extremely short time period is relatively high and each accuracy index is relatively close to the accuracy of the period of 1 day then with the increase of the time period the prediction accuracy also decreases while in the extremely short time period indicating the effect of a too short a period on the prediction accuracy of the model is positively correlated with the length of the period which indicates that too short a period will also affect the accuracy of the model therefore in combination with the prediction accuracy results of the model in different periods it is better to choose 1 2 day as the period to predict the dissolved oxygen content 4 3 water temperature treatment mechanism under natural conditions the oxygen content in the air changes little making water temperature the main factor the lower the water temperature is the higher the content of do in the water becomes cao et al 2019 in the long term aquaculture practice it is concluded that the dissolved oxygen in general pond water should be kept at 5 mg l 8 mg l and the minimum should be kept at 3 mg l below which fish and shrimp will die in the pond null et al 2017 in addition compared with other external factors water temperature is relatively easy to control to this end a water temperature regulation mechanism is hereby proposed to effectively regulate the do content when the dissolved oxygen is too low this mechanism causes the temperature to decrease thereby increasing the do content on the contrary this mechanism causes the water temperature to rise resulting in a decrease in do content through repeated experiments and comparison it is found that the stepwise temperature change method is the most effective control mechanism as shown in table 8 this study has divided 10 grades according to the range of the do content the grade represents the normal range of the do content with a positive one indicating that the content of dissolved oxygen is on the high side and vice versa formula 9 is used to change the water temperature and to predict the do content after temperature control by being combined with the prediction model proposed in this study a fixed constant c is introduced in formula 9 and the size of c is determined through many experiments in order to compare the effects of mechanism regulation the concept of the appropriate rate er is proposed which is detailed in formula 10 the larger the appropriate rate is the more the number of dissolved oxygen data falling within the range of 5 8 will be the optimization effects of different c values are shown in table 9 in the test set without water temperature treatment the suitability rate of xintang port data set is 41 98 while that of changji bridge data set is 66 47 as shown in fig 14 the optimization effect of both data sets is the best when c is set to 5 when c 5 0 the suitability rate of xintang port data set is 46 95 after processing and the suitability rate has increased by 4 97 a total of 76 data from the original data set have been optimized at this time the suitability rate of changji bridge data set is 71 12 increased by 4 65 a total of 71 pieces of original data have been optimized as shown in fig 15 many original data at the boundary of the optimal interval 5 8 are basically in the optimal interval after processing besides even if the processed data still do not fall into the optimal range the data processed by these mechanisms will be closer to the optimal range than the original data therefore through the water temperature treatment mechanism of this study the do content of the site can be adjusted to a certain extent and its value should be as close as possible to the 5 8 range which is beneficial for related agricultural activities 7 wt wt g c where wt represents the water temperature wt represents the water temperature after mechanism treatment g represents the level of dissolved oxygen content and c represents a fixed constant 8 er do e do a where er is the suitability rate do e is the number of dissolved oxygen data falling within the range of 5 8 do a represents the total number of dissolved oxygen data 5 conclusion the do content prediction model a hybrid model of secondary decomposition external characteristics intelligent algorithm and deep learning is hereby proposed based on woa cvmd cbilstm at f and applied to the water quality monitoring stations in the tai lake basin of china this model also derives a water temperature regulation mechanism to control the do content and thus contribute to help relevant agricultural management and production in this study the do data of two vmd stations are first decomposed into modal components of different frequencies and are then divided into feature items and self items according to their correlation coefficient with external features the feature items need to filter the external features to carry out multivariate prediction while the self items are decomposed twice by the ceemdan method in addition the characteristic item will be further divided into water temperature characteristic items and other feature items and the water temperature characteristic item is the key to the later water temperature regulation mechanism the prediction model is woa cbilstm at either a feature item or a self item which not only integrates cnn and bilstm but also adds attention mechanism and searches for the optimal parameters of the model through woa finally the do prediction result is obtained by linearly adding the predicted values of each component and the empirical results indicate not only the high prediction accuracy of this method but also its efficiency in controlling the do result by adjusting the water temperature data and the following conclusions are drawn 1 cbilstm at has the highest prediction accuracy among the prediction models without adding decomposition methods external features and intelligent optimization algorithms with the addition of the vmd decomposition model the prediction model accuracy will be greatly improved if the self term is decomposed twice the prediction accuracy will continue to improve which will be further improved to a certain extent if the feature items are combined with external features for multivariate prediction compared with the prediction accuracy of the bp model if woa is added to adjust parameters on the basis of the above model the accuracy can be improved by about 80 2 if the combination is a single feature the prediction accuracy will be improved by combining do data and feature data and adopting cbilstm at model to carry out multivariate prediction if multiple features are combined the accuracy will not be improved and the more features selected the lower the accuracy will be 3 the vmd optimization method proposed in this study can ensure no aliasing between components and make the correlation between feature items and external features as high as possible at the same time 4 in this research do data are predicted according to different time periods and the accuracy is the highest when the period is 1 2 day meanwhile when the cycle is a relatively long time step i e 1 day or more the prediction accuracy is negatively correlated with the cycle length when the cycle is very short i e 0 5 day or less the prediction accuracy is positively correlated with the cycle length 5 a stepped water temperature control mechanism is adopted and a parameter c 5 0 is required so that the output result of do will also change correspondingly in both data sets the suitability rate can be increased by more than 4 after the water temperature regulation mechanism is adopted although some data still fall to the optimal range 5 8 after the adoption of the mechanism the output result of do will also be closer to the optimal range to sum up the model proposed in this paper can accurately predict the dissolved oxygen content and effectively control the output of do by adopting the corresponding water temperature regulation mechanism thereby providing a reference for the decision making of relevant agricultural and fishery departments and further strengthening the protection of water resources and the management of fishery production in addition the proposed water temperature regulation mechanism is not yet mature enough and it is currently only a stepwise increase or decrease in water temperature if corresponding research theories in the field are proposed later the regulatory effect of do can be further

7693,study region tai lake the third largest freshwater lake in china with a history of serious ecological pollution incidents study focus lake water quality prediction techniques are essential to ensure an early emergency response capability for sustainable water management herein an effective data driven ensemble model was developed for predicting lake dissolved oxygen do based on meteorological factors water quality indicators and spatial information first variation mode decomposition vmd was used to decompose data into multiple modal components and classify them into feature terms and self terms the feature terms were combined with relevant external features for multivariate prediction by convolutional neural network cnn and a bi directional long and short term memory bilstm with attention mechanism at as well as using the whale optimization algorithm woa to optimize the model hyperparameters the self terms form a secondary modal decomposition model finally the groupings were linearly summed to obtain outcome new hydrological insights for the region the proposed model has the highest prediction accuracy in tai lake as well as the best prediction effect using 0 5 days as the period this research also establishes a stepwise water temperature regulation mechanism where the output of the target do content value is achieved by changing the magnitude of water temperature and combining it with this prediction model thereby strengthening the protection of water resources and the management of fishery production graphical abstract ga1 keywords attention mechanism bi directional long short term memory deep learning improved whale optimization algorithm variational modal decomposition water quality prediction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is the necessary material basis for human survival and social development making it necessarily important to improve the monitoring and prediction ability of water quality wang et al 2022b due to the great differences in the distribution of water resources in time and space coupled with the vulnerability of the water quality to the interference of various external factors such as hydrometeorology and human activities the nonlinear and non stationary characteristics of water quality changes can be observed chen and xue 2023 therefore accurate prediction of water quality has become a challenging task de paul obade and moore 2018 destandau and zaiter 2020 secondly previous studies focused more on the change of dynamic river water quality but less on the relatively static lake water quality kachroud et al 2019 however with the increasing population the development of urbanization and industrialization has caused more and more serious pollution problems to nearby lakes and other surface water sources bhateria and jain 2016 chen et al 2023 in particular these lakes assume important functions such as drinking water source and aquaculture accurate prediction of these lakes will contribute to the rational planning and management of water resources as well as the establishment of a timely warning mechanism for water quality salerno et al 2018 in addition the controllable and adjustable water quality is a natural extension of the development of water quality prediction research which can make timely correction and compensation for the existing potential pollution in this case it may be of great value to whether manually adjust the external factors of the established lake water quality model so as to make the water quality change more beneficial w li et al 2022 l li et al 2022 chen et al 2022 the lake water quality can be evaluated by various parameters such as dissolved oxygen do water temperature wt conductivity turbidity total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and ph value among which do can not only be used as an indicator to reflect the water quality of the lake but also directly affects the related output level of agriculture and fishery at present the prediction method of the do content is mainly through water quality parameter modeling and the prediction model based on artificial intelligence ai wai et al 2022 rajaee et al 2020 the modeling of water quality parameters is often combined with some physical laws about water quality and is thus called physically driven models the physical model uses the physical mechanism of the internal movement of water flow to calculate the change trend of pollutants in time and space common lake water quality modeling includes through gis post et al 2018 vollenweider model magar and khatry 2017 kirchner dillon model rong et al 2019 three dimensional 3d hydrodynamic and ecosystem model zamani et al 2018 wasp wool et al 2020 and other methods given that the mechanism models for lake water quality prediction are usually built on the basis of understanding physical processes and factors the advantage of mechanism models is the strict physical explanations of their parameters hildebrandt et al 2020 however in the water quality prediction calculation many reaction mechanisms cannot be quantitatively described by certain formulas read et al 2019 in addition a large amount of water quality data should be collected from the field for the physically driven model to analyze the data features and determine the model parameters although this method can provide high precision data it is a work with high labor and high cost and it is impossible to obtain the water quality data with full coverage of the lake in the whole cycle due to the limitations of climate environment and other realistic factors thereby exposing the modeling process to the constraints of realistic conditions varadharajan et al 2022 regarding water quality prediction there are not only physically driven modeling prediction models but also data driven models the data driven model mainly applies artificial intelligence related prediction models to predict water quality data in recent years the prediction of the do content based on ai has received increasing attention this is a robust calculation algorithm that can be used to simulate complex nonlinear relationships when there is no explicit formal relationship between variables ai models are mainly divided into machine learning methods and deep learning methods compared to physically driven models data driven models may be an effective tool to overcome these limitations data driven models can handle nonlinear and high randomness predictions through dynamic adaptive correction of model elements effectively reducing the workload of modelers in addition unlike physically driven models data driven models only focus on input output relationships without considering causal relationships between parameters which can facilitate the modeling process for environmental managers therefore data driven models may to some extent replace physically driven models and be accepted as effective tools for future water quality prediction the machine learning model does not need to consider the complexity of the hydrological system so the attention can only be paid to the information contained in the data itself moreover it does not need a large number of hydrological and water quality data for modeling support further reducing the complexity of the model meanwhile machine learning model is broadly used in the field of water quality prediction with its advantages of easy realization easy understanding and mature theory common machine learning models include support vector machines svm li et al 2017 random forests rf jasmin et al 2022 extreme gradient boosting xgboost wu et al 2021b extreme learning machine elm yaqub and lee 2022 and multi layer perceptron mlp zhu and heddam 2020 however most of the learning mechanisms of machine learning models are shallow learning and the ability to capture the hidden information in the long time series in the problem of time series prediction is restricted xu et al 2021 making the effect of machine learning model in the field of long time series prediction not ideal enough especially for nonlinear and non stationary water quality change prediction to solve the deficiencies of these methods researchers have turned their attention to the deep learning model driven by data which also has strong learning ability and adaptability and performs excellently in time series prediction and other fields wang et al 2021 s zhu et al 2021 n zhu et al 2021 wu et al 2021a minaee et al 2021 guo and wang 2022 wu et al 2022 xu et al 2023a b zhou et al 2023 common deep learning models include long and short term memory lstm chen et al 2021 wu and wang 2022 wang et al 2022a bi directional long short term memory bilstm s zhu et al 2021 n zhu et al 2021 yang et al 2023 gated recurrent unit gru guo et al 2022 temporal convolutional network tcn fu et al 2021 convolutional neural network cnn li and zhang 2022 and other commonly used models in addition a combination model of deep learning has been developed for example barzegar et al 2020 developed lstm and cnn models as well as their hybrid model i e the cnn lstm model to predict do concentration the experimental results show that by integrating lstm and cnn models the mixed model successfully captures the low and high levels of water quality variables and has better prediction ability w li et al 2022 l li et al 2022 extracted the characteristics of the sequence in the time dimension using lstm and then combined it with tcn to establish the fusion prediction model of lstm tcn the experimental results prove the high accuracy of the combined method in do prediction as well as its efficiency in better grasping the features of historical data with the increase of the time window of historical do sequence due to the interaction between do in the spatiotemporal dimension it is necessary to consider the interaction between adjacent sites of do data therefore some studies have introduced relevant factors such as do data at adjacent sites as features to obtain interactive spatiotemporal relationships between multiple sites which can compensate for the shortcomings of single site research fukushima et al 2019 jasmin et al 2022 considered 17 meteorological factors and used three kinds of feature selection techniques to establish different datasets for model development resulting in excellent prediction results in addition deep learning models are usually combined with attention mechanism at which learns the weight distribution between spatiotemporal features of multi site interactions through local attention mechanism to improve prediction performance cao et al 2021 li et al 2023 for example liu et al 2019 applied an attention based recurrent neural network rnn method to capture temporal relationships while learning spatiotemporal relationships and applied it to the prediction of dissolved oxygen the experimental results indicate that attention based rnn can achieve more accurate do prediction in both short term and long term predictions therefore introducing multi site related factors and attention mechanisms will play an important role in extracting water quality features it is worth mentioning that the neural network model has a large number of parameters and there is no strict standard for the selection of various parameters of the neural network researchers generally select parameters through experience and usually fail to obtain the best parameters but the development of intelligent algorithms provides researchers with new methods to solve this problem researchers combine neural network models with intelligent algorithms to find the optimal parameters zhou et al in press for instance yang and liu 2022 predicted the do content in water using gru in order to determine the best parameters of the model whale optimization algorithm woa was used to optimize the parameters of the neural network the experimental results showed that the prediction effect of the gru model optimized by woa was better than that of the gru model therefore the deep learning model established after using optimization algorithm to optimize the parameters is more objective and reasonable effectively eliminating the influence of subjective preferences and bringing more accurate prediction results do content data are a kind of complex time series data the periodicity noise and randomness in the data may reduce the prediction accuracy of the neural network in view of the above problems some decomposition methods will be used to process the data and then neural network will be used to predict wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 liu et al 2016 common methods include wavelet decomposition wt xu et al 2021 empirical mode decomposition emd liang et al 2019 variational mode decomposition vmd song et al 2021 and complete set empirical mode decomposition ceemdan song and yao 2022 etc among the above methods vmd has a good effect in processing the original data set and can extract the features in nonlinear and non stationary data and ceemdan can effectively capture the spectral features of high frequency signals therefore the combination of these two is bound to improve the effect of modal decomposition mining information the interaction between lake do and external characteristics such as meteorological factors and other water quality indicators may lead to the randomness and complexity of do noori et al 2020 the selection and extraction of external features have an important impact on its accurate prediction in addition the do content will have a certain periodicity with the change of time and will present a nonlinear and non stationary trend due to the influence of many factors from the perspective of modeling the application of the lstm or the bilstm model alone will introduce noise that has nothing to do with water quality prediction and will also be affected by the maximum and minimum values in time series data although using the cnn model alone can extract local features of water quality better it is not sensitive to the time sequence of water quality information therefore to improve the effect of water quality prediction the fusion of cnn and bilstm called cnn bilstm model makes the best use of cnn s feature extraction ability and the sensitivity of bilstm to time series data inspired by the above research a combined model is hereby proposed based on external features quadratic decomposition intelligent optimization algorithm attention mechanism and cnn bilstm according to the characteristics of lake do content data the prediction process of decomposition grouping prediction adding result is designed and the model is woa cvmd cbilstm at f in this study do data are first decomposed by vmd and divided into feature items and self items according to the correlation between each component and external characteristics both feature items and self items adopt the combined forecasting model meanwhile at is added to the cnn bilstm model and the parameters are adjusted by woa to form the combined prediction model of woa cbilstm at the feature item needs to be combined with relevant external features to carry out multivariate prediction the prediction model is woa vmd cbilstm at f the self terms are decomposed twice by ceemdan and the prediction model is woa cvmd cbilstm at finally the above results are linearly added to yield the final prediction result the innovation points of this study include 1 this research combines external characteristics to predict the do content and the selection of characteristics is multi dimensional taking into account the spatial characteristics meteorological factors and water quality indicators 2 the vmd is changed and the super parameters of the model are determined using the central frequency method and the external characteristic correlation coefficient in addition the results of vmd decomposition in this study are divided into feature items and self items and the self items need to be decomposed twice through ceemdan 3 the proposed prediction model in this study integrates a variety of deep learning models and automatically adjusts parameters to overcome the randomness of subjective selection using the intelligent optimization algorithm 4 based on the woa cvmd cbilstm at f model a stepwise water temperature regulation mechanism is established to regulate the output of do content and realize the controllable and adjustable change of water quality 5 this study studies the prediction ability of the model in advance of multiple periods to judge the early warning ability of the model in a longer period taking into account the extremely short term 1 day short term 1 3 days and long term 7 28 days respectively 2 models and methods 2 1 whale optimization algorithm woa mirjalili and lewis 2016 proposed the woa a meta heuristic optimization algorithm that simulates the hunting behavior of humpback whales which has the characteristics of fast optimization speed strong global convergence and few parameters woa is usually used in the deep learning model to adjust the hyperparameter of the model so as to improve the performance of the deep learning model a detailed description of woa can be found in supplementary note 1 1 2 2 bi directional long short term memory bilstm 2 2 1 long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1996 proposed the artificial neural network for lstm given that it can obtain long term feature information it is usually used to process and predict events with long intervals and delays in time series gers et al 2001 wang et al 2023 wu et al 2023a in addition it also effectively solves the problems of long term dependence gradient disappearance and gradient explosion of rnn neural network ye et al 2019 cui et al 2023 the specific formulas and descriptions of the lstm model are given in supplementary note 1 2 2 2 2 bi directional long short term memory bilstm the lstm method can only process the forward information of data to obtain prediction results while the bilstm method can obtain prediction results through the forward and backward information neural network since the bilstm method comprehensively considers the positive and negative information rules of time series data the prediction accuracy of the bilstm model may be higher than that of lstm lee et al 2019 through its independent hidden layer past and future information can be captured at specific time steps zhao et al 2017 wu et al 2023b bisltm is composed of two lstm layers with the same number of neurons first the forward data are input into the forward lstm layer to obtain the output of the forward lstm layer then the data are input into the reverse lstm layer to obtain the reverse output finally the forward lstm layer output and the reverse lstm layer result are linearly superimposed according to a certain weight to obtain the eventual output result the detailed formulas and illustrations of the bilstm model are given in supplementary note 1 3 2 3 attention mechanism at in principle the attention mechanism is equivalent to the optional visual attention mechanism of the brain in the do content data series the importance of data at each time point is different the attention mechanism layer is added to strengthen the attention to the important short term characteristics of the input time series data after assigning appropriate weight coefficients to the input data hidden vector features can be obtained each time and then input into the model layer for learning training and prediction its calculation is shown in formulas 1 3 the core idea of the attention mechanism is to properly allocate the attention of each input information so that different weights can be assigned to the state of the hidden layer in the neural network besides its most prominent functions are to focus on the impact of important information on results diminish the loss of information and enhance the impact of key information zhan et al 2019 fuentealba et al 2019 tian et al 2018 1 e t utanh w h t b 2 a t exp e t j 1 t e t 3 s

information in the model layer and s t the weighting result of the weight matrix and the output of the model layer 2 4 convolution neural network cnn herein cnn similar to the traditional neural network model is used to extract features from input data sets where there are different connections between neurons and their internal layers lecun et al 2015 the composition of the cnn model is shown in supplementary note 1 4 the prediction of the do content is a typical time series problem but it also has certain particularity considering the impact of the spatial characteristics on the do content of the reservoir the do content data of adjacent stations are hereby included in the reference characteristics in addition this research also considers the characteristics of meteorological factors and water quality indicators that is a multi dimensional feature is constructed the cnn convolution part of this study uses the conv2d structure to extract features and then extracts features in multi site and multi feature space using cnn afterwards the maximum pooling layer takes the characteristic matrix calculated by the convolution layer as the input uses the pooling window to slide on the matrix sequence takes the maximum value of the window for pooling each time and outputs a more expressive characteristic matrix finally the results are further processed through the full connection layer and the final results are output 2 5 hybrid cbilstm at model in this study cnn and bilstm form the cnn bilstm model cbilstm while cbilstm and at form the cbilstm at model the model is used for feature extraction to predict the do content and the cnn layer is used to extract multidimensional features to prevent the model from over fitting the dropout layer is hereby introduced between the cnn layer and the bilstm layer during model training the dropout layer will randomly disable the weights of some hidden layer nodes of the network temporarily to simplify the network model the bilstm layer is used to integrate the features collected on the input and then adopted for the prediction after the bilstm layer there comes the at layer which improves the prediction effect by learning the weight distribution between multi dimensional features eventually the prediction results of do content are output through the dense layer 2 6 complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise ceemdan torres et al 2011 proposed ceemdan which obtains intrinsic mode function imf by adding adaptive white noise and calculating the unique signal residual overcoming the shortcomings of emd and ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd ceemdan not only solves the problems of emd and eemd mode stacking as well as noise residues but also diminishes the reconstruction error by increasing the time of decomposition zhang et al 2022 predicted the water quality data using ceemdan and neural network models and the prediction results are relatively accurate the principles and formulas related to ceemdan can be found in the supplementary note 1 5 2 7 variational mode decomposition vmd dragomiretskiy and zosso 2013 proposed the vmd method which abandons the recursive filtering process of modal components in emd and redefines the imf as the amplitude frequency modulation signal at the same time vmd is a new adaptive decomposition method the constrained model is used to find the optimal solution and the original signal is decomposed into multiple decomposition components to obtain a series of imfs huang et al 2019 the relevant formulas and principles of vmd can be found in supplementary note 1 6 2 8 ceemdan vmd cvmd model do content data are decomposed by vmd and the imf obtained is divided into feature items and its own items according to the correlation coefficient with external characteristics feature items have a strong correlation with some external characteristics the numerical range is shown in table s2 and need to be combined with external characteristics to carry out multivariate prediction self items have no strong correlation with all external factors and can only be predicted through their own historical data as input the imf which belongs to its own item needs to be further decomposed and forecast through the ceemdan model 2 9 woa cvmd cbilstm at f model herein the woa cvmd cbilstm at f model is proposed where f represents the abbreviation of feature as shown in fig 1 the proposed prediction model is mainly divided into three stages i e the decomposition stage the group prediction stage and the addition stage first in the decomposition stage the do content data are decomposed into modal components with different frequencies using the vmd method and the appropriate super parameters are determined using the central frequency method according to their correlation coefficient with external factors after that the imf decomposed above is divided into feature items and its own items based on the presence of a strong correlation with external features then in the group prediction stage the basic model of both self items and feature items is woa vmd cbilstm at the role of woa is to automatically adjust the parameters related to the prediction model to enhance the prediction accuracy of the model the difference between the two is that the self terms will be further decomposed by ceemdan for the prediction while the feature terms are combined with strong correlation external features to carry out multivariate prediction additionally it is worth mentioning that this study also aims at exploring a water temperature regulation mechanism so the feature items can also be divided into water temperature feature items and other feature items as shown in fig 2 considering the large imf value with the lowest frequency its fluctuation has a great impact on the prediction results thus the lowest matching component is hereby treated as the characteristic term of water temperature the water temperature feature item filters features by setting the absolute value of the correlation coefficient between the imf and water temperature as a threshold while other feature items filter features by setting 0 6 as a threshold in addition the correlation coefficient between water temperature and characteristic term is often rather strong therefore if it is used as the threshold for screening features less external features will often be obtained thus making the model more sensitive to water temperature and facilitate subsequent water temperature regulation finally the addition stage is to add the prediction results of each component linearly to obtain the final prediction value 2 10 model performance indicators in this study four indicators namely mean absolute percentage error mape mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and r 2 are used to reveal the effect of the prediction method the relevant formulas and introduction of accuracy evaluation can be found in supplementary note 1 7 in order to more intuitively show the improvement of the prediction accuracy of the model proposed in this paper compared with other benchmark models the improvement rate of mape mae and rmse is also introduced as the accuracy evaluation index see formulas 4 6 for details 4 p mape mape p mape b mape b 100 5 p mae ma e p ma e b ma e b 100 6 p rmse rmse p rmse b rmse b 100

ma e p and rmse p the mape mae and rmse of the comparison model 3 empirical analysis 3 1 data sources this study selects six stations in the tai lake basin and their specific information can be referred to table s3 these six stations are located in six different cities in the tai lake basin so this study can predict the water quality of the tai lake from multiple directions in this study the dissolved oxygen data of xintang port station 119 5 n 32 0 e and changji bridge station 119 5 n 31 8 e located in the tai lake basin from november 1 2020 to february 28 2023 were selected as the research data in addition this study also continued to predict the other four stations in the tai lake basin and the results are presented in the supplementary note 2 1 see fig s6 for the relevant site map during this period each station will conduct observation every 4 h so 6 do observation data will be recorded every day in addition to the missing values in the dataset there are 5095 data in each site in this study the training set and test set of the model are constructed according to the 7 3 ratio of the data set as shown in fig s7 3 2 feature selection this study proposes a do content prediction model combining multi dimensional characteristics and selects external factors related to dissolved oxygen from three aspects namely water quality indicators meteorological factors and spatial characteristics this study combines external features from multiple dimensions which enables water quality prediction to consider multiple impacts in addition data driven models only focus on input and output relationships without considering causal relationships between parameters which can bring convenience to the subsequent modeling process many studies have confirmed that do content is related to water temperature and other characteristics of water while water quality index can represent the physical chemical and biological characteristics of water such as water temperature ph turbidity various ions etc najah et al 2011 antonopoulos and gianniou 2003 this research selects water temperature as the characteristic water quality indicator for the study the dissolved oxygen content is inversely proportional to the temperature of water that is when the water temperature is high the dissolved oxygen content is low in addition some studies have shown that dissolved oxygen is closely related to oxygen partial pressure atmospheric pressure temperature and other factors in the air so this study selects some relevant meteorological factors căluşaru constantin et al 2014 harvey et al 2011 there are two main meteorological factors that affect do the first is temperature such as air temperature surface temperature and dew point temperature the second is atmospheric pressure such as sea level pressure and ground pressure the above analysis analyzed the impact of water temperature on do content while surface water temperature is directly affected by temperature for air pressure the higher the pressure the higher the partial pressure of oxygen in the air and the higher the dissolution rate of do leading to an increase in do content based on the fluidity of the water circulation system there is a spatiotemporal linkage between the do content of the site and that of adjacent sites if the do content of adjacent sites is used as a feature it helps to analyze the spatiotemporal changes of the current site in addition the data of multiple city stations are combined to cover the whole area from point to point and the do data of the whole the tai lake basin is considered more comprehensively therefore the dissolved oxygen data of other stations in the same period in the tai lake basin are also taken as characteristics xintang port station changji bridge station and the other four stations are located in the tai lake basin and their geographical locations are very close so the do content of adjacent stations can be used as the spatial characteristic indicators in this study pearson correlation coefficient is used for model feature selection a strong correlation is observed when the absolute value of correlation coefficient is greater than or equal to 0 6 therefore 0 6 is hereby used as the threshold to screen the characteristics with strong correlation with the do and the final results are shown in table 1 besides it can be seen from fig 3 that the do content of xintang port station has a strong negative correlation with the surface temperature as well as a strong negative correlation with the water temperature air temperature and dew point temperature in addition it also has a strong positive correlation with sea level pressure ground pressure and the do content of nearby stations in the data set of changji bridge station its do content has a strong negative correlation with air temperature surface temperature and dew point temperature a strong negative correlation with water temperature also a strong positive correlation with sea level pressure ground pressure and the do content of nearby stations based on the above research the prediction model proposed in this article takes dissolved oxygen content and external characteristic variables including water temperature sea level pressure surface pressure air temperature surface temperature dew point temperature and dissolved oxygen content of adjacent sites as input variables and outputs do prediction values 3 3 results of cvmd decomposition the decomposition result of vmd is shown in fig 4 xintang port data set decomposes three imf and one residual res and the changji bridge dataset is the same it can be seen from table 2 that when the number of decompositions in xintang port data set is k 3 the central frequency of the last two imf and the central frequency of the last two imf with k 4 are very close with a difference of less than 0 01 in addition combined with fig 5 it can be found that when k 3 the imf does not have aliasing when the decomposition is the best when k 4 there is over decomposition similarly in the changji bridge site data set the decomposition is the best when k 3 in combination with fig 6a in xintang port data set the strong correlation of imf 1 imf 2 and imf 3 with external features can be observed and their correlation with features is even higher than that of original data and features similarly from fig 6b this feature is also reflected in the changji bridge data set besides both from the perspective of central frequency and that of feature correlation the results obtained by vmd are ideal according to the above vmd results and their correlation coefficient with external characteristics this paper will use the imf 1 imf 2 and imf 3 as the feature items in the xintang port station dataset imf 1 is the feature item of water temperature while imf 4 and res work as the self items in the changji bridge station dataset imf 1 and imf 2 work as the feature items imf 1 is the feature item of water temperature and imf 3 and res work as the self items the self items will be further decomposed through ceemdan as shown in fig 7 the imf 4 of xintang port dataset is decomposed 8 times and its res is decomposed 11 times the imf 3 of changji bridge dataset is decomposed 9 times and its res is decomposed 11 times meanwhile for feature items the threshold of correlation coefficient is hereby set for feature selection and the features selected for the feature items of each site are shown in table 3 3 4 prediction result of dissolved oxygen content to compare the prediction performance of the model in this study 8 other deep learning models are also used to predict the dissolved oxygen content the prediction results are shown in fig 8 and the prediction accuracy results are shown in table 4 the back propagation neural network model bp has the lowest prediction accuracy among all models lstm bilstm bilstm at and cbilstm at models are all non decomposed prediction models and the prediction accuracy of the cbilstm at model is the highest vmd cbilstm at adds vmd decomposition on the basis of cbilstm at model which not only improves the prediction accuracy but also divides the data into their own items and feature items for future research vmd cbilstm at f combines feature items with external features to carry out multivariate prediction not only improving the prediction accuracy but also excavating the relationship between dissolved oxygen data and external features the cvmd cbilstm at f model performs ceemdan processing on its own terms the results in table 4 indicate its improvement of the prediction accuracy finally based on the above model the proposed woa cvmd cbilstm at f model adjusts the parameters of the model parameters using woa further improving the prediction accuracy back propagation neural network bp is a very common model and its prediction accuracy is also the lowest of all models so it is regarded as the reference model of p mape p mae and p rmse indicators as shown in fig 9 the accuracy of lstm bilstm and bilstm at models is only slightly higher than that of bp and the improvement rate is within 20 the improvement rate of the bilstm at model is the largest among the three models with each accuracy index improved by about 20 cbilstm at is based on the bilstm at model the accuracy index of which is slightly improved and the improvement rate is increased to about 30 besides the improvement rate of the vmd cbilstm at model has been greatly improved since the beginning the average improvement rate of the three indicators of this model in xintang port data center is 57 which is more than twice the cbilstm at model on the basis of vmd cbilstm at the vmd cbilstm at f model is slightly improved and achieves an improvement rate of about 2 based on which the cvmd cbilstm at f model has been greatly improved and the model has been greatly improved in xintang port data set with an improvement rate of about 5 finally the woa cvmd cbilstm at f model is considered the most improved of all models and its improvement rate in both data sets is about 80 in addition the methods of linear fitting diagram and taylor diagram are also used to compare the prediction effects of each model from different angles as shown in fig 10 the scatter distribution of the predicted and observed values of the woa cvmd cbilstm at f model proposed in this study is relatively regular the slope of its fitting curve is the closest to 1 and the number of discrete points where the predicted value falls within the 95 confidence interval is also the largest fully proving the best prediction performance of woa cvmd cbilstm at f model as shown in fig 11 the star scattering in the taylor diagram represents each method the radiation line represents the correlation coefficient the horizontal and vertical axis represents the standard deviation and the dotted line represents the root mean square error additionally it is worth mentioning that the central position presenting the horizontal axis is the position with the best prediction accuracy from fig 11 it can be observed that the woa cvmd cbilstm at f model has the best prediction performance because it is the best location closest to the taylor chart 4 discussion 4 1 multivariable prediction the above experiments prove the good prediction performance of the cbilstm at model for dissolved oxygen without decomposition therefore this study will continue to use this model and carry out multivariate prediction by combining the external characteristic factors of the do herein the above selected features are further screened and the absolute value of their correlation coefficient with the do content of the site is taken as the threshold value which is 0 70 0 75 0 80 and 0 85 respectively the results in table 5 show that the prediction accuracy will not be improved when the model is used for multivariate prediction it is also noteworthy that when the threshold is set to 0 85 the prediction effect is relatively best and the number of features is also the minimum based on the above experiments this study allows the cbilstm at model to predict only one single feature at a time the results in table 6 show that the prediction accuracy of the model will be improved by combining single features p mape p mae and p rmse in the fig 12 take the cbilstm at model multivariate prediction in section 3 4 as the reference model it can be seen from fig 12a that the accuracy improvement of feature 1 is the largest in xintang port station which can be improved by about 8 while from fig 12b indicates that the accuracy improvement of xinfeng town is the largest in changji bridge station which can be improved by about 10 in addition it can be concluded by combining the correlation between these features and do content data that the characteristics with strong correlation have a large improvement range such as feature 1 similarly combined with the relatively low correlation the accuracy improvement is also low indicating its positive correlation with the characteristic correlation coefficient absolute value although the above multivariable experiments show that cbilstm at model combined with external features can improve the prediction accuracy of the model its defects are also obvious because only combining a single feature or a small number of features can achieve ideal prediction accuracy however the decomposition method and feature selection method proposed in section 3 3 can be combined with multiple features for the prediction and the effect of accuracy improvement is also significant 4 2 periodic research in order to better explore the performance of the proposed prediction model the influence of prediction period on prediction accuracy is also taken into consideration in this paper the prediction cycle is considered in terms of extremely short term short term and long term the time steps of 1 6 day 1 3 day and 1 2 day are selected for the extremely short time period while those of 1 day 2 days and 3 days are selected for the short time period and those of 7 days 14 days and 28 days are selected for the long time period as shown in table 7 when the period is 1 2 day the prediction accuracy of both stations is the highest if the precision data with a period of 1 day are taken as a reference changing the period to 1 2 day can increase mape by 23 28 mae by 23 25 and rmse by 17 09 in xintang port data set while in the changji bridge data set mape can be increased by 6 49 mae by 5 34 and rmse by 2 54 meanwhile it is worth mentioning that in table 7 the accuracy of each item with a period of 1 day is the second highest only to the accuracy with a period of 1 2 day as shown in fig 13 the prediction accuracy of the model in the extremely short time period is relatively high and each accuracy index is relatively close to the accuracy of the period of 1 day then with the increase of the time period the prediction accuracy also decreases while in the extremely short time period indicating the effect of a too short a period on the prediction accuracy of the model is positively correlated with the length of the period which indicates that too short a period will also affect the accuracy of the model therefore in combination with the prediction accuracy results of the model in different periods it is better to choose 1 2 day as the period to predict the dissolved oxygen content 4 3 water temperature treatment mechanism under natural conditions the oxygen content in the air changes little making water temperature the main factor the lower the water temperature is the higher the content of do in the water becomes cao et al 2019 in the long term aquaculture practice it is concluded that the dissolved oxygen in general pond water should be kept at 5 mg l 8 mg l and the minimum should be kept at 3 mg l below which fish and shrimp will die in the pond null et al 2017 in addition compared with other external factors water temperature is relatively easy to control to this end a water temperature regulation mechanism is hereby proposed to effectively regulate the do content when the dissolved oxygen is too low this mechanism causes the temperature to decrease thereby increasing the do content on the contrary this mechanism causes the water temperature to rise resulting in a decrease in do content through repeated experiments and comparison it is found that the stepwise temperature change method is the most effective control mechanism as shown in table 8 this study has divided 10 grades according to the range of the do content the grade represents the normal range of the do content with a positive one indicating that the content of dissolved oxygen is on the high side and vice versa formula 9 is used to change the water temperature and to predict the do content after temperature control by being combined with the prediction model proposed in this study a fixed constant c is introduced in formula 9 and the size of c is determined through many experiments in order to compare the effects of mechanism regulation the concept of the appropriate rate er is proposed which is detailed in formula 10 the larger the appropriate rate is the more the number of dissolved oxygen data falling within the range of 5 8 will be the optimization effects of different c values are shown in table 9 in the test set without water temperature treatment the suitability rate of xintang port data set is 41 98 while that of changji bridge data set is 66 47 as shown in fig 14 the optimization effect of both data sets is the best when c is set to 5 when c 5 0 the suitability rate of xintang port data set is 46 95 after processing and the suitability rate has increased by 4 97 a total of 76 data from the original data set have been optimized at this time the suitability rate of changji bridge data set is 71 12 increased by 4 65 a total of 71 pieces of original data have been optimized as shown in fig 15 many original data at the boundary of the optimal interval 5 8 are basically in the optimal interval after processing besides even if the processed data still do not fall into the optimal range the data processed by these mechanisms will be closer to the optimal range than the original data therefore through the water temperature treatment mechanism of this study the do content of the site can be adjusted to a certain extent and its value should be as close as possible to the 5 8 range which is beneficial for related agricultural activities 7 wt wt g c where wt represents the water temperature wt represents the water temperature after mechanism treatment g represents the level of dissolved oxygen content and c represents a fixed constant 8 er do e do a where er is the suitability rate do e is the number of dissolved oxygen data falling within the range of 5 8 do a represents the total number of dissolved oxygen data 5 conclusion the do content prediction model a hybrid model of secondary decomposition external characteristics intelligent algorithm and deep learning is hereby proposed based on woa cvmd cbilstm at f and applied to the water quality monitoring stations in the tai lake basin of china this model also derives a water temperature regulation mechanism to control the do content and thus contribute to help relevant agricultural management and production in this study the do data of two vmd stations are first decomposed into modal components of different frequencies and are then divided into feature items and self items according to their correlation coefficient with external features the feature items need to filter the external features to carry out multivariate prediction while the self items are decomposed twice by the ceemdan method in addition the characteristic item will be further divided into water temperature characteristic items and other feature items and the water temperature characteristic item is the key to the later water temperature regulation mechanism the prediction model is woa cbilstm at either a feature item or a self item which not only integrates cnn and bilstm but also adds attention mechanism and searches for the optimal parameters of the model through woa finally the do prediction result is obtained by linearly adding the predicted values of each component and the empirical results indicate not only the high prediction accuracy of this method but also its efficiency in controlling the do result by adjusting the water temperature data and the following conclusions are drawn 1 cbilstm at has the highest prediction accuracy among the prediction models without adding decomposition methods external features and intelligent optimization algorithms with the addition of the vmd decomposition model the prediction model accuracy will be greatly improved if the self term is decomposed twice the prediction accuracy will continue to improve which will be further improved to a certain extent if the feature items are combined with external features for multivariate prediction compared with the prediction accuracy of the bp model if woa is added to adjust parameters on the basis of the above model the accuracy can be improved by about 80 2 if the combination is a single feature the prediction accuracy will be improved by combining do data and feature data and adopting cbilstm at model to carry out multivariate prediction if multiple features are combined the accuracy will not be improved and the more features selected the lower the accuracy will be 3 the vmd optimization method proposed in this study can ensure no aliasing between components and make the correlation between feature items and external features as high as possible at the same time 4 in this research do data are predicted according to different time periods and the accuracy is the highest when the period is 1 2 day meanwhile when the cycle is a relatively long time step i e 1 day or more the prediction accuracy is negatively correlated with the cycle length when the cycle is very short i e 0 5 day or less the prediction accuracy is positively correlated with the cycle length 5 a stepped water temperature control mechanism is adopted and a parameter c 5 0 is required so that the output result of do will also change correspondingly in both data sets the suitability rate can be increased by more than 4 after the water temperature regulation mechanism is adopted although some data still fall to the optimal range 5 8 after the adoption of the mechanism the output result of do will also be closer to the optimal range to sum up the model proposed in this paper can accurately predict the dissolved oxygen content and effectively control the output of do by adopting the corresponding water temperature regulation mechanism thereby providing a reference for the decision making of relevant agricultural and fishery departments and further strengthening the protection of water resources and the management of fishery production in addition the proposed water temperature regulation mechanism is not yet mature enough and it is currently only a stepwise increase or decrease in water temperature if corresponding research theories in the field are proposed later the regulatory effect of do can be further

7694,study region the natural forest protection project area in china nfpp study focus applying the pattern process mechanism theory we analyzed the spatiotemporal differentiation pattern and change trend of evapotranspiration et in nfpp from 2000 to 2018 we employed methods such as geographical detectors and path analysis to identify the dominant factors and response mechanisms of et changes in nfpp specifically those resulting from vegetation recovery and climate change new hydrological insights for the region our study reveals that et in nfpp exhibits a fluctuating increasing trend rising from 299 155 mm yr in 2000 336 805 mm yr in 2018 with an annual average of 316 486 mm yr and a change rate of 2 092 mm yr the proportion of areas with decreasing et trend in nfpp 50 944 is approximately equal to that of areas with increasing et trend 49 056 vegetation restoration 18 959 water conditions 18 460 and thermal conditions 56 526 are the predominant factors that influence the changes and distribution of et in nfpp however the trend of et and its dominant factors vary by region we emphasize that given the circumstances of climate change and the continued increase in et future vegetation recovery strategies must consider water usage as this has critical practical implications for the sustained maintenance of regional ecological engineering outcomes graphical abstract

keywords climate change evapotranspiration forest ecological management forest protection project vegetation restoration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et which includes water surface evaporation soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration is a primary process parameter of land surface heat and water balances approximately 60 of global precipitation evaporates back into the atmosphere wang and dickinson 2012 et can influence precipitation and has a cooling effect due to the associated latent heat therefore et is considered a central process in the climate system and is the link between the hydrothermal cycle fisher et al 2017 changes in vegetation have a direct impact on the et process because they alter processes for allocating energy and transpiration in the canopy rainfall capture and redistribution infiltration of soil water and root water uptake li et al 2020 xi et al 2022 changes in vegetation can impact the regional hydrothermal balance and various elements of the hydrological processes potentially altering the substratum and posing new challenges for the equitable distribution of water resources in the region hoek van dijke et al 2022 large scale revegetation has a significant impact on the balance of et and surface water according to recent studies zhang et al 2018 this vegetation restoration aids in ecological restoration enhancing the local ecosystem gao et al 2018 however extensive regreening may lead to increased evaporation and excessive absorption of limited soil moisture thereby affecting the water supply and widening the gap between available and needed water in water scarce regions this makes it difficult to sustainably improve vegetation conditions in such areas feng et al 2016 tian et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a in addition global climate change alters atmospheric circulation and water cycles thereby affecting et through changes in soil moisture dynamics and vegetation growth from land air interactions jian et al 2015 zhang et al 2022 et refers to the total amount of processes that convert moisture from the land surface into water vapor and release it into the atmosphere precipitation temperature solar radiation and relative humidity directly affect the rate of et fu et al 2022 li et al 2018 2020 zheng et al 2022 however it remains to be seen whether this mechanism will hold under the influence of anthropogenic climate change human activity and various time series samples therefore understanding the spatial and temporal patterns as well as the trends and mechanisms of et in response to vegetation restoration and climate change is essential for future construction and management of ecological projects natural forests are a crucial strategic resource and ecological barrier in china playing an important role in addressing climate change and maintaining regional water balance the natural forest protection project nfpp is the largest ecological project in china in terms of both coverage and investment volume since its formal launch in 2000 the nfpp has had a significant impact on ecosystem development vegetation restoration and eco hydrological processes in the upper reaches of the yangtze river the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river and significant state owned forest areas in northeast china and inner mongolia liu et al 2021 however whether the direction of changes in eco hydrological processes resulting from extensive forest restoration supports ecological sustainability in the context of global climate change remains debatable feng et al 2016 the existing studies have mainly focused on local nfpp regions jian et al 2015 li et al 2016 shao et al 2019 and the spatial and temporal patterns of et covering the entire domain of the nfpp and the mechanisms underlying their influence have not been adequately addressed to further investigate this it is crucial to use et products with longer time series and higher accuracy while recent research has focused on refining the quantitative model and remote sensing inversion as well as the impact of meteorological factors on et cheng et al 2021 liu et al 2021 fu et al 2022 there is a pressing need to advance our understanding of how et responds to vegetation restoration and climate change with the increasing impact of climate change and human activities water scarcity has emerged as a critical issue that poses a threat to the sustainable development of vegetation in the project area feng et al 2016 this issue is particularly severe in areas where multiple ecological engineering projects have been implemented such as the loess plateau where the vegetation cover and water circulation have undergone significant changes despite the recognition of the combined impacts of climate change and vegetation greening on et their respective contributions remain poorly understood it is critical to identify trends in et and understand how climate and vegetation respond to it this knowledge is essential for developing effective water management measures and maintaining the sustainability of ecological projects especially in regions where unpredictable climate change and intensive human land management programs pose significant challenges luan et al 2022 large scale regional et cannot be directly observed but accurate results can be obtained using model simulations and remote sensing techniques various rs based et measurement techniques have been developed and utilized including the data assimilation method xu et al 2018 the energy balance residual method norman et al 1995 and techniques based on the penman monteith or priestley taylor formulas cleugh et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 in terms of et research trends there are three shifts 1 a shift from site scale to macro remote sensing estimation 2 a shift from empirical regression and mechanistic models to deep machine learning models and 3 a shift from et spatiotemporal characteristics to a focus on driving mechanisms machine learning based methods offer new approaches for fully revealing the spatiotemporal patterns of et at regional scales due to the shortcomings of empirical regression methods for large scale et calculations the high number of parameters in energy balance models and the canopy conductivity bias in penman monteith methods among other factors yin et al 2021 machine learning techniques have been used to estimate et due to their excellent classification and regression prediction capabilities unlike conventional physical models machine learning methods do not require knowledge of the underlying physical principles governing the et process to produce highly accurate results instead they rely on the relationships between the fluxes obtained from remote sensing meteorology and observation data yuan et al 2020 currently machine learning techniques are widely used in geological fields such as surface parameter inversion groundwater studies downscaling and remote sensing image fusion ke et al 2016 yuan et al 2020 recently several machine learning techniques have evolved for estimating et including neural networks support vector machines model tree integration random forests gaussian process regression and multiple adaptive regression spline functions jung et al 2010 li et al 2018b carter and liang 2019 bai et al 2021 yin et al 2021 improved the et estimation in china by combining five process based et algorithms with the gaussian process regression gpr algorithm they also confirmed that gpr provided the best performance for terrestrial et estimation in china by comparing and validating multiple machine learning algorithms and et estimation models the pattern process mechanism paradigm is a fundamental framework in geographical research for investigating phenomena and laws fu 2014 in this study we aim to examine the spatial pattern and temporal trends of et in the nfpp and to investigate the mechanisms by which et responds to vegetation restoration and climate change our research aims to provide a basis for future forest ecological management and planning in china specifically we address three key scientific questions 1 what are the spatial and temporal patterns of et in the nfpp and its regions and how have they evolved over the past 20 years 2 what are the expected trends in et in the future 3 how has et responded to climate change and vegetation restoration 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the natural forest protection project nfpp is primarily implemented in the upper yangtze river the upper and middle yellow river and the key state owned forest lands in northeast china and inner mongolia fig 1 nfpp aims to conserve natural forest resources especially in the upper and middle reaches of the yangtze and yellow rivers and in the key state owned forest areas in northeast china and inner mongolia the topography of nfpp exhibits a gradual increase in elevation from southeast to northwest the land use types in the area comprise farmland 17 670 forest land 29 464 grassland 33 908 water 1 335 urban land 1 542 unutilized land 15 843 and a minor portion of glacier 0 256 fig 1a as a whole nfpp exhibits a forest cover that is rich and dense in the northeast central and southwest regions but sparse and limited in the northwest the main vegetation types are cultivated vegetation meadow scrub desert and grassland the average annual temperature ranges from 19 to 26 and the average annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 2000 mm the water and heat conditions in the southeast are better than those in the northwest based on project distribution nfpp is divided into five regions fig 1 the upper yangtze river region uyz is mainly characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate and dominated by alpine vegetation and shrubland with high vegetation cover the upper and middle yellow river region muyr has a complex climate including subtropical monsoon temperate continental temperate monsoon and highland mountain climates vegetation types are dominated by cultivated vegetation steppe and meadows with significant differences in vegetation cover the key state owned forest areas in northeast china and inner mongolia nimf is located in northeastern china with a temperate monsoon climate and dominated by coniferous and broadleaf forests with high and stable vegetation cover the xinjiang key state owned forest region xjf is located in the northwest inland area of china with a temperate continental climate low vegetation cover and vegetation types mainly composed of shrubland and widespread bare areas the hainan key state owned forest region hnf is the smallest in area and has a tropical monsoon climate with adequate water and heat conditions we combined the xjf and hnf into the xinjiang and hainan key state owned forest region xhf for data statistics 2 2 data sources the et data used in this study were obtained from the research conducted by yin et al 2021 which estimated the terrestrial et data in china from 2000 to 2018 using machine learning methods the climate data were sourced from the china meteorological sharing network and were based on daily meteorological station observations from 2000 to 2018 which were then interpolated using anusplin professional meteorological interpolation software the monthly ndvi and npp data for the period 2000 2018 which were utilized for exploring the driving mechanisms are derived from reliable and validated data products that are suitable for reflecting the vegetation status in china for our subsequent study the above data were resampled to a resolution of 1 km the vegetation type data were obtained from the 1 1000 000 china vegetation atlas which provides a detailed representation of the distribution horizontal zonality and vertical zonality patterns of the 11 vegetation type groups in china the land use data were obtained from the resource and environment data center of cas http www resdc cn this is a multi temporal land use dataset constructed at a national scale in china using landsat remote sensing images of the united states as the primary information source table 1 2 3 methods 2 3 1 trend analysis we employed linear regression analysis to calculate the slope of the trend line for pixel time series in order to investigate the spatiotemporal trends of climate factors and et chatfield 2003 furthermore we utilized the pearson correlation coefficient method to evaluate the correlation between climate factors and et 1 s l o p e n i 1 n i x i i 1 n i i 1 n x i n i 1 n i 2 i 1 n i 2 where x i denotes the mean et in year i and n is the total number of years in the study period the method does not assume any specific data distribution and is robust to outliers the test for significance level is also grounded in statistical theory and is typically conducted at the significance levels of 0 05 or 0 01 if the p value is less than 0 05 or 0 01 the trend is considered statistically significant and if it is greater than the significance level the trend is considered not significant 2 3 2 hurst we utilized the rescaled range analysis method r s to calculate the hurst index which quantitatively characterizes the long term persistence of et this method is extensively used in the fields of hydrology climatology and ecology to monitor the persistence of long term trends and is well suited for detecting persistent changes in et over extended time series fu et al 2022 the basic principles of the method are outlined in the supplementary materials refer to appendix 1 2 3 3 geodetector the geographic detector proposed by wang and xu 2017 is a tool that can be used to detect and reveal spatial heterogeneity among data and has been widely proven to be accurate in geographic attribution and divergence feature analysis with significant spatial heterogeneity we applied the geographic detector to the disparity analysis of et in nfpp to compare the key drivers of different regions and analyzed the explanatory strength of different drivers the spatial heterogeneity of the factor detector detecting et changes y and the explanatory power of the independent variable x on y measured by the q are calculated as follows 2 q 1 h 1 l n h σ h 2 n σ 2 where q is the explanatory power of one factor on et change h is the number of classifications or partitions of y or factor x n h and n are the number of units in class h and the whole region respectively σ h 2 and σ 2 are the variance of y for the units in class h and the whole region respectively the q value ranges from 0 to 1 and the larger the q value is the stronger the spatial heterogeneity of y is if h is generated by factor x the q value indicates that x explains 100 q of y the larger the q value is the stronger the explanatory power of factor x to y is and vice versa the q value followed the noncentral f test which was used to determine the significance level quantitative characterization of the interaction of two drivers on the et distribution pattern by an interaction detector interaction detector assesses whether the explanatory powers of two factors are enhanced weakened or independent of each other first the q values of two factors x 1 and x 2 for y were calculated q x 1 and q x 2 then the q value of interaction which is a new layer formed by tangent of overlay variables x 1 and x 2 was calculated q x 1 x 2 and compared with q x 1 and q x 2 to indicate the interaction type between two variables 2 3 4 path analysis path analysis pa was first proposed by the quantitative geneticist sewall wright and refers to a method for analyzing correlations among variables using path coefficients wright 1934 this method allows for the direct quantification of the relative importance of respective variables independent of the units of measure between independent variables and the degree of variation of the independent variables cheng et al 2021 in our study we employed path analysis to quantify the degree of influence of each driver on et as measured by the total impact calculated via the path coefficients the pa method involves decomposing the correlation coefficient using multiple regression the direct path coefficient the indirect path coefficient and the total path coefficient are used to express the direct indirect and total effects of an independent variable on the dependent variable respectively the pa method does not require variables to be independent of each other the path coefficient is obtained by solving the following equations p 1 r 12 p 2 r 13 p 3 r 1 k p k r 1 y 3 r 21 p 1 p 2 r 23 p 3 r 2 k p k r 2 y r k 1 p 1 r k 2 p 2 r k 3 p 3 p k r k y where k represents the number of independent variables and is equal to 8 in this study i e representing tem pre prs npp ssd win rs and rhu rij represents the correlation coefficient between the independent variables i and j riy represents the correlation coefficient between the independent variable i and the dependent variable and also represents the total effect of the independent variable i on the dependent variable pi is the direct path coefficient which represents the direct effect of the independent variable i on the dependent variable and rij pi is the indirect path coefficient which represents the indirect effect of the independent variable i on the dependent variable through the independent variable j therefore the sum of the direct and indirect path coefficients total effect of an independent variable is equal to the correlation coefficient between the independent variable and the dependent variable in this study we selected 8 indicators in which one vegetation restoration net primary productivity npp two dynamic conditions wind speed and air pressure two water conditions precipitation relative humidity and temperature sunshine hours solar radiation these eight indicators are sufficient to explore the factors affecting et using path analysis all data were used for path analysis in 1 km spatial resolution and annual temporal resolution 3 results 3 1 analysis of the spatiotemporal evolutionary characteristics of et in the nfpp 3 1 1 spatiotemporal variation characteristics of et in the nfpp from 2000 2018 the et in the nfpp exhibited a varying increasing trend increasing from 299 155 mm yr in 2000 336 805 mm yr in 2018 fig 2 notably there was a significant increase in et from 2005 to 2010 with an increment of 3 812 mm yr from 2010 2015 et exhibited a declining trend 0 045 mm yr and the multi year average et in the nfpp was 316 486 mm yr on a regional level the largest increase in et rate was observed in muyr 2 660 mm yr and yuz 2 630 mm yr followed by xhf 1 363 mm yr and nimf 0 233 mm yr which had the slowest increase rate the trends of et for various vegetation types exhibited significant variation with an overall increasing trend specifically the changes in et were as follows grassland cultivated vegetation steppe shrubland coniferous forest broad leaved forest bare area meadow alpine vegetation swamp theropencedrymion the grassland and cultivated vegetation showed the highest et growth rates at 3 566 mm yr and 3 262 mm yr respectively which were both higher than the annual average similarly steppe 2 549 mm yr and shrubland 2 434 mm yr also exhibited higher than average annual et growth rates coniferous forest broad leaved forest bare area meadow and alpine vegetation also showed an increasing trend in et whereas swamp 0 013 mm yr and theropencedrymion 0 133 mm yr showed a decreasing trend from 2000 2018 the et trend of the nfpp exhibited spatial heterogeneity forming a high value area of et with the loess plateau region as its main core and a low value area that was distributed discretely throughout the nfpp fig 3 the trend analysis results showed that the et trend change rate in the nfpp ranged from 71 449 77 295 mm yr with an average change rate of 2 092 mm yr p 0 05 fig 3 the percentage of non significantly increasing and significantly increasing areas in the nfpp was 75 514 and 49 304 respectively the significantly increasing areas were primarily concentrated in the muyr s loess plateau area while the significantly decreasing areas were more discretely distributed 2 816 at the regional level there was an 83 668 increase in et in yuz and significant increases were observed in the eastern part of the bayankara mountain range the southern part of the yungui plateau and the eastern part of the hengduan mountain range the increase in et in muyr was 78 703 which was concentrated in the loess plateau area the distribution of reduced et in nfpp is discrete with the nimf 44 662 exhibiting the most significant decrease 3 1 2 consistency analysis of et changes in nfpp we can forecast the direction of future et change trends and overlay them with the hurst index analysis results to produce dual information about et change trends and consistency tests fig 4 the mean hurst index value was 0 485 with high values concentrated in the northern and northeastern parts of uyz and the southern part of the yunnan guizhou plateau among the nfpp s images 54 354 exhibited discontinuous changes in et while 45 646 exhibited a trend toward continuous changes et changes in the nfpp showed a trend of discontinuous increase continuous increase discontinuous decrease and continuous decrease in 40 406 35 108 13 948 and 10 538 of the images respectively based on these results the proportion of area in the future et of the nfpp that is showing a decreasing trend 50 944 is roughly equal to that in which it is showing an increasing trend 49 056 there are significant regional differences in the persistence of et within the nfpp in the uyz there is a sustained increase in cultivated vegetation 16 563 and shrubland 11 368 in the muyr there is a discontinuous increase in cultivated vegetation 12 875 and grassland 11 208 in the nimf there is a discontinuous increase in broad leaved forest 10 559 and coniferous forest 5 715 in the xhf there is a discontinuous increase in bare area and grassland in conclusion the area showing a decreasing trend and an increasing trend in et within nfpp is roughly equal in the future the uyz exhibit a sustained increasing trend in et while the muyr the nimf and the xhf all show a discontinuous increasing trend additionally the areas with a continuous increasing trend in et are mainly concentrated in the northern and northeastern parts of the uyz while the areas with a discontinuous increasing trend are widely distributed within nfpp 3 2 probing the driving mechanism of et change in nfpp the variation in et in china is closely associated with geographical differences in hydrothermal conditions climatic dynamics and vegetation distribution li et al 2018b li et al 2020 fu et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 therefore we selected vegetation restoration net primary productivity npp water conditions precipitation relative humidity thermal conditions temperature sunshine hours solar radiation and dynamical conditions wind speed and atmospheric pressure as factors affecting the et of nfpp for analysis to identify spatial heterogeneity features and patterns we used geodetector and we applied the natural breakpoint method to spatially classify the influencing factors based on the factor detection and interaction detection module appendix 1 this allowed us to demonstrate the contribution of each driver to the spatial heterogeneity of et in various regions and years of nfpp additionally we conducted a correlation analysis between each explanatory variable and et appendix 2 to compensate for the inability of geographic probing to investigate the drivers positive and negative effects to further analyze the factors driving the change in et of nfpp we performed an attribution analysis using the 2018 data as an example our investigation revealed that the explanatory strength of each driver for the change in et of nfpp was consistent across 2000 2010 and 2018 table 2 3 2 1 single factor detection of spatial pattern formation in et the spatial variation of et in nfpp is dependent mainly on three aspects regional vegetation restoration water conditions and thermal conditions while the influence of dynamic conditions is relatively weak the factors that influence the et of nfpp in order of magnitude according to the q value 2018 were npp 0 686 precipitation 0 548 sunshine hours 0 480 relative humidity 0 437 temperature 0 226 wind speed 0 149 solar radiation 0 052 atmospheric pressure 0 041 all factors passed the significance test p 0 001 table 2 the results of the factor detection demonstrate that npp is the primary factor driving the variation of et and best describes the spatial variation in et of nfpp the spatial trend of transpiration and evaporation in the nfpp is roughly consistent with the trend of npp net primary productivity with high values concentrated in the loess plateau region and a dispersed distribution in other regions in addition precipitation sunshine hours and relative humidity have a significant impact on the spatial differentiation of nfpp transpiration while the effects of temperature wind speed solar radiation and atmospheric pressure are relatively small overall the vegetation recovery of nfpp has the strongest explanatory power for the spatial differentiation of transpiration and evaporation largely influenced by human activities such as ecological restoration projects which affect the growth and spatial distribution of vegetation and consequently impact the spatial variation of transpiration and evaporation water and thermal conditions have the second strongest effect directly affecting the spatial distribution of transpiration and evaporation through precipitation relative humidity and sunshine hours while dynamic conditions have the smallest effect 3 2 2 interaction detection of driving factors in the formation of et spatial pattern the identification of factor interactions revealed that there was a dual factor enhancement and nonlinear enhancement in the interaction between the factors after interaction the detected factors improved the spatial pattern s interpretability demonstrating that several driving elements worked collaboratively to create the spatial differentiation pattern of nfpp the spatial pattern of et was more influenced by the interplay of nfpp components than by any individual factor the most robust explanation for the regional pattern of et resulted from the interplay between npp and other factors as any pair of two factors had a higher q value than a single npp 0 686 the interactive analysis of the regional driving forces indicated that there were considerable differences between the regional influencing factors for geographical differentiation of et fig 5 the strongest explanation for the spatial pattern of et in uyz 0 543 was the interaction between solar radiation and temperature and the combined effect of the two factors promoted the growth of et in uyz the relationship between npp and climatic conditions was the driving force behind the spatial distribution of et in both muyr and xhf this suggests that the spatiotemporal differentiation of et is influenced by both climate change and vegetation restoration resulting from similar activities although the pairwise interaction between npp precipitation and solar radiation of nimf is strong its explanatory power remains at a modest level the interaction results further confirmed that regional vegetation restoration was the primary force behind changes in the spatial and temporal pattern of et in nfpp on this basis the interplay between forest restoration and other environmental conditions jointly affected the spatiotemporal variation of et highlighting the regionality and complexity of the spatial pattern of et in nfpp 3 2 3 analysis of dominant factors in the formation of et spatial pattern to investigate the spatial distribution pattern of the dominant drivers of et trend in the nfpp from 2000 to 2018 a path analysis was conducted fig 6 the findings revealed that thermal conditions 56 526 vegetation restoration 18 959 and water conditions 18 460 had the most significant influences on the geographic and temporal evolution of et in the nfpp specifically solar radiation 49 291 npp 18 959 and precipitation 14 114 were the primary drivers with the remaining components accounting for less than 5 of each driver s total influence the predominant factors exhibited spatial heterogeneity across the regions with thermal conditions being the primary influencer of et variation in uyz and nimf accounting for 91 371 and 80 081 of the total influence respectively solar radiation dominated the largest proportion of et variation in these regions with area proportions as high as 89 378 and 65 141 respectively the et variations in muyr are mainly influenced by thermal conditions 35 402 vegetation restoration 30 932 and water conditions 25 923 with npp solar radiation and precipitation accounting for dominant area proportions of 30 932 27 435 and 22 193 respectively npp and precipitation dominate the et variations in the loess plateau region while solar radiation dominates the et variations in the southern part of muyr the et variations in xhf are influenced by multiple factors with water conditions vegetation restoration thermal conditions and dynamic conditions contributing proportions of 41 557 29 312 18 496 and 10 635 respectively the dominant area proportions of npp precipitation and relative humidity are 29 312 29 234 and 12 324 respectively in summary it is evident that the dominant drivers of et varied significantly between the nfpp and its sub regions the spatial and temporal patterns of et changes in the nfpp were primarily influenced by vegetation restoration water conditions and thermal conditions specifically thermal conditions were the dominant factor driving changes in et in uyz and nimf while water conditions thermal conditions and vegetation restoration all played significant roles in et changes in muyr finally changes in et in xhf were influenced by a variety of factors 4 discussion 4 1 et responses to vegetation restoration we found that the et of nfpp in china significantly increased between 2000 and 2018 with vegetation restoration water conditions and thermal conditions being the main drivers of this change however there were regional variations in et trends and their driving forces at local levels previous studies have suggested that changes in nfpp s et were closely related to vegetation restoration and the expansion of vegetation at a large scale was accompanied by a significant rise in the amount of water evaporated feng et al 2016 hoek van dijke et al 2022 luan et al 2022 et has been shown to depend on canopy resistance parameters determined by vegetation cover conditions using previous estimates of et based on penman monteith cleugh et al 2007 and studies using the surface energy balance algorithm sebal have demonstrated that et is highly sensitive to vegetation indices bastiaanssen et al 1998 we found a high correlation p 0 01 between the spatial variation in et and changes in normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and net primary productivity npp in areas like muyr and xinjiang which include the loess plateau sichuan basin and yunnan guizhou plateau this correlation was observed when we accounted for the effects of vegetation changes on et in various regions these areas are critical for nfpp s implementation and ndvi and npp of the vegetation showed a clear upward trend we found that the response of et to vegetation restoration varied by region for instance in muyr vegetation ndvi and npp significantly increased at 0 008 yr and 8 657gc m2 yr respectively and et also showed a trend of increase of 2 660 mm per year fig 3 we further investigated the loess plateau region which had a strong et response within muyr and found that et development in this area showed a pattern of considerable growth of 6 069 mm per year while ndvi and npp also dramatically rose at 0 010 yr and 10 347gc m2 yr respectively fig 7 due to the high levels of canopy interception et and transpiration in plantation forests plantation conservation dominated the vegetation restoration in this area and the trend of rising et in this area was the strongest this demonstrates how vegetation is crucial in controlling interannual fluctuation in et yu et al 2018 in contrast et dramatically decreased at a maximum rate of 8 697 mm yr in the northern hengduan mountains and the northwesterly sanjiangyuan region fig 3 however in both locations the vegetation ndvi and npp exhibited an upward trend which may result from the interaction between the effects of climate change and vegetation growth forzieri et al 2022 on the one hand human activities can modify the type of surface leading to an impact on the local water cycle cheng et al 2021 the chinese government s ecological projects carried out since the beginning of the 21st century have affected the type of surface vegetation and the distribution of water our findings suggest that the nfpp s vegetation restoration has effectively increased et and vegetation changes may be responsible for a significant portion of evaporative water use in areas where other ecological projects are underway li et al 2021 while ecological engineering has improved the environment by addressing issues such as soil erosion and ecological degradation it often overlooks the fact that et from forests consumes significant amounts of water during the implementation of ecological projects jones et al 2022 changes in vegetation transpiration soil evaporation and canopy interception evaporation due to eco engineering may put pressure on surface water resources potentially endangering the ecosystem and the environment li et al 2020 luan et al 2022 moreover in regions with low precipitation cultivated and natural vegetation compete for the limited amount of soil and groundwater causing conflicts between ecosystems and human water use li et al 2021 miguez macho and fan 2021 feng et al 2016 noted that as ecological projects are carried out et increases reducing the total water storage capacity of terrestrial ecosystems in the loess plateau as the region s vegetation restoration approaches the sustainable water resource limit the increase in vegetation cover could stagnate interestingly both the extreme arid and dry zones in the study area in northern china show a significant decreasing trend in water production fig 8 which we believe is related to a significant rise in et in the northern arid zone fig 3 fig 8 and fig s6 the south north water transfer project in china supplies enough water to the northern arid region which forms the basis for vegetation s water use as shown in fig 3 et is trending upward in these areas muyr however due to increased irrigation and vegetation restoration northern china is expected to be more dependent on water replenishment pei et al 2018 given the complexity of these impact mechanisms ongoing monitoring of the study area is necessary to improve our understanding of the long term effects of large scale ecological restoration projects on terrestrial ecosystems in general human activities can contribute to both social advancement and environmental improvement but their impact on the water cycle cannot be disregarded according to the vast majority of studies human activities have a much greater impact on water resources than climate change qin et al 2020 however our study suggests that contrary to earlier studies the impact of climate change is greater than that of ecological restoration it is important to note that our study only examined npp as an indicator of ecological restoration and further consideration of the impact of human activities is needed for example human activities such as agricultural irrigation urban expansion and construction of large hydraulic projects also affect et changes and other ecohydrological processes cheng et al 2021 therefore we recommend that when implementing ecological engineering solutions such as the nfpp variations in water use should be taken into account in particular attention should be paid to forest ecosystems where there are intricate connections between the forest and water 4 2 et response to climate change the restoration of vegetation is one of the primary drivers of the increase in et in the nfpp over the past 20 years with climate change also potentially contributing to the trend the interplay between vegetation and climate change has a significant impact on terrestrial et making it challenging to separate their respective effects on et on the one hand climate change can directly impact et and assuming a trend of rising vegetation growth in china due to global warming et changes induced by thermal driven water driven and multi factor driven factors are expected our research showed that over 90 of the uyz and nimf regions where thermal conditions are the primary factor influencing et climate change is the dominant factor driving et the uyz region has ample water resources but its complicated terrain and diversified solar radiation input make thermal conditions the primary driver of et spatial patterns chen et al 2021 moreover our geodetector based analysis indicated that the interaction between air temperature and solar radiation in uyz effectively contributed to the et increase however the contribution of air temperature explained only 0 801 of the total et variance in fig 5 likely due to the region s continued warming trend fig s1 the combined effects of the two mechanisms above may have mitigated the impact of temperature on et despite its well known role in reducing et and impeding vegetation growth will et al 2013 in nimf the high vegetation density and relatively stable vegetation conditions imply a high level of et meanwhile vegetation can dampen the intensity of et by reducing surface wind speed and radiation intensity jiang et al 2021 fu et al 2022 coupled with the high latitude of the region vegetation and climate together influence surface albedo and radiant energy absorption limiting et primarily based on thermal conditions on the other hand climate change may alter the state of vegetation which in turn affects terrestrial et our research indicates that climate change can account for roughly 70 of the variation in et in muyr and xhf with vegetation restoration accounting for the remaining 30 according to jiang et al 2021 muyr is in the moisture limitation zone fig 8 where the primary climatic factors affecting et are precipitation and solar radiation despite the region s arid environment and limited water supplies cultivated vegetation generates a significant amount of et due to the extensive use of irrigated agriculture the trend of increasing et is most pronounced in muyr 2 660 mm yr as a result of the simultaneous development of warming and humidifying conditions that promote vegetation growth by increasing transpiration and evaporation of soil moisture from the forest understory xjf is an inland region of china with a short growing season due to its long cold winters and short summers resulting in only a small increase in water consumption brought about by the increase in vegetation hnf is located in a low latitude coastal area with high water vapor transport and sufficient energy to enhance et efficiency our study found that et in all regions except uyz showed a non continuous increase fig 4 and future effects such as climate change co2 fertilization and stomatal conductance regulation will not only affect vegetation transpiration liu et al 2020 chen et al 2021 but also have long term lagged effects on terrestrial ecosystem et further research is needed to understand these effects 4 3 the trade off between ecological restoration and water resources effective water management in response to climate change and the increasing et rate requires the reduction of wasteful water usage by vegetation examples of efficient methods of ecological water conservation include prioritizing the preservation of natural forests and selecting and breeding new forest species ngo bieng et al 2022 yu et al 2018 have reported that natural forests in china sequester more carbon while consuming less water than planted forests it should be noted that shifting from low to high water consuming plants such as from agriculture to forestry may increase water usage cheng et al 2021 khorchani et al 2022 thus forestry restructuring and optimization of cropping structure are necessary in the context of insufficient water resources this includes china s ongoing strategy of converting farmland to forests and promoting reforestation which should be based on local water supply conditions although evidence suggests that large scale ecological restoration has positive ecological impacts song et al 2022 certain water scarce regions with uncertain outcomes require a more cautious approach feng et al 2016 siqueira et al 2021 fang et al 2022 despite the positive outcomes of our regional water yield simulations fig 8 the implementation of ecological restoration projects still requires careful consideration of local environmental conditions as well as scientifically sound management and species selection to prevent adverse environmental consequences jones et al 2022 our research primarily focuses on the impacts of regional vegetation restoration and climate change on et but the resulting ecohydrological changes will also have a significant impact future research can further investigate the feedback and interactions between climate change vegetation restoration and et by combining vegetation growth models regional climate models and et simulations with the aim of providing more scientific support for future forest management and regional ecological control practices in china 4 4 prospects and limitations this study has some limitations that require further improvement in future research firstly when attributing et variation we assumed that the influencing factors were independent of each other however in reality these factors may interact with each other such as an increase in temperature reducing relative humidity or a complex interaction between temperature and precipitation ma and zhang 2022 therefore the explanations of relative humidity and precipitation for et change attribution may be a by product of temperature change and should be further investigated in future research secondly we did not take into account the impact of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall high temperature heat waves and droughts on our long term analysis with the increasing global climate change the probability of extreme weather events has dramatically increased and their occurrence may have significant impacts on the regional water cycle findell et al 2017 in addition it is worth noting that multiple ecological protection projects including the three north shelterbelt project the grain for green project the grazing prohibition project and the comprehensive treatment of karst rocky desertification in southwest china were implemented in our study area rather than a single ecological project or a single ecological restoration measure shao et al 2022 in some regions where ecological projects are implemented in combination the comprehensive effects of ecological engineering measures have not been fully assessed future studies should consider a broader range of influential factors in et estimation to obtain more comprehensive conclusions despite the aforementioned limitations our study has consolidated the importance of et changes in hydrological processes promoted the understanding of climate variability and the role of vegetation restoration in water cycle and forest management and provided a scientific basis for the implementation of ecological restoration projects and the rational allocation of water resources in china however further research is needed to clarify the driving mechanisms of et changes across multiple scales in order to deepen our understanding of terrestrial ecohydrological change processes 5 conclusions based on the pattern process mechanism framework we have investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of et at both the nfpp image and regional scales in china as well as the past and future trends in et we have also explored the relationship between the response of et to vegetation restoration and climate change in response to the three important questions raised earlier our findings are as follows in the past 20 years et in the nfpp has exhibited a fluctuating increasing trend with significant increases mainly concentrated in the loess plateau area however future projections indicate that et in the nfpp will decrease continuously in 50 944 of the area while it will continue to increase in 49 056 of the area since 2000 the changes and distribution of et in the nfpp have been dominated by vegetation restoration 18 959 water conditions 18 460 and thermal conditions 56 526 the mechanisms behind et response to vegetation restoration and climate change are complex on one hand large scale vegetation expansion can lead to a significant increase in evaporative water consumption on the other hand climate change can directly or indirectly affect terrestrial et however at smaller scales et trends and their dominant factors vary from region to region overall our results suggest that revegetation has the potential to bring about favorable ecological effects on various components of nfpp this includes an increase in local ecosystems water production vegetation cover and carbon storage capacity however it is important to emphasize that restructuring and optimizing forestry projects should be a crucial part of ecological restoration efforts in order to minimize inefficient water use by vegetation this is essential for maintaining regional forest and water management especially in support of the un decade for ecosystem restoration which aims to reduce deforestation and restore forests to improve human well being on a global scale credit authorship contribution statement xiaofeng wang visualization methodology formal

7694,study region the natural forest protection project area in china nfpp study focus applying the pattern process mechanism theory we analyzed the spatiotemporal differentiation pattern and change trend of evapotranspiration et in nfpp from 2000 to 2018 we employed methods such as geographical detectors and path analysis to identify the dominant factors and response mechanisms of et changes in nfpp specifically those resulting from vegetation recovery and climate change new hydrological insights for the region our study reveals that et in nfpp exhibits a fluctuating increasing trend rising from 299 155 mm yr in 2000 336 805 mm yr in 2018 with an annual average of 316 486 mm yr and a change rate of 2 092 mm yr the proportion of areas with decreasing et trend in nfpp 50 944 is approximately equal to that of areas with increasing et trend 49 056 vegetation restoration 18 959 water conditions 18 460 and thermal conditions 56 526 are the predominant factors that influence the changes and distribution of et in nfpp however the trend of et and its dominant factors vary by region we emphasize that given the circumstances of climate change and the continued increase in et future vegetation recovery strategies must consider water usage as this has critical practical implications for the sustained maintenance of regional ecological engineering outcomes graphical abstract

keywords climate change evapotranspiration forest ecological management forest protection project vegetation restoration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et which includes water surface evaporation soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration is a primary process parameter of land surface heat and water balances approximately 60 of global precipitation evaporates back into the atmosphere wang and dickinson 2012 et can influence precipitation and has a cooling effect due to the associated latent heat therefore et is considered a central process in the climate system and is the link between the hydrothermal cycle fisher et al 2017 changes in vegetation have a direct impact on the et process because they alter processes for allocating energy and transpiration in the canopy rainfall capture and redistribution infiltration of soil water and root water uptake li et al 2020 xi et al 2022 changes in vegetation can impact the regional hydrothermal balance and various elements of the hydrological processes potentially altering the substratum and posing new challenges for the equitable distribution of water resources in the region hoek van dijke et al 2022 large scale revegetation has a significant impact on the balance of et and surface water according to recent studies zhang et al 2018 this vegetation restoration aids in ecological restoration enhancing the local ecosystem gao et al 2018 however extensive regreening may lead to increased evaporation and excessive absorption of limited soil moisture thereby affecting the water supply and widening the gap between available and needed water in water scarce regions this makes it difficult to sustainably improve vegetation conditions in such areas feng et al 2016 tian et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a in addition global climate change alters atmospheric circulation and water cycles thereby affecting et through changes in soil moisture dynamics and vegetation growth from land air interactions jian et al 2015 zhang et al 2022 et refers to the total amount of processes that convert moisture from the land surface into water vapor and release it into the atmosphere precipitation temperature solar radiation and relative humidity directly affect the rate of et fu et al 2022 li et al 2018 2020 zheng et al 2022 however it remains to be seen whether this mechanism will hold under the influence of anthropogenic climate change human activity and various time series samples therefore understanding the spatial and temporal patterns as well as the trends and mechanisms of et in response to vegetation restoration and climate change is essential for future construction and management of ecological projects natural forests are a crucial strategic resource and ecological barrier in china playing an important role in addressing climate change and maintaining regional water balance the natural forest protection project nfpp is the largest ecological project in china in terms of both coverage and investment volume since its formal launch in 2000 the nfpp has had a significant impact on ecosystem development vegetation restoration and eco hydrological processes in the upper reaches of the yangtze river the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river and significant state owned forest areas in northeast china and inner mongolia liu et al 2021 however whether the direction of changes in eco hydrological processes resulting from extensive forest restoration supports ecological sustainability in the context of global climate change remains debatable feng et al 2016 the existing studies have mainly focused on local nfpp regions jian et al 2015 li et al 2016 shao et al 2019 and the spatial and temporal patterns of et covering the entire domain of the nfpp and the mechanisms underlying their influence have not been adequately addressed to further investigate this it is crucial to use et products with longer time series and higher accuracy while recent research has focused on refining the quantitative model and remote sensing inversion as well as the impact of meteorological factors on et cheng et al 2021 liu et al 2021 fu et al 2022 there is a pressing need to advance our understanding of how et responds to vegetation restoration and climate change with the increasing impact of climate change and human activities water scarcity has emerged as a critical issue that poses a threat to the sustainable development of vegetation in the project area feng et al 2016 this issue is particularly severe in areas where multiple ecological engineering projects have been implemented such as the loess plateau where the vegetation cover and water circulation have undergone significant changes despite the recognition of the combined impacts of climate change and vegetation greening on et their respective contributions remain poorly understood it is critical to identify trends in et and understand how climate and vegetation respond to it this knowledge is essential for developing effective water management measures and maintaining the sustainability of ecological projects especially in regions where unpredictable climate change and intensive human land management programs pose significant challenges luan et al 2022 large scale regional et cannot be directly observed but accurate results can be obtained using model simulations and remote sensing techniques various rs based et measurement techniques have been developed and utilized including the data assimilation method xu et al 2018 the energy balance residual method norman et al 1995 and techniques based on the penman monteith or priestley taylor formulas cleugh et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 in terms of et research trends there are three shifts 1 a shift from site scale to macro remote sensing estimation 2 a shift from empirical regression and mechanistic models to deep machine learning models and 3 a shift from et spatiotemporal characteristics to a focus on driving mechanisms machine learning based methods offer new approaches for fully revealing the spatiotemporal patterns of et at regional scales due to the shortcomings of empirical regression methods for large scale et calculations the high number of parameters in energy balance models and the canopy conductivity bias in penman monteith methods among other factors yin et al 2021 machine learning techniques have been used to estimate et due to their excellent classification and regression prediction capabilities unlike conventional physical models machine learning methods do not require knowledge of the underlying physical principles governing the et process to produce highly accurate results instead they rely on the relationships between the fluxes obtained from remote sensing meteorology and observation data yuan et al 2020 currently machine learning techniques are widely used in geological fields such as surface parameter inversion groundwater studies downscaling and remote sensing image fusion ke et al 2016 yuan et al 2020 recently several machine learning techniques have evolved for estimating et including neural networks support vector machines model tree integration random forests gaussian process regression and multiple adaptive regression spline functions jung et al 2010 li et al 2018b carter and liang 2019 bai et al 2021 yin et al 2021 improved the et estimation in china by combining five process based et algorithms with the gaussian process regression gpr algorithm they also confirmed that gpr provided the best performance for terrestrial et estimation in china by comparing and validating multiple machine learning algorithms and et estimation models the pattern process mechanism paradigm is a fundamental framework in geographical research for investigating phenomena and laws fu 2014 in this study we aim to examine the spatial pattern and temporal trends of et in the nfpp and to investigate the mechanisms by which et responds to vegetation restoration and climate change our research aims to provide a basis for future forest ecological management and planning in china specifically we address three key scientific questions 1 what are the spatial and temporal patterns of et in the nfpp and its regions and how have they evolved over the past 20 years 2 what are the expected trends in et in the future 3 how has et responded to climate change and vegetation restoration 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the natural forest protection project nfpp is primarily implemented in the upper yangtze river the upper and middle yellow river and the key state owned forest lands in northeast china and inner mongolia fig 1 nfpp aims to conserve natural forest resources especially in the upper and middle reaches of the yangtze and yellow rivers and in the key state owned forest areas in northeast china and inner mongolia the topography of nfpp exhibits a gradual increase in elevation from southeast to northwest the land use types in the area comprise farmland 17 670 forest land 29 464 grassland 33 908 water 1 335 urban land 1 542 unutilized land 15 843 and a minor portion of glacier 0 256 fig 1a as a whole nfpp exhibits a forest cover that is rich and dense in the northeast central and southwest regions but sparse and limited in the northwest the main vegetation types are cultivated vegetation meadow scrub desert and grassland the average annual temperature ranges from 19 to 26 and the average annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 2000 mm the water and heat conditions in the southeast are better than those in the northwest based on project distribution nfpp is divided into five regions fig 1 the upper yangtze river region uyz is mainly characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate and dominated by alpine vegetation and shrubland with high vegetation cover the upper and middle yellow river region muyr has a complex climate including subtropical monsoon temperate continental temperate monsoon and highland mountain climates vegetation types are dominated by cultivated vegetation steppe and meadows with significant differences in vegetation cover the key state owned forest areas in northeast china and inner mongolia nimf is located in northeastern china with a temperate monsoon climate and dominated by coniferous and broadleaf forests with high and stable vegetation cover the xinjiang key state owned forest region xjf is located in the northwest inland area of china with a temperate continental climate low vegetation cover and vegetation types mainly composed of shrubland and widespread bare areas the hainan key state owned forest region hnf is the smallest in area and has a tropical monsoon climate with adequate water and heat conditions we combined the xjf and hnf into the xinjiang and hainan key state owned forest region xhf for data statistics 2 2 data sources the et data used in this study were obtained from the research conducted by yin et al 2021 which estimated the terrestrial et data in china from 2000 to 2018 using machine learning methods the climate data were sourced from the china meteorological sharing network and were based on daily meteorological station observations from 2000 to 2018 which were then interpolated using anusplin professional meteorological interpolation software the monthly ndvi and npp data for the period 2000 2018 which were utilized for exploring the driving mechanisms are derived from reliable and validated data products that are suitable for reflecting the vegetation status in china for our subsequent study the above data were resampled to a resolution of 1 km the vegetation type data were obtained from the 1 1000 000 china vegetation atlas which provides a detailed representation of the distribution horizontal zonality and vertical zonality patterns of the 11 vegetation type groups in china the land use data were obtained from the resource and environment data center of cas http www resdc cn this is a multi temporal land use dataset constructed at a national scale in china using landsat remote sensing images of the united states as the primary information source table 1 2 3 methods 2 3 1 trend analysis we employed linear regression analysis to calculate the slope of the trend line for pixel time series in order to investigate the spatiotemporal trends of climate factors and et chatfield 2003 furthermore we utilized the pearson correlation coefficient method to evaluate the correlation between climate factors and et 1 s l o p e n i 1 n i x i i 1 n i i 1 n x i n i 1 n i 2 i 1 n i 2 where x i denotes the mean et in year i and n is the total number of years in the study period the method does not assume any specific data distribution and is robust to outliers the test for significance level is also grounded in statistical theory and is typically conducted at the significance levels of 0 05 or 0 01 if the p value is less than 0 05 or 0 01 the trend is considered statistically significant and if it is greater than the significance level the trend is considered not significant 2 3 2 hurst we utilized the rescaled range analysis method r s to calculate the hurst index which quantitatively characterizes the long term persistence of et this method is extensively used in the fields of hydrology climatology and ecology to monitor the persistence of long term trends and is well suited for detecting persistent changes in et over extended time series fu et al 2022 the basic principles of the method are outlined in the supplementary materials refer to appendix 1 2 3 3 geodetector the geographic detector proposed by wang and xu 2017 is a tool that can be used to detect and reveal spatial heterogeneity among data and has been widely proven to be accurate in geographic attribution and divergence feature analysis with significant spatial heterogeneity we applied the geographic detector to the disparity analysis of et in nfpp to compare the key drivers of different regions and analyzed the explanatory strength of different drivers the spatial heterogeneity of the factor detector detecting et changes y and the explanatory power of the independent variable x on y measured by the q are calculated as follows 2 q 1 h 1 l n h σ h 2 n σ 2 where q is the explanatory power of one factor on et change h is the number of classifications or partitions of y or factor x n h and n are the number of units in class h and the whole region respectively σ h 2 and σ 2 are the variance of y for the units in class h and the whole region respectively the q value ranges from 0 to 1 and the larger the q value is the stronger the spatial heterogeneity of y is if h is generated by factor x the q value indicates that x explains 100 q of y the larger the q value is the stronger the explanatory power of factor x to y is and vice versa the q value followed the noncentral f test which was used to determine the significance level quantitative characterization of the interaction of two drivers on the et distribution pattern by an interaction detector interaction detector assesses whether the explanatory powers of two factors are enhanced weakened or independent of each other first the q values of two factors x 1 and x 2 for y were calculated q x 1 and q x 2 then the q value of interaction which is a new layer formed by tangent of overlay variables x 1 and x 2 was calculated q x 1 x 2 and compared with q x 1 and q x 2 to indicate the interaction type between two variables 2 3 4 path analysis path analysis pa was first proposed by the quantitative geneticist sewall wright and refers to a method for analyzing correlations among variables using path coefficients wright 1934 this method allows for the direct quantification of the relative importance of respective variables independent of the units of measure between independent variables and the degree of variation of the independent variables cheng et al 2021 in our study we employed path analysis to quantify the degree of influence of each driver on et as measured by the total impact calculated via the path coefficients the pa method involves decomposing the correlation coefficient using multiple regression the direct path coefficient the indirect path coefficient and the total path coefficient are used to express the direct indirect and total effects of an independent variable on the dependent variable respectively the pa method does not require variables to be independent of each other the path coefficient is obtained by solving the following equations p 1 r 12 p 2 r 13 p 3 r 1 k p k r 1 y 3 r 21 p 1 p 2 r 23 p 3 r 2 k p k r 2 y r k 1 p 1 r k 2 p 2 r k 3 p 3 p k r k y where k represents the number of independent variables and is equal to 8 in this study i e representing tem pre prs npp ssd win rs and rhu rij represents the correlation coefficient between the independent variables i and j riy represents the correlation coefficient between the independent variable i and the dependent variable and also represents the total effect of the independent variable i on the dependent variable pi is the direct path coefficient which represents the direct effect of the independent variable i on the dependent variable and rij pi is the indirect path coefficient which represents the indirect effect of the independent variable i on the dependent variable through the independent variable j therefore the sum of the direct and indirect path coefficients total effect of an independent variable is equal to the correlation coefficient between the independent variable and the dependent variable in this study we selected 8 indicators in which one vegetation restoration net primary productivity npp two dynamic conditions wind speed and air pressure two water conditions precipitation relative humidity and temperature sunshine hours solar radiation these eight indicators are sufficient to explore the factors affecting et using path analysis all data were used for path analysis in 1 km spatial resolution and annual temporal resolution 3 results 3 1 analysis of the spatiotemporal evolutionary characteristics of et in the nfpp 3 1 1 spatiotemporal variation characteristics of et in the nfpp from 2000 2018 the et in the nfpp exhibited a varying increasing trend increasing from 299 155 mm yr in 2000 336 805 mm yr in 2018 fig 2 notably there was a significant increase in et from 2005 to 2010 with an increment of 3 812 mm yr from 2010 2015 et exhibited a declining trend 0 045 mm yr and the multi year average et in the nfpp was 316 486 mm yr on a regional level the largest increase in et rate was observed in muyr 2 660 mm yr and yuz 2 630 mm yr followed by xhf 1 363 mm yr and nimf 0 233 mm yr which had the slowest increase rate the trends of et for various vegetation types exhibited significant variation with an overall increasing trend specifically the changes in et were as follows grassland cultivated vegetation steppe shrubland coniferous forest broad leaved forest bare area meadow alpine vegetation swamp theropencedrymion the grassland and cultivated vegetation showed the highest et growth rates at 3 566 mm yr and 3 262 mm yr respectively which were both higher than the annual average similarly steppe 2 549 mm yr and shrubland 2 434 mm yr also exhibited higher than average annual et growth rates coniferous forest broad leaved forest bare area meadow and alpine vegetation also showed an increasing trend in et whereas swamp 0 013 mm yr and theropencedrymion 0 133 mm yr showed a decreasing trend from 2000 2018 the et trend of the nfpp exhibited spatial heterogeneity forming a high value area of et with the loess plateau region as its main core and a low value area that was distributed discretely throughout the nfpp fig 3 the trend analysis results showed that the et trend change rate in the nfpp ranged from 71 449 77 295 mm yr with an average change rate of 2 092 mm yr p 0 05 fig 3 the percentage of non significantly increasing and significantly increasing areas in the nfpp was 75 514 and 49 304 respectively the significantly increasing areas were primarily concentrated in the muyr s loess plateau area while the significantly decreasing areas were more discretely distributed 2 816 at the regional level there was an 83 668 increase in et in yuz and significant increases were observed in the eastern part of the bayankara mountain range the southern part of the yungui plateau and the eastern part of the hengduan mountain range the increase in et in muyr was 78 703 which was concentrated in the loess plateau area the distribution of reduced et in nfpp is discrete with the nimf 44 662 exhibiting the most significant decrease 3 1 2 consistency analysis of et changes in nfpp we can forecast the direction of future et change trends and overlay them with the hurst index analysis results to produce dual information about et change trends and consistency tests fig 4 the mean hurst index value was 0 485 with high values concentrated in the northern and northeastern parts of uyz and the southern part of the yunnan guizhou plateau among the nfpp s images 54 354 exhibited discontinuous changes in et while 45 646 exhibited a trend toward continuous changes et changes in the nfpp showed a trend of discontinuous increase continuous increase discontinuous decrease and continuous decrease in 40 406 35 108 13 948 and 10 538 of the images respectively based on these results the proportion of area in the future et of the nfpp that is showing a decreasing trend 50 944 is roughly equal to that in which it is showing an increasing trend 49 056 there are significant regional differences in the persistence of et within the nfpp in the uyz there is a sustained increase in cultivated vegetation 16 563 and shrubland 11 368 in the muyr there is a discontinuous increase in cultivated vegetation 12 875 and grassland 11 208 in the nimf there is a discontinuous increase in broad leaved forest 10 559 and coniferous forest 5 715 in the xhf there is a discontinuous increase in bare area and grassland in conclusion the area showing a decreasing trend and an increasing trend in et within nfpp is roughly equal in the future the uyz exhibit a sustained increasing trend in et while the muyr the nimf and the xhf all show a discontinuous increasing trend additionally the areas with a continuous increasing trend in et are mainly concentrated in the northern and northeastern parts of the uyz while the areas with a discontinuous increasing trend are widely distributed within nfpp 3 2 probing the driving mechanism of et change in nfpp the variation in et in china is closely associated with geographical differences in hydrothermal conditions climatic dynamics and vegetation distribution li et al 2018b li et al 2020 fu et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 therefore we selected vegetation restoration net primary productivity npp water conditions precipitation relative humidity thermal conditions temperature sunshine hours solar radiation and dynamical conditions wind speed and atmospheric pressure as factors affecting the et of nfpp for analysis to identify spatial heterogeneity features and patterns we used geodetector and we applied the natural breakpoint method to spatially classify the influencing factors based on the factor detection and interaction detection module appendix 1 this allowed us to demonstrate the contribution of each driver to the spatial heterogeneity of et in various regions and years of nfpp additionally we conducted a correlation analysis between each explanatory variable and et appendix 2 to compensate for the inability of geographic probing to investigate the drivers positive and negative effects to further analyze the factors driving the change in et of nfpp we performed an attribution analysis using the 2018 data as an example our investigation revealed that the explanatory strength of each driver for the change in et of nfpp was consistent across 2000 2010 and 2018 table 2 3 2 1 single factor detection of spatial pattern formation in et the spatial variation of et in nfpp is dependent mainly on three aspects regional vegetation restoration water conditions and thermal conditions while the influence of dynamic conditions is relatively weak the factors that influence the et of nfpp in order of magnitude according to the q value 2018 were npp 0 686 precipitation 0 548 sunshine hours 0 480 relative humidity 0 437 temperature 0 226 wind speed 0 149 solar radiation 0 052 atmospheric pressure 0 041 all factors passed the significance test p 0 001 table 2 the results of the factor detection demonstrate that npp is the primary factor driving the variation of et and best describes the spatial variation in et of nfpp the spatial trend of transpiration and evaporation in the nfpp is roughly consistent with the trend of npp net primary productivity with high values concentrated in the loess plateau region and a dispersed distribution in other regions in addition precipitation sunshine hours and relative humidity have a significant impact on the spatial differentiation of nfpp transpiration while the effects of temperature wind speed solar radiation and atmospheric pressure are relatively small overall the vegetation recovery of nfpp has the strongest explanatory power for the spatial differentiation of transpiration and evaporation largely influenced by human activities such as ecological restoration projects which affect the growth and spatial distribution of vegetation and consequently impact the spatial variation of transpiration and evaporation water and thermal conditions have the second strongest effect directly affecting the spatial distribution of transpiration and evaporation through precipitation relative humidity and sunshine hours while dynamic conditions have the smallest effect 3 2 2 interaction detection of driving factors in the formation of et spatial pattern the identification of factor interactions revealed that there was a dual factor enhancement and nonlinear enhancement in the interaction between the factors after interaction the detected factors improved the spatial pattern s interpretability demonstrating that several driving elements worked collaboratively to create the spatial differentiation pattern of nfpp the spatial pattern of et was more influenced by the interplay of nfpp components than by any individual factor the most robust explanation for the regional pattern of et resulted from the interplay between npp and other factors as any pair of two factors had a higher q value than a single npp 0 686 the interactive analysis of the regional driving forces indicated that there were considerable differences between the regional influencing factors for geographical differentiation of et fig 5 the strongest explanation for the spatial pattern of et in uyz 0 543 was the interaction between solar radiation and temperature and the combined effect of the two factors promoted the growth of et in uyz the relationship between npp and climatic conditions was the driving force behind the spatial distribution of et in both muyr and xhf this suggests that the spatiotemporal differentiation of et is influenced by both climate change and vegetation restoration resulting from similar activities although the pairwise interaction between npp precipitation and solar radiation of nimf is strong its explanatory power remains at a modest level the interaction results further confirmed that regional vegetation restoration was the primary force behind changes in the spatial and temporal pattern of et in nfpp on this basis the interplay between forest restoration and other environmental conditions jointly affected the spatiotemporal variation of et highlighting the regionality and complexity of the spatial pattern of et in nfpp 3 2 3 analysis of dominant factors in the formation of et spatial pattern to investigate the spatial distribution pattern of the dominant drivers of et trend in the nfpp from 2000 to 2018 a path analysis was conducted fig 6 the findings revealed that thermal conditions 56 526 vegetation restoration 18 959 and water conditions 18 460 had the most significant influences on the geographic and temporal evolution of et in the nfpp specifically solar radiation 49 291 npp 18 959 and precipitation 14 114 were the primary drivers with the remaining components accounting for less than 5 of each driver s total influence the predominant factors exhibited spatial heterogeneity across the regions with thermal conditions being the primary influencer of et variation in uyz and nimf accounting for 91 371 and 80 081 of the total influence respectively solar radiation dominated the largest proportion of et variation in these regions with area proportions as high as 89 378 and 65 141 respectively the et variations in muyr are mainly influenced by thermal conditions 35 402 vegetation restoration 30 932 and water conditions 25 923 with npp solar radiation and precipitation accounting for dominant area proportions of 30 932 27 435 and 22 193 respectively npp and precipitation dominate the et variations in the loess plateau region while solar radiation dominates the et variations in the southern part of muyr the et variations in xhf are influenced by multiple factors with water conditions vegetation restoration thermal conditions and dynamic conditions contributing proportions of 41 557 29 312 18 496 and 10 635 respectively the dominant area proportions of npp precipitation and relative humidity are 29 312 29 234 and 12 324 respectively in summary it is evident that the dominant drivers of et varied significantly between the nfpp and its sub regions the spatial and temporal patterns of et changes in the nfpp were primarily influenced by vegetation restoration water conditions and thermal conditions specifically thermal conditions were the dominant factor driving changes in et in uyz and nimf while water conditions thermal conditions and vegetation restoration all played significant roles in et changes in muyr finally changes in et in xhf were influenced by a variety of factors 4 discussion 4 1 et responses to vegetation restoration we found that the et of nfpp in china significantly increased between 2000 and 2018 with vegetation restoration water conditions and thermal conditions being the main drivers of this change however there were regional variations in et trends and their driving forces at local levels previous studies have suggested that changes in nfpp s et were closely related to vegetation restoration and the expansion of vegetation at a large scale was accompanied by a significant rise in the amount of water evaporated feng et al 2016 hoek van dijke et al 2022 luan et al 2022 et has been shown to depend on canopy resistance parameters determined by vegetation cover conditions using previous estimates of et based on penman monteith cleugh et al 2007 and studies using the surface energy balance algorithm sebal have demonstrated that et is highly sensitive to vegetation indices bastiaanssen et al 1998 we found a high correlation p 0 01 between the spatial variation in et and changes in normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and net primary productivity npp in areas like muyr and xinjiang which include the loess plateau sichuan basin and yunnan guizhou plateau this correlation was observed when we accounted for the effects of vegetation changes on et in various regions these areas are critical for nfpp s implementation and ndvi and npp of the vegetation showed a clear upward trend we found that the response of et to vegetation restoration varied by region for instance in muyr vegetation ndvi and npp significantly increased at 0 008 yr and 8 657gc m2 yr respectively and et also showed a trend of increase of 2 660 mm per year fig 3 we further investigated the loess plateau region which had a strong et response within muyr and found that et development in this area showed a pattern of considerable growth of 6 069 mm per year while ndvi and npp also dramatically rose at 0 010 yr and 10 347gc m2 yr respectively fig 7 due to the high levels of canopy interception et and transpiration in plantation forests plantation conservation dominated the vegetation restoration in this area and the trend of rising et in this area was the strongest this demonstrates how vegetation is crucial in controlling interannual fluctuation in et yu et al 2018 in contrast et dramatically decreased at a maximum rate of 8 697 mm yr in the northern hengduan mountains and the northwesterly sanjiangyuan region fig 3 however in both locations the vegetation ndvi and npp exhibited an upward trend which may result from the interaction between the effects of climate change and vegetation growth forzieri et al 2022 on the one hand human activities can modify the type of surface leading to an impact on the local water cycle cheng et al 2021 the chinese government s ecological projects carried out since the beginning of the 21st century have affected the type of surface vegetation and the distribution of water our findings suggest that the nfpp s vegetation restoration has effectively increased et and vegetation changes may be responsible for a significant portion of evaporative water use in areas where other ecological projects are underway li et al 2021 while ecological engineering has improved the environment by addressing issues such as soil erosion and ecological degradation it often overlooks the fact that et from forests consumes significant amounts of water during the implementation of ecological projects jones et al 2022 changes in vegetation transpiration soil evaporation and canopy interception evaporation due to eco engineering may put pressure on surface water resources potentially endangering the ecosystem and the environment li et al 2020 luan et al 2022 moreover in regions with low precipitation cultivated and natural vegetation compete for the limited amount of soil and groundwater causing conflicts between ecosystems and human water use li et al 2021 miguez macho and fan 2021 feng et al 2016 noted that as ecological projects are carried out et increases reducing the total water storage capacity of terrestrial ecosystems in the loess plateau as the region s vegetation restoration approaches the sustainable water resource limit the increase in vegetation cover could stagnate interestingly both the extreme arid and dry zones in the study area in northern china show a significant decreasing trend in water production fig 8 which we believe is related to a significant rise in et in the northern arid zone fig 3 fig 8 and fig s6 the south north water transfer project in china supplies enough water to the northern arid region which forms the basis for vegetation s water use as shown in fig 3 et is trending upward in these areas muyr however due to increased irrigation and vegetation restoration northern china is expected to be more dependent on water replenishment pei et al 2018 given the complexity of these impact mechanisms ongoing monitoring of the study area is necessary to improve our understanding of the long term effects of large scale ecological restoration projects on terrestrial ecosystems in general human activities can contribute to both social advancement and environmental improvement but their impact on the water cycle cannot be disregarded according to the vast majority of studies human activities have a much greater impact on water resources than climate change qin et al 2020 however our study suggests that contrary to earlier studies the impact of climate change is greater than that of ecological restoration it is important to note that our study only examined npp as an indicator of ecological restoration and further consideration of the impact of human activities is needed for example human activities such as agricultural irrigation urban expansion and construction of large hydraulic projects also affect et changes and other ecohydrological processes cheng et al 2021 therefore we recommend that when implementing ecological engineering solutions such as the nfpp variations in water use should be taken into account in particular attention should be paid to forest ecosystems where there are intricate connections between the forest and water 4 2 et response to climate change the restoration of vegetation is one of the primary drivers of the increase in et in the nfpp over the past 20 years with climate change also potentially contributing to the trend the interplay between vegetation and climate change has a significant impact on terrestrial et making it challenging to separate their respective effects on et on the one hand climate change can directly impact et and assuming a trend of rising vegetation growth in china due to global warming et changes induced by thermal driven water driven and multi factor driven factors are expected our research showed that over 90 of the uyz and nimf regions where thermal conditions are the primary factor influencing et climate change is the dominant factor driving et the uyz region has ample water resources but its complicated terrain and diversified solar radiation input make thermal conditions the primary driver of et spatial patterns chen et al 2021 moreover our geodetector based analysis indicated that the interaction between air temperature and solar radiation in uyz effectively contributed to the et increase however the contribution of air temperature explained only 0 801 of the total et variance in fig 5 likely due to the region s continued warming trend fig s1 the combined effects of the two mechanisms above may have mitigated the impact of temperature on et despite its well known role in reducing et and impeding vegetation growth will et al 2013 in nimf the high vegetation density and relatively stable vegetation conditions imply a high level of et meanwhile vegetation can dampen the intensity of et by reducing surface wind speed and radiation intensity jiang et al 2021 fu et al 2022 coupled with the high latitude of the region vegetation and climate together influence surface albedo and radiant energy absorption limiting et primarily based on thermal conditions on the other hand climate change may alter the state of vegetation which in turn affects terrestrial et our research indicates that climate change can account for roughly 70 of the variation in et in muyr and xhf with vegetation restoration accounting for the remaining 30 according to jiang et al 2021 muyr is in the moisture limitation zone fig 8 where the primary climatic factors affecting et are precipitation and solar radiation despite the region s arid environment and limited water supplies cultivated vegetation generates a significant amount of et due to the extensive use of irrigated agriculture the trend of increasing et is most pronounced in muyr 2 660 mm yr as a result of the simultaneous development of warming and humidifying conditions that promote vegetation growth by increasing transpiration and evaporation of soil moisture from the forest understory xjf is an inland region of china with a short growing season due to its long cold winters and short summers resulting in only a small increase in water consumption brought about by the increase in vegetation hnf is located in a low latitude coastal area with high water vapor transport and sufficient energy to enhance et efficiency our study found that et in all regions except uyz showed a non continuous increase fig 4 and future effects such as climate change co2 fertilization and stomatal conductance regulation will not only affect vegetation transpiration liu et al 2020 chen et al 2021 but also have long term lagged effects on terrestrial ecosystem et further research is needed to understand these effects 4 3 the trade off between ecological restoration and water resources effective water management in response to climate change and the increasing et rate requires the reduction of wasteful water usage by vegetation examples of efficient methods of ecological water conservation include prioritizing the preservation of natural forests and selecting and breeding new forest species ngo bieng et al 2022 yu et al 2018 have reported that natural forests in china sequester more carbon while consuming less water than planted forests it should be noted that shifting from low to high water consuming plants such as from agriculture to forestry may increase water usage cheng et al 2021 khorchani et al 2022 thus forestry restructuring and optimization of cropping structure are necessary in the context of insufficient water resources this includes china s ongoing strategy of converting farmland to forests and promoting reforestation which should be based on local water supply conditions although evidence suggests that large scale ecological restoration has positive ecological impacts song et al 2022 certain water scarce regions with uncertain outcomes require a more cautious approach feng et al 2016 siqueira et al 2021 fang et al 2022 despite the positive outcomes of our regional water yield simulations fig 8 the implementation of ecological restoration projects still requires careful consideration of local environmental conditions as well as scientifically sound management and species selection to prevent adverse environmental consequences jones et al 2022 our research primarily focuses on the impacts of regional vegetation restoration and climate change on et but the resulting ecohydrological changes will also have a significant impact future research can further investigate the feedback and interactions between climate change vegetation restoration and et by combining vegetation growth models regional climate models and et simulations with the aim of providing more scientific support for future forest management and regional ecological control practices in china 4 4 prospects and limitations this study has some limitations that require further improvement in future research firstly when attributing et variation we assumed that the influencing factors were independent of each other however in reality these factors may interact with each other such as an increase in temperature reducing relative humidity or a complex interaction between temperature and precipitation ma and zhang 2022 therefore the explanations of relative humidity and precipitation for et change attribution may be a by product of temperature change and should be further investigated in future research secondly we did not take into account the impact of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall high temperature heat waves and droughts on our long term analysis with the increasing global climate change the probability of extreme weather events has dramatically increased and their occurrence may have significant impacts on the regional water cycle findell et al 2017 in addition it is worth noting that multiple ecological protection projects including the three north shelterbelt project the grain for green project the grazing prohibition project and the comprehensive treatment of karst rocky desertification in southwest china were implemented in our study area rather than a single ecological project or a single ecological restoration measure shao et al 2022 in some regions where ecological projects are implemented in combination the comprehensive effects of ecological engineering measures have not been fully assessed future studies should consider a broader range of influential factors in et estimation to obtain more comprehensive conclusions despite the aforementioned limitations our study has consolidated the importance of et changes in hydrological processes promoted the understanding of climate variability and the role of vegetation restoration in water cycle and forest management and provided a scientific basis for the implementation of ecological restoration projects and the rational allocation of water resources in china however further research is needed to clarify the driving mechanisms of et changes across multiple scales in order to deepen our understanding of terrestrial ecohydrological change processes 5 conclusions based on the pattern process mechanism framework we have investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of et at both the nfpp image and regional scales in china as well as the past and future trends in et we have also explored the relationship between the response of et to vegetation restoration and climate change in response to the three important questions raised earlier our findings are as follows in the past 20 years et in the nfpp has exhibited a fluctuating increasing trend with significant increases mainly concentrated in the loess plateau area however future projections indicate that et in the nfpp will decrease continuously in 50 944 of the area while it will continue to increase in 49 056 of the area since 2000 the changes and distribution of et in the nfpp have been dominated by vegetation restoration 18 959 water conditions 18 460 and thermal conditions 56 526 the mechanisms behind et response to vegetation restoration and climate change are complex on one hand large scale vegetation expansion can lead to a significant increase in evaporative water consumption on the other hand climate change can directly or indirectly affect terrestrial et however at smaller scales et trends and their dominant factors vary from region to region overall our results suggest that revegetation has the potential to bring about favorable ecological effects on various components of nfpp this includes an increase in local ecosystems water production vegetation cover and carbon storage capacity however it is important to emphasize that restructuring and optimizing forestry projects should be a crucial part of ecological restoration efforts in order to minimize inefficient water use by vegetation this is essential for maintaining regional forest and water management especially in support of the un decade for ecosystem restoration which aims to reduce deforestation and restore forests to improve human well being on a global scale credit authorship contribution statement xiaofeng wang visualization methodology formal
