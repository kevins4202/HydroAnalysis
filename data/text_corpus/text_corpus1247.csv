6235,stormwater flow rate attenuation is an important component of stormwater management but the mechanisms governing peak flowrate attenuation have received limited attention in the green roof community previous green roof literature studies that have reported peak flow rate attenuation have focused on comparing the peak precipitation intensity with the peak drainage rate over a given storm event however peak drainage rates do not necessarily correspond with peak precipitation intensity if peak precipitation intensity occurs before field capacity is achieved as such use of event based flow rate attenuation does not facilitate investigation of the mechanisms governing peak flow rate attenuation this study combines field data collected on a 200 m2 green roof with a richards based numerical model to quantify and provide new insights into the mechanisms governing flow rate attenuation the average peak flow rate attenuation from all measured drainage events was 58 n 121 distinct rainfall peaks and the average peak delay was 12 8 min field capacity was found to be a statistically significant point where attenuation performance decreases peak stormwater flow rate attenuation below field capacity was found to be significantly higher than after field capacity is reached with capillary storage the dominant attenuation mechanism before field capacity is reached and routing and gravity storage important attenuation mechanisms after field capacity is reached the richards equation based numerical model yielded very good predictions of observed peak flow rates using laboratory derived model parameters and without the need for model calibration this study suggests that green roofs have considerable potential to attenuate stormwater flow rate thus helping to mitigate damage due to urban runoff and providing some protection against storm intensification associated with climate change the validated numerical model is a valuable tool for the prediction of stormwater flow rate attenuation in different climates and can therefore be used in green roof design and by regulators to better evaluate the potential benefits of green roofs keywords stormwater management stormwater attenuation capillary storage gravity storage routing 1 introduction rapid stormwater drainage from impervious surfaces in urban areas increases stress on municipal infrastructure and downstream environments e g channel erosion and increased flooding green roofs are a low impact development lid tool that can mitigate excessive stormwater drainage and its impacts dhalla and zimmer 2010 they are generally comprised of a waterproofing membrane and a drainage layer that is overlain by growing medium and vegetation in addition to retaining stormwater and thus reducing the volume of stormwater green roofs can attenuate i e reduce peak flow rates and delay peak stormwater flow rates dhalla and zimmer 2010 p ng and henry 2003 reduced flow rates decrease downstream environmental damage while peak run off delay reduces the total peak sewer flow rates by delaying the contribution from a green roof relative to runoff from impervious surfaces the stormwater management benefits that green roofs provide are now recognized by several large cities for instance the city of toronto canada requires a green roof on any newly constructed building with a floor area over 2000 m2 borooah and aster 2007 toronto municipal code chapter 492 green roofs 2017 with the increasing implementation of green roofs detailed knowledge of how green roofs attenuate and delay peak flow rates is essential to optimize their performance as a stormwater management tool the hydrology of a green roof is governed by unsaturated soil conditions assuming homogenous green roof growth media when precipitation falls on a green roof rain is held in the growing medium through capillary storage until field capacity is reached at which point drainage occurs fig 1 illustrates the water storage and drainage response of a green roof during two typical rain events field capacity is defined in a variety of ways in the soil literature but is commonly considered as the threshold below which soil water flux out of the rooting zone is negligible for deep soil profiles assouline and or 2014 twarakavi et al 2009 as it relates to green roofs we consider field capacity to be the point at which soil capillary pressure can no longer retain water in the medium this concept of field capacity is indicated in fig 1 the intersection of the horizontal and vertical dashed lines indicates the storage capacity and time at which there is no more capillary storage available and field capacity is reached in fig 1a there are three clear rainfall peaks the first two peaks are almost completely attenuated i e very little or no drainage from single green roof modules or from the full green roof but once field capacity is reached the peak attenuation response i e extent to which peak outflow is reduced relative to peak inflow changes considerably it is noted that there is some drainage before field capacity is reached for the september 11th 2013 rainfall event shown in fig 1 b this is likely a result of preferential flow paths present in the growth medium as has been reported in other studies liu and fassman beck 2016 zhang et al 2018 while the concept of field capacity has received some attention in green roof experimental monitoring akther et al 2018 bengtsson 2005 villarreal 2007 villarreal and bengtsson 2005 zhang et al 2018 and modelling studies hilten et al 2008 she and pang 2010 field capacity has generally only been considered in the context of the extent to which the green roof can retain precipitation volume as such the importance of field capacity on peak flow rate attenuation and delay fig 1 requires more investigation quantitative understanding and simulation of its impact to improve field design fig 1a also illustrates the effect of gravity storage the term gravity storage is used to describe transient water retention in the medium due to short lived imbalance between free drainage from the base of the module and rainfall intensity gravity storage occurs once field capacity is reached and the force applied by gravity overcomes the ability of soil capillaries to retain water providing only temporary storage the effects of gravity storage are not well quantified for green roofs bengtsson 2005 examined gravity storage using artificial rainfall experiments conducted by saturating one 4 1 25 m green roof plot and letting it drain to field capacity they found gravity storage varied with rain intensity 1 mm min rain resulted in almost 8 mm of gravity storage compared with only 4 mm of gravity storage when the rain intensity was reduced to 0 4 mm min in these experiments gravity storage was not directly measured but it was inferred from the experimental difference between rainfall and measured drainage rates results from the 1 8 m2 experimental green roof study of palla et al 2011 also suggest that gravity storage leads to peak flow rate attenuation 40 gravity storage has a lower attenuation potential than capillary storage but it is important to quantify the effects of gravity storage to improve design of green roofs for large storms or under wet conditions numerous studies have investigated green roof stormwater performance berardi et al 2014 berndtsson 2010 the volumetric retention of stormwater i e the difference in area under the rainfall curve and drainage curve in fig 1 has been found to range from 27 to 81 for extensive green roofs mentens et al 2006 while many studies have quantified stormwater retention there is a need for an improved mechanistic understanding of the attenuation and delay of peak stormwater drainage from green roofs johannessen et al 2019 shafique et al 2018 voyde et al 2010 analyzed 91 individual rain events to obtain an event average peak flow rate attenuation event peak rainfall relative to event peak drainage of 93 from a 250 m2 green roof with 70 mm medium depth in auckland new zealand average peak attenuation values of 57 were reported for 11 events using test plots 3 m 1 m with an 80 mm medium depth in sheffield england stovin 2010 89 from three roofs in michigan carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 an average of 51 81 depending on the green roof depth and plant species in athens greece soulis et al 2017a b and an average of 41 58 depending on the green roof design in hong kong wong and jim 2014 similarly hamouz et al 2018 soulis et al 2017b and stovin et al 2017 report event based peak flowrate attenuation of 80 97 20 100 and 8 7 100 respectively brand√£o et al 2017 reported peak attenuation of greater than 89 for 75 of the observed precipitation events hunt et al 2006 reported greater than 75 peak flow rate attenuation and palla et al 2011 reported peak flow rate attenuation of 89 and 72 for two different periods johannessen et al 2019 and johannessen et al 2018 more recently investigated event based peak flow rate attenuation as well as compared observed and simulated runoff rates generated using swmm at differing sites across norway they found event based peak flow rate attenuations of 65 90 and that the swmm model generally did a good job simulating runoff rates with the exception of peak rates these prior studies did not consider the various individual peaks within a rain event in their calculation of attenuation as shown in fig 1 rainfall intensity varies within individual rain events causing distinct identifiable rainfall and green roof drainage peaks given that attenuation clearly depends on antecedent moisture conditions and rainfall intensity fig 1 calculating the average attenuation for an event oversimplifies the attenuation amounts the traditional approach of calculating attenuation is only representative if the largest rainfall peak occurs after field capacity is reached or field capacity is not reached during the rain event the definition of peak attenuation used in prior literature simplifies the process thereby limiting detailed understanding of green roof attenuation to better understand and quantify the mechanisms by which green roofs attenuate peak flows individual rainfall and drainage peaks need to be considered rather than only the event peaks the method by which peak flow delay is typically quantified masks underlying processes similar to peak attenuation as outlined above some studies quantify peak delay as the time difference between the largest rainfall and drainage peaks during an event denardo et al 2005 and soulis et al 2017b reported a time delay on average of roughly 2 h and a median of 85 min respectively using this definition calculating time delays using this approach neglects the multiple peaks within an event and can relate two completely separate peaks this can considerably increase the time delay fig 1b alternatively other researchers calculate time delay as the time difference between the rainfall and drainage hydrograph centroid carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 stovin et al 2012 and wong and jim 2014 reported peak delay times of 2 16 h 1 h and 25 35 min respectively using this definition the centroid calculation method is not able to assess trends for the individual peaks within a rain event as illustrated in fig 1 the delay of peak flow rates may change depending on when the individual peak occurs during a rain event i e before or after field capacity an improved understanding of drainage delay associated with individual peaks within a rain event and the impact of field capacity on peak delay will ultimately improve green roof design and improve our understanding of the potential benefits of green roofs for stormwater management a fundamental factor in storm attenuation is routing of the runoff through a drainage system routing describes the downstream translation of runoff peaks through a drainage system it is important to distinguish drainage effects on attenuation from routing effects the former relates to properties of the green roof growth medium the latter arises from the hydraulics of the building routing effects depend on the channel geometry and arbitrary location of the output point which might be a rooftop flow gauge a point in the building drainage system or further downstream in a municipal storm drain bengtsson 2005 quantified drainage routing times for an experimental green roof set up finding that they ranged from 12 to 20 min depending on the artificial rain intensity used aside from this study routing is seldomly described in green roof studies simulation of green roof stormwater performance is required to guide the design of green roofs various modeling approaches have been used to simulate green roof stormwater performance including empirical models carson et al 2013 fassman beck et al 2013 locatelli et al 2014 mentens et al 2006 stovin et al 2017 and physical conceptual models brunetti et al 2016 carbone et al 2014 cipolla et al 2016 feitosa and wilkinson 2016 hakimdavar et al 2016 johannessen et al 2019 kasmin et al 2010 li et al 2019 liu and fassman beck 2016 palla et al 2011 2018 peng and stovin 2017 qin et al 2016 sandoval et al 2017 soulis et al 2017b stovin et al 2017 villarreal 2007 zhang and guo 2012 some studies have developed variably saturated porous media flow models based on richards equation to simulate the outflow hydrograph and peak attenuation in response to rain events hilten et al 2008 palla et al 2009 soulis et al 2017b hilten et al 2008 developed a richards equation model based hydrus 1d that was validated against data collected for a 37 m2 100 mm deep green roof at the university of georgia they measured field capacity and wilting point in the laboratory but other hydraulic parameters e g hydraulic conductivity assumed the medium properties were identical to that of sand once validated the model was used to simulate the drainage response to design storms linear regression of the observed to modelled drainage produced an r2 of 0 918 but a slope of 1 14 and errors of up to 19 mm of drainage for an event which had 35 mm of observed drainage similarly soulis et al 2017b calibrated model parameters in a hydrus 1d model reporting poor but acceptable agreement between observations and model results palla et al 2009 also developed a richards equation based model using swms 2d they simulated water flow through a 2d domain and compared the results to field data from a green roof in genoa italy model parameters e g residual and saturated moisture content hydraulic conductivity and the van genuchten soil parameters Œ± and n were calibrated by minimizing the difference between observed and simulated green roof retention peak flow rate and hydrograph centroid data for four rain events the model simulated retention to within a 15 error with satisfactory peak delays but underestimated peak flow rates these studies illustrate that variably saturated porous media models can be used to simulate stormwater drainage from green roofs however important soil parameters were arbitrary or calibrated to better test the predictive capabilities of richards equation based numerical models there is need to use independently quantified soil parameters in these models this would provide greater confidence in the ability of these models to simulate green roof drainage processes in green roofs where soil parameters were not calibrated a model validated with measured parameters can also be used to explore the sensitivity of green roof drainage response to changing parameters this study aims to provide mechanistic insight into stormwater attenuation and delay on green roofs by evaluating the role of capillary storage gravity storage conditions and routing on field data was collected on a green roof array installed in london ontario from july 28th to november 11th 2013 and april 11th to october 21st 2014 the mechanisms that affect peak stormwater attenuation and delay are quantified by analyzing individual rainfall peaks within storms this differs to the traditional approach of comparing total event peak rainfall and drainage the field data is then used to validate a predictive model based on the richards equation this model based only on independently measured parameters is a valuable tool that may be used to evaluate green roof stormwater performance and optimize design 2 methodology 2 1 site description the green roof site monitored in this study is located on the claudette mackay lassonde pavilion cmlp a leed gold building at western university in london ontario london has a moderate climate with cool winters and warm summers the average annual precipitation is 1012 mm of which 846 mm is rainfall environment canada 2015 the cmlp green roof is an extensive modular system supplied by liveroof 0 3 m 0 3 m and 0 6 m 0 3 m modules with a growth medium depth of 100 mm the green roof design includes a waterproof membrane over a conventional rooftop with modules arranged on top of the membrane the drainage layer is built into the base of the modules see ridges in fig 2 a the cmlp site has a permanent green roof installed in 2009 that covers roughly 200 m2 fig 2b as well as a separate highly instrumented green roof array fig 2c the permanent green roof has full plant coverage with sedum varieties that include sedum kamtschaticum sedum album sedum sexangulare and sedum spurium the instrumented array fig 2c that was used for detailed quantification of the hydrologic response was separated from the permanent green roof by about 3 m the instrumented array was approximately 4 m 3 m half of this array was unvegetated bare medium and the other half was vegetated with the same sedum mixture as the permanent roof unlike the permanent green roof the instrumented array was elevated 0 10 m above the waterproof membrane and underlain by insulation to facilitate installation of instruments green roof growth medium provided by liveroof is a heterogeneous engineered medium mainly consisting of haydite dolostone loam organic matter bark peat moss and fertilizer detailed analysis of both the thermal and hydrologic properties of the medium is provided by perelli 2014 table 1 2 2 field methods instruments were used to quantify the water balance at the green roof site from july 28th to november 11th 2013 and april 11th to october 21st 2014 i e data for winter months with snow cover were not used two tipping bucket rain gauges located immediately adjacent the instrumented array were calibrated separately for high hoskin scientific and low campbell scientific te525mm intensity rainfall events measured precipitation at 1 minute intervals data from these rain gauges were supplemented with 5 hoskin scientific manual rain gauges on the permanent green roof that were checked daily drainage was monitored using three measurement devices two devices measured drainage from individual 0 3 m 0 3 m modules in the instrumented green roof array prior to any routing effects fig 2d one of the single module drainage devices used a tipping bucket placed directly underneath the module to measure drainage the other single module drainage device used a load cell to continuously weigh water draining from the module this is referred to as an accumulating drainage gauge these two modular drainage devices had the same sedum mixture as the permanent and instrumented arrays and were staged alongside the vegetated half of the instrumented green roof array the third device was a weir system that measured drainage from a 98 m2 catchment area within the permanent green roof and accounts for the effects of routing the rectangular notched weir device receives drainage directly from two roof drains within the permanent green roof these roof drains are gravity fed through a single pipe circular conduit to the measurement weir located about 4 m and 10 m from the two drains respectively the height of water in the weir was monitored with a honeywell fp200 pressure transducer fig 2e it is acknowledged that there may be minor aerodynamic effects on the two modular drainage units placed adjacent to the instrumented array additionally this experimental design opted to utilize multiple drainage measurement tools as opposed to duplicates of a single measurement technique although this approach may introduce uncertainty in direct comparisons due to module heterogeneity water storage and evapotranspiration from the green roof were monitored using two mini lysimeter devices installed under the instrumented green roof array these devices used a sensitive load cell interface spi load cell with 25 lbf capacity mounted in an aluminum plate structure placed underneath two vegetated modules 0 3 m 0 3 m additionally two decagon ec 5 soil moisture probes were embedded within the modules being placed on the mini lysimeter devices to quantify volumetric water content at a depth of 50 mm i e mid medium depth the ec 5 probes were calibrated using the two point method outlined in sakaki et al 2008 1 Œ∏ adc Œ± adc dry Œ± adc sat Œ± adc dry Œ± œÜ where Œ± 2 5 and is specific to the ec 5 the adcsat and adcdry is the mv response multiplied by a factor of 1 3661 for saturated and dry soil conditions also specific to the ec 5 and œï is the porosity this method was also used in the characterization of the green roof medium by perelli 2014 all instruments collected data at 1 minute intervals using one campbell scientific cr10 and two cr10x data loggers a rain event was defined as any period of precipitation that resulted in at least two tips of a tipping bucket rain gauge this two tip minimum threshold was used to ensure that a single tip was not considered a rain event in case there was residual water in the tipping bucket from a previous rain event the end of a rain event was defined by 6 h of no precipitation getter et al 2007 stovin 2010 vanwoert et al 2005 voyde et al 2010 when drainage was still occurring more than 6 h after a rain event and rainfall occurred again the two events were merged green roof stormwater performance was evaluated by quantifying rainfall and drainage depth duration rainfall intensity peak flow intensities and peak flow delay as well as gravity and capillary storage previous studies have only considered attenuation by comparing largest peak rainfall rate and largest peak runoff rate over a rain event e g speak et al 2013 vanwoert et al 2005 in this study distinct rainfall peaks within individual rain events were compared to the corresponding drainage peaks to determine peak attenuation and delay the 1 minute data resolution was appropriate for identifying the corresponding rainfall and drainage peaks with a high degree of certainty peak flow rate attenuation is calculated as a percent flow reduction 2 a t t e n u a t i o n p

simulate water storage and drainage from the green roof in response to rain events the governing equation is 5a Œ∏ t z k Œ∏ h p z 1 with 5b s e 1 1 Œ± h p n m h p 0 1 h p 0 5c k r s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m

hydraulic conductivity m s 1 hp is the pressure head m se is effective saturation and kr is the relative permeability Œ± m 1 n and m 1 1 n are van genuchten parameters defined by the soil water retention curve swrc the swrc for the growth medium was measured in the laboratory fitted to determine van genuchten parameters perelli 2014 table 1 and used to relate the water content to the capillary forces of the growing medium specifically to model field capacity capillary storage and gravity storage the richards equation was solved using the subsurface flow module in comsol multiphysics chui and freyberg 2009 comsol multiphysics 4 4 2013 a 1d model domain was used with a 100 mm depth and a mesh element size of 1 mm individual rain events were simulated using a time varying flux boundary condition on the inlet top boundary to represent rainfall the flux across this boundary was specified using 1 minute resolution precipitation data the bottom outlet boundary was specified as a free drainage boundary with drainage allowed to occur when water saturation exceeded field capacity i e no water storage in the drainage layer she and pang 2010 6 drainage 0 s e f c k r k s s e f c where ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity m s and fc is field capacity fc for the simulations was determined to be 0 215 volumetric water content during the wet periods i e april may and september november and 0 193 during the drier period i e may september based on measured soil moisture data from the green roof fig 3 these values were determined by considering all events with drainage and identifying the moisture content when capillary storage was full and substantial drainage started the higher field capacity during the wet periods is attributed to higher moisture contents providing the stored water adequate time to diffuse into internal pores of the medium alternatively during the dry season these internal pores dry out resulting in a lower field capacity the soil moisture data fig 3 was also used to determine the residual water content Œ∏r by extrapolation of the volumetric water content at the end of the longer drying periods unfortunately these longer drying events were not long enough to achieve a residual water content in the modules the initial soil moisture for each simulation was based on measured soil moisture at the start of each event this represents one limitation of the predictive capabilities of the numerical model in order to make the numerical model completely predictive more work is needed to develop robust evapotranspiration predictive models for green roof systems the initial moisture distribution was assumed to be uniform with depth the model used a 1 minute time step consistent with available rainfall data simulations were run until drainage through the lower boundary ceased all parameter values used to solve the unsaturated flow equations were determined from field data laboratory tests or literature table 1 this eliminated the need for model calibration as such the objective is to test the model against observed data to determine if it can be used as a predictive tool rather than a validation of the suitability of richards equation for simulation of hydrologic processes in green roofs as done by previous studies hilten et al 2008 palla et al 2009 soulis et al 2017b simplifying model assumptions include neglecting macro porosity impact of roots or preferential paths micro porosity internal grain porosity vegetation effects i e no interception and stationarity in model parameters given these assumptions the model is unable to predict drainage before field capacity is reached as this is thought to occur due to preferential flow paths i e this was observed on september 11th 2013 fig 1b it is known that green roof properties such as pore structure with root growth or rearranging of fines change with time de ville et al 2017 perelli 2014 soulis et al 2017b however based on de ville et al 2017 we do not expect these properties to result in statistical differences in green roof performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 measured attenuation and delay in stormwater drainage ninety eight distinct rain events were quantified over the measurement periods of july 28th november 11th 2013 and april 11th october 21st 2014 event rainfall and runoff intensities during this period are shown in fig 4 in fig 4 rainfall duration is the time from the first recorded tip on a tipping bucket rain gauge until the final recorded tip runoff duration is the time during which water flowed over the weir and finally rainfall and runoff intensity is the cumulative volume divided by the duration event average rainfall and drainage intensity respectively the london intensity duration frequency idf curves based on 50 years of historical rain data are also presented for comparison environment canada 2015 six of the events were equivalent to or greater than a 2 year storm with one event approaching a 100 year storm the characteristics of the drainage events shown in red are distinctly different than the rainfall characteristics nearly half of the rain events produced no drainage as indicated by the greater number of rain events shown in fig 4 most of the longer duration rain events produced drainage and as expected the drainage was of longer duration shift right and lower intensity shift down compared to the rainfall for instance for rain events that produced drainage the average rain duration and intensity are 10 70 h and 2 84 mm hr respectively compared to 18 54 h and 0 46 mm hr respectively for the average drainage duration and intensity the six large events that have over a 2 year return period have average rainfall duration and intensity of 20 0 h and 4 20 mm hr while the average drainage duration and intensity for these events are 34 6 h and 1 62 mm hr drainage intensity for the largest rainfall event 50 100 year return period decreased to about a 10 year storm these results highlight the overall stormwater management benefits that green roofs provide in increasing the duration and decreasing intensity of events specifically for large return period events johannessen et al 2018 also reported similar reductions in drainage intensity in comparison to precipitation intensity as well as a decrease in exceedance probability of high intensity drainage and associated prolonged duration over which water drained from the green roof this analysis however only considers event averages as such this analysis does not investigate the mechanisms causing attenuation and delay including the impact of field capacity this is important as prior to field capacity precipitation is stored in the green roof growth media through capillary action however after field capacity water is not stored in this manner to more closely evaluate the ability of green roofs to attenuate peak flow rates detailed attenuation analysis of each of the 50 events that produced a drainage event was conducted there were 121 distinct rainfall peaks within the 50 events that had drainage 66 of these peaks occurred before the green roof achieved field capacity and 55 peaks occurred after field capacity table 2 provides an overview of the average peak flow rate attenuation and delay results the average peak flow rate attenuation is 58 this is similar to moran and hunt 2005 and stovin 2010 who found peak flow rate attenuation of 57 and wong and jim 2014 with a range of 41 58 but dissimilar to the findings of voyde et al 2010 93 carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 89 and johannessen et al 2018 65 90 these previous studies used event peak flow rates to calculate the attenuation as well as including events with no drainage in the attenuation statistics these differences would result in larger peak attenuation values explaining the higher attenuation values reported by voyde et al 2010 carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 and johannessen et al 2018 the comparatively low values reported by moran and hunt 2005 and stovin 2010 may be due to the small sample sizes in their studies 13 and 11 events respectively the average time delay between rainfall and drainage peaks is 12 8 min if a rainfall peak occurred but there was no drainage the peak was omitted from time delay averages the calculated time delay differs from wong and jim 2014 who reported peak delays of 25 35 min denardo et al 2005 who found peak delays of about 2 h and also villarreal 2007 who found peak delays of 1 min both using the event peak rainfall and event peak drainage time difference the results of carter and rasmussen 2006 are most similar to this study where 57 of storms were found to have delays ranging from 0 to 10 min of note is that this study also used event peak rainfall and drainage values quantifying average attenuation and delay using event peaks as opposed to individual rainfall peaks over the entire monitoring period over which the storm hydrograph was quantified does not provide insight into the processes that control green roof attenuation and delay peak attenuation and delay are a function of the specific storage mechanisms occurring i e capillary and gravity storage and routing as well as the growth medium moisture content when the rainfall peak occurred i e greater or lower than field capacity comparison of single module drainage to the runoff response for the full green roof i e using the weir also enables quantification of the various processes influencing attenuation e g the importance of capillary and gravity storage in comparison to routing the influence of field capacity on flow rate attenuation was assessed by comparing drainage versus rainfall rate for peaks when the medium was initially below and above field capacity results shown in fig 5 indicate considerable flow rate attenuation with all data falling below the 1 1 lines that represent zero attenuation before field capacity the regression slopes indicate 72 peak attenuation due to capillary storage for the single module drainage and 79 attenuation for full roof runoff due to capillary storage and routing fig 5a it is noted that r2 values indicate considerable data scatter and this is because field capacity has not been reached these attenuation values differ slightly from those reported in table 2 since trendlines represent the best fit of drainage versus rainfall intensities whereas table 2 reports the arithmetic average of all attenuation values from drainage events the average peak attenuation presented in table 2 before field capacity was 77 for single module and 88 for full roof drainage the difference between the single module and full roof drainage values is due to routing the drainage routing increased peak attenuation by 11 and increased peak delay by 11 2 min table 2 when we consider fig 5a routing increased attenuation by 7 it is noted that routing of this nature would occur on a conventional roof above field capacity the regression line slopes are larger i e less attenuation and correlations are improved i e r2 0 93 fig 5b the impact of drainage routing also becomes more important in flow attenuation the full roof runoff measurements suggest 33 attenuation compared with 22 for single module drainage fig 5b as such the effect of routing increases the attenuation performance by a factor of 1 5 this finding is also confirmed from data presented in table 2 above field capacity comparison of the average single module attenuation 29 and the full roof attenuation 47 showed that routing increased attenuation by 18 and increased the peak delay by 6 8 min based on table 2 routing accounts for an additional 11 attenuation below field capacity whereas above field capacity routing adds 18 of the total attenuation this means that routing has a greater contribution to peak attenuation after field capacity to statistically assess the influence of field capacity on the peak rainfall and drainage flow rate data for the rain gauge single module drainage and full roof runoff were plotted as cumulative probability distributions before and after field capacity fig 6 a and b these plots were made by ranking the monitored peak flow rates by size and calculating the cumulative probability that is associated with each flow rate based upon the rank the cumulative probability value represents the percentage of monitored peaks equal to or less than the corresponding flow rate on the x axis similar plots were presented by johannessen et al 2018 however they did not distinguish between before and after field capacity the kolmogorov smirnov non parametric test was used to determine significance the test failed to find any significant difference between the distribution of rainfall before and after field capacity significant differences were found between the single module drainage flow rates before and after field capacity Œ± 0 001 and between full roof runoff flow rates before and after field capacity Œ± 0 001 this analysis indicates that attenuation performance of a green roof significantly decreases after field capacity is reached and therefore field capacity is a quantifiable point where attenuation performance of a green roof significantly decreases these peak flowrate attenuation results differ from those of hamouz et al 2018 who reported similar peak flowrate attenuation irrespective of initial water saturation in the growth media differences between the two studies may be that initial saturations in the study of hamouz et al 2018 were similar for the five reported events i e 32 1 to 35 7 differences in the drainage layer and that their growth media was different i e expanded clay than in this study another previous study reported that the moisture condition at the start of a rainfall event was weakly correlated to attenuation performance soulis et al 2017a as discussed rainfall peaks need to be associated with their associated runoff peaks and attenuation should not be quantified solely in terms of the largest peak rainfall and largest peak runoff during a rainfall event as peak rainfall may have occurred before field capacity was achieved and peak runoff may have occurred after field capacity was achieved attenuation is significantly greater before field capacity due to capillary storage availability after field capacity is reached drainage is only attenuated by temporary gravity storage and routing this is illustrated by the single module drainage data shown in fig 5b bengtsson 2005 noted the presence of gravity storage after field capacity was reached for artificial rain experiments however the gravity storage values were not directly quantified but inferred from convergence of the rainfall and drainage rates here the peak gravity storage was directly measured as mm of storage for each individual peak above field capacity fig 7 consistent with bengtsson 2005 gravity storage increased as rain intensity increases the spearman correlation for non parametric data shows a statistically positive correlation 0 735 between rain intensity and gravity storage this indicates that gravity storage is dynamic with more water temporarily stored when the rainfall intensity is higher 3 2 numerical model simulation of field data the green roof drainage response to 33 separate events i e events with drainage monitored in 2014 after the accumulating drainage unit was installed was simulated using the richards equation based model to assess the predictive capabilities of the numerical model as the model is 1d and does not account for routing effects the simulations results were compared with the single module drainage measurements the measured and simulated outflow hydrographs for three representative rain events are shown in fig 8 these simulated events were selected as they highlight a wide range of characteristics of the hydrograph including time to initiation of drainage storage peak flow rate attenuation and delay the simulated results match well with the measured green roof module drainage the simulated initiation of drainage shown in fig 8b is slightly delayed relative to the measured data this discrepancy is attributed to uncertainty in the soil moisture data which was obtained using ec 5 instruments installed at mid depth only and used as the initial soil moisture in the model domain however after drainage commenced the simulated and measured outflow hydrographs are almost identical fig 8a and c both show greater model accuracy with respect to the initiation of drainage the simulated peak flow rates delays and drainage volumes qualitatively correspond well to the measured data aggregate metrics for comparing the simulated and measured results for the events shown in fig 8 are provided in table 3 three metrics were selected to statistically assess the performance of the model in simulated rain events volume of water retained in the green roof capillary storage volume of water drained from the green roof and peak flow rates fig 9 these metrics were selected rather than using a standard error calculation such as rmse which would show bias between events i e exaggerating error for longer events with larger flow rates a comparison of the simulated and measured capillary storage and drainage for all 33 events simulated are shown in fig 9a and b respectively simulated drainage is calculated as the cumulative flux through the bottom outflow boundary over the event the relationship between the simulated and measured capillary storage yields a slope of 0 96 and an r2 of 0 93 the spearman coefficient œÅ was calculated to be 0 892 indicating a strong positive nonparametric correlation the mann whitney u test failed to show a significant difference in medians between the model and observed storage values p 0 705 the scatter about the 1 1 line is likely due to uncertainty regarding the initial moisture conditions or the model assumption of no evaporation during the rain event the same statistical analysis was conducted for drainage predictions with results suggesting an even greater correlation between simulated and measured drainage the slope of the linear trendline is 1 025 with an r2 of 0 99 and the spearman coefficient is 0 964 the mann whitney u test failed to show a significant difference between the model and observed drainage median p 0 682 the simulated and measured drainage likely correlate better than the storage values as drainage is directly affected by the amount of rainfall for each event i e an error of 2 mm in simulated capillary storage will have minimal effect on the cumulative drainage amount for a large rain event the correlation between the individual simulated and measured peak flow rates is not as strong as the other two metrics fig 9c the slope of the trendline is 0 91 implying a small but consistent underestimation of peak flow rates the trendline is influenced by a few large peak flow rates that were underestimated i e far right data point in fig 9c additionally there are some data points that lie on the x axis showing no simulated drainage the slight underestimation of some large peaks and no simulated drainage for other cases may be due to uncertainty in the initial moisture conditions for example poor estimation of initial moisture conditions would affect the relative permeability model during the peak causing a slightly smaller simulated peak flow rate for cases of no simulated drainage there is a possibility of preferential flow in the module which is not captured in the richards equation based model the initial condition measurement could be improved in future studies by having duplicate soil moisture measurements in different modules and at different depths to account for heterogeneity in the green roof medium the study of johannessen et al 2019 reported good agreement between model and observed flow rate for data collected at a range of sites in norway when model parameters were calibrated for each individual site they do however note some over and under model prediction of observed peak flow rate palla et al 2009 also found peak flow rates to be underestimated in their model the r2 value for the trendline was 0 95 and the spearman coefficient is 0 815 the mann whitney u test indicated that there is no significant difference between the simulated and observed peak flow rates p 0 352 nevertheless the simulated outflow hydrographs show that the numerical model was able to accurately predict outflow hydrographs from a green roof medium without any parameter calibration the utility of laboratory derived parameters for model prediction of field observation has received some attention in the literature in the present study use of laboratory derived parameters resulted in good model predictions of field observations however the study of johannessen et al 2019 reported model discrepancies when laboratory derived parameters were used to predict green roof performance at multiple sites the reason for differences in results between the studies could be due to the fact that the scale of the norwegian green roof sites was larger the use of different models e g richard s equation based model vs swmm and potentially some ageing of the green roof grown media resulting in parameters changing with time de ville et al 2017 perelli 2014 soulis et al 2017b although change in green roof parameters has been quantified for the green roof media used in this study perelli 2014 the good agreement between model results and field observations in this study suggest that results from the richard s equation based model are insensitive to the range of observed parameter change a literature report also suggested that change in green roof growth media parameters did not significantly impact performance metrics de ville et al 2017 3 3 numerical model sensitivity analyses a sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of growth medium parameters van genuchten soil parameters Œ± and n hydraulic conductivity and field capacity table 4 on green roof retention and attenuation performance the analysis was conducted considering the initial soil moisture was at field capacity and that it was at residual moisture content it is noted that for simulations when the initial soil moisture was at field capacity a field capacity equivalent to that of the base case was used as the initial soil moisture i e for sensitivity analyses that increased or decreased the field capacity the base case field capacity was used as the initial condition an improved understanding of the impact of growth medium properties on performance will ultimately help further engineer these properties for optimal green roof performance for a given metric e g retention or attenuation for example simulation results show that higher field capacity leads to greater retention values e g for the case when the growth medium is at field capacity storage increased from 0 9 mm for the base case to 8 6 mm when field capacity increased by 50 but also leads to slightly less attenuation of peak flow rates if the green roof is initially at field capacity e g increasing field capacity by 50 when the growth medium was at field capacity decreased peak flux from 4 0 10 5 m s for the base case to 3 7 10 5 m s table 4 increased peak flux with increasing field capacity is due to increased relative permeability in the growth medium with greater water content at larger field capacity if the green roof is initially at residual water saturation then increasing the field capacity increases both retention and attenuation e g for the base case storage is 18 2 mm and peak flux is 2 2 10 5 m s whereas when field capacity is increased by 50 storage is 29 1 mm and peak flux is 1 3 10 5 m s table 4 as a greater amount of rainfall is retained in capillary storage reducing the time during which drainage occurs this analysis suggests that growth media could be designed to have an optimal field capacity that limits peak flow rates for a given design storm to a preferred lower drainage rate however this may come at the expense of retaining a lower precipitation volume if the green roof is at field capacity at the initiation of a given storm the impact of hydraulic conductivity is as expected with increasing hydraulic conductivity decreasing peak flow rate attenuation e g when the growth medium is initially at field capacity the peak flux increased from 2 2 10 5 m s for the base case to 2 8 10 5 m s when hydraulic conductivity increased by 50 but having a negligible impact on retention sensitivity analyses were also conducted to evaluate the influence of capillary pressure saturation parameters i e the van genuchten soil parameters Œ± and n but only for cases where the system was initially at residual water saturation the van genuchten soil parameters specifically n had a considerable impact on attenuation and retention van genuchten n parameter is a measure of the pore size distribution of the medium with larger n corresponding to a more uniform pore size distribution while smaller n corresponds to a more graded pore size distribution as such n impacts both the capillary pressure saturation curve and the relative permeability saturation curve as n increases the relative permeability increases and the capillary pressure saturation curve is more uniform i e flatter resulting in less attenuation and slightly less rainfall retention e g retention of 18 2 mm and a peak flux of 2 2 10 5 m s for the base case retention of 16 5 mm and a peak flux of 2 9 10 5 m s when n increases by 50 table 4 alternatively when n decreases there is increased attenuation and decreased rainfall retention as n decreases drainage occurs over a longer period these results are interesting in that both increasing and decreasing n from the base case resulted in reduced retention with the magnitude of decreased retention greater for the decrease in n Œ± had limited impact on attenuation and retention this is likely since the shape of the capillary pressure saturation relationship does not change only the pressure at which air will displace water resulting in a translation up or down the capillary pressure axis this sensitivity analysis suggests that the model is a valuable tool that could be applied to identify ideal soil characteristics for a given climate to achieve either improved retention and or improved attenuation for stormwater management applications finally the validated model was applied to a range of design storms fig 10 to evaluate the influence of a green roof on the stormwater response for long return period events fig 10 shows simulation results for 2 25 and 100 year storms with initial conditions at field capacity meaning that no capillary storage was available only gravity storage the us department of agriculture soil conservation service scs design storm hyetographs were used as the rainfall input for 10 min 1 h 8 h and 24 h storms modelled for green roofs with 0 1 m and 0 2 m growth medium depth while the design storms simulated are specific to london ontario given the model is predictive it could also be used to simulate design storms in different regions large reductions in drainage were seen for the 10 min and 1 h design storms at all modelled return periods for a 0 1 m medium depth the 10 min and 1 h storm model scenarios predict a reduction in event intensity of 74 and 26 respectively while a 0 2 m medium depth would reduce the event intensity by 91 and 58 respectively fig 10 for longer duration storms 8 h and 24 h simulations suggest that a green roof provides limited attenuation of peak flow rate as the increase in storm duration means that the flow rate at the bottom of the module matches the precipitation rate i e gravity storage reaches steady state 4 conclusions the average peak flow rate attenuation from 98 events in london ontario from 2013 to 2014 was calculated to be 58 this average attenuation provides little information related to the underlying processes governing peak flow rate attenuation detailed analysis of individual rain and drainage peaks within rain events showed that before field capacity capillary storage accounts for the largest component of peak flow rate attenuation 72 and routing has a minor effect 7 however after field capacity drainage routing becomes considerably more important 11 and gravity storage also results in peak flow attenuation 22 when the green roof medium reaches field capacity this represents a statistically significant point at which attenuation efficiency decreases the green roof drainage response was simulated using a richards equation based model hilten et al 2008 palla et al 2009 and soulis et al 2017b previously modelled green roofs using the richards equation but their models were calibrated using field data the model used here is a predictive tool that used laboratory derived relationships and field data without calibration of any parameters the model provided very good predictions of observed data all performance metrics i e water storage event drainage and peak flow rates suggest a high degree of correlation between the model and observed values the model presented here could be used to estimate the retention of different green roof designs including the effects of varying media composition and depth and also to predict outflow hydrographs for green roofs the limitation of the model is that it requires initial soil moisture conditions and soil parameters to address this limitation the model could be coupled with an evapotranspiration model to enable for long term simulations and thus soil moisture dynamics to be calculated between rain events additionally it is recommended that further work incorporate a routing model it is noted that this study only simulated one green roof as such it is recommended that the extent to which laboratory derived parameters such as the one s characterized here and the modelling approach be investigated on multiple roofs as shown by the field data incorporation of this attenuation mechanism is particularly important once field capacity is reached green roofs have been empirically proven to provide substantial attenuation of peak flow rates understanding the fundamental process of green roof attenuation is needed to guide and optimize green roof design the development of an accurate predictive tool for green roofs will assist stormwater engineers in effective implementation of green roofs as lid results from this study suggest that green roofs have significant potential to attenuate storm water flow rate and mitigate against the impact of extreme events associated with climate change in urban areas declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this research was supported by a natural sciences and engineering research council of canada nserc strategic grant stpgp

6235,stormwater flow rate attenuation is an important component of stormwater management but the mechanisms governing peak flowrate attenuation have received limited attention in the green roof community previous green roof literature studies that have reported peak flow rate attenuation have focused on comparing the peak precipitation intensity with the peak drainage rate over a given storm event however peak drainage rates do not necessarily correspond with peak precipitation intensity if peak precipitation intensity occurs before field capacity is achieved as such use of event based flow rate attenuation does not facilitate investigation of the mechanisms governing peak flow rate attenuation this study combines field data collected on a 200 m2 green roof with a richards based numerical model to quantify and provide new insights into the mechanisms governing flow rate attenuation the average peak flow rate attenuation from all measured drainage events was 58 n 121 distinct rainfall peaks and the average peak delay was 12 8 min field capacity was found to be a statistically significant point where attenuation performance decreases peak stormwater flow rate attenuation below field capacity was found to be significantly higher than after field capacity is reached with capillary storage the dominant attenuation mechanism before field capacity is reached and routing and gravity storage important attenuation mechanisms after field capacity is reached the richards equation based numerical model yielded very good predictions of observed peak flow rates using laboratory derived model parameters and without the need for model calibration this study suggests that green roofs have considerable potential to attenuate stormwater flow rate thus helping to mitigate damage due to urban runoff and providing some protection against storm intensification associated with climate change the validated numerical model is a valuable tool for the prediction of stormwater flow rate attenuation in different climates and can therefore be used in green roof design and by regulators to better evaluate the potential benefits of green roofs keywords stormwater management stormwater attenuation capillary storage gravity storage routing 1 introduction rapid stormwater drainage from impervious surfaces in urban areas increases stress on municipal infrastructure and downstream environments e g channel erosion and increased flooding green roofs are a low impact development lid tool that can mitigate excessive stormwater drainage and its impacts dhalla and zimmer 2010 they are generally comprised of a waterproofing membrane and a drainage layer that is overlain by growing medium and vegetation in addition to retaining stormwater and thus reducing the volume of stormwater green roofs can attenuate i e reduce peak flow rates and delay peak stormwater flow rates dhalla and zimmer 2010 p ng and henry 2003 reduced flow rates decrease downstream environmental damage while peak run off delay reduces the total peak sewer flow rates by delaying the contribution from a green roof relative to runoff from impervious surfaces the stormwater management benefits that green roofs provide are now recognized by several large cities for instance the city of toronto canada requires a green roof on any newly constructed building with a floor area over 2000 m2 borooah and aster 2007 toronto municipal code chapter 492 green roofs 2017 with the increasing implementation of green roofs detailed knowledge of how green roofs attenuate and delay peak flow rates is essential to optimize their performance as a stormwater management tool the hydrology of a green roof is governed by unsaturated soil conditions assuming homogenous green roof growth media when precipitation falls on a green roof rain is held in the growing medium through capillary storage until field capacity is reached at which point drainage occurs fig 1 illustrates the water storage and drainage response of a green roof during two typical rain events field capacity is defined in a variety of ways in the soil literature but is commonly considered as the threshold below which soil water flux out of the rooting zone is negligible for deep soil profiles assouline and or 2014 twarakavi et al 2009 as it relates to green roofs we consider field capacity to be the point at which soil capillary pressure can no longer retain water in the medium this concept of field capacity is indicated in fig 1 the intersection of the horizontal and vertical dashed lines indicates the storage capacity and time at which there is no more capillary storage available and field capacity is reached in fig 1a there are three clear rainfall peaks the first two peaks are almost completely attenuated i e very little or no drainage from single green roof modules or from the full green roof but once field capacity is reached the peak attenuation response i e extent to which peak outflow is reduced relative to peak inflow changes considerably it is noted that there is some drainage before field capacity is reached for the september 11th 2013 rainfall event shown in fig 1 b this is likely a result of preferential flow paths present in the growth medium as has been reported in other studies liu and fassman beck 2016 zhang et al 2018 while the concept of field capacity has received some attention in green roof experimental monitoring akther et al 2018 bengtsson 2005 villarreal 2007 villarreal and bengtsson 2005 zhang et al 2018 and modelling studies hilten et al 2008 she and pang 2010 field capacity has generally only been considered in the context of the extent to which the green roof can retain precipitation volume as such the importance of field capacity on peak flow rate attenuation and delay fig 1 requires more investigation quantitative understanding and simulation of its impact to improve field design fig 1a also illustrates the effect of gravity storage the term gravity storage is used to describe transient water retention in the medium due to short lived imbalance between free drainage from the base of the module and rainfall intensity gravity storage occurs once field capacity is reached and the force applied by gravity overcomes the ability of soil capillaries to retain water providing only temporary storage the effects of gravity storage are not well quantified for green roofs bengtsson 2005 examined gravity storage using artificial rainfall experiments conducted by saturating one 4 1 25 m green roof plot and letting it drain to field capacity they found gravity storage varied with rain intensity 1 mm min rain resulted in almost 8 mm of gravity storage compared with only 4 mm of gravity storage when the rain intensity was reduced to 0 4 mm min in these experiments gravity storage was not directly measured but it was inferred from the experimental difference between rainfall and measured drainage rates results from the 1 8 m2 experimental green roof study of palla et al 2011 also suggest that gravity storage leads to peak flow rate attenuation 40 gravity storage has a lower attenuation potential than capillary storage but it is important to quantify the effects of gravity storage to improve design of green roofs for large storms or under wet conditions numerous studies have investigated green roof stormwater performance berardi et al 2014 berndtsson 2010 the volumetric retention of stormwater i e the difference in area under the rainfall curve and drainage curve in fig 1 has been found to range from 27 to 81 for extensive green roofs mentens et al 2006 while many studies have quantified stormwater retention there is a need for an improved mechanistic understanding of the attenuation and delay of peak stormwater drainage from green roofs johannessen et al 2019 shafique et al 2018 voyde et al 2010 analyzed 91 individual rain events to obtain an event average peak flow rate attenuation event peak rainfall relative to event peak drainage of 93 from a 250 m2 green roof with 70 mm medium depth in auckland new zealand average peak attenuation values of 57 were reported for 11 events using test plots 3 m 1 m with an 80 mm medium depth in sheffield england stovin 2010 89 from three roofs in michigan carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 an average of 51 81 depending on the green roof depth and plant species in athens greece soulis et al 2017a b and an average of 41 58 depending on the green roof design in hong kong wong and jim 2014 similarly hamouz et al 2018 soulis et al 2017b and stovin et al 2017 report event based peak flowrate attenuation of 80 97 20 100 and 8 7 100 respectively brand√£o et al 2017 reported peak attenuation of greater than 89 for 75 of the observed precipitation events hunt et al 2006 reported greater than 75 peak flow rate attenuation and palla et al 2011 reported peak flow rate attenuation of 89 and 72 for two different periods johannessen et al 2019 and johannessen et al 2018 more recently investigated event based peak flow rate attenuation as well as compared observed and simulated runoff rates generated using swmm at differing sites across norway they found event based peak flow rate attenuations of 65 90 and that the swmm model generally did a good job simulating runoff rates with the exception of peak rates these prior studies did not consider the various individual peaks within a rain event in their calculation of attenuation as shown in fig 1 rainfall intensity varies within individual rain events causing distinct identifiable rainfall and green roof drainage peaks given that attenuation clearly depends on antecedent moisture conditions and rainfall intensity fig 1 calculating the average attenuation for an event oversimplifies the attenuation amounts the traditional approach of calculating attenuation is only representative if the largest rainfall peak occurs after field capacity is reached or field capacity is not reached during the rain event the definition of peak attenuation used in prior literature simplifies the process thereby limiting detailed understanding of green roof attenuation to better understand and quantify the mechanisms by which green roofs attenuate peak flows individual rainfall and drainage peaks need to be considered rather than only the event peaks the method by which peak flow delay is typically quantified masks underlying processes similar to peak attenuation as outlined above some studies quantify peak delay as the time difference between the largest rainfall and drainage peaks during an event denardo et al 2005 and soulis et al 2017b reported a time delay on average of roughly 2 h and a median of 85 min respectively using this definition calculating time delays using this approach neglects the multiple peaks within an event and can relate two completely separate peaks this can considerably increase the time delay fig 1b alternatively other researchers calculate time delay as the time difference between the rainfall and drainage hydrograph centroid carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 stovin et al 2012 and wong and jim 2014 reported peak delay times of 2 16 h 1 h and 25 35 min respectively using this definition the centroid calculation method is not able to assess trends for the individual peaks within a rain event as illustrated in fig 1 the delay of peak flow rates may change depending on when the individual peak occurs during a rain event i e before or after field capacity an improved understanding of drainage delay associated with individual peaks within a rain event and the impact of field capacity on peak delay will ultimately improve green roof design and improve our understanding of the potential benefits of green roofs for stormwater management a fundamental factor in storm attenuation is routing of the runoff through a drainage system routing describes the downstream translation of runoff peaks through a drainage system it is important to distinguish drainage effects on attenuation from routing effects the former relates to properties of the green roof growth medium the latter arises from the hydraulics of the building routing effects depend on the channel geometry and arbitrary location of the output point which might be a rooftop flow gauge a point in the building drainage system or further downstream in a municipal storm drain bengtsson 2005 quantified drainage routing times for an experimental green roof set up finding that they ranged from 12 to 20 min depending on the artificial rain intensity used aside from this study routing is seldomly described in green roof studies simulation of green roof stormwater performance is required to guide the design of green roofs various modeling approaches have been used to simulate green roof stormwater performance including empirical models carson et al 2013 fassman beck et al 2013 locatelli et al 2014 mentens et al 2006 stovin et al 2017 and physical conceptual models brunetti et al 2016 carbone et al 2014 cipolla et al 2016 feitosa and wilkinson 2016 hakimdavar et al 2016 johannessen et al 2019 kasmin et al 2010 li et al 2019 liu and fassman beck 2016 palla et al 2011 2018 peng and stovin 2017 qin et al 2016 sandoval et al 2017 soulis et al 2017b stovin et al 2017 villarreal 2007 zhang and guo 2012 some studies have developed variably saturated porous media flow models based on richards equation to simulate the outflow hydrograph and peak attenuation in response to rain events hilten et al 2008 palla et al 2009 soulis et al 2017b hilten et al 2008 developed a richards equation model based hydrus 1d that was validated against data collected for a 37 m2 100 mm deep green roof at the university of georgia they measured field capacity and wilting point in the laboratory but other hydraulic parameters e g hydraulic conductivity assumed the medium properties were identical to that of sand once validated the model was used to simulate the drainage response to design storms linear regression of the observed to modelled drainage produced an r2 of 0 918 but a slope of 1 14 and errors of up to 19 mm of drainage for an event which had 35 mm of observed drainage similarly soulis et al 2017b calibrated model parameters in a hydrus 1d model reporting poor but acceptable agreement between observations and model results palla et al 2009 also developed a richards equation based model using swms 2d they simulated water flow through a 2d domain and compared the results to field data from a green roof in genoa italy model parameters e g residual and saturated moisture content hydraulic conductivity and the van genuchten soil parameters Œ± and n were calibrated by minimizing the difference between observed and simulated green roof retention peak flow rate and hydrograph centroid data for four rain events the model simulated retention to within a 15 error with satisfactory peak delays but underestimated peak flow rates these studies illustrate that variably saturated porous media models can be used to simulate stormwater drainage from green roofs however important soil parameters were arbitrary or calibrated to better test the predictive capabilities of richards equation based numerical models there is need to use independently quantified soil parameters in these models this would provide greater confidence in the ability of these models to simulate green roof drainage processes in green roofs where soil parameters were not calibrated a model validated with measured parameters can also be used to explore the sensitivity of green roof drainage response to changing parameters this study aims to provide mechanistic insight into stormwater attenuation and delay on green roofs by evaluating the role of capillary storage gravity storage conditions and routing on field data was collected on a green roof array installed in london ontario from july 28th to november 11th 2013 and april 11th to october 21st 2014 the mechanisms that affect peak stormwater attenuation and delay are quantified by analyzing individual rainfall peaks within storms this differs to the traditional approach of comparing total event peak rainfall and drainage the field data is then used to validate a predictive model based on the richards equation this model based only on independently measured parameters is a valuable tool that may be used to evaluate green roof stormwater performance and optimize design 2 methodology 2 1 site description the green roof site monitored in this study is located on the claudette mackay lassonde pavilion cmlp a leed gold building at western university in london ontario london has a moderate climate with cool winters and warm summers the average annual precipitation is 1012 mm of which 846 mm is rainfall environment canada 2015 the cmlp green roof is an extensive modular system supplied by liveroof 0 3 m 0 3 m and 0 6 m 0 3 m modules with a growth medium depth of 100 mm the green roof design includes a waterproof membrane over a conventional rooftop with modules arranged on top of the membrane the drainage layer is built into the base of the modules see ridges in fig 2 a the cmlp site has a permanent green roof installed in 2009 that covers roughly 200 m2 fig 2b as well as a separate highly instrumented green roof array fig 2c the permanent green roof has full plant coverage with sedum varieties that include sedum kamtschaticum sedum album sedum sexangulare and sedum spurium the instrumented array fig 2c that was used for detailed quantification of the hydrologic response was separated from the permanent green roof by about 3 m the instrumented array was approximately 4 m 3 m half of this array was unvegetated bare medium and the other half was vegetated with the same sedum mixture as the permanent roof unlike the permanent green roof the instrumented array was elevated 0 10 m above the waterproof membrane and underlain by insulation to facilitate installation of instruments green roof growth medium provided by liveroof is a heterogeneous engineered medium mainly consisting of haydite dolostone loam organic matter bark peat moss and fertilizer detailed analysis of both the thermal and hydrologic properties of the medium is provided by perelli 2014 table 1 2 2 field methods instruments were used to quantify the water balance at the green roof site from july 28th to november 11th 2013 and april 11th to october 21st 2014 i e data for winter months with snow cover were not used two tipping bucket rain gauges located immediately adjacent the instrumented array were calibrated separately for high hoskin scientific and low campbell scientific te525mm intensity rainfall events measured precipitation at 1 minute intervals data from these rain gauges were supplemented with 5 hoskin scientific manual rain gauges on the permanent green roof that were checked daily drainage was monitored using three measurement devices two devices measured drainage from individual 0 3 m 0 3 m modules in the instrumented green roof array prior to any routing effects fig 2d one of the single module drainage devices used a tipping bucket placed directly underneath the module to measure drainage the other single module drainage device used a load cell to continuously weigh water draining from the module this is referred to as an accumulating drainage gauge these two modular drainage devices had the same sedum mixture as the permanent and instrumented arrays and were staged alongside the vegetated half of the instrumented green roof array the third device was a weir system that measured drainage from a 98 m2 catchment area within the permanent green roof and accounts for the effects of routing the rectangular notched weir device receives drainage directly from two roof drains within the permanent green roof these roof drains are gravity fed through a single pipe circular conduit to the measurement weir located about 4 m and 10 m from the two drains respectively the height of water in the weir was monitored with a honeywell fp200 pressure transducer fig 2e it is acknowledged that there may be minor aerodynamic effects on the two modular drainage units placed adjacent to the instrumented array additionally this experimental design opted to utilize multiple drainage measurement tools as opposed to duplicates of a single measurement technique although this approach may introduce uncertainty in direct comparisons due to module heterogeneity water storage and evapotranspiration from the green roof were monitored using two mini lysimeter devices installed under the instrumented green roof array these devices used a sensitive load cell interface spi load cell with 25 lbf capacity mounted in an aluminum plate structure placed underneath two vegetated modules 0 3 m 0 3 m additionally two decagon ec 5 soil moisture probes were embedded within the modules being placed on the mini lysimeter devices to quantify volumetric water content at a depth of 50 mm i e mid medium depth the ec 5 probes were calibrated using the two point method outlined in sakaki et al 2008 1 Œ∏ adc Œ± adc dry Œ± adc sat Œ± adc dry Œ± œÜ where Œ± 2 5 and is specific to the ec 5 the adcsat and adcdry is the mv response multiplied by a factor of 1 3661 for saturated and dry soil conditions also specific to the ec 5 and œï is the porosity this method was also used in the characterization of the green roof medium by perelli 2014 all instruments collected data at 1 minute intervals using one campbell scientific cr10 and two cr10x data loggers a rain event was defined as any period of precipitation that resulted in at least two tips of a tipping bucket rain gauge this two tip minimum threshold was used to ensure that a single tip was not considered a rain event in case there was residual water in the tipping bucket from a previous rain event the end of a rain event was defined by 6 h of no precipitation getter et al 2007 stovin 2010 vanwoert et al 2005 voyde et al 2010 when drainage was still occurring more than 6 h after a rain event and rainfall occurred again the two events were merged green roof stormwater performance was evaluated by quantifying rainfall and drainage depth duration rainfall intensity peak flow intensities and peak flow delay as well as gravity and capillary storage previous studies have only considered attenuation by comparing largest peak rainfall rate and largest peak runoff rate over a rain event e g speak et al 2013 vanwoert et al 2005 in this study distinct rainfall peaks within individual rain events were compared to the corresponding drainage peaks to determine peak attenuation and delay the 1 minute data resolution was

retention curve swrc the swrc for the growth medium was measured in the laboratory fitted to determine van genuchten parameters perelli 2014 table 1 and used to relate the water content to the capillary forces of the growing medium specifically to model field capacity capillary storage and gravity storage the richards equation was solved using the subsurface flow module in comsol multiphysics chui and freyberg 2009 comsol multiphysics 4 4 2013 a 1d model domain was used with a 100 mm depth and a mesh element size of 1 mm individual rain events were simulated using a time varying flux boundary condition on the inlet top boundary to represent rainfall the flux across this boundary was specified using 1 minute resolution precipitation data the bottom outlet boundary was specified as a free drainage boundary with drainage allowed to occur when water saturation exceeded field capacity i e no water storage in the drainage layer she and pang 2010 6 drainage 0 s e f c k r

may and september november and 0 193 during the drier period i e may september based on measured soil moisture data from the green roof fig 3 these values were determined by considering all events with drainage and identifying the moisture content when capillary storage was full and substantial drainage started the higher field capacity during the wet periods is attributed to higher moisture contents providing the stored water adequate time to diffuse into internal pores of the medium alternatively during the dry season these internal pores dry out resulting in a lower field capacity the soil moisture data fig 3 was also used to determine the residual water content Œ∏r by extrapolation of the volumetric water content at the end of the longer drying periods unfortunately these longer drying events were not long enough to achieve a residual water content in the modules the initial soil moisture for each simulation was based on measured soil moisture at the start of each event this represents one limitation of the predictive capabilities of the numerical model in order to make the numerical model completely predictive more work is needed to develop robust evapotranspiration predictive models for green roof systems the initial moisture distribution was assumed to be uniform with depth the model used a 1 minute time step consistent with available rainfall data simulations were run until drainage through the lower boundary ceased all parameter values used to solve the unsaturated flow equations were determined from field data laboratory tests or literature table 1 this eliminated the need for model calibration as such the objective is to test the model against observed data to determine if it can be used as a predictive tool rather than a validation of the suitability of richards equation for simulation of hydrologic processes in green roofs as done by previous studies hilten et al 2008 palla et al 2009 soulis et al 2017b simplifying model assumptions include neglecting macro porosity impact of roots or preferential paths micro porosity internal grain porosity vegetation effects i e no interception and stationarity in model parameters given these assumptions the model is unable to predict drainage before field capacity is reached as this is thought to occur due to preferential flow paths i e this was observed on september 11th 2013 fig 1b it is known that green roof properties such as pore structure with root growth or rearranging of fines change with time de ville et al 2017 perelli 2014 soulis et al 2017b however based on de ville et al 2017 we do not expect these properties to result in statistical differences in green roof performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 measured attenuation and delay in stormwater drainage ninety eight distinct rain events were quantified over the measurement periods of july 28th november 11th 2013 and april 11th october 21st 2014 event rainfall and runoff intensities during this period are shown in fig 4 in fig 4 rainfall duration is the time from the first recorded tip on a tipping bucket rain gauge until the final recorded tip runoff duration is the time during which water flowed over the weir and finally rainfall and runoff intensity is the cumulative volume divided by the duration event average rainfall and drainage intensity respectively the london intensity duration frequency idf curves based on 50 years of historical rain data are also presented for comparison environment canada 2015 six of the events were equivalent to or greater than a 2 year storm with one event approaching a 100 year storm the characteristics of the drainage events shown in red are distinctly different than the rainfall characteristics nearly half of the rain events produced no drainage as indicated by the greater number of rain events shown in fig 4 most of the longer duration rain events produced drainage and as expected the drainage was of longer duration shift right and lower intensity shift down compared to the rainfall for instance for rain events that produced drainage the average rain duration and intensity are 10 70 h and 2 84 mm hr respectively compared to 18 54 h and 0 46 mm hr respectively for the average drainage duration and intensity the six large events that have over a 2 year return period have average rainfall duration and intensity of 20 0 h and 4 20 mm hr while the average drainage duration and intensity for these events are 34 6 h and 1 62 mm hr drainage intensity for the largest rainfall event 50 100 year return period decreased to about a 10 year storm these results highlight the overall stormwater management benefits that green roofs provide in increasing the duration and decreasing intensity of events specifically for large return period events johannessen et al 2018 also reported similar reductions in drainage intensity in comparison to precipitation intensity as well as a decrease in exceedance probability of high intensity drainage and associated prolonged duration over which water drained from the green roof this analysis however only considers event averages as such this analysis does not investigate the mechanisms causing attenuation and delay including the impact of field capacity this is important as prior to field capacity precipitation is stored in the green roof growth media through capillary action however after field capacity water is not stored in this manner to more closely evaluate the ability of green roofs to attenuate peak flow rates detailed attenuation analysis of each of the 50 events that produced a drainage event was conducted there were 121 distinct rainfall peaks within the 50 events that had drainage 66 of these peaks occurred before the green roof achieved field capacity and 55 peaks occurred after field capacity table 2 provides an overview of the average peak flow rate attenuation and delay results the average peak flow rate attenuation is 58 this is similar to moran and hunt 2005 and stovin 2010 who found peak flow rate attenuation of 57 and wong and jim 2014 with a range of 41 58 but dissimilar to the findings of voyde et al 2010 93 carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 89 and johannessen et al 2018 65 90 these previous studies used event peak flow rates to calculate the attenuation as well as including events with no drainage in the attenuation statistics these differences would result in larger peak attenuation values explaining the higher attenuation values reported by voyde et al 2010 carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 and johannessen et al 2018 the comparatively low values reported by moran and hunt 2005 and stovin 2010 may be due to the small sample sizes in their studies 13 and 11 events respectively the average time delay between rainfall and drainage peaks is 12 8 min if a rainfall peak occurred but there was no drainage the peak was omitted from time delay averages the calculated time delay differs from wong and jim 2014 who reported peak delays of 25 35 min denardo et al 2005 who found peak delays of about 2 h and also villarreal 2007 who found peak delays of 1 min both using the event peak rainfall and event peak drainage time difference the results of carter and rasmussen 2006 are most similar to this study where 57 of storms were found to have delays ranging from 0 to 10 min of note is that this study also used event peak rainfall and drainage values quantifying average attenuation and delay using event peaks as opposed to individual rainfall peaks over the entire monitoring period over which the storm hydrograph was quantified does not provide insight into the processes that control green roof attenuation and delay peak attenuation and delay are a function of the specific storage mechanisms occurring i e capillary and gravity storage and routing as well as the growth medium moisture content when the rainfall peak occurred i e greater or lower than field capacity comparison of single module drainage to the runoff response for the full green roof i e using the weir also enables quantification of the various processes influencing attenuation e g the importance of capillary and gravity storage in comparison to routing the influence of field capacity on flow rate attenuation was assessed by comparing drainage versus rainfall rate for peaks when the medium was initially below and above field capacity results shown in fig 5 indicate considerable flow rate attenuation with all data falling below the 1 1 lines that represent zero attenuation before field capacity the regression slopes indicate 72 peak attenuation due to capillary storage for the single module drainage and 79 attenuation for full roof runoff due to capillary storage and routing fig 5a it is noted that r2 values indicate considerable data scatter and this is because field capacity has not been reached these attenuation values differ slightly from those reported in table 2 since trendlines represent the best fit of drainage versus rainfall intensities whereas table 2 reports the arithmetic average of all attenuation values from drainage events the average peak attenuation presented in table 2 before field capacity was 77 for single module and 88 for full roof drainage the difference between the single module and full roof drainage values is due to routing the drainage routing increased peak attenuation by 11 and increased peak delay by 11 2 min table 2 when we consider fig 5a routing increased attenuation by 7 it is noted that routing of this nature would occur on a conventional roof above field capacity the regression line slopes are larger i e less attenuation and correlations are improved i e r2 0 93 fig 5b the impact of drainage routing also becomes more important in flow attenuation the full roof runoff measurements suggest 33 attenuation compared with 22 for single module drainage fig 5b as such the effect of routing increases the attenuation performance by a factor of 1 5 this finding is also confirmed from data presented in table 2 above field capacity comparison of the average single module attenuation 29 and the full roof attenuation 47 showed that routing increased attenuation by 18 and increased the peak delay by 6 8 min based on table 2 routing accounts for an additional 11 attenuation below field capacity whereas above field capacity routing adds 18 of the total attenuation this means that routing has a greater contribution to peak attenuation after field capacity to statistically assess the influence of field capacity on the peak rainfall and drainage flow rate data for the rain gauge single module drainage and full roof runoff were plotted as cumulative probability distributions before and after field capacity fig 6 a and b these plots were made by ranking the monitored peak flow rates by size and calculating the cumulative probability that is associated with each flow rate based upon the rank the cumulative probability value represents the percentage of monitored peaks equal to or less than the corresponding flow rate on the x axis similar plots were presented by johannessen et al 2018 however they did not distinguish between before and after field capacity the kolmogorov smirnov non parametric test was used to determine significance the test failed to find any significant difference between the distribution of rainfall before and after field capacity significant differences were found between the single module drainage flow rates before and after field capacity Œ± 0 001 and between full roof runoff flow rates before and after field capacity Œ± 0 001 this analysis indicates that attenuation performance of a green roof significantly decreases after field capacity is reached and therefore field capacity is a quantifiable point where attenuation performance of a green roof significantly decreases these peak flowrate attenuation results differ from those of hamouz et al 2018 who reported similar peak flowrate attenuation irrespective of initial water saturation in the growth media differences between the two studies may be that initial saturations in the study of hamouz et al 2018 were similar for the five reported events i e 32 1 to 35 7 differences in the drainage layer and that their growth media was different i e expanded clay than in this study another previous study reported that the moisture condition at the start of a rainfall event was weakly correlated to attenuation performance soulis et al 2017a as discussed rainfall peaks need to be associated with their associated runoff peaks and attenuation should not be quantified solely in terms of the largest peak rainfall and largest peak runoff during a rainfall event as peak rainfall may have occurred before field capacity was achieved and peak runoff may have occurred after field capacity was achieved attenuation is significantly greater before field capacity due to capillary storage availability after field capacity is reached drainage is only attenuated by temporary gravity storage and routing this is illustrated by the single module drainage data shown in fig 5b bengtsson 2005 noted the presence of gravity storage after field capacity was reached for artificial rain experiments however the gravity storage values were not directly quantified but inferred from convergence of the rainfall and drainage rates here the peak gravity storage was directly measured as mm of storage for each individual peak above field capacity fig 7 consistent with bengtsson 2005 gravity storage increased as rain intensity increases the spearman correlation for non parametric data shows a statistically positive correlation 0 735 between rain intensity and gravity storage this indicates that gravity storage is dynamic with more water temporarily stored when the rainfall intensity is higher 3 2 numerical model simulation of field data the green roof drainage response to 33 separate events i e events with drainage monitored in 2014 after the accumulating drainage unit was installed was simulated using the richards equation based model to assess the predictive capabilities of the numerical model as the model is 1d and does not account for routing effects the simulations results were compared with the single module drainage measurements the measured and simulated outflow hydrographs for three representative rain events are shown in fig 8 these simulated events were selected as they highlight a wide range of characteristics of the hydrograph including time to initiation of drainage storage peak flow rate attenuation and delay the simulated results match well with the measured green roof module drainage the simulated initiation of drainage shown in fig 8b is slightly delayed relative to the measured data this discrepancy is attributed to uncertainty in the soil moisture data which was obtained using ec 5 instruments installed at mid depth only and used as the initial soil moisture in the model domain however after drainage commenced the simulated and measured outflow hydrographs are almost identical fig 8a and c both show greater model accuracy with respect to the initiation of drainage the simulated peak flow rates delays and drainage volumes qualitatively correspond well to the measured data aggregate metrics for comparing the simulated and measured results for the events shown in fig 8 are provided in table 3 three metrics were selected to statistically assess the performance of the model in simulated rain events volume of water retained in the green roof capillary storage volume of water drained from the green roof and peak flow rates fig 9 these metrics were selected rather than using a standard error calculation such as rmse which would show bias between events i e exaggerating error for longer events with larger flow rates a comparison of the simulated and measured capillary storage and drainage for all 33 events simulated are shown in fig 9a and b respectively simulated drainage is calculated as the cumulative flux through the bottom outflow boundary over the event the relationship between the simulated and measured capillary storage yields a slope of 0 96 and an r2 of 0 93 the spearman coefficient œÅ was calculated to be 0 892 indicating a strong positive nonparametric correlation the mann whitney u test failed to show a significant difference in medians between the model and observed storage values p 0 705 the scatter about the 1 1 line is likely due to uncertainty regarding the initial moisture conditions or the model assumption of no evaporation during the rain event the same statistical analysis was conducted for drainage predictions with results suggesting an even greater correlation between simulated and measured drainage the slope of the linear trendline is 1 025 with an r2 of 0 99 and the spearman coefficient is 0 964 the mann whitney u test failed to show a significant difference between the model and observed drainage median p 0 682 the simulated and measured drainage likely correlate better than the storage values as drainage is directly affected by the amount of rainfall for each event i e an error of 2 mm in simulated capillary storage will have minimal effect on the cumulative drainage amount for a large rain event the correlation between the individual simulated and measured peak flow rates is not as strong as the other two metrics fig 9c the slope of the trendline is 0 91 implying a small but consistent underestimation of peak flow rates the trendline is influenced by a few large peak flow rates that were underestimated i e far right data point in fig 9c additionally there are some data points that lie on the x axis showing no simulated drainage the slight underestimation of some large peaks and no simulated drainage for other cases may be due to uncertainty in the initial moisture conditions for example poor estimation of initial moisture conditions would affect the relative permeability model during the peak causing a slightly smaller simulated peak flow rate for cases of no simulated drainage there is a possibility of preferential flow in the module which is not captured in the richards equation based model the initial condition measurement could be improved in future studies by having duplicate soil moisture measurements in different modules and at different depths to account for heterogeneity in the green roof medium the study of johannessen et al 2019 reported good agreement between model and observed flow rate for data collected at a range of sites in norway when model parameters were calibrated for each individual site they do however note some over and under model prediction of observed peak flow rate palla et al 2009 also found peak flow rates to be underestimated in their model the r2 value for the trendline was 0 95 and the spearman coefficient is 0 815 the mann whitney u test indicated that there is no significant difference between the simulated and observed peak flow rates p 0 352 nevertheless the simulated outflow hydrographs show that the numerical model was able to accurately predict outflow hydrographs from a green roof medium without any parameter calibration the utility of laboratory derived parameters for model prediction of field observation has received some attention in the literature in the present study use of laboratory derived parameters resulted in good model predictions of field observations however the study of johannessen et al 2019 reported model discrepancies when laboratory derived parameters were used to predict green roof performance at multiple sites the reason for differences in results between the studies could be due to the fact that the scale of the norwegian green roof sites was larger the use of different models e g richard s equation based model vs swmm and potentially some ageing of the green roof grown media resulting in parameters changing with time de ville et al 2017 perelli 2014 soulis et al 2017b although change in green roof parameters has been quantified for the green roof media used in this study perelli 2014 the good agreement between model results and field observations in this study suggest that results from the richard s equation based model are insensitive to the range of observed parameter change a literature report also suggested that change in green roof growth media parameters did not significantly impact performance metrics de ville et al 2017 3 3 numerical model sensitivity analyses a sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of growth medium parameters van genuchten soil parameters Œ± and n hydraulic conductivity and field capacity table 4 on green roof retention and attenuation performance the analysis was conducted considering the initial soil moisture was at field capacity and that it was at residual moisture content it is noted that for simulations when the initial soil moisture was at field capacity a field capacity equivalent to that of the base case was used as the initial soil moisture i e for sensitivity analyses that increased or decreased the field capacity the base case field capacity was used as the initial condition an improved understanding of the impact of growth medium properties on performance will ultimately help further engineer these properties for optimal green roof performance for a given metric e g retention or attenuation for example simulation results show that higher field capacity leads to greater retention values e g for the case when the growth medium is at field capacity storage increased from 0 9 mm for the base case to 8 6 mm when field capacity increased by 50 but also leads to slightly less attenuation of peak flow rates if the green roof is initially at field capacity e g increasing field capacity by 50 when the growth medium was at field capacity decreased peak flux from 4 0 10 5 m s for the base case to 3 7 10 5 m s table 4 increased peak flux with increasing field capacity is due to increased relative permeability in the growth medium with greater water content at larger field capacity if the green roof is initially at residual water saturation then increasing the field capacity increases both retention and attenuation e g for the base case storage is 18 2 mm and peak flux is 2 2 10 5 m s whereas when field capacity is increased by 50 storage is 29 1 mm and peak flux is 1 3 10 5 m s table 4 as a greater amount of rainfall is retained in capillary storage reducing the time during which drainage occurs this analysis suggests that growth media could be designed to have an optimal field capacity that limits peak flow rates for a given design storm to a preferred lower drainage rate however this may come at the expense of retaining a lower precipitation volume if the green roof is at field capacity at the initiation of a given storm the impact of hydraulic conductivity is as expected with increasing hydraulic conductivity decreasing peak flow rate attenuation e g when the growth medium is initially at field capacity the peak flux increased from 2 2 10 5 m s for the base case to 2 8 10 5 m s when hydraulic conductivity increased by 50 but having a negligible impact on retention sensitivity analyses were also conducted to evaluate the influence of capillary pressure saturation parameters i e the van genuchten soil parameters Œ± and n but only for cases where the system was initially at residual water saturation the van genuchten soil parameters specifically n had a considerable impact on attenuation and retention van genuchten n parameter is a measure of the pore size distribution of the medium with larger n corresponding to a more uniform pore size distribution while smaller n corresponds to a more graded pore size distribution as such n impacts both the capillary pressure saturation curve and the relative permeability saturation curve as n increases the relative permeability increases and the capillary pressure saturation curve is more uniform i e flatter resulting in less attenuation and slightly less rainfall retention e g retention of 18 2 mm and a peak flux of 2 2 10 5 m s for the base case retention of 16 5 mm and a peak flux of 2 9 10 5 m s when n increases by 50 table 4 alternatively when n decreases there is increased attenuation and decreased rainfall retention as n decreases drainage occurs over a longer period these results are interesting in that both increasing and decreasing n from the base case resulted in reduced retention with the magnitude of decreased retention greater for the decrease in n Œ± had limited impact on attenuation and retention this is likely since the shape of the capillary pressure saturation relationship does not change only the pressure at which air will displace water resulting in a translation up or down the capillary pressure axis this sensitivity analysis suggests that the model is a valuable tool that could be applied to identify ideal soil characteristics for a given climate to achieve either improved retention and or improved attenuation for stormwater management applications finally the validated model was applied to a range of design storms fig 10 to evaluate the influence of a green roof on the stormwater response for long return period events fig 10 shows simulation results for 2 25 and 100 year storms with initial conditions at field capacity meaning that no capillary storage was available only gravity storage the us department of agriculture soil conservation service scs design storm hyetographs were used as the rainfall input for 10 min 1 h 8 h and 24 h storms modelled for green roofs with 0 1 m and 0 2 m growth medium depth while the design storms simulated are specific to london ontario given the model is predictive it could also be used to simulate design storms in different regions large reductions in drainage were seen for the 10 min and 1 h design storms at all modelled return periods for a 0 1 m medium depth the 10 min and 1 h storm model scenarios predict a reduction in event intensity of 74 and 26 respectively while a 0 2 m medium depth would reduce the event intensity by 91 and 58 respectively fig 10 for longer duration storms 8 h and 24 h simulations suggest that a green roof provides limited attenuation of peak flow rate as the increase in storm duration means that the flow rate at the bottom of the module matches the precipitation rate i e gravity storage reaches steady state 4 conclusions the average peak flow rate attenuation from 98 events in london ontario from 2013 to 2014 was calculated to be 58 this average attenuation provides little information related to the underlying processes governing peak flow rate attenuation detailed analysis of individual rain and drainage peaks within rain events showed that before field capacity capillary storage accounts for the largest component of peak flow rate attenuation 72 and routing has a minor effect 7 however after field capacity drainage routing becomes considerably more important 11 and gravity storage also results in peak flow attenuation 22 when the green roof medium reaches field capacity this represents a statistically significant point at which attenuation efficiency decreases the green roof drainage response was simulated using a richards equation based model hilten et al 2008 palla et al 2009 and soulis et al 2017b previously modelled green roofs using the richards equation but their models were calibrated using field data the model used here is a predictive tool that used laboratory derived relationships and field data without calibration of any parameters the model provided very good predictions of observed data all performance metrics i e water storage event drainage and peak flow rates suggest a high degree of correlation between the model and observed values the model presented here could be used to estimate the retention of different green roof designs including the effects of varying media composition and depth and also to predict outflow hydrographs for green roofs the limitation of the model is that it requires initial soil moisture conditions and soil parameters to address this limitation the model could be coupled with an evapotranspiration model to enable for long term simulations and thus soil moisture dynamics to be calculated between rain events additionally it is recommended that further work incorporate a routing model it is noted that this study only simulated one green roof as such it is recommended that the extent to which laboratory derived parameters such as the one s characterized here and the modelling approach be investigated on multiple roofs as shown by the field data incorporation of this attenuation mechanism is particularly important once field capacity is reached green roofs have been empirically proven to provide substantial attenuation of peak flow rates understanding the fundamental process of green roof attenuation is needed to guide and optimize green roof design the development of an accurate predictive tool for green roofs will assist stormwater engineers in effective implementation of green roofs as lid results from this study suggest that green roofs have significant potential to attenuate storm water flow rate and mitigate against the impact of extreme events associated with climate change in urban areas declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this research was supported by a natural sciences and engineering research council of canada nserc strategic grant stpgp

6236,a robust hydrological modeling at a fine spatial resolution is a vital tool for norway to simulate river discharges and hydrological components for climate adaptation strategies however it requires improvements of modelling methods detailed observational data as input and expensive computational resources this work aims to set up a distributed version of the hbv model with a physically based evapotranspiration scheme at 1 km resolution for mainland norway and to calibrate validate the model for 124 catchments using regionalized parameterizations the penman monteith equation was implemented in the hbv model and vegetation characteristics were derived from the norwegian forest inventory combined with multi source remote sensing data at 16 m spatial resolution the estimated potential evapotranspiration ep was compared with pan measurements and estimates from the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer mod16 products the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam and variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model there are 5 climatic zones in norway classified based on 4 temperature and precipitation indices for each zone the model was calibrated separately by optimizing a multi objective function including the nash sutcliff efficiency nse and biases of selected catchments in total there are 85 catchments for calibration and 39 for validation the ep estimates showed good agreement with the measurements gleam and vic outputs however the mod16 product significantly overestimates ep compared to the other products the discharge was well reproduced with the median daily nse of 0 68 0 67 bias of 3 1 kling gupta efficiency kge of 0 70 0 69 and monthly nse of 0 80 0 78 in the calibration validation periods our results showed a significant improvement compared to the previous hbv application for all catchments with an increase of 0 08 0 16 in the median values of the daily nse kge and monthly nse both the temporal and spatial transferability of model parameterizations were also enhanced compared to the previous application keywords regional calibration norway hbv high resolution potential evapotranspiration 1 introduction understanding the past present and future climate impacts serves as basis to develop adaptation strategies for decision makers it requires high spatial resolution information on projected impacts which can be directly applied in adaptation measures kaspersen et al 2012 for the water sector hydrological models are important tools to project the impact of climate change on runoff water resources and flooding at both regional and large scales olsson et al 2016 in norway the hbv model is one of the most widely used tools for runoff simulations bergstr√∂m 2006 the spatially distributed version of this model was used to produce the map of average annual runoff for norway at 1 km resolution beldring et al 2003 and showed good performance for river discharge and hydrological components e g snow storage soil moisture groundwater recharge and runoff in addition the model has been used to provide fine resolution hydrological projections in the climate impact assessments for the governmental report climate in norway 2100 hanssen bauer et al 2017 published by the norwegian centre for climate services nccs even though the hbv models has been used widely and shown good performance during evaluations the model requires further improvements on its conceptual model structure to better quantify the impacts of both climate and land use changes there is an increasing discussion whether conceptual rainfall runoff models are capable to simulate the water balance under changing climatic conditions coron et al 2014 fowler et al 2016 merz et al 2011 the calibrated parameters may not be valid under non stationary conditions and insufficient model calibration and validation strategies may further contribute to poor temporal transferability of models in addition to such issues measured precipitation at gauge stations exhibit problems in norway such as undercatch f√∏rland et al 1996 such uncertainties largely influences estimates of for example evapotranspiration e by hydrological models since e is constrained by potential evapotranspiration ep and soil moisture in the model robust ep estimates can help to reduce the uncertainty caused by biased precipitation data several studies reveal that different ep formulas could lead to different changes in ep as well as river discharge under climate scenarios mcafee 2013 seiller and anctil 2016 the use of data intensive methods i e the methods consider other climatic variables in addition to air temperature are recommended when estimating the possible effects of climatic changes on evaporative demand donohue et al 2010 mcafee 2013 a major restriction of using physically based ep methods e g penman monteith on a large scale is the lack of spatially distributed input data foremost vegetation parameters and meteorological forcing data recently an enhanced forest classification scheme based on the norwegian forest inventory combined with multi source remote sensing data majasalmi et al 2018 has become available providing detailed information at 16 m spatial resolution on forest vegetation characteristics in norway this enabled us to estimate ep using the penman monteith approach in the hbv model and to compare it with pan evaporation measurements and satellite based products such as products from the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer mod16 mu et al 2011 and the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam miralles et al 2011 satellite based products are considered as important land evaporation estimates on terrestrial water and energy cycles and environmental changes miralles et al 2016 and are increasingly used for model calibration or as input to hydrological models bowman et al 2017 demirel et al 2018 lopez et al 2017 spies et al 2015 however these satellite derived data have not yet been validated in norway due to lack of for example long term flux net data hence a comparison between the ground based measurements and the ep estimates using different input data and methods can improve the understanding of evaporation on the national scale which has rarely been documented in literature another potential improvement for the distributed version of the hbv modelling can be the application of a new calibration approach the previous version of the hbv model was calibrated simultaneously against the discharge of 141 catchments across norway beldring et al 2003 the calibration lasted for three months due to a large number of grid cells more than 300 000 and 69 calibration parameters in the recent decades there is an increasing trend of applying regionalization calibration approaches in large scale hydrological modelling abbaspour et al 2015 beck et al 2016 hundecha et al 2016 troy et al 2008 one widely used approach is to construct a regression model linking model parameters to catchment characteristics or other variables and perform the calibration hundecha et al 2016 rakovec et al 2016 other common approaches focus on geographic proximity oudin et al 2008 the climatic and or physiographic similarity of catchments or grid cells beck et al 2016 parajka et al 2007 troy et al 2008 they either interpolated independently calibrated parameters for selected catchments to other non gauged areas or calibrated multiple catchments with similar characteristics simultaneously and transfer the parameters to ungauged areas which have the similar characteristics of the calibrated catchments yang et al 2018 compared the performance of different regionalization approaches using the water and snow balance modeling system wasmod for 118 norwegian catchments they found that applying a set of regionalized parameters to catchments within one climatic zone shows similar results as the distance based regionalization methods and outperforms the regression based ones this study motivated us to apply a regionalized approach based on climatic similarities to calibrate the distributed hbv model it is expected to improve the runoff simulations both temporally and spatially for the whole land surface of norway in addition it can speed up the calibration procedure by calibrating different groups of catchments in parallel thus this study attempts to improve both the hbv model structure and the calibration procedure to better simulate ep as well as discharges for mainland norway it shows the first application of the modified hbv model using the penman monteith method with vegetation characteristics derived from a high resolution dataset and a regionalized calibration procedure the main objectives of this study are formulated as 1 to set up the distributed version of the hbv model with the penman monteith method at 1 km resolution for the mainland of norway 2 to evaluate the ep estimates using both ground and satellite based data 3 to calibrate and validate the model for 124 catchments using regionalized parameterizations and 4 to compare the simulated river discharge and hydrological components with the outputs from the previous hbv application used in the climate in norway 2100 report hanssen bauer et al 2017 2 study area norway is located in northern europe and covers an area of about 325 000 km2 the elevation spans from 0 m along the coast to more than 2000 m in the central regions fig 1 about half of the land area is covered by bare soil and heathers in high mountains and about 38 of the area is covered by forest there is a large number of lakes and bogs wetlands in norway covering about 5 and 6 of the total land surface respectively only about 3 of the land surface is used as arable land norwegian soils and aquifers are generally shallow and have a limited storage capacity consisting mainly of thin precipitation fed till deposits the bare mountain and moraine soils account for ca 80 of the total mainland area the mean annual temperature during 1971 2000 was about 1 3 c for the mainland hanssen bauer et al 2017 it is warmest along the coast of southern norway with the annual temperature up to 7 c while it is coldest in the high mountains with the annual temperature down to 4 c due to the low temperature only about 11 of the land area has a growing season lasting more than six months hanssen bauer et al 2017 similar to temperature the annual precipitation also shows a distinct spatial distribution ranging from 300 mm in south eastern and northern norway to more than 3500 mm in the west the mainland can be divided into 6 hydrological regimes finnmark nordland tr√∏ndelag western norway eastern norway and southern norway fig 1 in total 124 catchments were selected for model calibration and validation in this study figs 1 and 2 the distribution of the catchments represents various climate and hydrological regimes geographic conditions and landscape types in norway these catchments are also used for calibration in the previous hbv application and most of them are considered as near natural catchments beldring et al 2003 the size of the catchments varies from 7 to 15450 km2 and 85 of them are smaller than 1000 km2 as some of the catchments stretch along the national borders the catchment area in the neighbouring countries was also included in the hbv modelling see fig 2 detailed information of the 124 catchments is listed in appendix a 3 methods and data 3 1 hbv model the spatially distributed version of the hbv model used here beldring et al 2003 was developed for calculating the water balance for 1 1 km2 grid cells covering the entire mainland surface area of norway each grid cell can be subdivided into lake area glacier area and up to three vegetation types the model runs with a daily time step using precipitation and air mean temperature as input it calculates subgrid scale accumulation and ablation of snow interception storage distribution of soil moisture storage e groundwater storage runoff response lake evaporation and glacier mass balance the original method for computing ep uses a function of air temperature and the e is calculated based on ep field capacity and permanent wilting point see beldring et al 2003 for details and table 1 for the range of field capacity in this study the permanent wilting point was assumed as zero meter based on the assessments of the hbv parameterizations for scandinavian catchments by bergstr√∂m 1976 the snowmelt is calculated by a simple degree day method the runoff is simulated by two non linear parallel reservoirs representing direct discharge and the groundwater response the calibration parameters include parameters for evaporation and snowmelt processes in each land use type and for the soil and groundwater processes in each soil type table 1 detailed information of the model and the algorithms can be found in beldring et al 2003 and bergstr√∂m 1995 we reference the distributed hbv model described by beldring et al 2003 as the old version of the hbv model in this study in this study we improve the model structure by replacing the simple ep function with the penman monteith method ershadi et al 2015 compared the estimates of e using different structures of the penman monteith model a traditional single source model monteith 1965 a two layer model based on shuttleworth and wallace 1985 and a three source model based on mu et al 2011 they found that no single model structure consistently outperformed the others for all biome types in addition best estimates are often generated using the surface resistance parameterization based on the lookup table from mu et al 2011 and the thom 1975 formulation for aerodynamic resistance that incorporated dynamic values of roughness parameters based on their findings and data availability of this study we applied the traditional single source

jonsson 2014 while the timing of autumn phenophases in a given location is assumed to be determined by photoperiod and it is simulated with constant senescence dates the lai for crops is estimated by a simplified epic crop model williams et al 1984 we applied the biome property look up table from mu et al 2011 to estimate the surface resistance parameters for vegetation for other land cover types e g urban and built up we used the parameterizations from the evapotranspiration model amor tallaksen et al 1996 which was developed for norway all parameterization for the penman monteith method is prescribed in the hbv model see appendix b for the prescribed parameter values since there is no calibration parameters needed for the ep simulation e g lai vegetation height albedo and bulk resistance the ep estimates must be validated against ground measurements and other model products before the model is calibrated against discharges in addition we corrected the rainfall gauge undercatch by a continuous adjustment function derived by wolff et al 2015 based on data from a test site in southern norway however we found that this correction function cannot guarantee a reliable correction for other parts of norway thus the precipitation snow correction coefficients need to be adjusted for each climatic zone in this study table 1 3 2 regionalized calibration the hbv model was calibrated and validated using discharge observations from 124 catchments spread across the whole country fig 2 as we mentioned in section 3 1 all parameters used by the penman monteith method were prescribed so we should validate the ep estimates to ensure a reasonable simulation for this process based on the validation of ep for the period 2000 2012 the details on the selection of period are explained in section 3 4 we can start the model calibration against discharges for the period of 2000 2007 which lies in the validation period of ep and minimizes the calibration time consumption the period 1983 1999 was used for validation yang et al 2018 applied a set of regionalized model parameters to multiple catchments with similar climate conditions in norway and found satisfactory runoff simulations which are comparable with the results using distance based regionalization approaches see fig 8 in their paper following their study we selected the regionalization approach based on climatic similarity in this study i e multiple catchments with similar climatic conditions were calibrated simultaneously and the calibrated parameters sets were transferred to other ungauged grid cells within the same climatic zone it was further assumed that each climatic zone has similar precipitation correction factors we used four climatic indices to classify the study domain into five distinct climatic zones the indices are mean annual precipitation precipitation seasonality index the ratio between the three consecutive wettest and driest months mean annual temperature and temperature seasonality index the mean temperature of the hottest month minus the mean temperature of the coldest month the indices were calculated for each 1 1 km2 grid cell and the k mean clustering method hartigan and wong 1979 was applied to the standardized indices for all modelling grid cells fig 2 illustrates the five climatic zones after classification and fig 3 shows that the zones represent not only distinct climatic regimes but also different geophysical and land cover characteristics though only the climate indices were used for classification zone 1 is mainly located in the far north region with lowest temperature and precipitation but a high seasonality index zone 2 spreads in the mountainous region from the south to the north so it has the highest elevation among the five zones this zone is mainly covered by bedrock and heathers and has almost no forest zone 3 is the warmest and wettest area and is situated along the west coast it has a low climate seasonality index and it is covered by both forest and heather zone 4 is mainly located in east norway and zone 5 in the southern and central part of norway both zones have high coverage of forest but they differ in all climatic indices moderately for calibration we selected catchments with drainage areas predominantly situated within one distinct climate zone fig 2 as a result there are five calibration groups with 3 20 31 13 and 18 catchments selected for zone 1 5 respectively the remaining 39 catchments which cover more than one climatic zone form the validation group used for testing the spatial transferability of the model we calibrated the model for each climatic zone in parallel to speed up the calibration procedure and improve the simulation results on discharge for the selected catchments three criteria were used for multi criteria optimization the non dimensional performance criterion of nash and sutcliffe 1970 efficiency nse the percent bias pbias in water balance and the percent volume bias in the high flow segment of the flow duration curve Œ¥fhv 0 0 02 flow exceedance probabilities yilmaz et al 2008 Œ¥fhv is an index for high flows aiming to improve the simulation of floods the parameter estimation routine pest doherty and skahill 2006 was applied for finding the parameter set giving the best model performance using the multi criteria defined above since pest minimizes the difference between the criteria results and their ideal values 1 for nse and 0 for biases the calibration objective function containing three criteria at multiple gauges can be formulated as eq 3 3 Œ∏ w nse i 1 n 1 nse i 2 w pbias i 1 n pbias i 2 w Œ¥ f h v i 1 n Œ¥ f h v i 2 where w are weights and n are the number of calibration catchments within each group there is an equal weight between catchments but the w nse is higher than the bias weights to achieve a good calibration performance as the calibration time is significantly reduced by parallel calibration 8 10 pest runs were carried out with various initial parameter values which were randomly generated within the parameter ranges listed in table 1 after the calibration the model performance was evaluated using the daily nse pbias kling gupta efficiency kge kling et al 2012 and monthly nse for all 124 catchments in both calibration and validation periods 3 3 model input data to setup the distributed version of the hbv model we used a digital elevation model dem soil and land cover raster maps with 1 km horizontal resolution the dem map is obtained from the norwegian mapping authority the swedish national land survey and the national land survey of finland the soil map combines the information from the geological survey of norway and the international soil reference and information centre isric http isric org eight soil types were reclassified for the modelling domain high resolution land cover information was derived from the national land resource map ahlstr√∏m et al 2014 and a remote sensing based forest map sat skog gjertsen and nilsen 2012 complemented by corine land cover 2000 https www eea europa eu data and maps data clc 2000 raster 4 for areas outside norway and was aggregated to percentage share of different land cover types at 1 1 km2 hbv modelling resolution the land cover classification distinguishes eight general land use types open area bog built up cropland heather bedrock lake permanent ice and snow and 12 structural forest types to better reflect spatial variability in hydrologically relevant land surface properties within forested areas the forest types are based on the classification scheme developed by majasalmi et al 2018 for fennoscandian forests which consists of three species groups spruce pine and deciduous dominated with four structural subgroups each look up tables provided by majasalmi et al 2018 were used to parameterize maximum leaf area index and vegetation height in hbv shortwave albedo was parametrized with values given in bright et al 2018 the new version of the distributed hbv model requires seven climate variables with daily time steps as input mean maximum and minimum air temperature tmean tmax tmin precipitation p shortwave incoming radiation swr vapour pressure vp and wind speed the senorge2 precipitation dataset lussana et al 2018 provides an observational gridded dataset over norway from 1957 to the present day this dataset is the most updated precipitation data from the norwegian meteorological institute it shows more precise estimates of annual average precipitation than senorge version 1 1 mohr 2008 which was used as input in the previous hbv application beldring et al 2003 however the product substantially underestimates precipitation in data sparse areas and inherits the undercatch problem from the measurements lussana et al 2018 the tmax tmin and wind datasets are based on different post processing procedures applied to norwegian reanalysis 10 km nora10 product reistad et al 2011 which is a dataset of hindcasts i e dynamical downscaling of a global reanalysis or analysis system over the scandinavian peninsula tmin and tmax combine the nora10 derived daily extreme temperature fields with in situ observations from a climate station network from 1981 to 2012 lussana 2017 the wind dataset is the result of a quantile mapping scheme aimed at adjusting the nora10 bias to better match the climatology of a high resolution numerical weather prediction model such as applications of research to operations at mesoscale model for meteorological cooperation on operational numerical weather prediction arome metcoop mueller et al 2017 all datasets have the same 1 1 km2 grid domain as the senorge datasets which covers the norwegian mainland plus a strip of land extending into sweden and finland based on the tmax tmin p and wind data for the period 1982 2012 we applied the mountain microclimate simulation model mtclim bohn et al 2013 which is embedded in the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model liang et al 1994 version 4 1 2 to generate remaining climate variables required by hbv tmean swr and vp for the same period 3 4 data for potential evapotranspiration and snow water equivalent comparison ground measurements of ep are scarce in norway there are only pan measurements from the thorsrud 2500 evaporimeter available at 42 locations across the country from 1967 to 1972 for the warm months may september hetager and lystad 1974 due to the cold climate and low winter insolation in norway the majority of e occurs in these warm months as shown in other high latitude areas shutov et al 2006 two recently published satellite based products were selected for comparison with the hbv estimates and the pan measurements these are the mod16 products of mean annual ep from 2000 to 2012 http files ntsg umt edu data ntsg products mod16 mod16a2 monthly merra gmao 1kmalb geotiff 0 05degree and the gleam annual ep available from 1980 to 2014 https www gleam eu the mod16 products use a penman monteith based method but estimate potential soil evaporation soil evaporation from wet soil surface canopy evaporation and potential transpiration from plant tissues separately mu et al 2011 the climate forcing of mod16 is derived from the daily global metrological reanalysis data from nasa s global modeling and assimilation office gmao at 1 1 25 resolution in contrast the gleam ep was calculated using the priestley and taylor equation miralles et al 2011 and the climate forcing data combines the era interim and mswep v1 0 reanalysis data at 0 25 resolution none of the satellite products and the hbv simulation can be directly compared with the measurements due to different time spans therefore we applied the vic hydrological model to simulate the long term ep from 1961 to 2012 to bridge the temporal gaps the vic model gives an approximation of the recent warming impacts on ep between the period 2000 2013 and 1967 1972 and helps to justify the comparison between the observations and estimations the vic model used the global vic input parameters at 0 5 resolution nijssen et al 2001 and the reanalysis climate forcing data from the water and global change watch project weedon et al 2011 as input the ep is estimated from an area weighted sum of potential transpiration and potential soil evaporation using the penman monteith based method for each grid cell the snow water equivalent swe data saloranta 2012 was calculated based on the measurements of snow depth and density recorded at stations operated by various hydropower companies since 1914 the stations were mainly located in the central mountain area in the southern eastern and western norway see appendix c most of the measurements 60 are taken once per snow season around the time of the maximum annual swe march april but at many stations several up to 13 measurements per snow season have been taken the whole data set has been quality controlled by removing or correcting bad or duplicate values and outliers only data in the period 1983 2012 were used in model evaluation resulting in 22 032 observations at 1151 stations see appendix c 4 results 4 1 validation of potential evapotranspiration estimates the ep estimates for the summer months may sep from the hbv model mod16 gleam and the vic model are compared with the pan measurements in fig 4 the measurements are only available during the period from 1967 to 1972 in norway while the model estimates span from 2000 to 2012 as we mentioned in section 3 4 we ran the vic model for the past 50 years to evaluate how ep varied in different historical time slices the long term simulation with the vic model shows that there is a slight increase of 6 mm year in ep from the period 1962 1970 to 2000 2012 see appendix d this increase is very small compared to the average annual ep that varies between 237 and 254 mm year for the period spanning the past 50 years therefore we assume that the difference of measured ep between 2000 and 2012 and 1967 1972 is also negligible and we can directly compare the estimates with the measurements as shown in fig 4 all estimates have good agreement with an average annual ep of 230 260 mm year except the mod16 product the mod16 shows a very high average annual ep of more than 400 mm year the measurements indeed suggest that the ep is significantly overestimated by the mod16 especially for the finnmark region where the ep is below 200 mm year in contrast the hbv gleam and vic models give reasonable estimates compared to the measurements with average annual ep ranging from 200 to 300 mm year in the north and finnmark and from 200 to 500 mm year in other regions in addition the hbv model presents the finest resolution among all products so that it can clearly reflect the spatial distribution of different land cover types and climate regimes fig 5 compares the estimated ep with the measurements at the 42 stations the modis data gives the overall highest estimate and it is much higher than the measurements the gleam model using the priestley and taylor equation shows slightly higher estimates with less variability with respect to the measurements both the hbv and vic models which consider vegetation characteristics give slightly lower estimates with respect to the measurements however we should notice that the measurements at a point scale cannot be identical to the estimates for cells which constitute various land use types in addition the pan measurements are considered as the maximum value of e from large lake surfaces hetager and lystad 1974 so they should in principle be larger than the estimates using the penman monteith approaches therefore based on the assumption that the ep varied only marginally in the past 50 years indicated by the vic results we conclude that the penman monteith approach with prescribed vegetation parameters seems to provide reasonable ep estimates for the mainland of norway compared to the measurements 4 2 calibration and validation results on river discharge the hbv model was calibrated against discharge observations from 85 catchments which were classified into 5 groups based on the climatic zones see section 3 2 for details for each group of catchments the parameters listed in table 1 were estimated to minimize the objective function shown in eq 3 as a result there are 5 sets of parameters for the hbv model to simulate the whole land surface of norway fig 6 shows the evaluation results for different catchment groups within the calibration period 2000 2007 in general the hbv model can reproduce the daily discharge well for most calibration catchments with a median daily nse of 0 68 pbias of 3 kge of 0 70 and monthly nse of 0 80 the model shows different performance between the catchment groups and the median daily nse kge varies from 0 78 0 83 for group 1 to 0 56 0 64 for group 5 however we should note that there are only three catchments in group 1 so we cannot conclude that the hbv can reproduce the discharge in finnmark better than in other regions different from the daily nse and kge criteria the median pbias of all five groups are close to zero and about half of the catchments have a volume error within 12 5 the monthly nse shows lower variability between the groups than the daily values and is above 0 7 for more than 75 of the calibration catchments in all groups except group 3 fig 7 shows two examples of comparison between the observed and simulated daily monthly discharge and explains why the daily and monthly nses differ significantly the first example is the gauge 88 4 which is a glacier covered catchment in climatic zone 1 and shows the best simulation performance among all catchments the hbv model reproduces the distinct seasonality of discharge well with both daily and monthly time steps the second example is the gauge 127 13 which is located in tr√∏ndelag and shows one of the poorest simulation results the hbv model underestimated most discharge peaks significantly at the daily time step however the model reproduced the monthly peak satisfactorily the results show that the model is not capable to reproduce flood peaks in some catchments even though the high flow index was included in the calibration objective function it also indicates that the monthly simulation results are more reliable than the daily ones for such large scale modelling fig 6 further demonstrates a good temporal and spatial transferability of the hbv model in general the model presents a good performance for all calibrated catchments in the validation period with median daily nse of 0 67 pbias of 1 kge of 0 69 and monthly nse of 0 78 the daily nse and kge show slightly better model performance in terms of the lower quantile and the smallest values in the boxplots while the box of pbias expands by 2 3 indicating larger biases in some catchments the model performance declined for group 1 shown by the nse pbias and monthly nse while the simulated discharge was improved for group 5 with the daily time step for the spatial validation catchments all criteria show a similar or better model performance compared to the calibration ones in both periods this indicates that the calibrated parameterizations are appropriate for the non gauged grid cells and the spatial distribution of simulated runoff should be reliable finally we compared the performance criteria using the new version of hbv with the ones using the old version for all 124 catchments beldring et al 2003 in various periods in fig 8 the calibration period of the previous hbv application starts from 1991 to 2000 the comparison shows that the new methods improve the discharge simulation substantially for most catchments in all periods the median values of the daily nse kge and monthly nse increase by 0 08 0 16 though the median pbias of the previous simulation is also close to zero the extent of the boxes and whiskers is wider than the one of the new simulation indicating larger biases in the old than in the new simulations however both hbv versions show a robust temporal transferability for all catchments in addition to the boxplots we compared the distribution of daily nse and pbias in the whole simulation period 1983 2012 using the two hbv versions in fig 9 in general there is no obvious spatial pattern of nse in both simulation runs but the spatial pattern of pbias varies in some regions for example the new hbv generated less bias in the east and finnmark while the old one performs better in terms of bias along the coastline in tr√∏ndelag and north regions significant positive biases dark green dots are found in eastern and western norway for both simulations the spatial pattern of pbias partly reflects the bias distribution of the senorge precipitation data which is a big challenge of climate input data at fine resolutions 4 3 hydrological components the climate impacts on actual evapotranspiration runoff and snow water equivalent swe were assessed in the report climate in norway 2100 in this paper we compare these water components simulated by both versions of the hbv model to illustrate the differences in estimates due to model structures and calibration procedures fig 10 for the whole simulation period 1983 2012 the results show distinct differences in actual evapotranspiration and a high level of agreement in runoff between the previous and current simulations the old long term average evapotranspiration estimate is more than double of the evapotranspiration estimated in this study and it is much higher than the measured ep shown in fig 4 this is mainly caused by the overestimation of precipitation in the senorge 1 1 precipitation data saloranta 2014 and the calibration of ep in the previous application see table 1 both hbv simulations show that the long term average annual runoff is over 1100 mm for the mainland of norway this high agreement is not surprising because both calibrations are against discharge measurements from almost the same gauges nevertheless the spatial distribution of the two estimates differs at regional scales for example the previous hbv simulation shows the annual runoff of more than 3500 mm in large parts of western norway while the new simulation has moderate estimates in this region it is hard to conclude that one spatial distribution of annual runoff outperforms the other because the distribution of pbias at gauges does not show a systematic improvement using the new version of hbv fig 9 however it should be in general more precise in the new simulation as shown in fig 8 the long term annual maximum swe simulated by the two versions of hbv model differs by approximately 30 mm and the spatial distribution varies depending on regions the new model simulated higher swe especially in the north where the model was calibrated separately for climate zone 1 and 2 nevertheless both models show distinct swe depth between the western and eastern norway the simulated swe from both hbv versions were also compared with observed swe at 1151 stations in norway fig 11 the pearson correlation coefficients indicate that the new hbv performs better in term of swe than the old one in general the regression lines show that the new hbv simulated swe less than 500 mm very well but overestimated high swe values 1000 mm 5 discussion there is an increasing trend of using satellite derived data to improve hydrological modelling especially for data scarce regions however different studies showed that the satellite based data might not give reliable estimates in specific regions for example poor agreement between the modis16 actual evapotranspiration and the data from eddy covariance ec fluxes were found in south africa ramoelo et al 2014 and irrigation regions in china tang et al 2015 yang et al 2017 also found that the gleam data significantly overestimated the ec measurements at four forest sites and one cropland site in china the results from this study contribute to a better understanding of the suitability and the differences between ep products in norway they show that the modis ep may not be an appropriate product for norway compared with other products in contrast the penman monteith method using ground based vegetation data can provide reasonable ep estimates in the mainland of norway at a fine resolution therefore the satellite based estimates should be carefully evaluated before using them in hydrological modelling either for calibration or as input data for regional studies finally we should keep in mind that the measured and estimated ep are from two different historical time slices in this study the comparison results in figs 4 and 5 are strongly based on the assumption derived from the vic long term simulation which is also highly determined by the quality of input data such as the watch climate data and vegetation data new measurements in future are strongly recommended for a more reliable validation of ep estimates in norway using a more physically approach does not guarantee an improved model performance li et al 2015 magnusson et al 2015 orth et al 2015 te linde et al 2008 however the results in this study show a significant improvement on the spatial and temporal transferability of model parameterizations this improvement can be attributed to either a more robust estimation of ep or the use of a better regionalization approach or a combination of both the current approaches help to reduce the uncertainty of simulated hydrological components in norway especially for e in addition the distribution of performance criteria for monthly discharges in this study are comparable with the best results in yang et al 2018 who used a lumped conceptual model and a combined spatial proximity and physical similarity regionalization approach for multiple norwegian catchments hence this study presents a robust hydrological modelling for both river discharges and hydrological components at the national scale of norway finally the undercatch problem in the senorge 2 precipitation data lussana et al 2018 remains a significant challenge for hydrological modelling in norway although the precipitation undercatch can be corrected for each climatic zone the large pbias at specific gauges requires further improvement of the precipitation data in terms of magnitude and spatial distribution ideally the precipitation should not be corrected in the hydrological modelling and the hydrological model should still show satisfactory performance for all studied catchments hence there is still a long term work of improving the hydrological modelling with the up to date climate forcing data at fine resolutions this can be achieved by either improving the interpolation method for observed precipitation data or applying a fully coupled land atmosphere modelling system for data scarce regions as it is shown by naabil et al 2017 6 conclusion this study presents the recent progress in improving the distributed version of hbv for the mainland of norway firstly we improved the input data to the model by collecting multi source vegetation data at high spatial resolution and ground based meteorological forcing data e g maximum minimum air temperature and wind speed secondly we fed the high resolution data to the penman monteith equation to estimate potential evapotranspiration and validated the results by comparing with measurements and different satellite based products thirdly we applied regionalized parameterizations to calibrate the hbv model against discharge for multiple catchments the calibration and validation results show a significant improvement on the simulated discharge as well as hydrological components e g actual evapotranspiration compared to previous simulation results the transferability of model parameterizations was also enhanced yielding more robust simulation results both in time and in space as a result the current model setup is more appropriate for climate and land use impact studies and it is expected to project more reliable changes in discharge and hydrological components in norway further improvements are required for the existing national wide hydrological model improved precipitation data is urgently appreciated for a sound hydrological modelling it is also interesting to test other model structures e g snow and river routing schemes with different complexities and regionalization methods a robust snow modelling plays an essential role in the hydrological modelling for high latitudes as was shown in this study a physically based method may improve the hydrological simulation in norway thus we plan to test a physically based snow model for all grid cells in the mainland of norway and substitute it for the parametric snow module currently implemented in hbv declaration of interests the authors declare that

6236,a robust hydrological modeling at a fine spatial resolution is a vital tool for norway to simulate river discharges and hydrological components for climate adaptation strategies however it requires improvements of modelling methods detailed observational data as input and expensive computational resources this work aims to set up a distributed version of the hbv model with a physically based evapotranspiration scheme at 1 km resolution for mainland norway and to calibrate validate the model for 124 catchments using regionalized parameterizations the penman monteith equation was implemented in the hbv model and vegetation characteristics were derived from the norwegian forest inventory combined with multi source remote sensing data at 16 m spatial resolution the estimated potential evapotranspiration ep was compared with pan measurements and estimates from the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer mod16 products the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam and variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model there are 5 climatic zones in norway classified based on 4 temperature and precipitation indices for each zone the model was calibrated separately by optimizing a multi objective function including the nash sutcliff efficiency nse and biases of selected catchments in total there are 85 catchments for calibration and 39 for validation the ep estimates showed good agreement with the measurements gleam and vic outputs however the mod16 product significantly overestimates ep compared to the other products the discharge was well reproduced with the median daily nse of 0 68 0 67 bias of 3 1 kling gupta efficiency kge of 0 70 0 69 and monthly nse of 0 80 0 78 in the calibration validation periods our results showed a significant improvement compared to the previous hbv application for all catchments with an increase of 0 08 0 16 in the median values of the daily nse kge and monthly nse both the temporal and spatial transferability of model parameterizations were also enhanced compared to the previous application keywords regional calibration norway hbv high resolution potential evapotranspiration 1 introduction understanding the past present and future climate impacts serves as basis to develop adaptation strategies for decision makers it requires high spatial resolution information on projected impacts which can be directly applied in adaptation measures kaspersen et al 2012 for the water sector hydrological models are important tools to project the impact of climate change on runoff water resources and flooding at both regional and large scales olsson et al 2016 in norway the hbv model is one of the most widely used tools for runoff simulations bergstr√∂m 2006 the spatially distributed version of this model was used to produce the map of average annual runoff for norway at 1 km resolution beldring et al 2003 and showed good performance for river discharge and hydrological components e g snow storage soil moisture groundwater recharge and runoff in addition the model has been used to provide fine resolution hydrological projections in the climate impact assessments for the governmental report climate in norway 2100 hanssen bauer et al 2017 published by the norwegian centre for climate services nccs even though the hbv models has been used widely and shown good performance during evaluations the model requires further improvements on its conceptual model structure to better quantify the impacts of both climate and land use changes there is an increasing discussion whether conceptual rainfall runoff models are capable to simulate the water balance under changing climatic conditions coron et al 2014 fowler et al 2016 merz et al 2011 the calibrated parameters may not be valid under non stationary conditions and insufficient model calibration and validation strategies may further contribute to poor temporal transferability of models in addition to such issues measured precipitation at gauge stations exhibit problems in norway such as undercatch f√∏rland et al 1996 such uncertainties largely influences estimates of for example evapotranspiration e by hydrological models since e is constrained by potential evapotranspiration ep and soil moisture in the model robust ep estimates can help to reduce the uncertainty caused by biased precipitation data several studies reveal that different ep formulas could lead to different changes in ep as well as river discharge under climate scenarios mcafee 2013 seiller and anctil 2016 the use of data intensive methods i e the methods consider other climatic variables in addition to air temperature are recommended when estimating the possible effects of climatic changes on evaporative demand donohue et al 2010 mcafee 2013 a major restriction of using physically based ep methods e g penman monteith on a large scale is the lack of spatially distributed input data foremost vegetation parameters and meteorological forcing data recently an enhanced forest classification scheme based on the norwegian forest inventory combined with multi source remote sensing data majasalmi et al 2018 has become available providing detailed information at 16 m spatial resolution on forest vegetation characteristics in norway this enabled us to estimate ep using the penman monteith approach in the hbv model and to compare it with pan evaporation measurements and satellite based products such as products from the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer mod16 mu et al 2011 and the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam miralles et al 2011 satellite based products are considered as important land evaporation estimates on terrestrial water and energy cycles and environmental changes miralles et al 2016 and are increasingly used for model calibration or as input to hydrological models bowman et al 2017 demirel et al 2018 lopez et al 2017 spies et al 2015 however these satellite derived data have not yet been validated in norway due to lack of for example long term flux net data hence a comparison between the ground based measurements and the ep estimates using different input data and methods can improve the understanding of evaporation on the national scale which has rarely been documented in literature another potential improvement for the distributed version of the hbv modelling can be the application of a new calibration approach the previous version of the hbv model was calibrated simultaneously against the discharge of 141 catchments across norway beldring et al 2003 the calibration lasted for three months due to a large number of grid cells more than 300 000 and 69 calibration parameters in the recent decades there is an increasing trend of applying regionalization calibration approaches in large scale hydrological modelling abbaspour et al 2015 beck et al 2016 hundecha et al 2016 troy et al 2008 one widely used approach is to construct a regression model linking model parameters to catchment characteristics or other variables and perform the calibration hundecha et al 2016 rakovec et al 2016 other common approaches focus on geographic proximity oudin et al 2008 the climatic and or physiographic similarity of catchments or grid cells beck et al 2016 parajka et al 2007 troy et al 2008 they either interpolated independently calibrated parameters for selected catchments to other non gauged areas or calibrated multiple catchments with similar characteristics simultaneously and transfer the parameters to ungauged areas which have the similar characteristics of the calibrated catchments yang et al 2018 compared the performance of different regionalization approaches using the water and snow balance modeling system wasmod for 118 norwegian catchments they found that applying a set of regionalized parameters to catchments within one climatic zone shows similar results as the distance based regionalization methods and outperforms the regression based ones this study motivated us to apply a regionalized approach based on climatic similarities to calibrate the distributed hbv model it is expected to improve the runoff simulations both temporally and spatially for the whole land surface of norway in addition it can speed up the calibration procedure by calibrating different groups of catchments in parallel thus this study attempts to improve both the hbv model structure and the calibration procedure to better simulate ep as well as discharges for mainland norway it shows the first application of the modified hbv model using the penman monteith method with vegetation characteristics derived from a high resolution dataset and a regionalized calibration procedure the main objectives of this study are formulated as 1 to set up the distributed version of the hbv model with the penman monteith method at 1 km resolution for the mainland of norway 2 to evaluate the ep estimates using both ground and satellite based data 3 to calibrate and validate the model for 124 catchments using regionalized parameterizations and 4 to compare the simulated river discharge and hydrological components with the outputs from the previous hbv application used in the climate in norway 2100 report hanssen bauer et al 2017 2 study area norway is located in northern europe and covers an area of about 325 000 km2 the elevation spans from 0 m along the coast to more than 2000 m in the central regions fig 1 about half of the land area is covered by bare soil and heathers in high mountains and about 38 of the area is covered by forest there is a large number of lakes and bogs wetlands in norway covering about 5 and 6 of the total land surface respectively only about 3 of the land surface is used as arable land norwegian soils and aquifers are generally shallow and have a limited storage capacity consisting mainly of thin precipitation fed till deposits the bare mountain and moraine soils account for ca 80 of the total mainland area the mean annual temperature during 1971 2000 was about 1 3 c for the mainland hanssen bauer et al 2017 it is warmest along the coast of southern norway with the annual temperature up to 7 c while it is coldest in the high mountains with the annual temperature down to 4 c due to the low temperature only about 11 of the land area has a growing season lasting more than six months hanssen bauer et al 2017 similar to temperature the annual precipitation also shows a distinct spatial distribution ranging from 300 mm in south eastern and northern norway to more than 3500 mm in the west the mainland can be divided into 6 hydrological regimes finnmark nordland tr√∏ndelag western norway eastern norway and southern norway fig 1 in total 124 catchments were selected for model calibration and validation in this study figs 1 and 2 the distribution of the catchments represents various climate and hydrological regimes geographic conditions and landscape types in norway these catchments are also used for calibration in the previous hbv application and most of them are considered as near natural catchments beldring et al 2003 the size of the catchments varies from 7 to 15450 km2 and 85 of them are smaller than 1000 km2 as some of the catchments stretch along the national borders the catchment area in the neighbouring countries was also included in the hbv modelling see fig 2 detailed information of the 124 catchments is listed in appendix a 3 methods and data 3 1 hbv model the spatially distributed version of the hbv model used here beldring et al 2003 was developed for calculating the water balance for 1 1 km2 grid cells covering the entire mainland surface area of norway each grid cell can be subdivided into lake area glacier area and up to three vegetation types the model runs with a daily time step using precipitation and air mean temperature as input it calculates subgrid scale accumulation and ablation of snow interception storage distribution of soil moisture storage e groundwater storage runoff response lake evaporation and glacier mass balance the original method for computing ep uses a function of air temperature and the e is calculated based on ep field capacity and permanent wilting point see beldring et al 2003 for details and table 1 for the range of field capacity in this study the permanent wilting point was assumed as zero meter based on the assessments of the hbv parameterizations for scandinavian catchments by bergstr√∂m 1976 the snowmelt is calculated by a simple degree day method the runoff is simulated by two non linear parallel reservoirs representing direct discharge and the groundwater response the calibration parameters include parameters for evaporation and snowmelt processes in each land use type and for the soil and groundwater processes in each soil type table 1 detailed information of the model and the algorithms can be found in beldring et al 2003 and bergstr√∂m 1995 we reference the distributed hbv model described by beldring et al 2003 as the old version of the hbv model in this study in this study we improve the model structure by replacing the simple ep function with the penman monteith method ershadi et al 2015 compared the estimates of e using different structures of the penman monteith model a traditional single source model monteith 1965 a two layer model based on shuttleworth and wallace 1985 and a three source model based on mu et al 2011 they found that no single model structure consistently outperformed the others for all biome types in addition best estimates are often generated using the surface resistance parameterization based on the lookup table from mu et al 2011 and the thom 1975 formulation for aerodynamic resistance that incorporated dynamic values of roughness parameters based on their findings and data availability of this study we applied the traditional single source

jonsson 2014 while the timing of autumn phenophases in a given location is assumed to be determined by photoperiod and it is simulated with constant senescence dates the lai for crops is estimated by a simplified epic crop model williams et al 1984 we applied the biome property look up table from mu et al 2011 to estimate the surface resistance parameters for vegetation for other land cover types e g urban and built up we used the parameterizations from the evapotranspiration model amor tallaksen et al 1996 which was developed for norway all parameterization for the penman monteith method is prescribed in the hbv model see appendix b for the prescribed parameter values since there is no calibration parameters needed for the ep simulation e g lai vegetation height albedo and bulk resistance the ep estimates must be validated against ground measurements and other model products before the model is calibrated against discharges in addition we corrected the rainfall gauge undercatch by a continuous adjustment function derived by wolff et al 2015 based on data from a test site in southern norway however we found that this correction function cannot guarantee a reliable correction for other parts of norway thus the precipitation snow correction coefficients need to be adjusted for each climatic zone in this study table 1 3 2 regionalized calibration the hbv model was calibrated and validated using discharge observations from 124 catchments spread across the whole country fig 2 as we mentioned in section 3 1 all parameters used by the penman monteith method were prescribed so we should validate the ep estimates to ensure a reasonable simulation for this process based on the validation of ep for the period 2000 2012 the details on the selection of period are explained in section 3 4 we can start the model calibration against discharges for the period of 2000 2007 which lies in the validation period of ep and minimizes the calibration time consumption the period 1983 1999 was used for validation yang et al 2018 applied a set of regionalized model parameters to multiple catchments with similar climate conditions in norway and found satisfactory runoff simulations which are comparable with the results using distance based regionalization approaches see fig 8 in their paper following their study we selected the regionalization approach based on climatic similarity in this study i e multiple catchments with similar climatic conditions were calibrated simultaneously and the calibrated parameters sets were transferred to other ungauged grid cells within the same climatic zone it was further assumed that each climatic zone has similar precipitation correction factors we used four climatic indices to classify the study domain into five distinct climatic zones the indices are mean annual precipitation precipitation seasonality index the ratio between the three consecutive wettest and driest months mean annual temperature and temperature seasonality index the mean temperature of the hottest month minus the mean temperature of the coldest month the indices were calculated for each 1 1 km2 grid cell and the k mean clustering method hartigan and wong 1979 was applied to the standardized indices for all modelling grid cells fig 2 illustrates the five climatic zones after classification and fig 3 shows that the zones represent not only distinct climatic regimes but also different geophysical and land cover characteristics though only the climate indices were used for classification zone 1 is mainly located in the far north region with lowest temperature and precipitation but a high seasonality index zone 2 spreads in the mountainous region from the south to the north so it has the highest elevation among the five zones this zone is mainly covered by bedrock and heathers and has almost no forest zone 3 is the warmest and wettest area and is situated along the west coast it has a low climate seasonality index and it is covered by both forest and heather zone 4 is mainly located in east norway and zone 5 in the southern and central part of norway both zones have high coverage of forest but they differ in all climatic indices moderately for calibration we selected catchments with drainage areas predominantly situated within one distinct climate zone fig 2 as a result there are five calibration groups with 3 20 31 13 and 18 catchments selected for zone 1 5 respectively the remaining 39 catchments which cover more than one climatic zone form the validation group used for testing the spatial transferability of the model we calibrated the model for each climatic zone in parallel to speed up the calibration procedure and improve the simulation results on discharge for the selected catchments three criteria were used for multi criteria optimization the non dimensional performance criterion of nash and sutcliffe 1970 efficiency nse the percent bias pbias in water balance and the percent volume bias in the high flow segment of the flow duration curve Œ¥fhv 0 0 02 flow exceedance probabilities yilmaz et al 2008 Œ¥fhv is an index for high flows aiming to improve the simulation of floods the parameter estimation routine pest doherty and skahill 2006 was applied for finding the parameter set giving the best model performance using the multi criteria defined above since pest minimizes the difference between the criteria results and their ideal values 1 for nse and 0 for biases the calibration objective function containing three criteria at multiple gauges can be formulated as eq 3 3 Œ∏ w nse i 1 n 1 nse i 2 w pbias i 1 n pbias i 2 w Œ¥ f h v i 1 n Œ¥ f h v i 2 where w are weights and n are the number of calibration catchments within each group there is an equal weight between catchments but the w nse is higher than the bias weights to achieve a good calibration performance as the calibration time is significantly reduced by parallel calibration 8 10 pest runs were carried out with various initial parameter values which were randomly generated within the parameter ranges listed in table 1 after the calibration the model performance was evaluated using the daily nse pbias kling gupta efficiency kge kling et al 2012 and monthly nse for all 124 catchments in both calibration and validation periods 3 3 model input data to setup the distributed version of the hbv model we used a digital elevation model dem soil and land cover raster maps with 1 km horizontal resolution the dem map is obtained from the norwegian mapping authority the swedish national land survey and the national land survey of finland the soil map combines the information from the geological survey of norway and the international soil reference and information centre isric http isric org eight soil types were reclassified for the modelling domain high resolution land cover information was derived from the national land resource map ahlstr√∏m et al 2014 and a remote sensing based forest map sat skog gjertsen and nilsen 2012 complemented by corine land cover 2000 https www eea europa eu data and maps data clc 2000 raster 4 for areas outside norway and was aggregated to percentage share of different land cover types at 1 1 km2 hbv modelling resolution the land cover classification distinguishes eight general land use types open area bog built up cropland heather bedrock lake permanent ice and snow and 12 structural forest types to better reflect spatial variability in hydrologically relevant land surface properties within forested areas the forest types are based on the classification scheme developed by majasalmi et al 2018 for fennoscandian forests which consists of three species groups spruce pine and deciduous dominated with four structural subgroups each look up tables provided by majasalmi et al 2018 were used to parameterize maximum leaf area index and vegetation height in hbv shortwave albedo was parametrized with values given in bright et al 2018 the new version of the distributed hbv model requires seven climate variables with daily time steps as input mean maximum and minimum air temperature tmean tmax tmin precipitation p shortwave incoming radiation swr vapour pressure vp and wind speed the senorge2 precipitation dataset lussana et al 2018 provides an observational gridded dataset over norway from 1957 to the present day this dataset is the most updated precipitation data from the norwegian meteorological institute it shows more precise estimates of annual average precipitation than senorge version 1 1 mohr 2008 which was used as input in the previous hbv application beldring et al 2003 however the product substantially underestimates precipitation in data sparse areas and inherits the undercatch problem from the measurements lussana et al 2018 the tmax tmin and wind datasets are based on different post processing procedures applied to norwegian reanalysis 10 km nora10 product reistad et al 2011 which is a dataset of hindcasts i e dynamical downscaling of a global reanalysis or analysis system over the scandinavian peninsula tmin and tmax combine the nora10 derived daily extreme temperature fields with in situ observations from a climate station network from 1981 to 2012 lussana 2017 the wind dataset is the result of a quantile mapping scheme aimed at adjusting the nora10 bias to better match the climatology of a high resolution numerical weather prediction model such as applications of research to operations at mesoscale model for meteorological cooperation on operational numerical weather prediction arome metcoop mueller et al 2017 all datasets have the same 1 1 km2 grid domain as the senorge datasets which covers the norwegian mainland plus a strip of land extending into sweden and finland based on the tmax tmin p and wind data for the period 1982 2012 we applied the mountain microclimate simulation model mtclim bohn et al 2013 which is embedded in the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model liang et al 1994 version 4 1 2 to generate remaining climate variables required by hbv tmean swr and vp for the same period 3 4 data for potential evapotranspiration and snow water equivalent comparison ground measurements of ep are scarce in norway there are only pan measurements from the thorsrud 2500 evaporimeter available at 42 locations across the country from 1967 to 1972 for the warm months may september hetager and lystad 1974 due to the cold climate and low winter insolation in norway the majority of e occurs in these warm months as shown in other high latitude areas shutov et al 2006 two recently published satellite based products were selected for comparison with the hbv estimates and the pan measurements these are the mod16 products of mean annual ep from 2000 to 2012 http files ntsg umt edu data ntsg products mod16 mod16a2 monthly merra gmao 1kmalb geotiff 0 05degree and the gleam annual ep available from 1980 to 2014 https www gleam eu the mod16 products use a penman monteith based method but estimate potential soil evaporation soil evaporation from wet soil surface canopy evaporation and potential transpiration from plant tissues separately mu et al 2011 the climate forcing of mod16 is derived from the daily global metrological reanalysis data from nasa s global modeling and assimilation office gmao at 1 1 25 resolution in contrast the gleam ep was calculated using the priestley and taylor equation miralles et al 2011 and the climate forcing data combines the era interim and mswep v1 0 reanalysis data at 0 25 resolution none of the satellite products and the hbv simulation can be directly compared with the measurements due to different time spans therefore we applied the vic hydrological model to simulate the long term ep from 1961 to 2012 to bridge the temporal gaps the vic model gives an approximation of the recent warming impacts on ep between the period 2000 2013 and 1967 1972 and helps to justify the comparison between the observations and estimations the vic model used the global vic input parameters at 0 5 resolution nijssen et al 2001 and the reanalysis climate forcing data from the water and global change watch project weedon et al 2011 as input the ep is estimated from an area weighted sum of potential transpiration and potential soil evaporation using the penman monteith based method for each grid cell the snow water equivalent swe data saloranta 2012 was calculated based on the measurements of snow depth and density recorded at stations operated by various hydropower companies since 1914 the stations were mainly located in the central mountain area in the southern eastern and western norway see appendix c most of the measurements 60 are taken once per snow season around the time of the maximum annual swe march april but at many stations several up to 13 measurements per snow season have been taken the whole data set has been quality controlled by removing or correcting bad or duplicate values and outliers only data in the period 1983 2012 were used in model evaluation resulting in 22 032 observations at 1151 stations see appendix c 4 results 4 1 validation of potential evapotranspiration estimates the ep estimates for the summer months may sep from the hbv model mod16 gleam and the vic model are compared with the pan measurements in fig 4 the measurements are only available during the period from 1967 to 1972 in norway while the model estimates span from 2000 to 2012 as we mentioned in section 3 4 we ran the vic model for the past 50 years to evaluate how ep varied in different historical time slices the long term simulation with the vic model shows that there is a slight increase of 6 mm year in ep from the period 1962 1970 to 2000 2012 see appendix d this increase is very small compared to the average annual ep that varies between 237 and 254 mm year for the period spanning the past 50 years therefore we assume that the difference of measured ep between 2000 and 2012 and 1967 1972 is also negligible and we can directly compare the estimates with the measurements as shown in fig 4 all estimates have good agreement with an average annual ep of 230 260 mm year except the mod16 product the mod16 shows a very high average annual ep of more than 400 mm year the measurements indeed suggest that the ep is significantly overestimated by the mod16 especially for the finnmark region where the ep is below 200 mm year in contrast the hbv gleam and vic models give reasonable estimates compared to the measurements with average annual ep ranging from 200 to 300 mm year in the north and finnmark and from 200 to 500 mm year in other regions in addition the hbv model presents the finest resolution among all products so that it can clearly reflect the spatial distribution of different land cover types and climate regimes fig 5 compares the estimated ep with the measurements at the 42 stations the modis data gives the overall highest estimate and it is much higher than the measurements the gleam model using the priestley and taylor equation shows slightly higher estimates with less variability with respect to the measurements both the hbv and vic models which consider vegetation characteristics give slightly lower estimates with respect to the measurements however we should notice that the measurements at a point scale cannot be identical to the estimates for cells which constitute various land use types in addition the pan measurements are considered as the maximum value of e from large lake surfaces hetager and lystad 1974 so they should in principle be larger than the estimates using the penman monteith approaches therefore based on the assumption that the ep varied only marginally in the past 50 years indicated by the vic results we conclude that the penman monteith approach with prescribed vegetation parameters seems to provide reasonable ep estimates for the mainland of norway compared to the measurements 4 2 calibration and validation results on river discharge the hbv model was calibrated against discharge observations from 85 catchments which were classified into 5 groups based on the climatic zones see section 3 2 for details for each group of catchments the parameters listed in table 1 were estimated to minimize the objective function shown in eq 3 as a result there are 5 sets of parameters for the hbv model to simulate the whole land surface of norway fig 6 shows the evaluation results for different catchment groups within the calibration period 2000 2007 in general the hbv model can reproduce the daily discharge well for most calibration catchments with a median daily nse of 0 68 pbias of 3 kge of 0 70 and monthly nse of 0 80 the model shows different performance between the catchment groups and the median daily nse kge varies from 0 78 0 83 for group 1 to 0 56 0 64 for group 5 however we should note that there are only three catchments in group 1 so we cannot conclude that the hbv can reproduce the discharge in finnmark better than in other regions different from the daily nse and kge criteria the median pbias of all five groups are close to zero and about half of the catchments have a volume error within 12 5 the monthly nse shows lower variability between the groups than the daily values and is above 0 7 for more than 75 of the calibration catchments in all groups except group 3 fig 7 shows two examples of comparison between the observed and simulated daily monthly discharge and explains why the daily and monthly nses differ significantly the first example is the gauge 88 4 which is a glacier covered catchment in climatic zone 1 and shows the best simulation performance among all catchments the hbv model reproduces the distinct seasonality of discharge well with both daily and monthly time steps the second example is the gauge 127 13 which is located in tr√∏ndelag and shows one of the poorest simulation results the hbv model underestimated most discharge peaks significantly at the daily time step however the model reproduced the monthly peak satisfactorily the results show that the model is not capable to reproduce flood peaks in some catchments even though the high flow index was included in the calibration objective function it also indicates that the monthly simulation results are more reliable than the daily ones for such large scale modelling fig 6 further demonstrates a good temporal and spatial transferability of the hbv model in general the model presents a good performance for all calibrated catchments in the validation period with median daily nse of 0 67 pbias of 1 kge of 0 69 and monthly nse of 0 78 the daily nse and kge show slightly better model performance in terms of the lower quantile and the smallest values in the boxplots while the box of pbias expands by 2 3 indicating larger biases in some catchments the model performance declined for group 1 shown by the nse pbias and monthly nse while the simulated discharge was improved for group 5 with the daily time step for the spatial validation catchments all criteria show a similar or better model performance compared to the calibration ones in both periods this indicates that the calibrated parameterizations are appropriate for the non gauged grid cells and the spatial distribution of simulated runoff should be reliable finally we compared the performance criteria using the new version of hbv with the ones using the old version for all 124 catchments beldring et al 2003 in various periods in fig 8 the calibration period of the previous hbv application starts from 1991 to 2000 the comparison shows that the new methods improve the discharge simulation substantially for most catchments in all periods the median values of the daily nse kge and monthly nse increase by 0 08 0 16 though the median pbias of the previous simulation is also close to zero the extent of the boxes and whiskers is wider than the one of the new simulation indicating larger biases in the old than in the new simulations however both hbv versions show a robust temporal transferability for all catchments in addition to the boxplots we compared the distribution of daily nse and pbias in the whole simulation period 1983 2012 using the two hbv versions in fig 9 in general there is no obvious spatial pattern of nse in both simulation runs but the spatial pattern of pbias varies in some regions for example the new hbv generated less bias in the east and finnmark while the old one performs better in terms of bias along the coastline in tr√∏ndelag and north regions significant positive biases dark green dots are found in eastern and western norway for both simulations the spatial pattern of pbias partly reflects the bias distribution of the senorge precipitation data which is a big challenge of climate input data at fine resolutions 4 3 hydrological components the climate impacts on actual evapotranspiration runoff and snow water equivalent swe were assessed in the report climate in norway 2100 in this paper we compare these water components simulated by both versions of the hbv model to illustrate the differences in estimates due to model structures and calibration procedures fig 10 for the whole simulation period 1983 2012 the results show distinct differences in actual evapotranspiration and a high level of agreement in runoff between the previous and current simulations the old long term average evapotranspiration estimate is more than double of the evapotranspiration estimated in this study and it is much higher than the measured ep shown in fig 4 this is mainly caused by the overestimation of precipitation in the senorge 1 1 precipitation data saloranta 2014 and the calibration of ep in the previous application see table 1 both hbv simulations show that the long term average annual runoff is over 1100 mm for the mainland of norway this high agreement is not surprising because both calibrations are against discharge measurements from almost the same gauges nevertheless the spatial distribution of the two estimates differs at regional scales for example the previous hbv simulation shows the annual runoff of more than 3500 mm in large parts of western norway while the new simulation has moderate estimates in this region it is hard to conclude that one spatial distribution of annual runoff outperforms the other because the distribution of pbias at gauges does not show a systematic improvement using the new version of hbv fig 9 however it should be in general more precise in the new simulation as shown in fig 8 the long term annual maximum swe simulated by the two versions of hbv model differs by approximately 30 mm and the spatial distribution varies depending on regions the new model simulated higher swe especially in the north where the model was calibrated separately for climate zone 1 and 2 nevertheless both models show distinct swe depth between the western and eastern norway the simulated swe from both hbv versions were also compared with observed swe at 1151 stations in norway fig 11 the pearson correlation coefficients indicate that the new hbv performs better in term of swe than the old one in general the regression lines show that the new hbv simulated swe less than 500 mm very well but overestimated high swe values 1000 mm 5 discussion there is an increasing trend of using satellite derived data to improve hydrological modelling especially for data scarce regions however different studies showed that the satellite based data might not give reliable estimates in specific regions for example poor agreement between the modis16 actual evapotranspiration and the data from eddy covariance ec fluxes were found in south africa ramoelo et al 2014 and irrigation regions in china tang et al 2015 yang et al 2017 also found that the gleam data significantly overestimated the ec measurements at four forest sites and one cropland site in china the results from this study contribute to a better understanding of the suitability and the differences between ep products in norway they show that the modis ep may not be an appropriate product for norway compared with other products in contrast the penman monteith method using ground based vegetation data can provide reasonable ep estimates in the mainland of norway at a fine resolution therefore the satellite based estimates should be carefully evaluated before using them in hydrological modelling either for calibration or as input data for regional studies finally we should keep in mind that the measured and estimated ep are from two different historical time slices in this study the comparison results in figs 4 and 5 are strongly based on the assumption derived from the vic long term simulation which is also highly determined by the quality of input data such as the watch climate data and vegetation data new measurements in future are strongly recommended for a more reliable validation of ep estimates in norway using a more physically approach does not guarantee an improved model performance li et al 2015 magnusson et al 2015 orth et al 2015 te linde et al 2008 however the results in this study show a significant improvement on the spatial and temporal transferability of model parameterizations this improvement can be attributed to either a more robust estimation of ep or the use of a better regionalization approach or a combination of both the current approaches help to reduce the uncertainty of simulated hydrological components in norway especially for e in addition the distribution of performance criteria for monthly discharges in this study are comparable with the best results in yang et al 2018 who used a lumped conceptual model and a combined spatial proximity and physical similarity regionalization approach for multiple norwegian catchments hence this study presents a robust hydrological modelling for both river discharges and hydrological components at the national scale of norway finally the undercatch problem in the senorge 2 precipitation data lussana et al 2018 remains a significant challenge for hydrological modelling in norway although the precipitation undercatch can be corrected for each climatic zone the large pbias at specific gauges requires further improvement of the precipitation data in terms of magnitude and spatial distribution ideally the precipitation should not be corrected in the hydrological modelling and the hydrological model should still show satisfactory performance for all studied catchments hence there is still a long term work of improving the hydrological modelling with the up to date climate forcing data at fine resolutions this can be achieved by either improving the interpolation method for observed precipitation data or applying a fully coupled land atmosphere modelling system for data scarce regions as it is shown by naabil et al 2017 6 conclusion this study presents the recent progress in improving the distributed version of hbv for the mainland of norway firstly we improved the input data to the model by collecting multi source vegetation data at high spatial resolution and ground based meteorological forcing data e g maximum minimum air temperature and wind speed secondly we fed the high resolution data to the penman monteith equation to estimate potential evapotranspiration and validated the results by comparing with measurements and different satellite based products thirdly we applied regionalized parameterizations to calibrate the hbv model against discharge for multiple catchments the calibration and validation results show a significant improvement on the simulated discharge as well as hydrological components e g actual evapotranspiration compared to previous simulation results the transferability of model parameterizations was also enhanced yielding more robust simulation results both in time and in space as a result the current model setup is more appropriate for climate and land use impact studies and it is expected to project more reliable changes in discharge and hydrological components in norway further improvements are required for the existing national wide hydrological model improved precipitation data is urgently appreciated for a sound hydrological modelling it is also interesting to test other model structures e g snow and river routing schemes with different complexities and regionalization methods a robust snow modelling plays an essential role in the hydrological modelling for high latitudes as was shown in this study a physically based method may improve the hydrological simulation in norway thus we plan to test a physically based snow model for all grid cells in the mainland of norway and substitute it for the parametric snow module currently implemented in hbv declaration of interests the authors declare that

6237,calibrating a spatially distributed hydrological model of a region with complex and highly diverse agricultural settings is a difficult task it becomes even more challenging if major parts of the hydrology are human controlled e g through irrigation agriculture in this study a soil and water assessment tool swat was set up and calibrated for an entirely managed meso scale irrigation scheme where irrigation channels are the only water courses and no natural streams exist an automated and spatially distributed model calibration was applied implementing the global dynamically dimensioned search algorithm dds and using kling gupta efficiency kge as objective function to account for the spatio temporal heterogeneity of water balance fluxes in the calibration process remote sensing derived evapotranspiration et estimates with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km were used as observational data results showed that the automated and spatially distributed model calibration was able to increase the model et simulation performance from 0 04 to 0 27 kge however a strong land use dependent goodness of fit ranging from approx 0 60 kge to 0 60 kge for individual land use types revealed that the information extracted from remote sensing derived et estimates used in this study is lacking the necessary spatial heterogeneity an unsatisfactory spatial comparison between simulated et and et derived from remote sensing estimates showed to inhibit better calibration results for the study area which is characterized by small scale and diverse cropping patterns using a modified remote sensing derived et product which accounts for land use class dependent et characteristics improved the overall calibration results to 0 40 kge a cross validation could indicate a successful application of this automated and spatially distributed model calibration approach using the modified et product keywords swat hydrological model sebal calibration dds evapotranspiration 1 introduction the importance of calibrating and validating hydrological models and thereby assessing their uncertainties before using them for predictions and decision making is unquestionable however with increasing model complexity the calibration procedure has become increasingly difficult for example problems with unique parameter identification of large unknown model parameter sets i e model equifinality and issues of model and data uncertainties become more severe abbaspour et al 2017 gupta et al 1998 zhang et al 2008 especially in highly managed systems with small scale agricultural practices and spatially as well as temporarily diverse hydrological processes bastiaanssen and bandara 2001 furthermore due to intensive human actions as well as due to climate change hydrological systems became statistically non stationary fatichi et al 2016 which makes the calibration of physically based water balance models for such impacted systems very challenging to capture the interdependency of various water fluxes and the spatio temporal heterogeneity of hydrological processes calibration should preferably be done with process based variables which reflect the relevant interactions of the numerous water balance components arnold et al 2012 streamflow is therefore most often taken as calibration variable as its dynamic can be closely related to variations in water balance components such as evapotranspiration et surface runoff interflow and infiltration or percolation rates hence observed and simulated hydrographs are commonly compared and discharge based objective functions serve as evaluation criteria for model performance however using streamflow data for calibration is difficult in areas which lack run off information or even the presence of a natural river network to tackle the calibration challenge et data have gained importance in the calibration process of hydrological models and have been used for calibration in various studies legates and mccabe 1999 lopez lopez et al 2017 rajib et al 2018 rientjes et al 2013 tobin and bennett 2017 one advantage is that et data can be derived from remote sensing platforms making spatio temporally distributed calibration data available moreover et serves as an overall indicator for surface water availability independent of the cause of its availability i e if water allocation was human or naturally induced hence from et principal changes in hydrological processes can still be inferred even if surface water availability is controlled by often unknown human decisions examples for such controlled systems are entirely managed irrigation schemes where irrigation channels are the only water courses in the study area and no further natural streams exist the channel discharge is usually exclusively determined by management decisions following formal local policies as well as informal local agreements these sometimes subjective and therefore often unpredictable decisions on water channel flows might interfere with or even supersede the natural behavior of the hydrological system thus streamflow becomes inappropriate as fitting variable during calibration immerzeel and droogers 2008 a successful inverse estimation of spatially distributed model parameters through calibration based on these entirely managed runoff values is therefore highly unlikely in this case an alternative way of model calibration has to be applied this approach has to account for the spatial heterogeneity of water balance fluxes and at the same time it has to be independent from unforeseeable water management decisions in addition to be able to address research questions on changing hydrological fluxes with respect to changing land use or small scale agricultural management strategies an evaluation of the distributed behavior of the model beyond just catchment integrated performance is needed zink et al 2018 the implementation of such a spatial evaluation into the calibration procedure as well as the high number of model parameters which need to be parameterized make a trial and error calibration of complex distributed models unfeasible usman et al 2018 for this reason automated calibration strategies which use optimization algorithms to find the best parameter values are increasingly used for parameter estimation several studies exist on the application of automated calibration procedures for lumped models sorooshian et al 1993 vrugt et al 2003 and since the past decade these approaches have also been used for spatially distributed models campo et al 2006 immerzeel and droogers 2008 li et al 2018 zink et al 2018 immerzeel and droogers 2008 used remotely sensed et data to calibrate a spatially distributed swat soil water assessment tool model in an automated calibration approach a comparable methodology using the same model and et estimation procedure will be presented here in this study however a stronger focus is laid on the challenges of using remote sensing derived et data for model calibration in a highly diverse agricultural setting past studies outline the complexity of spatially distributed hydrological model applications in irrigation systems and intensively used agricultural areas droogers et al 2000 jiang et al 2015 and also specifically of swat model applications in such managed regions awan et al 2016 dechmi et al 2012 yet as far as the authors are concerned the application of automated calibration strategies using remote sensing derived et data for models of entirely managed irrigation system has not yet been studied in depth key subjects this study addresses are therefore i the calibration of a spatially distributed hydrological model of an entirely managed irrigation system using satellite et measurements and ii to evaluate the suitability of et data derived from a surface energy balance algorithm sebal for calibrating a swat model in such a complex agricultural setting finally the potential and limitations of this calibration approach is examined to assess the importance of spatial information in the observation data set used for calibration 2 study area the calibration methodology described in this study is applied using a hydrological model of the intensively irrigated rechna doab in the punjab region in pakistan fig 1 study area is the lower chenab canal system lcc which comprises about 15 000 km2 of agricultural land and which is located between the rivers chenab and ravi with river chenab being the main source for irrigation water supply the region highly depends on water resources extracted from sources outside of the study area annual precipitation of about 500 mm and potential et of about 1800 mm show this strong demand for additional water supply for irrigation the annual distribution of precipitation is characterized by strong monsoonal rain events in the summer months which account for approx 75 of the annual total rainfall awan and ismaeel 2014 evaporation follows the annual temperature pattern and shows maximum values of approx 200 mm month during summer months and minimum values of approx 50 mm month during winter months in the lcc area the entire hydrological system is artificially built and managed to supply the necessary irrigation water during the colder and dry winter season rabi as well as during the hot and wet summer season kharif during dry winter season the dominating crop type is winter wheat while during the wetter summer the crop pattern diversifies and mainly cotton maize rice and fodder are grown on small scale farm plots the topography of the area is entirely flat and the hydrology is driven by a dense irrigation canal network no natural river exists in this area 3 material and methods 3 1 swat model the soil water assessment tool swat model software arnold et al 1998 is used for this study main reasons for the selection of swat are its capability to incorporate detailed management strategies e g irrigation schedule and efficiency planting schedule plant physiognomy and to account for spatially distributed land use and management changes and their effects on single water balance components such as et which is used as fitting variable in the calibration process basic datasets needed to set up a swat model are topography soil characteristics land cover data and meteorological time series sources as well as temporal and spatial resolution for each dataset used in this study are listed in the appendix table a 1 detailed information on the generation and quality control of land cover data can be found in awan et al 2016 and awan and ismaeel 2014 in addition crop rotation patterns are considered and specific planting and harvesting times are defined for each major crop type according to fig 2 the spatial discretization is represented in swat by hydrological response units hrus each representing specific soil land cover and topographic characteristics their extent in the study area varies from approx 0 008 km2 to 340 km2 with a mean extent of approx 20 km2 the size of an hru depends on the homogeneity of the underlying soil and land use characteristics with larger sizes for homogeneous and smaller sizes for heterogeneous landscape patterns respectively irrigation is assumed to be demand based i e an irrigation supply function is automatically activated every time water availability falls below a water demand threshold even though the irrigation schedule in our study area is supposed to follow the stringent local warabandi irrigation scheme with fixed water allocation schedules qureshi and hussain 1994 irrigation according to plant water demand better represents the actual local irrigation practice where groundwater pumping and on site irrigation water storage are leading to a more flexible and demand based irrigation qureshi et al 2010 administrative boundaries of the so called irrigation sub divisions fig 1 are used to delineate pre defined artificial sub catchments the reason for this artificial catchment delineation is the local surface water allocation system apart from precipitation surface water availability for agricultural purposes is entirely human controlled and its allocation strictly follows the administrative rules of irrigation canal command areas this however implies that sub catchments are purely administratively defined and are not bounded by topography this again infers that a model based on these artificial sub catchment delineations can only calculate water balance components correctly if surface and subsurface flows between these catchments are negligible an assumption which seems very plausible considering the entirely flat nature of our study area the restricted surface runoff due to dams surrounding the fields to enable furrow and flood irrigation as well as the high plant water demand which leads to negligible horizontal water movement hence to ensure a suitable swat model application in our study area with its specific local characteristics the following assumptions are made i irrigation is driven by plant water demand ii no lateral flow exists between hrus iii streamflow is ignored as a valid response variable due to the fact that water availability in the channels is entirely human controlled and no natural streams exist which could indicate a natural response to changes in hydrological fluxes consequentially routing routines are disabled and the entire analysis of the model outputs is based only on hru level and no further spatial aggregation e g basin or sub basin scale is made therefore swat is used for this study rather like a land surface model than a conventional surface runoff model this unconventional swat model set up adds to the fact that discharge cannot be used for calibration hence a spatially distributed calibration on hru level becomes necessary to guarantee a sound evaluation of the model performance in this study we take actual et etact as fitting variable as it can be used to derive spatially distributed information on surface water fluxes actual et etact is calculated in swat as the sum of the potential evaporation from the intercept storage rain water trapped in the plant canopy actual soil water evaporation and actual plant transpiration potential soil water evaporation and potential plant transpiration are calculated in swat using the penman monteith et equation eq 1 1 et 1 Œª Œ¥ r n g o œÅ a c a e s e a r a Œ¥ Œ≥ 1 r s r a where et is the potential evapotranspiration mm day 1 r n is the daily net radiation mj m 2 day 1 g o is the soil heat flux mj m 2 day 1 œÅ a is the mean density of air at constant pressure kg m 3 c a is the specific heat of air mj kg 1 c 1 e s e a is the vapor pressure deficit of the air kpa r a and r s are aerodynamic and bulk surface resistances s m 1 Œ¥ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 Œ≥ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 and Œª is the latent heat of vaporization mj kg 1 swat calculates reference et etref with fixed resistance factors for a reference alfalfa crop as well as a plant type specific potential et etp with varying plant specific r a and r s parameters meteorological data from local climate stations is used to retrieve the climate parameters leaf area indices as well as crop heights are used to determine aerodynamic and surface resistances of specific crop types for estimating etp following etref is used to estimate the potential soil water evaporation where etref is adjusted for evaporation of free water in the canopy and is then related to the degree of soil shading to account for et reducing effects due to soil cover by plants actual soil water evaporation is then calculated using a biomass dependent soil cover index and information on available water storage capacity awc coefficient in the soil the awc coefficient controlling the available water storage capacity was found to be highly sensitive with respect to et variations and is therefore used as one of the calibration parameters etp is taken as the maximum possible plant transpiration and is adjusted according to the available water in the soil profile to estimate actual plant water uptake which equals the actual plant transpiration using the plant uptake compensation factor epco coefficient the depths from where water is allowed to be used for plant uptake can be adjusted this parameter was likewise found to be highly sensitive in controlling et in our study and is therefore also included into the calibration parameter set table 2 finally the swat model is run on a monthly basis to generate a monthly et time series with a spatial resolution identical to the resolution of the model hrus this means that the swat et output is not a gridded product but holds hru discretization and therefore land use soil and topography dependent et information 3 2 sebal remote sensing data provide spatially distributed information on actual et and thus enables the possibility for a spatially distributed calibration procedure in this study we use et act estimates from usman et al 2015a who derived spatio temporal et act estimates from modis satellite data using the surface energy balance algorithm sebal approach briefly described below the sebal surface energy balance algorithm approach bastiaanssen et al 1998a 1998b was developed to estimate spatially distributed information on surface energy balances it is based on the land surface energy balance theory which relates the single incoming and outgoing energy components through the energy balance equation 2 r n g 0 h l e where rn net radiation g0 ground heat flux h sensible heat flux and le latent heat of vaporization all in w m 2 the energy required for et latent heat of vaporization le can therefore be calculated as the residual term of the equation 3 le r n g 0 h sebal solves this equation by retrieving surface characteristics such as surface albedo normalized differenced vegetation indices ndvis surface temperature and emissivity based on remotely sensed information of spectral radiances in the visible near infrared and thermal infrared spectrum using these derived surface characteristics sebal converts the spectral information into the surface energy fluxes rn g0 and h to estimate le the computation of sensible heat flux h is hereby the most challenging part h is calculated by 4 h œÅ a c a Œ¥ t r a where all constants are as listed above eq 1 and Œ¥t is the vertical temperature difference between two heights the unknown Œ¥t is calculated by using the hottest and the coldest pixels of the remote sensing image as anchor pixels where maximum and minimum le is sensed it is assumed that h of all other pixels relate linearly to the derived slope of Œ¥t the aerodynamic resistance factor r a depends amongst other parameters on land cover i e plant type dependent parameters such as plant height to define the roughness length for heat transfer this information is derived from land use maps or using the derived albedo and ndvi data once rn and h are computed g0 is neglected due to daily calculation of et le can be calculated and is then used to define the instantaneous evaporative fraction efins by 5 e f i n s l e le h to finally calculate daily et by 6 e t d a y 86400 10 3 e f i n s r nday Œª œÅ w where rnday is daily net radiation w m 2 Œª is latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 and œÅw is the density of water kg m 3 to average daily et to a monthly value daily et is related to a reference et etref which can be calculated on a daily basis using the penman monteith equation and daily meteorological data subsequently the cumulative etref of all days of a respective months is used to derive the ratio of the cumulative to a monthly average et value this ratio is finally used to convert daily et to monthly et usman et al 2015b derived monthly et data using modis level 1 b data for our study area and developed a time series of monthly et for 2005 2012 with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km grid cells the product was validated using the advection aridity method usman et al 2015b 2015a resulting in nash sutcliffe efficiencies of 0 92 and 0 71 for dry rabi season and wet kharif season respectively a validation using observed data from lysimeters or other point estimates like bowen energy balance and eddy covariance estimates was not feasible due to the lack of this information for our study area noteworthy usman et al 2015b also reported difficulties in retrieving accurate et data during wet season especially during the monsoon months due to the lack of cloud free satellite images for this reason the months july and august are excluded from the et time series used for calibration for the remaining months the images of the two years 2009 and 2010 show the highest data quality i e lowest cloud cover least data gaps and are therefore chosen as calibration data set for this study to be able to compare the pixel based sebal et data set with the hru based swat et data set which differ in spatial resolution a new sebal based et data set is created which projects sebal et information to the hrus in cases where the hru areas exceeded the extent of a sebal pixel the mean of all sebal pixels within one hru was calculated for the respective hru area to assure a good correspondence of the swat hrus and the respective sebal et data only hrus representing the most dominant land use classes each covering more than 10 of the catchment area are selected for calibration thus small areas with higher uncertainties in the land use class estimation and therefore with higher uncertainties in et estimates are excluded from calibration following these selection criteria 293 out of 780 hrus are finally chosen and the respective observed et time series were extracted from the original sebal data set hereafter the term sebal et data refers to the extracted and hru based sebal data set and has to be distinguished from the original pixel based sebal data set which we will denote as original sebal data a third and modified sebal et product is created referred to as modified sebal which is based on the sebal et product but includes plant specific et information to account for the land use dependent et variations a modification of the sebal data set was designed by multiplying each monthly sebal et value with a land use class specific correction factor for each hru the correction factor is derived from crop specific temporal et patterns etc etc is estimated for each land use class using the fao cropwat model approach which simply multiplies a reference et with a crop specific coefficient kc allen et al 1998 the monthly correction factor for each crop type is given by the monthly ratio of each land use specific etc to the mean etc of all land use classes estimated by cropwat table a 2 the monthly sebal et value of each hru is then multiplied by this monthly land use class specific correction factor the characteristics of the different sebal and swat et products are summarized in table 1 3 3 calibration procedure the calibration procedure applied in this study follows the work flow summarized in fig 3 after the initial swat model setup the model is calibrated using swat simulated et as calibration variable and the unmodified sebal et data set as observed data a set of 44 parameters is adjusted during calibration to optimize the kling gupta efficiency criteria kge between swat and sebal et values non satisfactory initial calibration results make a second calibration necessary in the second approach the modified sebal et data set is used which better accounts for detailed crop specific et finally the calibration outputs are validated to assess the calibration success and transferability of the results 3 3 1 dds optimization algorithm the optimization algorithm used in calibration is a very crucial factor in parameter estimation singh and woolhiser 2002 in this study we apply the dynamically dimensioned search algorithm dds which was developed by tolson and shoemaker 2007 to efficiently solve complex calibration problems with a high number of fitting parameters it has been applied in the calibration of spatially distributed hydrological models lin et al 2017 tolson and shoemaker 2007 and its performance has been discussed by behrangi et al 2008 the difference of dds compared to other commonly applied global search algorithms e g shuffled complex evolution algorithm sce duan et al 1994 1993 is the way the search space is dynamically adjusted by successively decreasing the parameter dimension until the number of iterations reaches its user defined limit for this study the dds was set up with 44 parameters table a 3 appendix and 10 000 iterations using the software ostrich matott 2017 3 3 2 calibration parameters a first selection of 12 calibration parameters table 2 was made based on most commonly selected swat calibration parameters used in previous swat calibration studies abbaspour et al 2015 zambrano bigiarini and rojas 2013 zhang et al 2008 as well as parameters which were found to be most sensitive with respect to changes in et according to a manual trial and error tests the pre selection of these 12 parameters was then tested for sensitivity using the latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat sampling strategy van griensven et al 2006 as a result the five most sensitive parameters for the swat model of the study area with respect to changes in evapotranspiration could be identified only these parameters highlighted with in table 2 were used in the calibration process subsequently these five model parameters were further differentiated based on their dependency on individual soil or land use classes as well as on soil depth resulting in 44 parameters to calibrate initial values are within the range of the given maximum and minimum values but vary with land use class soil class and soil depth respectively the parameter ranges were defined based on swat suggested minimum and maximum values for unmeasurable model parameters e g epco esco cn ii and on estimates used in previous studies in this region awan et al 2016 3 3 3 objective function it is widely suggested to treat the calibration problem of hydrological models as a multi objective problem gupta et al 2009 1998 van griensven and van bauwens 2003 i e using either multi variable measurements multi site measurements or multi response functions in the calibration process madsen 2003 the method used in this study can be seen as a multi site calibration as it uses individual et time series from 293 sites i e hrus moreover to account for multiple hydrological responses hence to estimate temporal as well as total volumetric error behavior we chose the kling gupta efficiency kge as objective function kling et al 2012 this goodness of fit criterion includes measures of correlation r variability Œ± and bias error Œ≤ gupta et al 1998 kling et al 2012 it assesses the fit between modelled and observed values on a scale of infinity to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect match and decreasing kges indicating decreasing fits between model results and observations finally the optimization problem becomes a single criterion maximization problem which combines multiple criteria into the single goal function of maximizing the mean kge gupta et al 1998 kling et al 2012 of all selected sites the objective function is given as 7 max kge mean j 1 k 1 k 1 r 1 2 Œ± 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 j where k is the total number of hrus r is the regression coefficient Œ±is a measure of relative variability ratio of simulated and observed standard deviation and Œ≤is the bias ratio of simulated and observed means 3 3 4 validation to validate the calibrated swat model a cross validation approach is applied a new set of 264 hrus is selected these hrus were not used during calibration but represent the same land use classes of the previously used hrus this way it is tested if parameter adjustments which were done during calibration can be transferred to other swat hrus the swat model is run with the best parameter set obtained by the dds algorithm and finally swat et values of the new 264 hrus are compared to sebal et values for the same locations the calibration success is then evaluated based on the goodness of fit between swat and sebal et 4 results despite the underestimation of swat et values compared to sebal et throughout the dry months and overestimation during monsoon months the temporal pattern as well as the corresponding efficiency criteria e g kge 0 51 r2 0 81 and rmse 20 mm month show that the uncalibrated swat et data fit reasonably well to the sebal data fig 4 both et time series capture the same temporal variation with respect to growing and harvesting seasons and except for the two wettest summer months deviations of swat vs sebal et are small we therefore consider sebal to be an adequate observed data set to be used for parameter estimation in the swat calibration procedure 4 1 calibration results the spatially distributed swat calibration using a sebal data set seems promising but also reveals limitations the initial kge of 0 04 is calculated by averaging the individual kges of all 293 hrus and represents the fit between swat et and sebal et before calibration table 3 calibrating the swat model using the dds algorithm yielded the following results the automated calibration procedure improved the mean kge by 0 23 from initially 0 04 to 0 27 within the first 5000 calibration runs the best kge of 0 28 was achieved after approx 10 000 dds runs showing that a fast convergence within the first 5000 runs was reached while the following 5000 runs were only leading to a further improvement of about 0 01 kge even though a kge of 0 27 is clearly not showing a satisfying model performance an overall improvement of 0 23 kge seems promising for a spatially distributed model calibration while in a traditional calibration procedure time series of spatially integrated data fig 4 would be fitted in a spatially distributed calibration all hrus are treated as separate time series thus spatially dependent misfits are not averaged out comparing the lumped initial kge of mean sebal et and mean swat et of 0 51 with the spatially distributed initial kge values mean kge of all hrus of 0 04 already points towards the complexity of calibrating a model using a spatially distributed approach a closer look into the detailed results of this calibration process shows that the results have to be examined with respect to seasonal patterns as well as spatial variations in the goodness of fit calibration results differ clearly between single hrus best hrus reach kge values of up to 0 6 after calibration whereas some areas show values as low as 0 60 in the following the reasons for the low calibration performance and for the temporal and spatial error variations are presented in detail 4 2 seasonal differences of goodness of fit mean et time series for all hrus of the uncalibrated dotted black line as well as for the calibrated solid black line swat model are presented in fig 4 furthermore it shows the sebal data mean of all hrus solid red line which was used as observation data for calibration while this figure does not reveal much about the spatial fit it shows the improvement of temporal model performance during the calibration process it can be observed that the calibration helped to reduce the underestimation of et by the swat model during the drier winter months yet the seasonal variation in the goodness of fit remains while during most of the year a good fit of swat vs sebal values can be observed during summer months swat values uncalibrated and calibrated still clearly exceed the sebal estimates these months coincide with the wet season kharif in our study area where cloud cover is high and remote sensing estimates of surface energy balances calculations exhibit higher uncertainties usman et al 2015a this hypothesis is also supported by the spread of the model performance on hru scale fig 5 dry winter months show very low differences between sebal and swat data sets whereas wet summer months show differences in et of over 100 mm month fig 5 for this reason some studies have excluded the monsoon months from calibration immerzeel and droogers 2008 for study areas however where each season has entirely different cropping characteristics neglecting all wet months would exclude an entire cropping cycle with its unique temporal and spatial land use characteristics accordingly the parameterization would be biased by only one cropping and climate pattern therefore methods of separating wet and dry seasons in the calibration process have been applied in other studies gao et al 2018 yet the parameters selected for calibration in this study namely epco cn2 sol awc gw delay and sol k are not expected to significantly change from wet to dry months as these coefficients are depending mainly on characteristics of soil structure grain size distribution geological factors etc which are changing on long term time scales but not by season to be physically consistent this study therefore does not separate wet and dry seasons for calibration examining the distributions of monthly et values separately for sebal and swat fig 6 reveals that the reason for the mismatch of et during summer months could lay in the low variance of sebal et values fig 6a in contrast to our expectation that sebal would reflect high et variances during monsoon months due to higher diversity in the agricultural cultivation as well as higher uncertainties in the remote sensing data it shows a surprisingly low data spread compared to swat et fig 6b assessing the dependency of et with respect to each land use class shows a high variance of swat et this seems quite plausible as different land use types have specific plant physiognomies and growing patterns and hence unique et time series fig 6d consequently swat results show a clear distinction of different land use class et estimates while the sebal data entirely lack any land use class dependent et characteristics and show nearly identical et patterns for all hrus fig 6c the limitations of using this sebal data set for a spatially distributed calibration of a small scale farming system are further reflected by the spatial differences of the calibration results 4 3 spatial differences of goodness of fit a closer look into the spatial distribution of the calibration results shows that the error between observed and simulated et is highly land use dependent i e kges vary significantly between land use classes fig 7 while hrus of the land use class wheat rice show a mean kge of over 0 3 with a maximum kge of 0 69 fodder fallow only yields a mean kge of less than 0 50 this shows a discrepancy of over 0 8 kge between best and worst mean fit see fig 1 for spatial distribution of land use classes and fig 10b for mean kges of each individual land use class the clear land use dependency of the calibration results reveals again that the best goodness of fits occur for land use classes with et characteristics closest to the average temporal et pattern of all land use types this underlines the hypothesis that the extracted sebal data represents only a mean et value of all land use classes at the same time land use types which vary significantly from the mean show lowest goodness of fits hence to improve the overall calibration result an alternative et data set which better accounts for differences due to land use characteristics is needed 4 4 calibration results using a modified sebal et data set as mentioned the main reason for the low calibration performance might lay in the missing reproduction of land use dependent et patterns by the sebal data during the wet season we therefore use the modified sebal data set which better accounts for land use dependent et variation for a second calibration trial the resulting mean et time series of each land use class from the modified sebal data set are shown in fig 8 now land use class dependent et variations better reflect expected differences between different crop types the initial fit between swat et and the modified sebal et yields a kge of 0 22 compared to 0 04 in the previous case and thus already presents an improved starting point for a spatial calibration table 4 as expected the results show that a consideration of the land use dependent et characteristics clearly improves the calibration performance a final mean kge of 0 40 could be achieved with a 5th and 95th percentile of 0 14 and 0 60 kge respectively table 4 furthermore the results show that except for two land use classes fodder cotton foco and wheat cotton whco the calibration could reach comparable kges for all land use classes as opposed to the previous attempt where mean kges varied from approx 0 50 to 0 40 depending on the respective land cover type fig 10b and 10d as mentioned above during calibration with unmodified sebal et data kges were high for land use classes with et estimates close to the average sebal et and low for land use classes for which et deviated strongly from this mean it can be assumed that the reason for a less successful calibration of single land use classes i e foco and whco is no longer the strong general difference from the mean sebal et estimate compared to the simulated mean et as it was the case during the first calibration attempt both foco and whco for example show relatively low kges fig 10d but closer proximity to the average modified sebal et estimates mean absolute difference approx 30 mm month than land use classes which reached highest kges sugr sugarcane for example shows a higher deviation from the mean sebal data mean absolute difference 40 mm month but shows a much better match with its respective sebal time series and a mean kge above 0 60 a low kge can therefore now be attributed to land use specific performance of swat et estimation the spatial distribution of the model performance fig 9 as well as land use class specific kge improvement fig 10 illustrate once more that the second calibration procedure leads to a study area wide improvement of the model performance hence the calibration results using the modified sebal data set enable a spatially distributed assessment of the model performance this helps to achieve the initially stated aim of examining and improving the model set up without losing spatially distributed information 4 5 validation the validity of the best parameter set derived by the above described calibration procedure is tested using a cross validation approach due to the quality of the observation data described above the same time period 2009 2010 has to be used for validation therefore the verification is done using a new hru set of 264 hrus which were not used during calibration but represent the same land use classes the validation results show a mean kge of 0 57 with best kges of up to 0 74 table 5 which is on average even slightly higher than during calibration this shows that the calibrated parameters are transferable to other areas hrus in our study region and hence ascertains a valid calibration the kge distribution with respect to each land use except for wheat rice shows similar or even higher values compared to the calibration output 5 discussion the remote sensing derived sebal data set enables a spatially distributed calibration of the hydrological swat model yet the study shows that the calibration results of the first trial are unsatisfactory and show a high seasonal variation in the goodness of fit between sebal and swat et especially during months with heterogeneous cropping patterns land use type specific et information differs significantly between both data sets and a decent parameterization and hence a satisfactory calibration is not possible using the original sebal et data however the result can be improved using the modified sebal product which accounts for plant type specific et characteristics the resulting improved calibration performance hints towards the importance of using a plant type dependent et data set for model calibration of small scale and heterogeneous agricultural areas still remaining differences of modified sebal and swat et can be explained by i differences in the et calculation methods of sebal and swat ii differences in input data sets iii differences in spatial scales of swat hrus and the initial sebal grid and iv by differences in model assumptions regarding parameters controlling et 5 1 differences in et calculation methods of sebal and swat as mentioned in the introduction section sebal et is based on the surface energy balance with visible near infrared and thermal infrared images being the input data for the retrieval of radiation and relevant land surface characteristics e g ndvi hence energy balance components are the main factors controlling the et estimation while this sparse input data requirement is an advantage for our large scale application it also poses a potential source of et uncertainty for example all plant dependent information needed for the et calculation such as leave area or plant height to define the roughness length for heat transfer are estimated from the spectral information of the remote sensing product hence if the spectral data cannot resolve the spatial variability of the respective plant information such as vegetation height roughness length and displacement height it will not be able to give plant specific spatially distributed et estimates ershadi et al 2013 this can be seen in fig 6c which shows the weak performance of the sebal data set in separating the single land use dependent et patterns in swat on the other hand et calculation is embedded into the overall water balance equation which relates et estimates to the entire hydrological cycle swat includes detailed information about the different land use types such as rooting depth plant height leaf area index etc and thus enables a plant type specific et estimation at the model unit scale i e hru level as can be seen in fig 6d however similar to the uncertainties of the sebal product also the swat et calculation is based on parameter assumption which induce uncertainty embedding the et estimation into the overall water balance calculation and therefore linking it to other water fluxes such as soil moisture availability which again depends on percolation rates lateral flow surface runoff etc increases the number of model parameters responsible for the final et rate and hence increases uncertainty therefore the selection of swat parameters to be included into the calibration procedure is crucial rajib et al 2018 found that for a successful swat calibration using et data biophysical parameters should be considered as they are representing vegetation dynamics and energy utilization mechanisms and thus enable a better model accuracy regarding et however an accurate observed data set which reflects the same detail in spatial and temporal variation in et as the model output is still required for a successful calibration as further discussed in the following sections 5 2 differences in input data sets another reason for the discrepancy between sebal and swat et might be a general mismatch due to differences in input data for et calculations while the sebal product applied in this study uses plant information ndvi and lai derived from modis products swat uses landsat derived land use classification as well as soil information from the water and soil investigation division of pakistan table a 1 appendix to estimate et input data sets are therefore entirely independent and might lead to temporal and spatial differences in the final et estimation however as illustrated in fig 5 and fig 6 the et mismatch is only apparent for the wet summer season which shows a high variety of crop types dry winter months with mainly one crop type winter wheat show a nearly perfect fit of sebal and swat et estimates thus it seems reasonable to assume that the main difficulty does not lay in the general mismatch of et values due to differences in et calculation methods or discrepancies in the input data sets but rather in a spatial discrepancy 5 3 differences of spatial scales a spatial mismatch between sebal and swat due to scaling and averaging procedures is one more reason for the hampered calibration success similar discrepancies of observed and simulated et due to scaling problems were reported by liaqat et al 2015 who compared surface energy balance system sebs results with advection aridity derived et also bastiaanssen et al 2012 compared et based on remote sensing data with lysimeter values and reported differences in et estimates due to scaling discrepancies while agricultural fields in our study area have an average size of about 150 150 m sebal calculates et only on a 1 km 1 km scale and hence delivers an average et of several different fields within one sebal pixel swat averages the sebal et estimates over hrus with areas of approx 20 km2 taking the mean of all sebal pixels which fall within one hru polygon all spatial differences in sebal et characteristics are lost consequently this method leads to smoothed observed sebal et time series for all hrus and hence wrongly implies equal et characteristics for each land use class fig 6c moreover it is known that modis based et estimates are able to correctly reproduce basin average et patterns as it is also shown in this study but that they fail to distinguish variation in et fluxes between crop types at smaller scales mccabe and wood 2006 wang et al 2016 this explains the spatial distribution of kges fig 7 and our findings that kges are highest for land use classes which show et patterns closest to the basin average et values in areas which show a larger extent of homogeneous crop types like rice growing areas in the northern part of the catchment a better fit of the modis based sebal estimates and swat can be observed this means that a higher spatial resolution of the input data set used for remote sensing derived et calculation would be necessary to get more reliable et information for smaller scales only then sebal would yield et information which would be sufficiently spatially discretized to be used for a successful swat model calibration procedure as described in this study the improvement of the calibration results using the modified sebal data set which accounts for a higher spatial variability of crop specific et patterns shows the potential for a successful calibration using such a higher spatially resolved data product 5 4 differences in model parameter assumptions so far we mainly discussed the difficulties of the calibration approach due to limitations of the remotely sensed et product however given the local conditions of our study area the sebal data set used in this study still offers valuable information which is very useful for a basin wide swat model calibration for example sebal serves well as calibration data for temporal variations of et it gives good et approximations in dry winter months and due to its initially gridded information it accounts for detailed spatially distributed temperature and precipitation variations in the region in addition considering the local characteristics of our study area where surface water content is nearly entirely determined by irrigation water supply sebal et data provides the advantage that they inherently account for the information of surface water availability in this semi arid and extensively irrigated area energy partitioning between sensible and latent heat flux is strongly varying with surface water availability as sebal derives et from the amount of energy available for latent heat flux it indirectly accounts for the surface water content which controls et in turn swat needs detailed irrigation management information as well as crop planting and harvesting times to guarantee a correct estimation of surface water availability and hence actual et rates these management strategies are often unknown and approximations are taken as initial model parameters consequently this yields a high degree of model parameter and hence et uncertainty sebal can therefore help to calibrate the swat model with respect to management parameter settings the final calibration results fig 10 show that if the sebal data set contains crop type dependent et pattern i e modified sebal et data set variations in the goodness of fit between sebal and swat are still noticeable however in this case a less satisfying goodness of fit can be attributed to single crop types fig 10c e g whco and foco and thus to a land use specific performance of swat et estimation to account for this the model can be calibrated accordingly 6 conclusions the study assessed the potential as well as shortcomings of using remote sensing derived et data in a spatially distributed model calibration approach a sebal data set was used to obtain et time series which were subsequently applied in a spatially distributed calibration procedure the study could demonstrate that the extraction of spatial et data from a 1 km 1 km modis based sebal data set using the extent of swat model hru areas leads to averaged and nearly equal remote sensing derived et data for all hrus the extracted time series from sebal data are therefore insufficiently representing spatial differences in et patterns and are inhibiting satisfactory calibration results in order to use remote sensing derived et data for model calibration which is often the only spatially distributed data set available a detailed assessment of the spatial variability of sebal et data is necessary for a small scale and highly diverse agricultural setting the preservation of the spatial heterogeneity of the observed i e remote sensing data set remains one of the main challenges for an improved model calibration in such an environment a higher resolution or a modified observed et data set which accounts for land use class specific et pattern is therefore desirable the final calibration of swat using a modified sebal et data set which captures the spatial et variability showed the potential of this calibration approach for a complex spatially distributed hydrological model in line with the findings of this study the following should be considered for a successful spatially distributed calibration using remote sensing derived et data temporal variability of et is captured well by sebal data but shows lower accuracies during wet seasons when cloud cover reduces the reliability of remote sensing derived et data during seasons with homogeneous crop types i e low spatial heterogeneity sebal and swat et estimates show a satisfactory match during seasons when crop patterns are highly diverse the remote sensing product is biased towards specific land use patterns which results in the same trend in the calibration results especially for small scale agricultural areas the averaging of remote sensing derived data to a mean et value per hru cannot resolve the spatial et variability during seasons when crop patterns are highly diverse a correction of the observed data set is therefore suggested to account for the characteristics of each specific land use class and to remove the bias mentioned above credit authorship contribution statement rike becker conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation

6237,calibrating a spatially distributed hydrological model of a region with complex and highly diverse agricultural settings is a difficult task it becomes even more challenging if major parts of the hydrology are human controlled e g through irrigation agriculture in this study a soil and water assessment tool swat was set up and calibrated for an entirely managed meso scale irrigation scheme where irrigation channels are the only water courses and no natural streams exist an automated and spatially distributed model calibration was applied implementing the global dynamically dimensioned search algorithm dds and using kling gupta efficiency kge as objective function to account for the spatio temporal heterogeneity of water balance fluxes in the calibration process remote sensing derived evapotranspiration et estimates with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km were used as observational data results showed that the automated and spatially distributed model calibration was able to increase the model et simulation performance from 0 04 to 0 27 kge however a strong land use dependent goodness of fit ranging from approx 0 60 kge to 0 60 kge for individual land use types revealed that the information extracted from remote sensing derived et estimates used in this study is lacking the necessary spatial heterogeneity an unsatisfactory spatial comparison between simulated et and et derived from remote sensing estimates showed to inhibit better calibration results for the study area which is characterized by small scale and diverse cropping patterns using a modified remote sensing derived et product which accounts for land use class dependent et characteristics improved the overall calibration results to 0 40 kge a cross validation could indicate a successful application of this automated and spatially distributed model calibration approach using the modified et product keywords swat hydrological model sebal calibration dds evapotranspiration 1 introduction the importance of calibrating and validating hydrological models and thereby assessing their uncertainties before using them for predictions and decision making is unquestionable however with increasing model complexity the calibration procedure has become increasingly difficult for example problems with unique parameter identification of large unknown model parameter sets i e model equifinality and issues of model and data uncertainties become more severe abbaspour et al 2017 gupta et al 1998 zhang et al 2008 especially in highly managed systems with small scale agricultural practices and spatially as well as temporarily diverse hydrological processes bastiaanssen and bandara 2001 furthermore due to intensive human actions as well as due to climate change hydrological systems became statistically non stationary fatichi et al 2016 which makes the calibration of physically based water balance models for such impacted systems very challenging to capture the interdependency of various water fluxes and the spatio temporal heterogeneity of hydrological processes calibration should preferably be done with process based variables which reflect the relevant interactions of the numerous water balance components arnold et al 2012 streamflow is therefore most often taken as calibration variable as its dynamic can be closely related to variations in water balance components such as evapotranspiration et surface runoff interflow and infiltration or percolation rates hence observed and simulated hydrographs are commonly compared and discharge based objective functions serve as evaluation criteria for model performance however using streamflow data for calibration is difficult in areas which lack run off information or even the presence of a natural river network to tackle the calibration challenge et data have gained importance in the calibration process of hydrological models and have been used for calibration in various studies legates and mccabe 1999 lopez lopez et al 2017 rajib et al 2018 rientjes et al 2013 tobin and bennett 2017 one advantage is that et data can be derived from remote sensing platforms making spatio temporally distributed calibration data available moreover et serves as an overall indicator for surface water availability independent of the cause of its availability i e if water allocation was human or naturally induced hence from et principal changes in hydrological processes can still be inferred even if surface water availability is controlled by often unknown human decisions examples for such controlled systems are entirely managed irrigation schemes where irrigation channels are the only water courses in the study area and no further natural streams exist the channel discharge is usually exclusively determined by management decisions following formal local policies as well as informal local agreements these sometimes subjective and therefore often unpredictable decisions on water channel flows might interfere with or even supersede the natural behavior of the hydrological system thus streamflow becomes inappropriate as fitting variable during calibration immerzeel and droogers 2008 a successful inverse estimation of spatially distributed model parameters through calibration based on these entirely managed runoff values is therefore highly unlikely in this case an alternative way of model calibration has to be applied this approach has to account for the spatial heterogeneity of water balance fluxes and at the same time it has to be independent from unforeseeable water management decisions in addition to be able to address research questions on changing hydrological fluxes with respect to changing land use or small scale agricultural management strategies an evaluation of the distributed behavior of the model beyond just catchment integrated performance is needed zink et al 2018 the implementation of such a spatial evaluation into the calibration procedure as well as the high number of model parameters which need to be parameterized make a trial and error calibration of complex distributed models unfeasible usman et al 2018 for this reason automated calibration strategies which use optimization algorithms to find the best parameter values are increasingly used for parameter estimation several studies exist on the application of automated calibration procedures for lumped models sorooshian et al 1993 vrugt et al 2003 and since the past decade these approaches have also been used for spatially distributed models campo et al 2006 immerzeel and droogers 2008 li et al 2018 zink et al 2018 immerzeel and droogers 2008 used remotely sensed et data to calibrate a spatially distributed swat soil water assessment tool model in an automated calibration approach a comparable methodology using the same model and et estimation procedure will be presented here in this study however a stronger focus is laid on the challenges of using remote sensing derived et data for model calibration in a highly diverse agricultural setting past studies outline the complexity of spatially distributed hydrological model applications in irrigation systems and intensively used agricultural areas droogers et al 2000 jiang et al 2015 and also specifically of swat model applications in such managed regions awan et al 2016 dechmi et al 2012 yet as far as the authors are concerned the application of automated calibration strategies using remote sensing derived et data for models of entirely managed irrigation system has not yet been studied in depth key subjects this study addresses are therefore i the calibration of a spatially distributed hydrological model of an entirely managed irrigation system using satellite et measurements and ii to evaluate the suitability of et data derived from a surface energy balance algorithm sebal for calibrating a swat model in such a complex agricultural setting finally the potential and limitations of this calibration approach is examined to assess the importance of spatial information in the observation data set used for calibration 2 study area the calibration methodology described in this study is applied using a hydrological model of the intensively irrigated rechna doab in the punjab region in pakistan fig 1 study area is the lower chenab canal system lcc which comprises about 15 000 km2 of agricultural land and which is located between the rivers chenab and ravi with river chenab being the main source for irrigation water supply the region highly depends on water resources extracted from sources outside of the study area annual precipitation of about 500 mm and potential et of about 1800 mm show this strong demand for additional water supply for irrigation the annual distribution of precipitation is characterized by strong monsoonal rain events in the summer months which account for approx 75 of the annual total rainfall awan and ismaeel 2014 evaporation follows the annual temperature pattern and shows maximum values of approx 200 mm month during summer months and minimum values of approx 50 mm month during winter months in the lcc area the entire hydrological system is artificially built and managed to supply the necessary irrigation water during the colder and dry winter season rabi as well as during the hot and wet summer season kharif during dry winter season the dominating crop type is winter wheat while during the wetter summer the crop pattern diversifies and mainly cotton maize rice and fodder are grown on small scale farm plots the topography of the area is entirely flat and the hydrology is driven by a dense irrigation canal network no natural river exists in this area 3 material and methods 3 1 swat model the soil water assessment tool swat model software arnold et al 1998 is used for this study main reasons for the selection of swat are its capability to incorporate detailed management strategies e g irrigation schedule and efficiency planting schedule plant physiognomy and to account for spatially distributed land use and management changes and their effects on single water balance components such as et which is used as fitting variable in the calibration process basic datasets needed to set up a swat model are topography soil characteristics land cover data and meteorological time series sources as well as temporal and spatial resolution for each dataset used in this study are listed in the appendix table a 1 detailed information on the generation and quality control of land cover data can be found in awan et al 2016 and awan and ismaeel 2014 in addition crop rotation patterns are considered and specific planting and harvesting times are defined for each major crop type according to fig 2 the spatial discretization is represented in swat by hydrological response units hrus each representing specific soil land cover and topographic characteristics their extent in the study area varies from approx 0 008 km2 to 340 km2 with a mean extent of approx 20 km2 the size of an hru depends on the homogeneity of the underlying soil and land use characteristics with larger sizes for homogeneous and smaller sizes for heterogeneous landscape patterns respectively irrigation is assumed to be demand based i e an irrigation supply function is automatically activated every time water availability falls below a water demand threshold even though the irrigation schedule in our study area is supposed to follow the stringent local warabandi irrigation scheme with fixed water allocation schedules qureshi and hussain 1994 irrigation according to plant water demand better represents the actual local irrigation practice where groundwater pumping and on site irrigation water storage are leading to a more flexible and demand based irrigation qureshi et al 2010 administrative boundaries of the so called irrigation sub divisions fig 1 are used to delineate pre defined artificial sub catchments the reason for this artificial catchment delineation is the local surface water allocation system apart from precipitation surface water availability for agricultural purposes is entirely human controlled and its allocation strictly follows the administrative rules of irrigation canal command areas this however implies that sub catchments are purely administratively defined and are not bounded by topography this again infers that a model based on these artificial sub catchment delineations can only calculate water balance components correctly if surface and subsurface flows between these catchments are negligible an assumption which seems very plausible considering the entirely flat nature of our study area the restricted surface runoff due to dams surrounding the fields to enable furrow and flood irrigation as well as the high plant water demand which leads to negligible horizontal water movement hence to ensure a suitable swat model application in our study area with its specific local characteristics the following assumptions are made i irrigation is driven by plant water demand ii no lateral flow exists between hrus iii streamflow is ignored as a valid response variable due to the fact that water availability in the channels is entirely human controlled and no natural streams exist which could indicate a natural response to changes in hydrological fluxes consequentially routing routines are disabled and the entire analysis of the model outputs is based only on hru level and no further spatial aggregation e g basin or sub basin scale is made therefore swat is used for this study rather like a land surface model than a conventional surface runoff model this unconventional swat model set up adds to the fact that discharge cannot be used for calibration hence a spatially distributed calibration on hru level becomes necessary to guarantee a sound evaluation of the model performance in this study we take actual et etact as fitting variable as it can be used to derive spatially distributed information on surface water fluxes actual et etact is calculated in swat as the sum of the potential evaporation from the intercept storage rain water trapped in the plant canopy actual soil water evaporation and actual plant transpiration potential soil water evaporation and potential plant transpiration are calculated in swat using the penman monteith et equation eq 1 1 et 1 Œª Œ¥ r n g o œÅ a c a e s e a r a Œ¥ Œ≥ 1 r s r a where et is the potential evapotranspiration mm day 1 r n is the daily net radiation mj m 2 day 1 g o is the soil heat flux mj m 2 day 1 œÅ a is the mean density of air at constant pressure kg m 3 c a is the specific heat of air mj kg 1 c 1 e s e a is the vapor pressure deficit of the air kpa r a and r s are aerodynamic and bulk surface resistances s m 1 Œ¥ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 Œ≥ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 and Œª is the latent heat of vaporization mj kg 1 swat calculates reference et etref with fixed resistance factors for a reference alfalfa crop as well as a plant type specific potential et etp with varying plant specific r a and r s parameters meteorological data from local climate stations is used to retrieve the climate parameters leaf area indices as well as crop heights are used to determine aerodynamic and surface resistances of specific crop types for estimating etp following etref is used to estimate the potential soil water evaporation where etref is adjusted for evaporation of free water in the canopy and is then related to the degree of soil shading to account for et reducing effects due to soil cover by plants actual soil water evaporation is then calculated using a biomass dependent soil cover index and information on available water storage capacity awc coefficient in the soil the awc coefficient controlling the available water storage capacity was found to be highly sensitive with respect to et variations and is therefore used as one of the calibration parameters etp is taken as the maximum possible plant transpiration and is adjusted according to the available water in the soil profile to estimate actual plant water uptake which equals the actual plant transpiration using the plant uptake compensation factor epco coefficient the depths from where water is allowed to be used for plant uptake can be adjusted this parameter was likewise found to be highly sensitive in controlling et in our study and is therefore also included into the calibration parameter set table 2 finally the swat model is run on a monthly basis to generate a monthly et time series with a spatial resolution identical to the resolution of the model hrus this means that the swat et output is not a gridded product but holds hru discretization and therefore land use soil and topography dependent et information 3 2 sebal remote sensing data provide spatially distributed information on actual et and thus enables the possibility for a spatially distributed calibration procedure in this study we use et act estimates from usman et al 2015a who derived spatio temporal et act estimates from modis satellite data using the surface energy balance algorithm sebal approach briefly described below the sebal surface energy balance algorithm approach bastiaanssen et al 1998a 1998b was developed to estimate spatially distributed information on surface energy balances it is based on the land surface energy balance theory which relates the single incoming and outgoing energy components through the energy balance equation 2 r n g 0 h l e where rn net radiation g0 ground heat flux h sensible heat flux and le latent heat of vaporization all in w m 2 the energy required for et latent heat of vaporization le can therefore be calculated as the residual term of the equation 3 le r n g 0 h sebal solves this equation by retrieving surface characteristics such as surface albedo normalized differenced vegetation indices ndvis surface temperature and emissivity based on remotely sensed information of spectral radiances in the visible near infrared and thermal infrared spectrum using these derived surface characteristics sebal converts the spectral information into the surface energy fluxes rn g0 and h to estimate le the computation of sensible heat flux h is hereby the most challenging part h is calculated by 4 h œÅ a c a Œ¥ t r a where all constants are as listed above eq 1 and Œ¥t is the vertical temperature difference between two heights the unknown Œ¥t is calculated by using the hottest and the coldest pixels of the remote sensing image as anchor pixels where maximum and minimum le is sensed it is assumed that h of all other pixels relate linearly to the derived slope of Œ¥t the aerodynamic resistance factor r a depends amongst other parameters on land cover i e plant type dependent parameters such as plant height to define the roughness length for heat transfer this information is derived from land use maps or using the derived albedo and ndvi data once rn and h are computed g0 is neglected due to daily calculation of et le can be calculated and is then used to define the instantaneous evaporative fraction efins by 5 e f i n s l e le h to finally calculate daily et by 6 e t d a y 86400 10 3 e f i n s r nday Œª œÅ w where rnday is daily net radiation w m 2 Œª is latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 and œÅw is the density of water kg m 3 to average daily et to a monthly value daily et is related to a reference et etref which can be calculated on a daily basis using the penman monteith equation and daily meteorological data subsequently the cumulative etref of all days of a respective months is used to derive the ratio of the cumulative to a monthly average et value this ratio is finally used to convert daily et to monthly et usman et al 2015b derived monthly et data using modis level 1 b data for our study area and developed a time series of monthly et for 2005 2012 with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km grid cells the product was validated using the advection aridity method usman et al 2015b 2015a resulting in nash sutcliffe efficiencies of 0 92 and 0 71 for dry rabi season and wet kharif season respectively a validation using observed data from lysimeters or other point estimates like bowen energy balance and eddy covariance estimates was not feasible due to the lack of this information for our study area noteworthy usman et al 2015b also reported difficulties in retrieving accurate et data during wet season especially during the monsoon months due to the lack of cloud free satellite images for this reason the months july and august are excluded from the et time series used for calibration for the remaining months the images of the two years 2009 and 2010 show the highest data quality i e lowest cloud cover least data gaps and are therefore chosen as calibration data set for this study to be able to compare the pixel based sebal et data set with the hru based swat et data set which differ in spatial resolution a new sebal based et data set is created which projects sebal et information to the hrus in cases where the hru areas exceeded the extent of a sebal pixel the mean of all sebal pixels within one hru was calculated for the respective hru area to assure a good correspondence of the swat hrus and the respective sebal et data only hrus representing the most dominant land use classes each covering more than 10 of the catchment area are selected for calibration thus small areas with higher uncertainties in the land use class estimation and therefore with higher uncertainties in et estimates are excluded from calibration following these selection criteria 293 out of 780 hrus are finally chosen and the respective observed et time series were extracted from the original sebal data set hereafter the term sebal et data refers to the extracted and hru based sebal data set and has to be distinguished from the original pixel based sebal data set which we will denote as original sebal data a third and modified sebal et product is created referred to as modified sebal which is based on the sebal et product but includes plant specific et information to account for the land use dependent et variations a modification of the sebal data set was designed by multiplying each monthly sebal et value with a land use class specific correction factor for each hru the correction factor is derived from crop specific temporal et patterns etc etc is estimated for each land use class using the fao cropwat model approach which simply multiplies a reference et with a crop specific coefficient kc allen et al 1998 the monthly correction factor for each crop type is given by the monthly ratio of each land use specific etc to the mean etc of all land use classes estimated by cropwat table a 2 the monthly sebal et value of each hru is then multiplied by this monthly land use class specific correction factor the characteristics of the different sebal and swat et products are summarized in table 1 3 3 calibration procedure the calibration procedure applied in this study follows the work flow summarized in fig 3 after the initial swat model setup the model is calibrated using swat simulated et as calibration variable and the unmodified sebal et data set as observed data a set of 44 parameters is adjusted during calibration to optimize the kling gupta efficiency criteria kge between swat and sebal et values non satisfactory initial calibration results make a second calibration necessary in the second approach the modified sebal et data set is used which better accounts for detailed crop specific et finally the calibration outputs are validated to assess the calibration success and transferability of the results 3 3 1 dds optimization algorithm the optimization algorithm used in calibration is a very crucial factor in parameter estimation singh and woolhiser 2002 in this study we apply the dynamically dimensioned search algorithm dds which was developed by tolson and shoemaker 2007 to efficiently solve complex calibration problems with a high number of fitting parameters it has been applied in the calibration of spatially distributed hydrological models lin et al 2017 tolson and shoemaker 2007 and its performance has been discussed by behrangi et al 2008 the difference of dds compared to other commonly applied global search algorithms e g shuffled complex evolution algorithm sce duan et al 1994 1993 is the way the search space is dynamically adjusted by successively decreasing the parameter dimension until the number of iterations reaches its user defined limit for this study the dds was set up with 44 parameters table a 3 appendix and 10 000 iterations using the software ostrich matott 2017 3 3 2 calibration parameters a first selection of 12 calibration parameters table 2 was made based on most commonly selected swat calibration parameters used in previous swat calibration studies abbaspour et al 2015 zambrano bigiarini and rojas 2013 zhang et al 2008 as well as parameters which were found to be most sensitive with respect to changes in et according to a manual trial and error tests the pre selection of these 12 parameters was then tested for sensitivity using the latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat sampling strategy van griensven et al 2006 as a result the five most sensitive parameters for the swat model of the study area with respect to changes in evapotranspiration could be identified only these parameters highlighted with in table 2 were used in the calibration process subsequently these five model parameters were further differentiated based on their dependency on individual soil or land use classes as well as on soil depth resulting in 44 parameters to calibrate initial values are within the range of the given maximum and minimum values but vary with land use class soil class and soil depth respectively the parameter ranges were defined based on swat suggested minimum and maximum values for unmeasurable model parameters e g epco esco cn ii and on estimates used in previous studies in this region awan et al 2016 3 3 3 objective function it is widely suggested to treat the calibration problem of hydrological models as a multi objective problem gupta et al 2009 1998 van griensven and van bauwens 2003 i e using either multi variable measurements multi site measurements or multi response functions in the calibration process madsen 2003 the method used in this study can be seen as a multi site calibration as it uses individual et time series from 293 sites i e hrus moreover to account for multiple hydrological responses hence to estimate temporal as well as total volumetric error behavior we chose the kling gupta efficiency kge as objective function kling et al 2012 this goodness of fit criterion includes measures of correlation r variability Œ± and bias error Œ≤ gupta et al 1998 kling et al 2012 it assesses the fit between modelled and observed values on a scale of infinity to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect match and decreasing kges indicating decreasing fits between model results and observations finally the optimization problem becomes a single criterion maximization problem which combines multiple criteria into the single goal function of maximizing the mean kge gupta et al 1998 kling et al 2012 of all selected sites the objective function is given as 7 max kge mean j 1 k 1 k 1 r 1 2 Œ± 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 j where k is the total number of hrus r is the regression coefficient Œ±is a measure of relative variability ratio of simulated and observed standard deviation and Œ≤is the bias ratio of simulated and observed means 3 3 4 validation to validate the calibrated swat model a cross validation approach is applied a new set of 264 hrus is selected these hrus were not used during calibration but represent the same land use classes of the previously used hrus this way it is tested if parameter adjustments which were done during calibration can be transferred to other swat hrus the swat model is run with the best parameter set obtained by the dds algorithm and finally swat et values of the new 264 hrus are compared to sebal et values for the same locations the calibration success is then evaluated based on the goodness of fit between swat and sebal et 4 results despite the underestimation of swat et values compared to sebal et throughout the dry months and overestimation during monsoon months the temporal pattern as well as the corresponding efficiency criteria e g kge 0 51 r2 0 81 and rmse 20 mm month show that the uncalibrated swat et data fit reasonably well to the sebal data fig 4 both et time series capture the same temporal variation with respect to growing and harvesting seasons and except for the two wettest summer months deviations of swat vs sebal et are small we therefore consider sebal to be an adequate observed data set to be used for parameter estimation in the swat calibration procedure 4 1 calibration results the spatially distributed swat calibration using a sebal data set seems promising but also reveals limitations the initial kge of 0 04 is calculated by averaging the individual kges of all 293 hrus and represents the fit between swat et and sebal et before calibration table 3 calibrating the swat model using the dds algorithm yielded the following results the automated calibration procedure improved the mean kge by 0 23 from initially 0 04 to 0 27 within the first 5000 calibration runs the best kge of 0 28 was achieved after approx 10 000 dds runs showing that a fast convergence within the first 5000 runs was reached while the following 5000 runs were only leading to a further improvement of about 0 01 kge even though a kge of 0 27 is clearly not showing a satisfying model performance an overall improvement of 0 23 kge seems promising for a spatially distributed model calibration while in a traditional calibration procedure time series of spatially integrated data fig 4 would be fitted in a spatially distributed calibration all hrus are treated as separate time series thus spatially dependent misfits are not averaged out comparing the lumped initial kge of mean sebal et and mean swat et of 0 51 with the spatially distributed initial kge values mean kge of all hrus of 0 04 already points towards the complexity of calibrating a model using a spatially distributed approach a closer look into the detailed results of this calibration process shows that the results have to be examined with respect to seasonal patterns as well as spatial variations in the goodness of fit calibration results differ clearly between single hrus best hrus reach kge values of up to 0 6 after calibration whereas some areas show values as low as 0 60 in the following the reasons for the low calibration performance and for the temporal and spatial error variations are presented in detail 4 2 seasonal differences of goodness of fit mean et time series for all hrus of the uncalibrated dotted black line as well as for the calibrated solid black line swat model are presented in fig 4 furthermore it shows the sebal data mean of all hrus solid red line which was used as observation data for calibration while this figure does not reveal much about the spatial fit it shows the improvement of temporal model performance during the calibration process it can be observed that the calibration helped to reduce the underestimation of et by the swat model during the drier winter months yet the seasonal variation in the goodness of fit remains while during most of the year a good fit of swat vs sebal values can be observed during summer months swat values uncalibrated and calibrated still clearly exceed the sebal estimates these months coincide with the wet season kharif in our study area where cloud cover is high and remote sensing estimates of surface energy balances calculations exhibit higher uncertainties usman et al 2015a this hypothesis is also supported by the spread of the model performance on hru scale fig 5 dry winter months show very low differences between sebal and swat data sets whereas wet summer months show differences in et of over 100 mm month fig 5 for this reason some studies have excluded the monsoon months from calibration immerzeel and droogers 2008 for study areas however where each season has entirely different cropping characteristics neglecting all wet months would exclude an entire cropping cycle with its unique temporal and spatial land use characteristics accordingly the parameterization would be biased by only one cropping and climate pattern therefore methods of separating wet and dry seasons in the calibration process have been applied in other studies gao et al 2018 yet the parameters selected for calibration in this study namely epco cn2 sol awc gw delay and sol k are not expected to significantly change from wet to dry months as these coefficients are depending mainly on characteristics of soil structure grain size distribution geological factors etc which are changing on long term time scales but not by season to be physically consistent this study therefore does not separate wet and dry seasons for calibration examining the distributions of monthly et values separately for sebal and swat fig 6 reveals that the reason for the mismatch of et during summer months could lay in the low variance of sebal et values fig 6a in contrast to our expectation that sebal would reflect high et variances during monsoon months due to higher diversity in the agricultural cultivation as well as higher uncertainties in the remote sensing data it shows a surprisingly low data spread compared to swat et fig 6b assessing the dependency of et with respect to each land use class shows a high variance of swat et this seems quite plausible as different land use types have specific plant physiognomies and growing patterns and hence unique et time series fig 6d consequently swat results show a clear distinction of different land use class et estimates while the sebal data entirely lack any land use class dependent et characteristics and show nearly identical et patterns for all hrus fig 6c the limitations of using this sebal data set for a spatially distributed calibration of a small scale farming system are further reflected by the spatial differences of the calibration results 4 3 spatial differences of goodness of fit a closer look into the spatial distribution of the calibration results shows that the error between observed and simulated et is highly land use dependent i e kges vary significantly between land use classes fig 7 while hrus of the land use class wheat rice show a mean kge of over 0 3 with a maximum kge of 0 69 fodder fallow only yields a mean kge of less than 0 50 this shows a discrepancy of over 0 8 kge between best and worst mean fit see fig 1 for spatial distribution of land use classes and fig 10b for mean kges of each individual land use class the clear land use dependency of the calibration results reveals again that the best goodness of fits occur for land use classes with et characteristics closest to the average temporal et pattern of all land use types this underlines the hypothesis that the extracted sebal data represents only a mean et value of all land use classes at the same time land use types which vary significantly from the mean show lowest goodness of fits hence to improve the overall calibration result an alternative et data set which better accounts for differences due to land use characteristics is needed 4 4 calibration results using a modified sebal et data set as mentioned the main reason for the low calibration performance might lay in the missing reproduction of land use dependent et patterns by the sebal data during the wet season we therefore use the modified sebal data set which better accounts for land use dependent et variation for a second calibration trial the resulting mean et time series of each land use class from the modified sebal data set are shown in fig 8 now land use class dependent et variations better reflect expected differences between different crop types the initial fit between swat et and the modified sebal et yields a kge of 0 22 compared to 0 04 in the previous case and thus already presents an improved starting point for a spatial calibration table 4 as expected the results show that a consideration of the land use dependent et characteristics clearly improves the calibration performance a final mean kge of 0 40 could be achieved with a 5th and 95th percentile of 0 14 and 0 60 kge respectively table 4 furthermore the results show that except for two land use classes fodder cotton foco and wheat cotton whco the calibration could reach comparable kges for all land use classes as opposed to the previous attempt where mean kges varied from approx 0 50 to 0 40 depending on the respective land cover type fig 10b and 10d as mentioned above during calibration with unmodified sebal et data kges were high for land use classes with et estimates close to the average sebal et and low for land use classes for which et deviated strongly from this mean it can be assumed that the reason for a less successful calibration of single land use classes i e foco and whco is no longer the strong general difference from the mean sebal et estimate compared to the simulated mean et as it was the case during the first calibration attempt both foco and whco for example show relatively low kges fig 10d but closer proximity to the average modified sebal et estimates mean absolute difference approx 30 mm month than land use classes which reached highest kges sugr sugarcane for example shows a higher deviation from the mean sebal data mean absolute difference 40 mm month but shows a much better match with its respective sebal time series and a mean kge above 0 60 a low kge can therefore now be attributed to land use specific performance of swat et estimation the spatial distribution of the model performance fig 9 as well as land use class specific kge improvement fig 10 illustrate once more that the second calibration procedure leads to a study area wide improvement of the model performance hence the calibration results using the modified sebal data set enable a spatially distributed assessment of the model performance this helps to achieve the initially stated aim of examining and improving the model set up without losing spatially distributed information 4 5 validation the validity of the best parameter set derived by the above described calibration procedure is tested using a cross validation approach due to the quality of the observation data described above the same time period 2009 2010 has to be used for validation therefore the verification is done using a new hru set of 264 hrus which were not used during calibration but represent the same land use classes the validation results show a mean kge of 0 57 with best kges of up to 0 74 table 5 which is on average even slightly higher than during calibration this shows that the calibrated parameters are transferable to other areas hrus in our study region and hence ascertains a valid calibration the kge distribution with respect to each land use except for wheat rice shows similar or even higher values compared to the calibration output 5 discussion the remote sensing derived sebal data set enables a spatially distributed calibration of the hydrological swat model yet the study shows that the calibration results of the first trial are unsatisfactory and show a high seasonal variation in the goodness of fit between sebal and swat et especially during months with heterogeneous cropping patterns land use type specific et information differs significantly between both data sets and a decent parameterization and hence a satisfactory calibration is not possible using the original sebal et data however the result can be improved using the modified sebal product which accounts for plant type specific et characteristics the resulting improved calibration performance hints towards the importance of using a plant type dependent et data set for model calibration of small scale and heterogeneous agricultural areas still remaining differences of modified sebal and swat et can be explained by i differences in the et calculation methods of sebal and swat ii differences in input data sets iii differences in spatial scales of swat hrus and the initial sebal grid and iv by differences in model assumptions regarding parameters controlling et 5 1 differences in et calculation methods of sebal and swat as mentioned in the introduction section sebal et is based on the surface energy balance with visible near infrared and thermal infrared images being the input data for the retrieval of radiation and relevant land surface characteristics e g ndvi hence energy balance components are the main factors controlling the et estimation while this sparse input data requirement is an advantage for our large scale application it also poses a potential source of et uncertainty for example all plant dependent information needed for the et calculation such as leave area or plant height to define the roughness length for heat transfer are estimated from the spectral information of the remote sensing product hence if the spectral data cannot resolve the spatial variability of the respective plant information such as vegetation height roughness length and displacement height it will not be able to give plant specific spatially distributed et estimates ershadi et al 2013 this can be seen in fig 6c which shows the weak performance of the sebal data set in separating the single land use dependent et patterns in swat on the other hand et calculation is embedded into the overall water balance equation which relates et estimates to the entire hydrological cycle swat includes detailed information about the different land use types such as rooting depth plant height leaf area index etc and thus enables a plant type specific et estimation at the model unit scale i e hru level as can be seen in fig 6d however similar to the uncertainties of the sebal product also the swat et calculation is based on parameter assumption which induce uncertainty embedding the et estimation into the overall water balance calculation and therefore linking it to other water fluxes such as soil moisture availability which again depends on percolation rates lateral flow surface runoff etc increases the number of model parameters responsible for the final et rate and hence increases uncertainty therefore the selection of swat parameters to be included into the calibration procedure is crucial rajib et al 2018 found that for a successful swat calibration using et data biophysical parameters should be considered as they are representing vegetation dynamics and energy utilization mechanisms and thus enable a better model accuracy regarding et however an accurate observed data set which reflects the same detail in spatial and temporal variation in et as the model output is still required for a successful calibration as further discussed in the following sections 5 2 differences in input data sets another reason for the discrepancy between sebal and swat et might be a general mismatch due to differences in input data for et calculations while the sebal product applied in this study uses plant information ndvi and lai derived from modis products swat uses landsat derived land use classification as well as soil information from the water and soil investigation division of pakistan table a 1 appendix to estimate et input data sets are therefore entirely independent and might lead to temporal and spatial differences in the final et estimation however as illustrated in fig 5 and fig 6 the et mismatch is only apparent for the wet summer season which shows a high variety of crop types dry winter months with mainly one crop type winter wheat show a nearly perfect fit of sebal and swat et estimates thus it seems reasonable to assume that the main difficulty does not lay in the general mismatch of et values due to differences in et calculation methods or discrepancies in the input data sets but rather in a spatial discrepancy 5 3 differences of spatial scales a spatial mismatch between sebal and swat due to scaling and averaging procedures is one more reason for the hampered calibration success similar discrepancies of observed and simulated et due to scaling problems were reported by liaqat et al 2015 who compared surface energy balance system sebs results with advection aridity derived et also bastiaanssen et al 2012 compared et based on remote sensing data with lysimeter values and reported differences in et estimates due to scaling discrepancies while agricultural fields in our study area have an average size of about 150 150 m sebal calculates et only on a 1 km 1 km scale and hence delivers an average et of several different fields within one sebal pixel swat averages the sebal et estimates over hrus with areas of approx 20 km2 taking the mean of all sebal pixels which fall within one hru polygon all spatial differences in sebal et characteristics are lost consequently this method leads to smoothed observed sebal et time series for all hrus and hence wrongly implies equal et characteristics for each land use class fig 6c moreover it is known that modis based et estimates are able to correctly reproduce basin average et patterns as it is also shown in this study but that they fail to distinguish variation in et fluxes between crop types at smaller scales mccabe and wood 2006 wang et al 2016 this explains the spatial distribution of kges fig 7 and our findings that kges are highest for land use classes which show et patterns closest to the basin average et values in areas which show a larger extent of homogeneous crop types like rice growing areas in the northern part of the catchment a better fit of the modis based sebal estimates and swat can be observed this means that a higher spatial resolution of the input data set used for remote sensing derived et calculation would be necessary to get more reliable et information for smaller scales only then sebal would yield et information which would be sufficiently spatially discretized to be used for a successful swat model calibration procedure as described in this study the improvement of the calibration results using the modified sebal data set which accounts for a higher spatial variability of crop specific et patterns shows the potential for a successful calibration using such a higher spatially resolved data product 5 4 differences in model parameter assumptions so far we mainly discussed the difficulties of the calibration approach due to limitations of the remotely sensed et product however given the local conditions of our study area the sebal data set used in this study still offers valuable information which is very useful for a basin wide swat model calibration for example sebal serves well as calibration data for temporal variations of et it gives good et approximations in dry winter months and due to its initially gridded information it accounts for detailed spatially distributed temperature and precipitation variations in the region in addition considering the local characteristics of our study area where surface water content is nearly entirely determined by irrigation water supply sebal et data provides the advantage that they inherently account for the information of surface water availability in this semi arid and extensively irrigated area energy partitioning between sensible and latent heat flux is strongly varying with surface water availability as sebal derives et from the amount of energy available for latent heat flux it indirectly accounts for the surface water content which controls et in turn swat needs detailed irrigation management information as well as crop planting and harvesting times to guarantee a correct estimation of surface water availability and hence actual et rates these management strategies are often unknown and approximations are taken as initial model parameters consequently this yields a high degree of model parameter and hence et uncertainty sebal can therefore help to calibrate the swat model with respect to management parameter settings the final calibration results fig 10 show that if the sebal data set contains crop type dependent et pattern i e modified sebal et data set variations in the goodness of fit between sebal and swat are still noticeable however in this case a less satisfying goodness of fit can be attributed to single crop types fig 10c e g whco and foco and thus to a land use specific performance of swat et estimation to account for this the model can be calibrated accordingly 6 conclusions the study assessed the potential as well as shortcomings of using remote sensing derived et data in a spatially distributed model calibration approach a sebal data set was used to obtain et time series which were subsequently applied in a spatially distributed calibration procedure the study could demonstrate that the extraction of spatial et data from a 1 km 1 km modis based sebal data set using the extent of swat model hru areas leads to averaged and nearly equal remote sensing derived et data for all hrus the extracted time series from sebal data are therefore insufficiently representing spatial differences in et patterns and are inhibiting satisfactory calibration results in order to use remote sensing derived et data for model calibration which is often the only spatially distributed data set available a detailed assessment of the spatial variability of sebal et data is necessary for a small scale and highly diverse agricultural setting the preservation of the spatial heterogeneity of the observed i e remote sensing data set remains one of the main challenges for an improved model calibration in such an environment a higher resolution or a modified observed et data set which accounts for land use class specific et pattern is therefore desirable the final calibration of swat using a modified sebal et data set which captures the spatial et variability showed the potential of this calibration approach for a complex spatially distributed hydrological model in line with the findings of this study the following should be considered for a successful spatially distributed calibration using remote sensing derived et data temporal variability of et is captured well by sebal data but shows lower accuracies during wet seasons when cloud cover reduces the reliability of remote sensing derived et data during seasons with homogeneous crop types i e low spatial heterogeneity sebal and swat et estimates show a satisfactory match during seasons when crop patterns are highly diverse the remote sensing product is biased towards specific land use patterns which results in the same trend in the calibration results especially for small scale agricultural areas the averaging of remote sensing derived data to a mean et value per hru cannot resolve the spatial et variability during seasons when crop patterns are highly diverse a correction of the observed data set is therefore suggested to account for the characteristics of each specific land use class and to remove the bias mentioned above credit authorship contribution statement rike becker conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation

6238,due to the increasing need of human societies and diverse biological species for adequate and reliable water resources river basins play an important role in reliable water supply a comprehensive index for assessing the performance of river basins can prevent unintentional events by accurately identifying vulnerabilities and threats in the present study comprehensive risk assessment of a river basin is carried out using fault tree analysis fta to determine the undesirable events the fta method based on a logical diagram reveals the relationships of basic events and the top event by logical gates and is capable of providing quantitative and qualitative analysis of the river basin it can show the failure paths and calculates the degree of basins reliability in this study undesirable ecological status low quality and scarcity of water resources and economic and social anomalies were studied as unfavorable events of the urmia lake basin to do this an fta model is presented in which water resources failure risk of urmia lake basin is the top event the probability of occurrence of basic events and top event was calculated based on the information available for the area and using experts opinions the results of the study show that quality failure have the most impact on top event occurrence the effective basic events in the occurrence of the top event are inappropriate governance low awareness level entrance of industrial and domestic wastewater to groundwater entrance of agricultural wastewater to groundwater and meteorological drought respectively the index derived from the fta can provide water resources managers and decision makers with comprehensive measure to improve and compare the status of internal and external effective factors in river basins keywords fault tree analysis risk assessment river basin urmia lake 1 introduction the unfavorable consequences of the loss of water for human life and other biological species have made it necessary to verify the reliability of river basins to meet this basic need the lack of proper and scientific planning in critical water shortage situations exacerbate the threats and risks of water scarcity in recent years river basins have had many problems from the viewpoints of water scarcity inadequate water quality environmental hazards and social and economic damages a comprehensive approach to assess the performance of river basins can reduce their vulnerability to critical situations and provide a comprehensive assessment for their risk management and improvement in recent years researchers have examined the threats in the river basins some of which are presented below babel et al 2011 considered environmental social and economic indicators of the bagmati basin in nepal a comprehensive index was obtained in this basin by weighting various indicators such as water scarcity and water pollution in another research ge et al 2013 used projection pursuit cluster model to manage social vulnerability risk social vulnerability indicators included rural urban population development economic and social development family foundation and industry development a comprehensive indicator was obtained by weighting social vulnerability indicators to investigate the damages and causes of the river basin failure wei et al 2014 assessed the credit regulatory and physical risks of several rivers in china using indicators provided by organizations such as the world wide fund for nature wwf and the german investment and development co they finally calculated the rivers overall risk in another risk assessment of river basins gain et al 2015 assessed the risk of water scarcity in terms of ecological social and physical in the brahmaputra basin they used a hierarchical combination of indicators to achieve a comprehensive risk index furthermore non additive measures method was used to aggregate the indicators finally in order to achieve a general relationship of criteria experts rated each indicator to illustrate the application of risk management in the luanhe basin bao et al 2017 provided a comprehensive ecological risk assessment index which included water quantitative risk physical risk water qualitative risk chemical risk and water ecosystem risk biological risk to calculate the ecological risk they used the relationships among the rate of supplying the required environmental flow the river ecological risk index the relative quality of the sediments and the biological index and then a general risk was obtained by weighting and aggregating of the indicators a review on previous studies on the management of river basins failure risk reveals that so far the threats to river basins have not been thoroughly assessed quantitatively qualitatively ecologically socially and economically and only a specific aspect of basins risks have been noticed the aim of this study is to find a comprehensive index to cover the failure risks of river basins in different aspects risk assessment of river basins can be done by methods such as bayesian network fta and multi criteria decision making fta is a qualitative model that provides a good understanding of the causes of an unfavorable event furthermore this method can be quantitated to obtain more information about the probability of occurrence of the top event and the importance of the basic events by prioritizing events that contribute to an unfavorable event preventive plans can be considered for easier performance improvement of the catchment areas therefore fta is a suitable method for obtaining and graphically displaying all threats and hazards at a catchment area fta is a top down method based on system failure that begins with an unfavorable event and then its causes are determined using a reverse process by the quantitative fta it is possible to obtain important information about the probability of occurrence of the top event and the importance of the basic events kelley and allison 1981 presented a comprehensive approach to preventing hazards and threats in a water treatment plant they used the fta graphical display to quickly and easily access the overall threats of the plant sadiq et al 2008 examined the inadequate water quality in an urban water distribution system as an unfavorable event using the fta method they identified water pollution at the entry point corrosion of the system components and failure in the water treatment plant as the basic events in occurrence of the top event lindhe et al 2009 showed the importance of fta in drinking water systems of gothenburg sweden they identified water pollution failure in the water treatment plant and several more factors as the basic events that led to poor water quality in the urban water distribution network in another application of fta tchorzewska cieslak et al 2012 presented possible scenarios for the failure of urban water supply networks using fta and several basic events including non continuous water supply water contamination in water pipelines pipeline technical conditions human error and sudden changes in temperature were identified as the factors that increase in the likelihood of an unfavorable event health threats of water users beauchamp et al 2010 studied the technical and operation hazards of the sewage treatment plant using fta the main objective of their research was to improve the effective technical and operation factors in cryptosporidium parvum oocysts removal by various physicochemical purification technologies in this study they investigated fta qualitatively and collected information required for fta using previous investigations as well as operators experience results showed that quality analysis of water treatment plant is a complex process so many factors should be taken into account in order to minimize the uncertainties throughout the system by using dynamic fault tree lindhe et al 2012 assessed the risk of three types of drinking water supply system considering accessible water quality failures in terms of measurement and quality failures in the treatment plant as top events in gutenberg they used logical gates to model the risks of water supply through the markov process stein et al 2017 investigated the widespread use of the fta and stated that the fta could be used as a decision support system to identify the relationships among the underlying events and their effects on the top event in water treatment plants for the first time using the fta babaei et al 2018 provided a unique structure for the risk assessment of the adequacy equity and efficiency of water delivery in agricultural water delivery systems considering unfavorable supply and delivery as the top event then the factors leading to the occurrence of this unfavorable event including natural hazards and human and operational threats were considered to be basic and intermediate events in the fta structure ozga zielinski et al 2018 used methods such as the fault tree method ftm event tree method etm risk matrix and ranking method in a portion of the upper sola river catchment in poland for assessing hazard risk and losses connected with the occurrence of such events are suggested to improve flood risk management and enhance the capacity to safeguard against such events by improving current flood protection protocols reviewing previous studies shows that so far there has been no research in the area of risk assessment of river basins using fta furthermore the probabilistic approach of fta has not been used to achieve a comprehensive and integrated indicator that includes effective factors in the river basins weight aggregation and averaging methods which are used in previous works to indicate the importance of the indicators cannot specifically address the entire basin for this reason the risk indicators discussed in this study are used for the first time to analyze comprehensive and multidimensional risk of river basin failures the comprehensive approach is presented for urmia lake basin which is one of the most important river basins in iran due to the several issues such as water shortages inadequate water quality ecological hazards and economic and social damages urmia lake basin requires a comprehensive assessment to identify its vulnerable aspects in order to perform a successful risk management plan to establish a comprehensive index for assessing the lake failure risk in the urmia lake basin using the fta the factors provided by various researchers as well as recognized organizations such as world wide fund for nature wwf and the german investment and development co deg were used the overall framework proposed in this study can be used as a comprehensive measure for decision makers to improve the status of the main and secondary catchment areas in terms of economic social political environmental and other aspects indeed not only they can compare the river basins in terms of calculated risk values but also they can focus on reducing the occurrence probability of the top event using corrective actions based on the measuring the importance of the basic events or even of the intermediate events which increases the reliability of the river basin 2 methodology 2 1 study area in this study the urmia lake basin located in iran was selected for comprehensive failure risk assessment the basin of urmia lake in northwest of iran with an area of 51 762 km2 is one of the six major river basins in iran the urmia lake is surrounded by west azerbaijan province with a total area of 24 681 km2 east azerbaijan province with a total area of 22 488 km2 and kurdistan province with an area of 4 593 km2 the urmia lake is one of the largest lakes in iran and is one of the most permanent hypersaline lakes in the world zarghami 2011 azarnivand et al 2015 due to its natural and ecological characteristics urmia lake has been designated as a national park since 1967 it is also the second largest habitat of a unique artemia species in the world the urmia lake basin considered to be one of the most ecologically socially unique areas has suffered a severe drop in lake levels in recent years due to climate change and poor water resources management alipour 2006 banihabib et al 2015 in the current situation due to the drought of a significant part of the lake very difficult conditions have been created for the survival of plant and animal species of this lake and in some cases such as artemia their life is in danger because of the high salinity of the lake water the overall location of urmia lake and the basin s boundary are shown in fig 1 various human and natural factors such as implementation of various water resources development projects increasing agricultural water use changing the cropping pattern production of high water consumption agricultural products in the river basin low productivity of water and the lack of effective protection of the environmental and ecological resources of the river basin on one hand and climate fluctuations and the reduction of precipitation and runoff in the catchment area on the other hand have resulted in such a condition for the largest lake in iran based upon the existing evidence as well as experiences from other lakes with similar status worldwide the persistence of drought in urmia lake will undoubtedly cause many damages to the health of inhabitants in this area and the ecosystem of the region the process shown in this fig 2 will be used to formulate a general fta in the river basin scale to achieve a comprehensive risk index and to improve the planning for risk management 2 2 risk assessment methods risk is the occurrence probability of an unfavorable event risk assessment is a systematic effort to identify and deal with a natural an unnatural human made and operational management issues improper design lack of long term planning etc threats and hazards by analyzing each threat the probability of occurrence and the damage from the threat can be determined in case of occurrence 2 3 fault tree analysis 2 3 1 quantitative analysis of basic events and top event fta is a deductive top down approach based on system failure and as an analogous approach begins with an unfavorable event the top event and then the causes are determined using a systematic reverse process in other words the fta based on a logical diagram by introducing the relationships between the basic events and the top event and providing a quantitative analysis of the system shows the failure probability and calculates the degree of system reliability al saleem 2007 the events and symbols used in the fta are defined as follows intermediate event this event is placed between the top event and the basic events which is found at the output of a gate transfer out indicates that a part of the tree must be connected to the same symbol transfer in represents the transfer of a part of the fta to another location the gates define the logic in the fta and relate the basic events to the intermediate events and eventually to the top event if the simultaneous failure of two event results in a higher event failure the gate and and if the failure of at least one of them leads to a higher event failure the gate or will be used for their connection for example in fig 3 the failure of d is considered to be the top event the gate or is used between the two failures of b and c however the gate and is seen between the failures of events of b or c and a fta calculations are based on boolean rules in the calculation of the top event the basic events are connected to each other and to the intermediate events using logical and and or gates therefore to calculate the top event and and or gates are calculated using eq 1 and 2 respectively 1 p i 1 n p i 2 p 1 i 1 n 1 p i where p is the probability of each basic event i is a counter and n is the number of incoming events connected to the gate 2 3 2 corrective actions to reduce the occurrence probability and severity of the top event if the probability of the top event obtained from the preceding step is satisfactory the fta process is over but if it is unsatisfactory it is necessary to reduce the occurrence probability of the top event using corrective actions in fact the system will enter the risk management phase one of the most useful tools in this field is to measure the importance of the basic events or even of the intermediate events which increases the reliability of the system many indices have been proposed in measuring the effectiveness of the lower events in order to investigate the distribution of failure in each subcategory quantitative qualitative ecological economic and social failures the birnbaum index bi was used in this study the bi is calculated from the eq 3 pan and tai 1988 3 bi q q i 1 q q i 0 in this equation q q i 1 is the function of the failure probability of a top event at the time when the failure of the i th event occurs entirely also q q i 0 is the function of the failure probability of a top event at the time when the failure of the i th event does not happen at all the higher this indicator the greater the effect of the basic event on the occurrence of the top event is 2 4 fault tree analysis of the studied area the effective criteria and indicators in the river basin are based on reports provided by reputable organizations such as wwf and deg published studies and experts opinions in all aspects of the threats including quantitative qualitative ecological economic and social 29 threats were identified to assess the water resources failure risk of urmia lake basin these threats were considered to be the fta basic events classified into operational human made and natural categories table 1 in this research 29 factors basin events have been evaluated in fta in which failure probability of 7 factors have been considered qualitatively based on experts opinions and other factors are calculated mathematically in majority of the fta related researches questionnaire is used and the basic events are mostly subjective but in this research a great effort has been made to implement the risk assessment by real and numerical data fig 4 shows the fta structure of the failure risk of urmia lake basin this failure risk top event will occur due to the occurrence of at least one of the quantitative qualitative ecological economic and social failures due to the wide fta developed in this study and in order to give details of each section each of the quantitative qualitative ecological economic and social failures of the urmia lake basin is described separately with a triangle symbol therefore basic events top event and logical gates in the fta structure are shown with be te and and or symbols respectively as well as intermediate events at level 1 with the symbol a level 2 with the symbol b level 3 with the symbol c and level 4 are displayed with the symbol d in fig 4 the probability of occurrence of the top event is obtained based on the probabilities assigned to the lower events to use logical gates there should be a deep understanding on the relationships between the intermediate and basic events otherwise the occurrence probability of the top event will not be similar to its actual value failure of water quantity failure of water quantity is one of the most important failures in the occurrence of the top event which is split into two sub divisions failure risk of water quantity due to water shortage occurs with at least one of the failures of destructive human factors or natural degradation factors most effective human factors in the lack of surface water and groundwater shortage in the studied basin are excessive construction of water structures water exports during water shortage excessive withdrawal of surface water and groundwater resources excessive production of high water consumed agricultural products losses due to the improper use of reservoirs and damaged water pipelines the phenomena such as hydrological and meteorological drought and climate change in the last decade are among the natural factors that have reduced surface runoff and precipitation and resulted in lake water loss and consequently shortage of water resources in the studied area fig 5 failure of water quality one of the reasons for the failure of the urmia lake basin is lack of quality surface water and groundwater resources contamination from domestic industrial and agricultural wastewater to surface water and groundwater sources reduce water quality one of the main reasons for reducing groundwater quality is the excessive drop of aquifer surface level due to unauthorized water withdrawal of wells and the construction of water structures which results in an increase in pollutants fig 6 ecological failures this failure is related to the threats to the habitat of various species in the lake basin the most important factor that threatens the environment of the urmia lake basin is the lack of environmental water right allocation in which the minimum required ecological balance for the survival of the biological species is not provided in addition contamination from domestics industrial and agricultural wastewater also undermine the environmental balance of the urmia lake basin fig 7 economic failures effective factors related to economic problems can be the reduction of water productivity in agriculture due to the lack of modern irrigation methods the inappropriate organization of agricultural soils and damaged water transfer systems lack of attention to the economic value of water as well as lack of financial supports fig 8 social failures the most important factors of social problems are low awareness of inhabitants in the river basin and inappropriate governance inappropriate governance stems from factors such as lack of proper planning for water supply and water demand and applying inappropriate water laws in the lake basin fig 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 failure probability of basic events the occurrence probabilities of basic events were calculated on the basis of a short term 10 year period for critical situations and a long term 40 year period for the normal situation inappropriate cultivation pattern the agricultural products that consume a lot of water in the urmia lake basin are apples sugar beet potatoes tomatoes wheat and barley which have significant exports the amount of excess consumption generated by high consumption products in the urmia lake basin in the short term is 1719 mcm hadinejad 2016 and the total agricultural consumption in these years is 5356 mcm hadinejad 2016 hence these products enter a failure risk at the entire area the probability of failure due to the inappropriate cultivating pattern in the entire urmia lake basin in the last 10 years can be obtained using eq 4 by excessive water use due to inappropriate cultivation pattern ec to total agricultural water ta 4 p b e 1 e c ta improper management of virtual water virtual water is the volume of water that an agricultural or non agricultural product consumes in the production process generally some part of the water consumed in the production process has no physical presence in the final product to calculate the probability of a failure due to improper management of virtual water the water export is a defect for the studied river basin thus the average amount of water exported from the urmia lake basin ae in the short term is 1320 mcm hadinejad 2016 and the total agricultural consumption ta in these years is 5356 mcm hadinejad 2016 the probability of virtual water failure in the urmia lake basin in the last 10 years is calculated using eq 5 5 p b e 2 a e t a inappropriate water prices low water price in the present condition of urmia lake basin modern semi traditional and traditional water network tariffs are equal to three two and one percent of the value of the planted products determining a reasonable price for water has the privilege those consumers would not consider water as free products and they will try to save it today the plan for achieving self sufficiency in food production in one hand and the shortage in water resources need optimal utilization of water with regard to eq 6 the probability of failure due to the inappropriate water price is calculated by the price of producing agricultural water pa 0 012 to the price of agricultural water for the farmers in the urmia lake basin pf 0 02 yasi et al 2016 thus 6 p be 3 p a p f p a excessive construction of dams dams reduce the volume of runoff to the lake from 3900 mcm to 1600 mcm this volume

variable variables using a questionnaire where the probability of failure were evaluated as very low low moderate high and very high according to table 2 for each descriptive variable a probability value was assigned which using the arithmetic mean of experts opinions the failure probability of the remaining events was calculated lack of quality water for diverse species the entrance of pollutants and sewage into the urmia lake prevents providing reliable and suitable water for the aquatic species of this basin the failure probability of this event according to the experts for not having access to reliable water for aquatic organisms in urmia lake is 34 p be22 34 lack of adequate water for diverse species one of the features of an unfavorable ecosystem is the lack of adequate water for aquatic organisms according to experts the failure probability of this event is 43 p be23 43 lack of financial resources lack of financial support delays the implementation of lake recovery

is likely to occur in the urmia lake basin should be investigated at first the basins with a potential flood damage were identified 34 of sub basins in the west azerbaijan and 19 of the sub basins in east azerbaijan had experienced damages by occurring floods thus according to experts opinion the failure probability of this event is 28 p be26 28 inappropriate using of agricultural soils this factor in the case of occurrence causes a decrease in water productivity in the agricultural sector and its failure probability is 33 according to the experts p be27 33 low awareness level of inhabitants in the river basins one of the most important reasons for the social failure of the river basin is the lack of information and awareness in the river basin knowledge of people about river basin values and their threats is essential for basin management therefore raising public awareness is a priority to prevent the failure of the urmia lake basin hence institutions in charge of management must upgrade their capacities to carry out their work due to lack of sufficient awareness of inhabitants in the river basin which according to the experts opinions the failure probability was 45 p be28 45 inappropriate governance inappropriate governance in the urmia lake basin can be due to inappropriate laws as well as lack of proper management of water supply and demand this factor is one of the main factors in the social failure of the river basin according to the experts the failure probability is 55 p be29 55 3 3 the risk assessment model and quantitative analysis of the water resources failure risk of urmia lake basin the probabilities derived from experts opinions and the data and statistics of recent years for the study area are shown in table 3 the open fta software was used to calculate the probability of the top event the probabilities shown in table 3 were introduced as input data into the software the software then implemented and or logical gates to calculate the river basin failure risk according to table 4 the failure probability of the quantitative qualitative ecological economic and social events was 0 119 0 43 0 0172 0 06 and 0 75 respectively eventually the probability of the water resources failure risk of urmia lake basin as the top event was obtained 88 6 the results show that the social failure event has the highest probability of failure in the urmia lake basin due to the high probability of the top event it is necessary to investigate the effectiveness of each basic event based on its contribution to the occurrence of the top event after identifying the most effective factors it is possible to control and improve these factors by considering corrective actions 3 4 investigating the contribution of the basic events to the occurrence of the top event tables 5 10 show the scoring of the basic events given their impact on the occurrence of the top event and the quantitative qualitative ecological economic and social failures the larger the bi the basic event will have a greater effect on the top event according to table 5 events 29 28 15 16 13 14 26 are of the most influential events in the water resources failure risk of urmia lake basin subsequently the contribution of each basic event to the quantitative qualitative ecological economic and social failures were separately examined for checking the influence of the events of their upper events the values of bi for the quantitative failure events in table 6 show that the meteorological drought event has had the greatest effect in the shortage of water resources in the urmia lake basin table 7 shows that the most effective events related to qualitative failure are entrance of industrial and domestic wastewater to groundwater and entrance of agricultural wastewater to groundwater based on their contribution to the occurrence of the top event the environmental status of urmia lake has undergone a downward trend in recent years in spite of its all aspects of geology economics social water resources and climate consequently these negative impacts will lead to the destruction of the ecosystem in the river basin currently many of the ecological and socioeconomic functions of urmia lake and its marginal wetlands are impaired tangible and intangible damages due to this disorder will affect not only to the nature of the region but also to local livelihoods and human societies therefore a long term planning to maintain the ecological balance of the study area is inevitable according to the events shown in table 8 lack of environmental water right allocation and erosion events have the highest share in the ecological failure of urmia lake in table 9 lack of financial support will delay the implementation of urmia lake restoration which can result in a failure in urmia lake recovery projects inappropriate regional planning lack of codified laws in the lake area lack of land use planning despite the existence of planning documents as well as low awareness level of inhabitant in the river basin are of the most important reasons for the current situation in table 10 low awareness level of inhabitants in the river basin is shown as the most effective event in the occurrence of social failure in urmia lake basin 4 conclusions in this study a comprehensive risk assessment model is proposed for managing river basins using fta fault tree analysis fta is a top down deductivefailure analysis in which an undesired state of a system is analyzed the purpose of the failure risk assessment of a river basin was to assess the threatening factors in terms of water quantity water quality ecological economic and social status of the river basin considering the failure risk of the river basin as an unfavorable event at the top of the fta 29 factors contributed to the failure of the urmia lake basin which is one of the most important and under tension river basins in iran were identified based on the indicators provided by organizations such as wwf and deg available 40 year period statistics and information and the views of experts in the field the probabilistic values of the basic events were analyzed by using opn fta software according to the results the lake failure risk is 88 6 due to the high occurrence probability of failure of the top event the effectiveness of each basic event was investigated based on its contribution to the occurrence of the top event using bi which its result is useful to risk management after scoring all the basic events inappropriate governance low awareness level of inhabitants in the river basin and entrance of industrial and domestic wastewater to groundwater events have the highest influence in the risk of urmia lake basin based on the bi among all quantitative and qualitative failures the social failure is the most effective event in the occurrence of the top event due to its high score by improving the data accuracy the final results of this paper can be changed but the presented methodology is novel and applicable in other river basins as the future study it is suggested that uncertainties arising from experts opinions will be modeled using fuzzy logic or fta conversion to the bayesian network and the results will be compared with the findings of this study applying other useful techniques such as event tree analysis method for risk assessment of river basins is also suggested declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
6238,due to the increasing need of human societies and diverse biological species for adequate and reliable water resources river basins play an important role in reliable water supply a comprehensive index for assessing the performance of river basins can prevent unintentional events by accurately identifying vulnerabilities and threats in the present study comprehensive risk assessment of a river basin is carried out using fault tree analysis fta to determine the undesirable events the fta method based on a logical diagram reveals the relationships of basic events and the top event by logical gates and is capable of providing quantitative and qualitative analysis of the river basin it can show the failure paths and calculates the degree of basins reliability in this study undesirable ecological status low quality and scarcity of water resources and economic and social anomalies were studied as unfavorable events of the urmia lake basin to do this an fta model is presented in which water resources failure risk of urmia lake basin is the top event the probability of occurrence of basic events and top event was calculated based on the information available for the area and using experts opinions the results of the study show that quality failure have the most impact on top event occurrence the effective basic events in the occurrence of the top event are inappropriate governance low awareness level entrance of industrial and domestic wastewater to groundwater entrance of agricultural wastewater to groundwater and meteorological drought respectively the index derived from the fta can provide water resources managers and decision makers with comprehensive measure to improve and compare the status of internal and external effective factors in river basins keywords fault tree analysis risk assessment river basin urmia lake 1 introduction the unfavorable consequences of the loss of water for human life and other biological species have made it necessary to verify the reliability of river basins to meet this basic need the lack of proper and scientific planning in critical water shortage situations exacerbate the threats and risks of water scarcity in recent years river basins have had many problems from the viewpoints of water scarcity inadequate water quality environmental hazards and social and economic damages a comprehensive approach to assess the performance of river basins can reduce their vulnerability to critical situations and provide a comprehensive assessment for their risk management and improvement in recent years researchers have examined the threats in the river basins some of which are presented below babel et al 2011 considered environmental social and economic indicators of the bagmati basin in nepal a comprehensive index was obtained in this basin by weighting various indicators such as water scarcity and water pollution in another research ge et al 2013 used projection pursuit cluster model to manage social vulnerability risk social vulnerability indicators included rural urban population development economic and social development family foundation and industry development a comprehensive indicator was obtained by weighting social vulnerability indicators to investigate the damages and causes of the river basin failure wei et al 2014 assessed the credit regulatory and physical risks of several rivers in china using indicators provided by organizations such as the world wide fund for nature wwf and the german investment and development co they finally calculated the rivers overall risk in another risk assessment of river basins gain et al 2015 assessed the risk of water scarcity in terms of ecological social and physical in the brahmaputra basin they used a hierarchical combination of indicators to achieve a comprehensive risk index furthermore non additive measures method was used to aggregate the indicators finally in order to achieve a general relationship of criteria experts rated each indicator to illustrate the application of risk management in the luanhe basin bao et al 2017 provided a comprehensive ecological risk assessment index which included water quantitative risk physical risk water qualitative risk chemical risk and water ecosystem risk biological risk to calculate the ecological risk they used the relationships among the rate of supplying the required environmental flow the river ecological risk index the relative quality of the sediments and the biological index and then a general risk was obtained by weighting and aggregating of the indicators a review on previous studies on the management of river basins failure risk reveals that so far the threats to river basins have not been thoroughly assessed quantitatively qualitatively ecologically socially and economically and only a specific aspect of basins risks have been noticed the aim of this study is to find a comprehensive index to cover the failure risks of river basins in different aspects risk assessment of river basins can be done by methods such as bayesian network fta and multi criteria decision making fta is a qualitative model that provides a good understanding of the causes of an unfavorable event furthermore this method can be quantitated to obtain more information about the probability of occurrence of the top event and the importance of the basic events by prioritizing events that contribute to an unfavorable event preventive plans can be considered for easier performance improvement of the catchment areas therefore fta is a suitable method for obtaining and graphically displaying all threats and hazards at a catchment area fta is a top down method based on system failure that begins with an unfavorable event and then its causes are determined using a reverse process by the quantitative fta it is possible to obtain important information about the probability of occurrence of the top event and the importance of the basic events kelley and allison 1981 presented a comprehensive approach to preventing hazards and threats in a water treatment plant they used the fta graphical display to quickly and easily access the overall threats of the plant sadiq et al 2008 examined the inadequate water quality in an urban water distribution system as an unfavorable event using the fta method they identified water pollution at the entry point corrosion of the system components and failure in the water treatment plant as the basic events in occurrence of the top event lindhe et al 2009 showed the importance of fta in drinking water systems of gothenburg sweden they identified water pollution failure in the water treatment plant and several more factors as the basic events that led to poor water quality in the urban water distribution network in another application of fta tchorzewska cieslak et al 2012 presented possible scenarios for the failure of urban water supply networks using fta and several basic events including non continuous water supply water contamination in water pipelines pipeline technical conditions human error and sudden changes in temperature were identified as the factors that increase in the likelihood of an unfavorable event health threats of water users beauchamp et al 2010 studied the technical and operation hazards of the sewage treatment plant using fta the main objective of their research was to improve the effective technical and operation factors in cryptosporidium parvum oocysts removal by various physicochemical purification technologies in this study they investigated fta qualitatively and collected information required for fta using previous investigations as well as operators experience results showed that quality analysis of water treatment plant is a complex process so many factors should be taken into account in order to minimize the uncertainties throughout the system by using dynamic fault tree lindhe et al 2012 assessed the risk of three types of drinking water supply system considering accessible water quality failures in terms of measurement and quality failures in the treatment plant as top events in gutenberg they used logical gates to model the risks of water supply through the markov process stein et al 2017 investigated the widespread use of the fta and stated that the fta could be used as a decision support system to identify the relationships among the underlying events and their effects on the top event in water treatment plants for the first time using the fta babaei et al 2018 provided a unique structure for the risk assessment of the adequacy equity and efficiency of water delivery in agricultural water delivery systems considering unfavorable supply and delivery as the top event then the factors leading to the occurrence of this unfavorable event including natural hazards and human and operational threats were considered to be basic and intermediate events in the fta structure ozga zielinski et al 2018 used methods such as the fault tree method ftm event tree method etm risk matrix and ranking method in a portion of the upper sola river catchment in poland for assessing hazard risk and losses connected with the occurrence of such events are suggested to improve flood risk management and enhance the capacity to safeguard against such events by improving current flood protection protocols reviewing previous studies shows that so far there has been no research in the area of risk assessment of river basins using fta furthermore the probabilistic approach of fta has not been used to achieve a comprehensive and integrated indicator that includes effective factors in the river basins weight aggregation and averaging methods which are used in previous works to indicate the importance of the indicators cannot specifically address the entire basin for this reason the risk indicators discussed in this study are used for the first time to analyze comprehensive and multidimensional risk of river basin failures the comprehensive approach is presented for urmia lake basin which is one of the most important river basins in iran due to the several issues such as water shortages inadequate water quality ecological hazards and economic and social damages urmia lake basin requires a comprehensive assessment to identify its vulnerable aspects in order to perform a successful risk management plan to establish a comprehensive index for assessing the lake failure risk in the urmia lake basin using the fta the factors provided by various researchers as well as recognized organizations such as world wide fund for nature wwf and the german investment and development co deg were used the overall framework proposed in this study can be used as a comprehensive measure for decision makers to improve the status of the main and secondary catchment areas in terms of economic social political environmental and other aspects indeed not only they can compare the river basins in terms of calculated risk values but also they can focus on reducing the occurrence probability of the top event using corrective actions based on the measuring the importance of the basic events or even of the intermediate events which increases the reliability of the river basin 2 methodology 2 1 study area in this study the urmia lake basin located in iran was selected for comprehensive failure risk assessment the basin of urmia lake in northwest of iran with an area of 51 762 km2 is one of the six major river basins in iran the urmia lake is surrounded by west azerbaijan province with a total area of 24 681 km2 east azerbaijan province with a total area of 22 488 km2 and kurdistan province with an area of 4 593 km2 the urmia lake is one of the largest lakes in iran and is one of the most permanent hypersaline lakes in the world zarghami 2011 azarnivand et al 2015 due to its natural and ecological characteristics urmia lake has been designated as a national park since 1967 it is also the second largest habitat of a unique artemia species in the world the urmia lake basin considered to be one of the most ecologically socially unique areas has suffered a severe drop in lake levels in recent years due to climate change and poor water resources management alipour 2006 banihabib et al 2015 in the current situation due to the drought of a significant part of the lake very difficult conditions have been created for the survival of plant and animal species of this lake and in some cases such as artemia their life is in danger because of the high salinity of the lake water the overall location of urmia lake and the basin s boundary are shown in fig 1 various human and natural factors such as implementation of various water resources development projects increasing agricultural water use changing the cropping pattern production of high water consumption agricultural products in the river basin low productivity of water and the lack of effective protection of the environmental and ecological resources of the river basin on one hand and climate fluctuations and the reduction of precipitation and runoff in the catchment area on the other hand have resulted in such a condition for the largest lake in iran based upon the existing evidence as well as experiences from other lakes with similar status worldwide the persistence of drought in urmia lake will undoubtedly cause many damages to the health of inhabitants in this area and the ecosystem of the region the process shown in this fig 2 will be used to formulate a general fta in the river basin scale to achieve a comprehensive risk index and to improve the planning for risk management 2 2 risk assessment methods risk is the occurrence probability of an unfavorable event risk assessment is a systematic effort to identify and deal with a natural an unnatural human made and operational management issues improper design lack of long term planning etc threats and hazards by analyzing each threat the probability of occurrence and the damage from the threat can be determined in case of occurrence 2 3 fault tree analysis 2 3 1 quantitative analysis of basic events and top event fta is a deductive top down approach based on system failure and as an analogous approach begins with an unfavorable event the top event and then the causes are determined using a systematic reverse process in other words the fta based on a logical diagram by introducing the relationships between the basic events and the top event and providing a quantitative analysis of the system shows the failure probability and calculates the degree of system reliability al saleem 2007 the events and symbols used in the fta are defined as follows intermediate event this event is placed between the top event and the basic events which is found at the output of a gate transfer out indicates that a part of the tree must be connected to the same symbol transfer in represents the transfer of a part of the fta to another location the gates define the logic in the fta and relate the basic events to the intermediate events and eventually to the top event if the simultaneous failure of two event results in a higher event failure the gate and and if the failure of at least one of them leads to a higher event failure the gate or will be used for their connection for example in fig 3 the failure of d is considered to be the top event the gate or is used between the two failures of b and c however the gate and is seen between the failures of events of b or c and a fta calculations are based on boolean rules in the calculation of the top event the basic events are connected to each other and to the intermediate events using logical and and or gates therefore to calculate the top event and and or gates are calculated using eq 1 and 2 respectively 1 p i 1 n p i 2 p 1 i 1 n 1 p i where p is the probability of each basic event i is a counter and n is the number of incoming events connected to the gate 2 3 2 corrective actions to reduce the occurrence probability and severity of the top event if the probability of the top event obtained from the preceding step is satisfactory the fta process is over but if it is unsatisfactory it is necessary to reduce the occurrence probability of the top event using corrective actions in fact the system will enter the risk management phase one of the most useful tools in this field is to measure the importance of the basic events or even of the intermediate events which increases the reliability of the system many indices have been proposed in measuring the effectiveness of the lower events in order to investigate the distribution of failure in each subcategory quantitative qualitative ecological economic and social failures the birnbaum index bi was used in this study the bi is calculated from the eq 3 pan and tai 1988 3 bi q q i 1 q q i 0 in this equation q q i 1 is the function of the failure probability of a top event at the time when the failure of the i th event occurs entirely also q q i 0 is the function of the failure probability of a top event at the time when the failure of the i th event does not happen at all the higher this indicator the greater the effect of the basic event on the occurrence of the top event is 2 4 fault tree analysis of the studied area the effective criteria and indicators in the river basin are based on reports provided by reputable organizations such as wwf and deg published studies and experts opinions in all aspects of the threats including quantitative qualitative ecological economic and social 29 threats were identified to assess the water resources failure risk of urmia lake basin these threats were considered to be the fta basic events classified into operational human made and natural categories table 1 in this research 29 factors basin events have been evaluated in fta in which failure probability of 7 factors have been considered qualitatively based on experts opinions and other factors are calculated mathematically in majority of the fta related researches questionnaire is used and the basic events are mostly subjective but in this research a great effort has been made to implement the risk assessment by real and numerical data fig 4 shows the fta structure of the failure risk of urmia lake basin this failure risk top event will occur due to the occurrence of at least one of the quantitative qualitative ecological economic and social failures due to the wide fta developed in this study and in order to give details of each section each of the quantitative qualitative ecological economic and social failures of the urmia lake basin is described separately with a triangle symbol therefore basic events top event and logical gates in the fta structure are shown with be te and and or symbols respectively as well as intermediate events at level 1 with the symbol a level 2 with the symbol b level 3 with the symbol c and level 4 are displayed with the symbol d in fig 4 the probability of occurrence of the top event is obtained based on the probabilities assigned to the lower events to use logical gates there should be a deep understanding on the relationships between the intermediate and basic events otherwise the occurrence probability of the top event will not be similar to its actual value failure of water quantity failure of water quantity is one of the most important failures in the occurrence of the top event which is split into two sub divisions failure risk of water quantity due to water shortage occurs with at least one of the failures of destructive human factors or natural degradation factors most effective human factors in the lack of surface water and groundwater shortage in the studied basin are excessive construction of water structures water exports during water shortage excessive withdrawal of surface water and groundwater resources excessive production of high water consumed agricultural products losses due to the improper use of reservoirs and damaged water pipelines the phenomena such as hydrological and meteorological drought and climate change in the last decade are among the natural factors that have reduced surface runoff and precipitation and resulted in lake water loss and consequently shortage of water resources in the studied area fig 5 failure of water quality one of the reasons for the failure of the urmia lake basin is lack of quality surface water and groundwater resources contamination from domestic industrial and agricultural wastewater to surface water and groundwater sources reduce water quality one of the main reasons for reducing groundwater quality is the excessive drop of aquifer surface level due to unauthorized water withdrawal of wells and the construction of water structures which results in an increase in pollutants fig 6 ecological failures this failure is related to the threats to the habitat of various species in the lake basin the most important factor that threatens the environment of the urmia lake basin is the lack of environmental water right allocation in which the minimum required ecological balance for the survival of the biological species is not provided in addition contamination from domestics industrial and agricultural wastewater also undermine the environmental balance of the urmia lake basin fig 7 economic failures effective factors related to economic problems can be the reduction of water productivity in agriculture due to the lack of modern irrigation methods the inappropriate organization of agricultural soils and damaged water transfer systems lack of attention to the economic value of water as well as lack of financial supports fig 8 social failures the most important factors of social problems are low awareness of inhabitants in the river basin and inappropriate governance inappropriate governance stems from factors such as lack of proper planning for water supply and water demand and applying inappropriate water laws in the lake basin fig 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 failure probability of basic events the occurrence probabilities of basic events were calculated on the basis of a short term 10 year period for critical situations and a long term 40 year period for the normal situation inappropriate cultivation pattern the agricultural products that consume a lot of water in the urmia lake basin are apples sugar beet potatoes tomatoes wheat and barley which have significant exports the amount of excess consumption generated by high consumption products in the urmia lake basin in the short term is 1719 mcm hadinejad 2016 and the total agricultural consumption in these years is 5356 mcm hadinejad 2016 hence these products enter a failure risk at the entire area the probability of failure due to the inappropriate cultivating pattern in the entire urmia lake basin in the last 10 years can be obtained using eq 4 by excessive water use due to inappropriate cultivation pattern ec to total agricultural water ta 4 p b e 1 e c ta improper management of virtual water virtual water is the volume of water that an agricultural or non agricultural product consumes in the production process generally some part of the water consumed in the production process has no physical presence in the final product to calculate the probability of a failure due to improper management of virtual water the water export is a defect for the studied river basin thus the average amount of water exported from the urmia lake basin ae in the short term is 1320 mcm hadinejad 2016 and the total agricultural consumption ta in these years is 5356 mcm hadinejad 2016 the probability of virtual water failure in the urmia lake basin in the last 10 years is calculated using eq 5 5 p b e 2 a e t a inappropriate water prices low water price in the present condition of urmia lake basin modern semi traditional and traditional water network tariffs are equal to three two and one percent of the value of the planted products determining a reasonable price for water has the privilege those consumers would not consider water as free products and they will try to save it today the plan for achieving self sufficiency in food production in one hand and the shortage in water resources need optimal utilization of water with regard to eq 6 the probability of failure due to the inappropriate water price is calculated by the price of producing agricultural water pa 0 012 to the price of agricultural water for the farmers in the urmia lake basin pf 0 02 yasi et al 2016 thus 6 p be 3 p a p f p a excessive construction of dams dams reduce the volume of runoff to the lake from 3900 mcm to 1600 mcm this volume equals to 42 of the flows into urmia lake through rivers of which 16 is related to the increase in water requirements and 26 to the decrease of surface water flow azizi et al 2017 with regard to eq 7 the probability of failure due to the excessive construction of dams is calculated by production runoff due to dam construction in the river basin for short term period rs and production runoff due to dam construction in the river basin for the long term period rl thus 7 p be 4 r l r s r l unauthorized water withdrawal of wells the volume of water exploited from unauthorized wells and quenches

variable variables using a questionnaire where the probability of failure were evaluated as very low low moderate high and very high according to table 2 for each descriptive variable a probability value was assigned which using the arithmetic mean of experts opinions the failure probability of the remaining events was calculated lack of quality water for diverse species the entrance of pollutants and sewage into the urmia lake prevents providing reliable and suitable water for the aquatic species of this basin the failure probability of this event according to the experts for not having access to reliable water for aquatic organisms in urmia lake is 34 p be22 34 lack of adequate water for diverse species one of the features of an unfavorable ecosystem is the lack of adequate water for aquatic organisms according to experts the failure probability of this event is 43 p be23 43 lack of financial resources lack of financial support delays the implementation of lake recovery projects this is a major factor in failure of the lake and according to experts its failure probability is 40 p be24 40 flood risk since the flood risk is examined economically the flood damage that is likely to occur in the urmia lake basin should be investigated at first the basins with a potential flood damage were identified 34 of sub basins in the west azerbaijan and 19 of the sub basins in east azerbaijan had experienced damages by occurring floods thus according to experts opinion the failure probability of this event is 28 p be26 28 inappropriate using of agricultural soils this factor in the case of occurrence causes a decrease in water productivity in the agricultural sector and its failure probability is 33 according to the experts p be27 33 low awareness level of inhabitants in the river basins one of the most important reasons for the social failure of the river basin is the lack of information and awareness in the river basin knowledge of people about river basin values and their threats is essential for basin management therefore raising public awareness is a priority to prevent the failure of the urmia lake basin hence institutions in charge of management must upgrade their capacities to carry out their work due to lack of sufficient awareness of inhabitants in the river basin which according to the experts opinions the failure probability was 45 p be28 45 inappropriate governance inappropriate governance in the urmia lake basin can be due to inappropriate laws as well as lack of proper management of water supply and demand this factor is one of the main factors in the social failure of the river basin according to the experts the failure probability is 55 p be29 55 3 3 the risk assessment model and quantitative analysis of the water resources failure risk of urmia lake basin the probabilities derived from experts opinions and the data and statistics of recent years for the study area are shown in table 3 the open fta software was used to calculate the probability of the top event the probabilities shown in table 3 were introduced as input data into the software the software then implemented and or logical gates to calculate the river basin failure risk according to table 4 the failure probability of the quantitative qualitative ecological economic and social events was 0 119 0 43 0 0172 0 06 and 0 75 respectively eventually the probability of the water resources failure risk of urmia lake basin as the top event was obtained 88 6 the results show that the social failure event has the highest probability of failure in the urmia lake basin due to the high probability of the top event it is necessary to investigate the effectiveness of each basic event based on its contribution to the occurrence of the top event after identifying the most effective factors it is possible to control and improve these factors by considering corrective actions 3 4 investigating the contribution of the basic events to the occurrence of the top event tables 5 10 show the scoring of the basic events given their impact on the occurrence of the top event and the quantitative qualitative ecological economic and social failures the larger the bi the basic event will have a greater effect on the top event according to table 5 events 29 28 15 16 13 14 26 are of the most influential events in the water resources failure risk of urmia lake basin subsequently the contribution of each basic event to the quantitative qualitative ecological economic and social failures were separately examined for checking the influence of the events of their upper events the values of bi for the quantitative failure events in table 6 show that the meteorological drought event has had the greatest effect in the shortage of water resources in the urmia lake basin table 7 shows that the most effective events related to qualitative failure are entrance of industrial and domestic wastewater to groundwater and entrance of agricultural wastewater to groundwater based on their contribution to the occurrence of the top event the environmental status of urmia lake has undergone a downward trend in recent years in spite of its all aspects of geology economics social water resources and climate consequently these negative impacts will lead to the destruction of the ecosystem in the river basin currently many of the ecological and socioeconomic functions of urmia lake and its marginal wetlands are impaired tangible and intangible damages due to this disorder will affect not only to the nature of the region but also to local livelihoods and human societies therefore a long term planning to maintain the ecological balance of the study area is inevitable according to the events shown in table 8 lack of environmental water right allocation and erosion events have the highest share in the ecological failure of urmia lake in table 9 lack of financial support will delay the implementation of urmia lake restoration which can result in a failure in urmia lake recovery projects inappropriate regional planning lack of codified laws in the lake area lack of land use planning despite the existence of planning documents as well as low awareness level of inhabitant in the river basin are of the most important reasons for the current situation in table 10 low awareness level of inhabitants in the river basin is shown as the most effective event in the occurrence of social failure in urmia lake basin 4 conclusions in this study a comprehensive risk assessment model is proposed for managing river basins using fta fault tree analysis fta is a top down deductivefailure analysis in which an undesired state of a system is analyzed the purpose of the failure risk assessment of a river basin was to assess the threatening factors in terms of water quantity water quality ecological economic and social status of the river basin considering the failure risk of the river basin as an unfavorable event at the top of the fta 29 factors contributed to the failure of the urmia lake basin which is one of the most important and under tension river basins in iran were identified based on the indicators provided by organizations such as wwf and deg available 40 year period statistics and information and the views of experts in the field the probabilistic values of the basic events were analyzed by using opn fta software according to the results the lake failure risk is 88 6 due to the high occurrence probability of failure of the top event the effectiveness of each basic event was investigated based on its contribution to the occurrence of the top event using bi which its result is useful to risk management after scoring all the basic events inappropriate governance low awareness level of inhabitants in the river basin and entrance of industrial and domestic wastewater to groundwater events have the highest influence in the risk of urmia lake basin based on the bi among all quantitative and qualitative failures the social failure is the most effective event in the occurrence of the top event due to its high score by improving the data accuracy the final results of this paper can be changed but the presented methodology is novel and applicable in other river basins as the future study it is suggested that uncertainties arising from experts opinions will be modeled using fuzzy logic or fta conversion to the bayesian network and the results will be compared with the findings of this study applying other useful techniques such as event tree analysis method for risk assessment of river basins is also suggested declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

large number of parameters such as precipitation temperature evapotranspiration land use and is characterized by nonlinear relationship between streamflow and the characteristics of its watershed streamflow prediction models can be classified as physically based models and data driven models physically based models are data intensive and require extensive variety of parameters based on rainfall amount intensity and distribution physiographic characteristics of the watershed land use and human activities ochoa tocachi et al 2016 teutschbein et al 2018 however a reliable model performance is not always ensured depending on the study area and specific purpose these parameters are not easily obtained and it is extremely hard to procure accurate and adequate data for many watersheds which leads to poor model performance ragettli et al 2014 data driven models present linear or nonlinear relationships between streamflow and its parameters mathematically yaseen et al 2015 2016 zhang et al 2018 the least squares ls multiple linear regression mlr autoregressive ar moving average ma autoregressive moving average arma and stepwise cluster analysis sca as well as their variants are approaches often used in data driven models fan et al 2016 tootle et al 2007 these approaches assume that a linear relationship exists between the input and output of these models as a result their output is mostly poor without the important information hidden in the nonlinear relationship in the last decades artificial intelligence ai models such as artificial neural networks anns adaptive neural fuzzy inference systems anfiss model tree mt multivariate adaptive regression splines mars support vector machines svm genetic algorithm ga and their hybrid models have been successfully applied in streamflow prediction al sudani et al 2019 kalteh 2015 nourani et al 2011 yarar 2014 yaseen et al 2018a these models are helpful in identifying the inherent nonlinearity in streamflow process sharda et al 2008 reported that the mars method is a promising new method of short term runoff forecasting for hilly watersheds adamowski et al 2012 used the mars method for the streamflow prediction and indicated that mars models have potential to accurately predict streamflow in mountainous watersheds with limited data adnan et al 2017 found that mars method provided better prediction results than conventional multiple linear regression method in monthly river flow prediction park et al 2017 analyzed groundwater potential using two different models logistic regression lr and mars the authors concluded that the mars model is useful and effective for groundwater potential analysis in buyeo gun chungcheongnam do korea in the last decades m5 model tree m5t has been used in many hydrological problems bhattacharya and solomatine 2005 successfully applied m5t to model water level discharge relationship stravs and brilly 2007 used m5t method to predict streamflows of several tributaries of sava river the authors indicated that m5t approach is useful for streamflow prediction during rainless periods sattari et al 2013 used m5t algorithm to predict daily streamflow in sohu stream turkey the authors presented that m5t performs well for the streamflow prediction adnan et al 2018 used least square support vector machine lssvm fuzzy genetic algorithm fga and m5t for forecasting streamflows of poorly gauged mountainous watershed using climatic data from nearby station yaseen et al 2018b applied extreme learning machine elm model for streamflow forecasting the authors concluded that the random initialization of the internal hidden layer weights is a basic weakness of elm algorithm the performance of elm model can be improved by incorporation of more reliable features as attributes yaseen et al 2019 in op elm however more robust model can be obtained compared to standard elm due to the pruning procedure of the neurons rezaie balf and kisi 2018 explored the performances of evolutionary polynomial regression epr multilayer perceptron neural network mlpnn and optimally pruned extreme learning machine op elm in forecasting daily streamflow using data from three different stations located on the tajan river of iran sudheer et al 2013 applied particle swarm optimization pso algorithm to choose svm parameters and developed a hybrid svm pso model for forecasting monthly streamflow in the recent years anfis pso has only been applied in a few hydrological problems khosravi et al 2018 used anfis pso for the spatial prediction of groundwater spring potential mapping at the koohdasht nourabad plain lorestan province iran in these papers ai data driven models have been demonstrated to be effective approach for streamflow prediction and possess significant advantages over physically based models such as simpler model structures lower data requirements and shorter development cycles the objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the potential of several heuristic models including optimally pruned extreme learning machine adaptive neural fuzzy inference system with particle swarm optimization and multivariate adaptive regression splines for streamflow prediction in fijiang river china 2 to evaluate different predictors including flow patterns and combined flow and precipitation patterns from local data and data of nearby upstream station 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study for the present study fujiang river originated from songpan sichuan province china was selected as a case study the river basin located at upper reach of yangtze river with a drainage area of 28 901 km2 fujiang river presents a narrow and long foliage basin the widest part of the basin is 135 km whereas the narrowest point is about 30 km runoff in river mainly concentrated in june october accounting for 72 5 of the total annual runoff the dry season of the river is from december to april accounting for l2 1 of the total annual runoff from january to march it was the lowest accounting for only 5 87 of the annual total runoff in fujiang river basin mainly comes from precipitation thus in the present study two hydro climatic stations on fujiang river basin namely fujiangqiao and shehang were used for prediction of daily streamflow see fig 1 the data used in the present study were extracted from hydrological yearbooks of the people s republic of china table 1 gives the brief statistical information of the precipitation and streamflow data employed in the current work m1 m2 and m3 in the table indicate three different data sets used in cross validation process it is clear from the table 1 that both precipitation and streamflow have highly skewed distribution especially for the fijiangqiao station precipitation data of m1 and m2 have the lowest and highest skewed distributions respectively while the streamflows of the m3 and m1 have the lowest and highest skewness it is apparent from table 1 that the m1 m2 and m3 have different data ranges 2 2 soft computing models models based on soft computing techniques are commonly applied to estimate hydrological processes due to their favorable accuracy and computational efficiency kisi 2007 zounemat kermani and teshnehlab 2008 in this study four different types of soft computing models namely 1 optimally pruned extreme learning machine 2 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system with pso algorithm 3 multivariate adaptive regression splines and 4 m5 model tree are evaluated for predicting stream flow as a non linear hydrological event brief descriptions for each of the aforementioned models are given below 2 2 1 op elm based on the structure of a single layer feed forward neural network slfn the original version of the extreme learning machine elm algorithm was introduced by huang et al 2006 in the elm choosing process of the synaptic weights of the hidden neurons is much quicker than a normal slfn model by using complexity reduction algorithms e g least angle regression lars hence the computational cost for training of the elm model is reduced miche et al 2010 assume that there is a dataset of m observations x i y i to be used as training samples with x i r d 1 represents the input vector and y i r d 2 as the output vector then it would be possible to define an slfn with n hidden neurons as the following sum 1 i 1 n Œ≤ i f x j c i a i 1 j m where a i c i are the biases and synaptic weights belonged to learning parameters of the hidden nodes f is considered as the transfer or activation function and Œ≤ i are the weights connecting ith hidden node to the output node it is worth noting that in a standard slfn model adjusting of the weights and biases can be done using the least square optimization technique ls nonetheless in the elm there is no need for adjusting the weights and biases of hidden nodes by the ls method in elm the random values for weights and biases are tuned using the following equilibrium 2 i 1 n Œ≤ i f x j c i a i y j 1 j m in general the form of f x j c i a i radial basis activation function might be applied in eq 2 where c i are the centers and a i are the spreads or radii of the ith node assume Œ≤ Œ≤ 1 t Œ≤ n t and y y 1 t y m t as a result of eq 2 can be rewritten as 3 h Œ≤ y with 4 h c 1 c n a 1 a n x 1 x n f x 1 c 1 a 1 f x 1 c n a n f x m c 1 a 1 f x m c n a n where Œ≤ denotes the output weights of the slfn and h represents a matrix associated to the hidden layer output which is created in a random way in this regard the output weights can be calculated as 5 Œ≤ h y where h is known as the moore penrose inverse of the h matrix rong et al 2008 miche et al 2010 as for the learning stage in elm the number of neurons in the hidden layer of activation functions has to be determined in the standard elm this process might end up to generate too large number of hidden nodes and lead to overfitting of the training phase nevertheless the elm algorithm might not act very efficiently when irrelevant or highly correlated data are entered as input variables accordingly rong et al 2008 proposed a developed form of elm named pruned extreme learning machine p elm for classification problems later miche et al 2010 presented the optimally pruned elm op elm for modelling both classification and regression problems in short the pruning procedure of the neurons in p elm and op elm makes the standard elm more robust op elm models are built in three stages of 1 construction 2 ranking of the neurons in the hidden layer and 3 making decision on how many neurons are pruned based on leave one out error method detailed information about the theory and application of op elm can be found at huang et al 2006 miche et al 2010 there are several successful reports in literature on the application of elm in hydrological modelling such as evaporation modelling deo et al 2016 groundwater fluctuation prediction alizamir et al 2018 daily runoff forecasting niu et al 2018 and water level prediction in lakes shiri et al 2016 2 2 2 anfis pso the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis is known as a soft computing learning method it is structured like an adaptive multi layer feed forward neural network with antecedent and conclusion sections which are connected to each other by fuzzy rules jang 1993 normally anfis uses a hybrid learning process that employs the learning process of neural networks to find adjustable parameters of the fuzzy system this learning process consists of a forward pass using the least squares method to identify the consequent parameters and a backward pass using the gradient descent technique for updating the premise parameters however it is possible to integrate heuristic optimization methods with the standard version of anfis for having a more efficient structure vafaei et al 2015 among all the well known heuristic algorithms such as swarm intelligence systems genetic algorithm and tabu search the pso algorithm is known as one of the best and efficient algorithm for computational optimizing pso is a global swarm optimization algorithm which is inspired from the movement behavior of flocks of birds or school of fish cheng and jin 2015 pso is also considered as an evolutionary optimization technique suitable for continues and discontinues decision making problems the pso algorithm can be applied to improve the performance of the standard anfis by tuning the parameters related to the membership functions of the fuzzy inference system in this respect an integrated anfis model with particle swarm optimization heuristic algorithm anfis pso is applied to stream flow prediction in pso each potential solution is known as a swarm which is a particle of the population during an iteration procedure it is aimed to reach to the optimal respond for the optimizing problem at first a swarm of particles with random position x i t 0 in the d dimensional hyperspace is initialized d denotes number of variables the goal is to guide each particle to its best position x i t 1 on the next iteration by the aid of particle s velocity v i t 1 over a solution space the best previous position of each particle is named pbest while the name of the best particle in the swarm is gbest velocity and position of each particle can be updated as follows 6 v i t 1 w v i t œÅ 1 x pbes t i x i t 1 œÅ 2 x gbest x i t 1 7 x i t 1 x i t v i t 1 eq 6 describes the velocity v i t update rule whereas eq 7 explains the x i t update rule in these equations w denotes an inertia weight and œÅ 1 and œÅ 2 are random variables the iteration process will be continued either for specified epochs or until reaching a predetermined convergence criterion 2 2 3 mars the multivariate adaptive regression splines mars is a non linear and non parametric regression method which can simulate the nonlinear relationship between input and output parameters by the aid of piecewise linear splines flexible regression models are produced using the mars models so that the solution space is divided into several intervals of independent parameters input vector of the model while individual splines are fit to each interval friedman 1991 two main stages should be considered for setting up the mars model including forward constructing the model and backward a pruning procedure stages in the forward step a potentially over fitted multivariate regression model with several knots is created for each interval a spline function separate piecewise linear segments with different slopes between two knots is defined the general structure of the mars model with m functions can be described as the following form 8 f x Œ¥ 0 m 1 m Œ¥ m h m x in eq 8 h m x represents spline functions Œ¥ 0 Œ¥ m are coefficient that can be estimated through the minimum sum of squared errors from splines functions in the backward step the pruning procedure is employed to regulate the created regression structure by removing redundant knots further details of the mars method can be obtained from the original study of friedman 1991 and more recent work of deo et al 2017 2 2 4 m5 model tree model trees are soft computing approaches which provide a tree shaped structural representation of the dataset by fitting piecewise linear regressions to some split sub categories of the dataset ghasemi et al 2018 m5 model tree is one of the most commonly used model trees in m5 model tree multi dimensional parameter space is split into some sub spaces afterwards a linear regression model is built for each subspace at the terminal nodes leaves of the tree the splitting process of the m5 model tree is based on the standard deviation reduction sdr criterion at each node as follows 9 sdr s d m m i m s d m i where m denotes the training dataset before splitting mi denotes the subset of examples that have the ith outcome of the potential set and sd stands for the standard deviation the m5 model would choose the one split structure that maximizes the expected sdr however this process often ends up to create an overgrown and over fitted tree like structure to cope with the over fitting problem the tree is pruned in a backward stage pal and deswal 2009 3 application and results the study compares the accuracy of four different meta heuristic methods op elm anfis pso mars m5tree in prediction of daily streamflows using various combinations of precipitation and streamflow data the results are also compared with feed forward neural networks ffnn and multi linear regression mlr first three previous streamflow q inputs i qt 1 ii qt 1 and qt 2 and iii qt 1 qt 2 and qt 3 are tried as inputs to the mars method to predict current q qt then precipitation p inputs are added to the best q combination iv qt 1 qt 2 and pt v qt 1 qt 2 pt and pt 1 and vi qt 1 qt 2 pt pt 1 and pt 2 finally the six methods are compared with each other for the optimal input obtained from mars method the following statistics are used for evaluation of the applied models 10 r o o t m e a n s q u a r e e r r o r r m s e i 1 n q io q ic 2 n 11 n a s h s u t c l i f f e e f f i c i e n c y n s e 1 i 1 n q io q ic 2 i 1 n q io q o 2 12 c o m b i n e d a c c u r a c y c a 0 33 r m s e m a e 1 r 2 where n is number of data q o is observed q q i c is calculated q q i o is observed q mae is mean absolute error and r2 is determination coefficient ca is the combined accuracy which was recently used by eray et al 2018 eray et al 2018 applied the ca criterion in their study which combines the rmse mae and r2 and provides general evaluation for the employed models similar to the ideal point error dom√≠nguez et al 2011 test statistics of the mars models using various combinations of q and p in daily streamflow prediction of fijiangqiao station are summed up in table 2 it is apparent from the average statistics that the mars model whose inputs are qt 1 qt 2 and pt has the best accuracy adding previous p inputs does not increase model accuracy in prediction of daily streamflow table 3 compares the test accuracy of anfis pso op elm ffnn mlr m5tree and mars using input combination of qt 1 qt 2 and pt for the op elm models various kernel types e g linear sigmoid gaussian linear sigmoid linear gaussian and linear sigmoid gaussian were tried and the linear linear sigmoid gaussian and linear sigmoid provided the best predictions for the m1 m2 and m3 data sets respectively for the anfis pso 25 and 50 populations and 100 500 1000 and 2000 generations were tried for the ffnn levenberg marquardt algorithm was employed with 10 000 iterations and hidden node numbers were tried from 2 to 20 average statistics in table 3 reveal that the op elm has the lowest rmse 155 m3 s ca 69 4 and the highest nse 0 751 followed by the anfis pso mars ffnn mlr and m5tree models mlr has the lowest accuracy in predicting daily streamflow linear structure of this method might be the main reason for this all the methods provide the worst predictions for the m1 data set while the m3 gives the best results this can be explained by the fact that the m1 streamflow data set has the highest skewness while the lowest skewness belongs to the m3 the other reason for the worst accuracy of the m1 may be the higher range of this data set compared to m2 and m3 in fijiangqiao station in other words the minimum and maximum q values of the m1 are lower and higher than those of the m2 and m3 sets this may cause extrapolation difficulties for the applied models kisi and aytek 2013 kisi and parmar 2016 the model predictions are shown in figs 2 and 3 in the forms of hydrograph and scatterplot it is observed from the hydrograph graphs especially from the detail graphs the op elm predictions have better agreement with the observed ones compared to other models m5tree and mlr models have the worst streamflow predictions the mlr cannot catch the highly nonlinear behavior of the streamflow phenomenon and provides considerable underestimations test accuracies of the mars models with respect to different input combinations and data sets of shehang station are compared in table 2 as observed from the table the best accuracy belongs to input combination iii however there is a slight difference between the combinations iii and ii and therefore latter one comprising qt 1 and qt 2 was selected as the best q input combination adding p input does not increase model performance in prediction of daily streamflow test accuracies of the anfis pso op elm m5tree ffnn mlr and mars are reported in table 3 for the input combination of qt 1 and qt 2 for the op elm models the same kernel functions selected for the previous station also provided the best predictions for the m1 m2 and m3 data sets in this station it is apparent from the table that the anfis pso has the lowest rmse 293 m3 s mae 102 m3 s ca 130 and the highest nse 0 735 followed by the op elm mars ffnn m5tree and mlr here also the m5tree or mlr has the worst performance similar to the fujiamgqiao the best and worst accuracies belong to the m3 and m1 data sets similar reasons explaining the difference between m1 and m3 are also valid for this station figs 4 and 5 illustrates the streamflow predictions of four methods in the test period it is apparent from the graphs especially from the detail graphs that the anfis pso predictions closer to the observed streamflows compared to other three models here also the worst predictions obtained from the mlr and m5tree models in table 4 the mars models with different input combinations are compared for prediction of daily streamflow of shehang station using data from upstream station fujiamgqiao here in the first three combinations streamflow q data of upstream station are used and the precipitation p data of upstream are added to the optimal q combination the last combination vi is obtained by including the optimal input combination of the shehang station qt 1 and qt 2 it is observed from table 4 that the input combination v involving inputs of qt 1 qt 2 pt and pt 1 provides the best accuracy among the first five combinations it should be noted that the local data are not used in this case this may be useful in case of missing data in the downstream station moreover input combination vi has the highest accuracy which indicates that including downstream local data considerably improves model accuracy decrease in rmse from 255 m3 s to 219 m3 s by 14 mae from 108 m3 s to 86 2 m3 s by 20 ca from 118 to 101 by 14 and increase in nse from 0 791 to 0 852 by 8 table 5 compares the performances of the anfis pso op elm mars ffnn mlr and m5tree in test stage using the optimal inputs obtained from table 4 for the op elm models linear sigmoid linear sigmoid and linear sigmoid gaussian kernels gave the best predictions for the m1 m2 and m3 data sets respectively it is observed from the table that the op elm over performs the other models in predicting daily streamflow of shehang using data from upstream fujiamgqiao mars and anfis pso have similar rmse mae and ca while the latter model performs better with respect to nse here also the worst performance belongs to mlr models the relative rmse and nse differences between the op elm and anfis pso are 12 and 5 figs 6 and 7 compares the predictions of applied methods in the test period it is clearly observed from the figures that the op elm provides better streamflow predictions than the other three models using data from upstream station ghorbania et al 2018 applied local prediction model lpm and multigene genetic programming mggp for prediction of daily streamflows they utilized phase space reconstruction parameters of delay time and embedding dimension for identifying the optimal inputs and the lpg and mggp models provided nse of 0 776 and 0 766 for the eherchay station iran in the test stage respectively in the current study the nse ranges of the optimal op elm models were calculated as 0 770 0 807 and 0 674 0 733 for the fujiangqiao and shehang stations respectively hwang et al 2012 used lssvm ffnn and mlr models for forecasting daily streamflow time series data from south korea and they found r2 of 0 771 0 696 and 0 679 for the corresponding methods respectively in the presented study the optimal op elm models had 0 821 and 0 713 for the fujiangqiao and shehang stations respectively all these suggest that the op elm model could be successfully applied for daily streamflow prediction 4 conclusion this study evaluated the prediction accuracy of novel op elm method for predicting daily streamflows of two hydro climatic stations shehang and fujiangqiao of fujiang river by comparing with anfis pso mars ffnn m5tree and mlr methods using cross validation technique in the 1st part of the study mars method was applied to hydro climatic datasets of both stations to determine the best input combination with less prediction error based on the application the input combination consisting of previous two time lags of streamflow and precipitation at time t provided the best prediction accuracy for fujiangqiao station whereas in case of shehang station it was found that precipitation inputs did not affect the prediction accuracy of the model thus for shehang station the input combination comprising previous two time lags values of streamflow dataset was selected as the best after determining the best input combination for both stations using mars method op elm anfis pso ffnn mlr and m5t methods were applied to compare the prediction accuracy of the selected methods for the fujiangqiao shehang stations it was found that the op elm and anfis pso outperformed the other methods in predicting streamflow it was also found that m5tree and mlr provided the worst prediction results due to their linear structures for the op elm method various kernel types were tried and the linear linear sigmoid gaussian and linear sigmoid provided the best predictions for the both stations in 2nd part of the study the selected models were evaluated for estimating streamflows of downstream station shehang using hydro climatic data of upstream fujiangqiao station in this part after application of mars model the best input combination for shehang station was found as qt 1 qt 2 pt and pt 1 comparison of six methods revealed that the op elm provided the best accuracy the op elm reduced the prediction error of anfis pso by 12 it was also found that including local data highly improves the prediction accuracy it can be concluded that the op elm outperformed the other models and could be successfully utilized in prediction and estimation of daily streamflows the authors found that the applied models using the nearby gauging station data for training generated more accurate results than the locally trained models thus the authors suggest that the applied methods could be successfully utilized in streamflow prediction studies when local data are unavailable or unreliable especially in ungauged or data scarce basins despite of the successful application of these hybrid models in this study and in previous literature it is recommended to couple these hybrid models with discrete wavelet transform singular spectrum analysis and empirical mode decomposition preprocessing techniques for denoising the streamflow data in future studies this study was limited for stream flow of sub basin of the yangtze river basin further studies are suggested to cover other sub basins of yangtze river basin so that better forecasting pictures of the whole basin can be made declaration of interest statement all authors have seen and approved the final version of the manuscript being submitted they warrant that the article is the authors original work hasn t received prior publication and isn t under

large number of parameters such as precipitation temperature evapotranspiration land use and is characterized by nonlinear relationship between streamflow and the characteristics of its watershed streamflow prediction models can be classified as physically based models and data driven models physically based models are data intensive and require extensive variety of parameters based on rainfall amount intensity and distribution physiographic characteristics of the watershed land use and human activities ochoa tocachi et al 2016 teutschbein et al 2018 however a reliable model performance is not always ensured depending on the study area and specific purpose these parameters are not easily obtained and it is extremely hard to procure accurate and adequate data for many

the people s republic of china table 1 gives the brief statistical information of the precipitation and streamflow data employed in the current work m1 m2 and m3 in the table indicate three different

inference system with pso algorithm 3 multivariate adaptive regression splines and 4 m5 model tree are evaluated for predicting stream flow as a non linear hydrological event brief descriptions for each of the aforementioned models are given below 2 2 1 op elm based on the structure of a single layer feed forward neural network slfn the original version of the extreme learning machine elm algorithm was introduced by huang et al 2006 in the elm choosing process of the synaptic weights of the hidden neurons is much quicker than a normal slfn model by using complexity reduction algorithms e g least angle regression lars hence the computational cost for training of the elm model is reduced miche et al 2010 assume that there is a dataset of m observations x i y i to be used as training samples with x i r d 1 represents the input vector and y i r d 2 as the output vector then it would be possible to define an slfn with n hidden neurons as the following sum 1 i 1 n Œ≤ i f x j c i a i 1 j m where a i c i are the biases and synaptic weights belonged to learning parameters of the hidden nodes f is considered as the transfer or activation function and Œ≤ i are the weights connecting ith hidden node to the output node it is worth noting that in a standard slfn model adjusting of the weights and biases can be done using the least square optimization technique ls nonetheless in the elm there is no need for adjusting the weights and biases of hidden nodes by the ls method in elm the random values for weights and biases are tuned using the following equilibrium 2 i 1 n Œ≤ i f x j c i a i y j 1 j m in general the form of f x j c i a i radial basis activation function might be applied in eq 2 where c i are the centers and a i are the spreads or radii of the ith node assume Œ≤ Œ≤ 1 t Œ≤ n t and y y 1 t y m t as a result of eq 2 can be rewritten as 3 h Œ≤ y with 4 h c 1 c n a 1 a n x 1 x n f x 1 c 1 a 1 f x 1 c n a n f x m c 1 a 1 f x m c n a n where Œ≤ denotes the output weights of the slfn and h represents a matrix associated to the hidden layer output which is created in a random way in this regard the output weights can be calculated as 5 Œ≤ h y where h is known as the moore penrose inverse of the h matrix rong et al 2008 miche et al 2010 as for the learning stage in elm the number of neurons in the hidden layer of activation functions has to be determined in the standard elm this process might end up to generate too large number of hidden nodes and lead to overfitting of the training phase nevertheless the elm algorithm might not act very efficiently when irrelevant or highly correlated data are entered as input variables accordingly rong et al 2008 proposed a developed form of elm named pruned extreme learning machine p elm for classification problems later miche et al 2010 presented the optimally pruned elm op elm for modelling both classification and regression problems in short the pruning procedure of the neurons in p elm and op elm makes the standard elm more robust op elm models are built in three stages of 1 construction 2 ranking of the neurons in the hidden layer and 3 making decision on how many neurons are pruned based on leave one out error method detailed information about the theory and application of op elm can be found at huang et al 2006 miche et al 2010 there are several successful reports in literature on the application of elm in hydrological modelling such as evaporation modelling deo et al 2016 groundwater fluctuation prediction alizamir et al 2018 daily runoff forecasting niu et al 2018 and water level prediction in lakes shiri et al 2016 2 2 2 anfis pso the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis is known as a soft computing learning method it is structured like an adaptive multi layer feed forward neural network with antecedent and conclusion sections which are connected to each other by fuzzy rules jang 1993 normally anfis uses a hybrid learning process that employs the learning process of neural networks to find adjustable parameters of the fuzzy system this learning process consists of a forward pass using the least squares method to identify the consequent parameters and a backward pass using the gradient descent technique for updating the premise parameters however it is possible to integrate heuristic optimization methods with the standard version of anfis for having a more efficient structure vafaei et al 2015 among all the well known heuristic algorithms such as swarm intelligence systems genetic algorithm and tabu search the pso algorithm is known as one of the best and efficient algorithm for computational optimizing pso is a global swarm optimization algorithm which is inspired from the movement behavior of flocks of birds or school of fish cheng and jin 2015 pso is also considered as an evolutionary optimization technique suitable for continues and discontinues decision making problems the pso algorithm can be applied to improve the performance of the standard anfis by tuning the parameters related to the membership functions of the fuzzy inference system in this respect an integrated anfis model with particle swarm optimization heuristic algorithm anfis pso is applied to stream flow prediction in pso each potential solution is known as a swarm which is a particle of the population during an iteration procedure it is aimed to reach to the optimal respond for the optimizing problem at first a swarm of particles with random position x i t 0 in the d dimensional hyperspace is initialized d denotes number of variables the goal is to guide each particle to its best position x i t 1 on the next iteration by the aid of particle s velocity v i t 1 over a solution space the best previous position of each particle is named pbest while the name of the best particle in the swarm is gbest velocity and position of each particle can be updated as follows 6 v i t 1 w v i t œÅ 1 x pbes t i x i t 1 œÅ 2 x gbest x i t 1 7 x i t 1 x i t v i t 1 eq 6 describes the velocity v i t update rule whereas eq 7 explains the x i t update rule in these equations w denotes an inertia weight and œÅ 1 and œÅ 2 are random variables the iteration process will be continued either for specified epochs or until reaching a predetermined convergence criterion 2 2 3 mars the multivariate adaptive regression splines mars is a non linear and non parametric regression method which can simulate the nonlinear relationship between input and output parameters by the aid of piecewise linear splines flexible regression models are produced using the mars models so that the solution space is divided into several intervals of independent parameters input vector of the model while individual splines are fit to each interval friedman 1991 two main stages should be considered for setting up the mars model including forward constructing the model and backward a pruning procedure stages in the forward step a potentially over fitted multivariate regression model with several knots is created for each interval a spline function separate piecewise linear segments with different slopes between two knots is defined the general structure of the mars model with m functions can be described as the following form 8 f x Œ¥ 0 m 1 m Œ¥ m h m x in eq 8 h m x represents spline functions Œ¥ 0 Œ¥ m are coefficient that can be estimated through the minimum sum of squared errors from splines functions in the backward step the pruning procedure is employed to regulate the created regression structure by removing redundant knots further details of the mars method can be obtained from the original study of friedman 1991 and more recent work of deo et al 2017 2 2 4 m5 model tree model trees are soft computing approaches which provide a tree shaped structural representation of the dataset by fitting piecewise linear regressions to some split sub categories of the dataset ghasemi et al 2018 m5 model tree is one of the most commonly used model trees in m5 model tree multi dimensional parameter space is split into some sub spaces afterwards a linear regression model is built for each subspace at the terminal nodes leaves of the tree the splitting process of the m5 model tree is based on the standard deviation reduction sdr criterion at each node as follows 9 sdr s d m m i m s d m i where m denotes the training dataset before splitting mi denotes the subset of examples that have the ith outcome of the potential set and sd stands for the standard deviation the m5 model would choose the one split structure that maximizes the expected sdr however this process often ends up to create an overgrown and over fitted tree like structure to cope with the over fitting problem the tree is pruned in a backward stage pal and deswal 2009 3 application and results the study compares the accuracy of four different meta heuristic methods op elm anfis pso mars m5tree in prediction of daily streamflows using various combinations of precipitation and streamflow data the results are also compared with feed forward neural networks ffnn and multi linear regression mlr first three previous streamflow q inputs i qt 1 ii qt 1 and qt 2 and iii qt 1 qt 2 and qt 3 are tried as inputs to the mars method to predict current q qt then precipitation p inputs are added to the best q combination iv qt 1 qt 2 and pt v qt 1 qt 2 pt and pt 1 and vi qt 1 qt 2 pt pt 1 and pt 2 finally the six methods are compared with each other for the optimal input obtained from mars method the following statistics are used for evaluation of the applied models 10 r o o t m e a n s q u a r e e r r o r r m s e i 1 n q io q ic 2 n 11 n a s h s u t c l i f f e e f f i c i e n c y n s e 1 i 1 n q io q ic 2 i 1 n q io q o 2 12 c o m b i n e d a c c u r a c

accuracy which was recently used by eray et al 2018 eray et al 2018 applied the ca criterion in their study which combines the rmse mae and r2 and provides general evaluation for the employed models similar to the ideal point error dom√≠nguez et al 2011 test statistics of the mars models using various combinations of q and p in daily streamflow prediction of fijiangqiao station are summed up in table 2 it is apparent from the average statistics that the mars model whose inputs are qt 1 qt 2 and pt has the best accuracy adding previous p inputs does not increase model accuracy in prediction of daily streamflow table 3 compares the test accuracy of anfis pso op elm ffnn mlr m5tree and mars using input combination of qt 1 qt 2 and pt for the op elm models various kernel types e g linear sigmoid gaussian linear sigmoid linear gaussian and linear sigmoid gaussian were tried and the linear linear sigmoid gaussian and linear sigmoid provided the best predictions for the m1 m2 and m3 data sets respectively for the anfis pso 25 and 50 populations and 100 500 1000 and 2000 generations were tried for the ffnn levenberg marquardt algorithm was employed with 10 000 iterations and hidden node numbers were tried from 2 to 20 average statistics in table 3 reveal that the op elm has the lowest rmse 155 m3 s ca 69 4 and the highest nse 0 751 followed by the anfis pso mars ffnn mlr and m5tree models mlr has the lowest accuracy in predicting daily streamflow linear structure of this method might be the main reason for this all the methods provide the worst predictions for the m1 data set while the m3 gives the best results this can be explained by the fact that the m1 streamflow data set has the highest skewness while the lowest skewness belongs to the m3 the other reason for the worst accuracy of the m1 may be the higher range of this data set compared to m2 and m3 in fijiangqiao station in other words the minimum and maximum q values of the m1 are lower and higher than those of the m2 and m3 sets this may cause extrapolation difficulties for the applied models kisi and aytek 2013 kisi and parmar 2016 the model predictions are shown in figs 2 and 3 in the forms of hydrograph and scatterplot it is observed from the hydrograph graphs especially from the detail graphs the op elm predictions have better agreement with the observed ones compared to other models m5tree and mlr models have the worst streamflow predictions the mlr cannot catch the highly nonlinear behavior of the streamflow phenomenon and provides considerable underestimations test accuracies of the mars models with respect to different input combinations and data sets of shehang station are compared in table 2 as observed from the table the best accuracy belongs to input combination iii however there is a slight difference between the combinations iii and ii and therefore latter one comprising qt 1 and qt 2 was selected as the best q input combination adding p input does not increase model performance in prediction of daily streamflow test accuracies of the anfis pso op elm m5tree ffnn mlr and mars are reported in table 3 for the input combination of qt 1 and qt 2 for the op elm models the same kernel functions selected for the previous station also provided the best predictions for the m1 m2 and m3 data sets in this station it is apparent from the table that the anfis pso has the lowest rmse 293 m3 s mae 102 m3 s ca 130 and the highest nse 0 735 followed by the op elm mars ffnn m5tree and mlr here also the m5tree or mlr has the worst performance similar to the fujiamgqiao the best and worst accuracies belong to the m3 and m1 data sets similar reasons explaining the difference between m1 and m3 are also valid for this station figs 4 and 5 illustrates the streamflow predictions of four methods in the test period it is apparent from the graphs especially from the detail graphs that the anfis pso predictions closer to the observed streamflows compared to other three models here also the worst predictions obtained from the mlr and m5tree models in table 4 the mars models with different input combinations are compared for prediction of daily streamflow of shehang station using data from upstream station fujiamgqiao here in the first three combinations streamflow q data of upstream station are used and the precipitation p data of upstream are added to the optimal q combination the last combination vi is obtained by including the optimal input combination of the shehang station qt 1 and qt 2 it is observed from table 4 that the input combination v involving inputs of qt 1 qt 2 pt and pt 1 provides the best accuracy among the first five combinations it should be noted that the local data are not used in this case this may be useful in case of missing data in the downstream station moreover input combination vi has the highest accuracy which indicates that including downstream local data considerably improves model accuracy decrease in rmse from 255 m3 s to 219 m3 s by 14 mae from 108 m3 s to 86 2 m3 s by 20 ca from 118 to 101 by 14 and increase in nse from 0 791 to 0 852 by 8 table 5 compares the performances of the anfis pso op elm mars ffnn mlr and m5tree in test stage using the optimal inputs obtained from table 4 for the op elm models linear sigmoid linear sigmoid and linear sigmoid gaussian kernels gave the best predictions for the m1 m2 and m3 data sets respectively it is observed from the table that the op elm over performs the other models in predicting daily streamflow of shehang using data from upstream fujiamgqiao mars and anfis pso have similar rmse mae and ca while the latter model performs better with respect to nse here also the worst performance belongs to mlr models the relative rmse and nse differences between the op elm and anfis pso are 12 and 5 figs 6 and 7 compares the predictions of applied methods in the test period it is clearly observed from the figures that the op elm provides better streamflow predictions than the other three models using data from upstream station ghorbania et al 2018 applied local prediction model lpm and multigene genetic programming mggp for prediction of daily streamflows they utilized phase space reconstruction parameters of delay time and embedding dimension for identifying the optimal inputs and the lpg and mggp models provided nse of 0 776 and 0 766 for the eherchay station iran in the test stage respectively in the current study the nse ranges of the optimal op elm models were calculated as 0 770 0 807 and 0 674 0 733 for the fujiangqiao and shehang stations respectively hwang et al 2012 used lssvm ffnn and mlr models for forecasting daily streamflow time series data from south korea and they found r2 of 0 771 0 696 and 0 679 for the corresponding methods respectively in the presented study the optimal op elm models had 0 821 and 0 713 for the fujiangqiao and shehang stations respectively all these suggest that the op elm model could be successfully applied for daily streamflow prediction 4 conclusion this study evaluated the prediction accuracy of novel op elm method for predicting daily streamflows of two hydro climatic stations shehang and fujiangqiao of fujiang river by comparing with anfis pso mars ffnn m5tree and mlr methods using cross validation technique in the 1st part of the study mars method was applied to hydro climatic datasets of both stations to determine the best input combination with less prediction error based on the application the input combination consisting of previous two time lags of streamflow and precipitation at time t provided the best prediction accuracy for fujiangqiao station whereas in case of shehang station it was found that precipitation inputs did not affect the prediction accuracy of the model thus for shehang station the input combination comprising previous two time lags values of streamflow dataset was selected as the best after determining the best input combination for both stations using mars method op elm anfis pso ffnn mlr and m5t methods were applied to compare the prediction accuracy of the selected methods for the fujiangqiao shehang stations it was found that the op elm and anfis pso outperformed the other methods in predicting streamflow it was also found that m5tree and mlr provided the worst prediction results due to their linear structures for the op elm method various kernel types were tried and the linear linear sigmoid gaussian and linear sigmoid provided the best predictions for the both stations in 2nd part of the study the selected models were evaluated for estimating streamflows of downstream station shehang using hydro climatic data of upstream fujiangqiao station in this part after application of mars model the best input combination for shehang station was found as qt 1 qt 2 pt and pt 1 comparison of six methods revealed that the op elm provided the best accuracy the op elm reduced the prediction error of anfis pso by 12 it was also found that including local data highly improves the prediction accuracy it can be concluded that the op elm outperformed the other models and could be successfully utilized in prediction and estimation of daily streamflows the authors found that the applied models using the nearby gauging station data for training generated more accurate results than the locally trained models thus the authors suggest that the applied methods could be successfully utilized in streamflow prediction studies when local data are unavailable or unreliable especially in ungauged or data scarce basins despite of the successful application of these hybrid models in this study and in previous literature it is recommended to couple these hybrid models with discrete wavelet transform singular spectrum analysis and empirical mode decomposition preprocessing techniques for denoising the streamflow data in future studies this study was limited for stream flow of sub basin of the yangtze river basin further studies are suggested to cover other sub basins of yangtze river basin so that better forecasting pictures of the whole basin can be made declaration of interest statement
