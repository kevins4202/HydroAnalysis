problems aggregation release and difficulty with scale up have slowed the application of nanomaterials in water treatment keller et al 2010 zhang et al 2008 the aim of the current study was to produce a nanoenabled point of use treatment technology suitable as reactive filtration media i e simultaneous particle removal and sorption for targeting dissolved metal cations and anions to accomplish this objective we used electrospinning a scalable and industrially viable approach persano et al 2013 for the tunable synthesis of nanofiber networks well suited for filtration applications ramakrishna et al 2005 2006 thavasi et al 2008 two types of hematite based polymer nanofiber composites were considered first by blending different amounts of hematite nanoparticles into polymer precursor solutions used for electrospinning we produced various polyacrylonitrile pan hematite α fe2o3 composites via a simple i e single pot one step fabrication route alternatively we also developed a subsequent hydrothermal treatment to further process these more traditional nanoparticle embedded composites into novel pan α fe2o3 core shell nanofibers by considering both nanoparticle embedded and core shell nanofiber composites our intent was to identify those treatment applications where i our simpler single pot nanofiber fabrication may be sufficient even though it likely results in some loss of hematite surface area via embedding of the nanoparticles in the polymer matrix and ii our multi step coupled electrospinning and hydrothermal nanofiber fabrication route is preferred because of the emphasis placed on external hematite surface area in the core shell material accordingly composite properties from microscopy and surface area analysis were correlated with their uptake of cu pb cr and as across a range of metal and metalloid hereafter simply metal concentrations and mixtures as well as ph values ultimately the performance of nanoparticle embedded and core shell nanofiber composites was compared and benchmarked versus commercially available gfh media as well as suspensions of hematite nanoparticles to establish potential benefits of reactive filtration technologies using composite nanofiber networks we also addressed practical considerations for the application of nanofiber composites in water treatment because inorganic e g iron oxide nanofibers can be brittle and lack material strength nalbandian et al 2015 2016 we conducted material strength testing to assess the robustness and durability of composite nanofiber networks also while cohesive iron oxide polymer composites have been fabricated previously to date demonstrations of their reactivity have been limited to highly idealized systems e g targeting dye removal patel and hota 2016 that provide little insight into their performance toward higher priority pollutant targets accordingly nanoparticle embedded and core shell nanofiber composites were also tested in flow through systems which included trials with authentic groundwater samples from as contaminated groundwater wells that allowed us to monitor simultaneous removal of as and suspended particles under conditions most representative of treatment applications 2 experimental methods 2 1 reagents all chemicals were reagent grade or better and used as received a detailed list of reagents is provided in the supplemental information si 2 2 nanofiber filter synthesis electrospun pan nanofibers with embedded α fe2o3 nanoparticles hereafter pan fe2o3 were prepared by electrospinning a pan precursor solution containing either 10 nm or 40 nm α fe2o3 nanoparticles that were synthesized as described elsewhere lanzl et al 2012 schwertmann and cornell 2000 details are provided in the si to generate core shell composites hereafter pan fe2o3 fe2o3 pan fe2o3 nanofibers were hydrothermally treated a piece of pan fe2o3 mat 6 cm 10 cm was placed in a 150 ml equimolar solution 0 07 or 0 14 m of fecl3 6h2o and l arginine held in a plastic container that was then loosely covered and heated at 95 c for 1 12 h bora et al 2011 after treatment mats were rinsed with deionized di water 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh and then sonicated in di water for 1 5 h to ensure the removal of extraneous material not firmly affixed to the surface 2 3 nanofiber filter characterization all materials were characterized using scanning electron microscopy sem for their size and morphology x ray diffraction xrd for their crystal phase n2 bet analysis for specific surface area acid digestion for total iron analysis x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps for surface composition and mechanical testing for material strength sizes of α fe2o3 nanoparticles were confirmed with transmission electron microscopy tem and n2 bet analysis details of these characterization approaches are given in the si 2 4 batch sorption experiments experiments with as v cr vi and cu ii were conducted in 20 ml glass vials sealed with butyl rubber septa while those with pb ii were conducted in 15 ml plastic centrifuge tubes to avoid sorption on glass approximately 5 mg of nanofibers 0 5 cm 0 5 cm piece was placed in 10 ml of appropriate buffer solution 10 mm mes or hepes isotherm kinetics and ph edge batch experiments were then initiated by spiking these solutions with as v cr vi cu ii and pb ii for isotherm experiments reactors were spiked with metal concentrations ranging from 0 3 to 200 mg l using potassium chromate sodium arsenate dibasic heptahydrate copper chloride dihydrate and lead nitrate isotherm experiments were conducted at ph 6 to ensure metal solubility for ph edge experiments solutions of either 10 mm mes for ph 6 and 6 5 or hepes for ph 7 and 8 were spiked with 4 mg l as v 3 mg l cr vi 3 mg l pb ii or 0 6 mg l cu ii the markedly lower cu ii concentration was to ensure complete solubility at each ph considered although cu ii experiments were not conducted at ph 8 due to its solubility constraints kinetic experiments examining the rate of metal uptake were also carried out at these initial concentrations at ph 6 interspecies competitive sorption was examined with mixtures of two metals at the initial concentrations and ph values considered in ph edge experiments after assembly vials were placed on a rotator cole parmer roto torque for 0 24 h all experiments employed sacrificial reactor sampling where separate identical vials or tubes were used for each parameter studied e g time initial metal concentration allowing the entire reactor volume to be sampled for dissolved metal analysis 5 ml samples were withdrawn from the reactors acidified to 2 hno3 filtered with 0 45 μm nylon filters and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes details below sorbed masses of metals were quantified from the difference between their initial and equilibrium dissolved concentration for all experiments controls were completed with buffer and metal in the absence of any sorbent material sorption of as v cr vi and cu ii on the glass vials and rubber septa and pb ii on the plastic tubes was negligible 2 5 simulated point of use treatment in flow through filtration systems for flow through filtration experiments fig s1 in the si nanofiber mats were cut to a 47 mm diameter and placed in a filter holder millipore connected to a peristaltic pump masterflex buffer solutions at ph 6 containing either 100 ppb as v and cr vi or 300 ppb pb ii were pumped through the system with a flux of 1060 l m2 h as determined gravimetrically during operation 5 ml samples were collected every 5 min acidified and filtered for analysis reversibility and regeneration of the filters in flow through was examined by subsequently passing either 2 l of 10 mm mes buffer at ph 6 a combination of 1 l of 0 05 m naoh followed by 1 l of ph 6 10 mm mes for as cr experiments or a combination of 1 l of 0 1 m hno3 followed by 1 l of ph 6 10 mm mes for pb experiments across the filter previously such alkaline and acid regeneration of iron oxides for sorption of the respective metals has been effective bailey et al 1992 lai and chen 2001 mohan and pittman 2007 theis et al 1992 zhang et al 2004 nanofiber filters were also tested in flow through filtration experiments with authentic groundwater samples containing as collected from private wells in mason city and clear lake iowa the raw groundwater from both locations had turbidity of 22 ntu ph of 8 5 and as concentrations ranging from 100 to 120 ppb additional groundwater quality characteristics are provided in table s1 2 6 dissolved metals analysis the icp oes perkinelmer optima 7000 dv was calibrated with standards for as v cu ii cr vi and pb ii preceding sample analysis a limited number of cr vi samples were also analyzed colorimetrically using the diphenylcarbazide method u s epa 1992 further details for all analytical methods are provided in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanofiber characterization and material strength testing fig 1 shows sem images nanofiber diameter distributions and specific surface areas for unamended pan the embedded pan fe2o3 composite and the hydrothermally treated core shell pan fe2o3 fe2o3 xrd confirmed that the phase of nanoparticles embedded in pan remained as α fe2o3 throughout synthesis while the hydrothermal coating on pan fe2o3 was also α fe2o3 fig s2 further histograms of nanofiber diameters revealed that the inclusion of fe2o3 shown at 33 wt of 10 nm particles relative to pan caused the average nanofiber diameter to increase from 180 30 nm to 240 40 nm although hydrothermal treatment resulted in growth of particulate nanostructures on the surface of pan fe2o3 nanofibers pan fe2o3 fe2o3 materials did not exhibit any significant increase in average diameter 250 50 nm also the thickness of all mats was relatively consistent at 0 5 mm as determined with sem from acid digestion both the embedded and the core shell composites contained less total iron 20 and 50 total fe by mass respectively than commercial gfh media 70 fe by mass despite possessing larger average diameters α fe2o3 containing composites exhibit greater specific surface area than unmodified pan we attribute this to the high surface area of the 10 nm α fe2o3 particles 80 m2 g integrated into the pan which impart some degree of surface roughness to the nanofiber mat based on sem images however variations in the mass loading of α fe2o3 nanoparticles in pan from 8 to 50 wt relative to pan did not impact composite specific surface area in contrast the extensive growth of nanostructures on the surface of core shell composites increased specific surface area by two fold from 15 m2 g for pan fe2o3 to 30 m2 g for pan fe2o3 fe2o3 notably hydrothermal treatment of pan fe2o3 did not eliminate the flexibility or wettability of the mat despite extensive surface coating with α fe2o3 pan fe2o3 and pan fe2o3 fe2o3 were hydrophilic and exhibited complete wetting i e applied water droplets fully soaked into the nanofiber mats rather than remaining as a droplet on the surface to allow for measurement of a contact angle thus they should require minimal pressure to drive membrane flux during filtration applications mats could be bent and rolled fig 1 which should help facilitate their application in reactor platforms that may optimize their performance e g spiral wound membrane filters failure loads for pan fe2o3 and pan fe2o3 fe2o3 were statistically equivalent at 0 26 0 06 and 0 22 0 03 n respectively values represent mean and standard deviations of at least n 3 measurements but these values were significantly less p 0 0358 where p values were determined in prism via one way anova with tukey s multiple comparisons test than that measured for unamended pan 0 40 0 10 n at 33 wt α fe2o3 the embedded nanoparticles and nanoparticle aggregates likely serve as areas that concentrate stress and cause failure at lower loads relative to unamended pan as has been reported elsewhere augustine et al 2016 wetzel et al 2003 further inclusion of α fe2o3 nanoparticles produced wider nanofibers and the young s modulus of electrospun nanofibers has often been found to increase with decreasing diameter because the level of molecular orientation in the nanofibers increases pai et al 2011 yao et al 2014 with pan fe2o3 and pan fe2o3 fe2o3 mats able to sustain loads in material strength testing these composite materials are vastly improved over pure fe2o3 nanofibers which are brittle and tend to break during handling so as to limit their use in filtration application nalbandian et al 2016 3 2 optimization of pan fe2o3 embedded composites for metal uptake for all nanofiber sorbents equilibrium was typically achieved after 12 h and adsorption isotherms fig 2 fig 4 were best described by the langmuir model eq 1 1 q k l q m a x c e 1 k l c e in eq 1 q is the mass of contaminant adsorbed per unit mass or specific surface area of adsorbent mg g or mg m2 k l is the langmuir coefficient l mg q max is the amount of adsorption at one monolayer mg g or mg m2 and c e is the concentration of the contaminant in solution at equilibrium mg l lakshmipathiraj et al 2006 although the langmuir model assumes reversible uptake we note that sorption on nanofibers proved only partially reversible as described below langmuir model fit parameters i e k l and q max values are summarized in table 1 and the best fit isotherms are shown in corresponding figures as solid lines these langmuir model fit parameters were used as a basis for comparing and optimizing material performance a priority was placed on maximizing material capacity thus q max values both per unit mass and surface area of sorbent were the focus of these nanofiber optimization efforts in subsequent performance evaluation metal uptake on these optimal nanofiber formulations was investigated across a broader range of conditions e g ph and in mixed metal systems and evaluated for their ability to remove metals in flow through filtration systems simulating point of use applications 3 2 1 influence of embedded hematite particle size 10 vs 40 nm for pan fe2o3 nanofibers we first evaluated how the primary particle size of the embedded α fe2o3 nanoparticles influenced uptake of cr vi fig s3 pan containing 20 wt of either 10 nm or 40 nm α fe2o3 exhibited identical sorption capacities q max 0 3 mg cr vi g although 10 nm α fe2o3 exhibits greater specific surface area than 40 nm α fe2o3 it is prone to aggregate more extensively lanzl et al 2012 this in turn could limit the amount of α fe2o3 available at the surface of pan fe2o3 composites and cause comparable reactivity regardless of α fe2o3 primary particle size 3 2 2 influence of embedded hematite mass loading the influence of α fe2o3 nanoparticle loading up to 50 wt as 10 nm α fe2o3 on cr vi and pb ii uptake was assessed at ph 6 fig 2 without α fe2o3 pan nanofibers demonstrated limited sorption of pb ii but did not sorb any cr vi this pb ii uptake is likely from the electron rich nitrile cn groups of pan which may represent a viable complexation site for cationic metal targets kampalanonwat and supaphol 2014 peter et al 2017 increasing α fe2o3 loading increased metal uptake values of q max increased from 0 1 0 01 to 1 5 0 1 mg g for cr vi and from 3 0 5 to 11 1 mg g for pb ii across the α fe2o3 loadings considered 8 50 wt relative to pan fig 2 thus evidence suggests that α fe2o3 exposed at the composite water interface represents the dominant sorbent in embedded composite systems with the amount of near surface α fe2o3 scaling proportionally with the bulk α fe2o3 content increasing α fe2o3 loading also improved the affinity of pan fe2o3 for cr vi with k l values increasing for cr vi from 2 1 to 6 3 l mg with 8 wt to 50 wt α fe2o3 cr vi forms both inner sphere monodentate and bidentate complexes and outer sphere complexes on α fe2o3 adegoke et al 2014 huang et al 2016 johnston and chrysochoou 2014 kendelewicz et al 1999 khaodhiar et al 2000 yin and ellis 2009 greater cr vi affinity with higher α fe2o3 loadings may reflect not only increased access to surface fe sites but also the influence of the pan support on the activity of these sites in contrast k l values were relatively constant for pb ii from 0 1 to 0 2 l mg suggesting a consistent affinity for pb ii even though the number of sorption sites increases pb ii commonly forms bidentate complexes with o sites on α fe2o3 bargar et al 1997 but can also precipitate on iron oxide surfaces in hydr oxide forms especially at elevated pb ii concentrations lee et al 2012 unfortunately the pb ii loading on the pan fe2o3 surface was not high enough to detect and characterize via methods including xrd or xps notably as discussed later xps suggests pb precipitates form on core shell pan fe2o3 fe2o3 see fig s4 3 3 optimization of pan fe2o3 fe2o3 core shell structures for metal uptake core shell pan fe2o3 fe2o3 nanofibers synthesized with various i α fe2o3 primary particle sizes 10 and 40 nm and loadings 20 wt to 33 wt ii hydrothermal solution concentrations 0 07 m 0 14 m fecl3 6h2o and l arginine and iii hydrothermal treatment times 1 12 h were essentially comparable in performance as assessed by cr vi sorption isotherms fig s5 we attribute their consistent performance to the relatively high loading of embedded α fe2o3 nanoparticles which provides an abundance of nucleation sites on the pan surface for the hydrothermal deposition and growth of the α fe2o3 nanostructured shell this in turn produces external surface area for cr vi uptake that is roughly constant across the synthesis conditions we explored we also developed core shell composites from pan fe2o3 nanofibers with narrower diameters these core shell composites were prepared by first electrospinning pan 33 wt α fe2o3 at low relative humidity 10 rh and subsequently coating these composites hydrothermally with fe2o3 this produced core shell nanofibers with an average diameter of 160 40 nm roughly 100 nm less than those shown in fig 1 nevertheless the q max value for cr vi did not increase on these narrower diameter materials this suggests that any gains in reactive surface area obtained by decreasing nanofiber diameter are small relative to the surface area increase afforded by the nanostructured α fe2o3 coating grown hydrothermally 3 4 performance comparison of pan fe2o3 and pan fe2o3 fe2o3 to traditional iron oxide sorbents 3 4 1 sorption isotherms adsorption isotherms for anionic as v and cr vi fig 3 and cationic cu ii and pb ii fig 4 were collected at ph 6 for pan fe2o3 33 wt of fe2o3 relative to pan pan fe2o3 fe2o3 and gfh media at ph 6 the predominant species for each metal is h2aso4 silberberg 2012 hcro4 silberberg 2012 cu2 cuppett 2006 and pb2 perera et al 2001 across all metals considered pan fe2o3 fe2o3 outperformed pan fe2o3 and commercial gfh media on the basis of available surface area often by 2 fold and achieved surface area normalized sorption capacities equivalent to suspensions of 10 nm α fe2o3 nanoparticles we anticipated that gfh media which consists of poorly crystalline akaganeite β feooh chen et al 2009 would better adsorb anions than cations at near neutral ph because it is widely marketed for as removal evoqua water technologies 2014c indeed on a per mass basis either of total sorbent mass or available fe mass gfh media was the most effective sorbent for oxyanions as v and cr vi in contrast pan fe2o3 fe2o3 pan fe2o3 and 10 nm fe2o3 nanoparticles generally exhibited greater sorption capacities for cations i e cu ii and pb ii than anions i e as v and cr vi table 1 and achieved mass normalized uptake capacities for cations that were essentially equivalent to gfh media this behavior is consistent with both nanoparticle suspensions and composite nanofibers of hematite possessing lower points of zero charge pzc than gfh media for the composite materials reactivity was also compared with that of the components from which they were assembled as one line of comparison the relative q max values for cr vi as v cu ii and pb ii at ph 6 are 1 0 1 8 7 5 10 for the 10 nm α fe2o3 suspension this trend reasonably matches that observed for pan fe2o3 1 0 1 7 5 8 9 2 indicating that embedding α fe2o3 nanoparticles in pan has little influence on their surface chemistry for binding metals for pan fe2o3 fe2o3 although the same qualitative trend was observed quantitative differences 1 1 3 4 8 7 9 may indicate slight differences in the types and abundance of surface sites on the α fe2o3 coating for core shell nanofibers for all sorbents trends in metal uptake match prior reports for this metal suite as v cr vi cu ii and pb ii on α fe2o3 ajouyed et al 2010 bargar et al 1997 peacock and sherman 2004 singh et al 1996 thus established mechanisms for metal uptake on α fe2o3 e g surface complexation bargar et al 1997 catalano et al 2008 peacock and sherman 2004 yin and ellis 2009 are likely at play in all sorbent systems accordingly the performance of α fe2o3 nanofiber composites can likely be reasonably estimated from the extensive body of work that exists for nanoparticulate α fe2o3 sorbents davis and bhatnagar 1995 jeon et al 2003 lenhart and honeyman 1999 li et al 2006 osseo asare and fuerstenau 1979 rose and bianchi mosquera 1993 shuibo et al 2009 we note however that xps suggests precipitation contributes to pb uptake at elevated concentrations e g 60 mg l of initial pb ii fig s4 on core shell pan fe2o3 fe2o3 as a final point of comparison it is worth examining the relative accessibility of hematite in embedded and core shell composites based upon their metal uptake per gram of available iron in table 1 the maximum uptake capacity per gram of available fe is generally 40 13 higher on core shell composites relative to embedded composites i e from table 1 this value represents the average with standard deviation of the ratio of q max values in mg g fe for pan fe2o3 fe2o3 and pan fe2o3 across each of the target metals investigated however while hematite is clearly more accessible in the core shell nanofibers uptake of metals per g fe is still relatively low compared to hematite dispersions e g for as v core shell and embedded composites achieve 55 and 42 respectively of the capacity of 10 nm hematite suspensions per g of fe thus regardless of the approach used for immobilization some portion of the hematite mass in nanofiber composites is unavailable for uptake relative to suspended hematite nanoparticles and their aggregates 3 4 2 uptake rates in all systems a short interval of rapid uptake typically in the first hour or less was followed by a period of slower sorption until equilibrium was achieved figs s6a and 6b notably the rates of initially rapid uptake on pan fe2o3 fe2o3 and pan fe2o3 were roughly equivalent for all metals and these values were generally comparable to or greater than those observed for gfh media equilibrium uptake of oxyanions as v and cr vi on pan fe2o3 was achieved after 1 h while equilibrium in pan fe2o3 fe2o3 systems was reached after 2 h for uptake of cations cu ii and pb ii pan fe2o3 was first to achieve equilibrium after 2 h whereas pan fe2o3 fe2o3 reached equilibrium after 5 h for cu ii and between 5 and 12 h for pb ii figs s6c and 6d in comparison gfh media had reached 50 uptake of all metals within 2 4 h and equilibrium was typically attained over 12 24 h 3 4 3 ph edge ph dependent sorption was assessed from ph 6 to 8 at relatively low initial concentrations compared to those used in isotherms 4 mg l as v 3 mg l cr vi 0 6 mg l cu ii and 3 mg l pb ii these results are shown in fig s7 for oxyanions and fig s8 for cations along with predominance diagrams for each metal over this ph range for anionic as v and cr vi sorption generally decreased with increasing ph on pan fe2o3 pan fe2o3 fe2o3 and gfh media consistent with prior reports for anion sorption on hematite i e anion uptake diminishes as the hematite surface grows more negatively charged at higher ph ajouyed et al 2010 campos and büchler 2005 martin et al 2014 mohan and pittman 2007 as with isotherms pan fe2o3 fe2o3 bound the most as v per unit surface area and also exhibited greater capacity than pan fe2o3 when sorbed as v concentrations were normalized by total sorbent mass and the mass of available fe gfh media exhibited the most uptake per unit sorbent and fe mass of all sorbents considered for uptake of cationic cu ii and pb ii the two types of composite nanofibers generally resulted in the greatest metal uptake across all ph values both for adsorption per unit surface area and on the basis of total sorbent mass and available fe a notable difference from observed performance trends for oxyanion uptake was that at the metal concentrations used in ph edge experiments lower than those in isotherms pan fe2o3 adsorbed comparable or more metal cations per unit surface area than pan fe2o3 fe2o3 there were also differences in performance of the materials toward each cation for cu ii sorption increased modestly on all sorbents but typically by no more than two fold from ph 6 to ph 7 this behavior is once again consistent with that typically observed for cation binding on more traditional iron oxide sorbents peacock and sherman 2004 pb ii uptake as a function of ph varied across the different materials pb ii uptake was relatively low on unmodified pan from ph 6 to 7 but increased nearly four fold at ph 8 to surface area normalized pb ii concentrations that rivaled nanofiber composites in contrast sorption of pb ii on pan fe2o3 fe2o3 decreased monotonically albeit only slightly from ph 6 to 8 pan fe2o3 exhibited a maximum in pb ii uptake at ph 6 5 behavior that was also observed for gfh media notably for pb ii a clear increase in adsorption is often reported with increasing ph on iron oxides barton et al 2011 shipley et al 2013 behavior that was not pronounced on our composites again this may relate to the ability of pan functionalities to influence pb ii binding particularly at higher ph values 3 4 4 competitive sorption in mixtures of as v and cr vi sorption of as v was largely unaffected fig s9a but uptake of cr vi was inhibited considerably for all materials and ph values fig s9b for pan fe2o3 cr vi uptake generally decreased three to four fold which was comparable to the extent of inhibition observed in suspensions of 10 nm α fe2o3 pan fe2o3 fe2o3 exhibited a five fold decrease in cr vi uptake in the presence of as v indeed previous studies have shown as v and cr vi to compete directly for surface sites on iron oxide with as v prevailing in equilibrium systems khaodhiar et al 2000 neither mixtures of as v and cu ii oxyanion cation nor cu ii and pb ii cation cation resulted in inhibition as discussed more extensively in the si fig s10 suggesting reasonable versatility for composite materials when applied to mixed metal systems 3 5 reactive filtration studies with model and authentic groundwater 3 5 1 filtration in model water systems a filter consisting of 100 mg of pan fe2o3 1 4 m2 available surface area was evaluated at ph 6 with 10 mm mes buffer against an influent of 100 ppb as v i e 10 times the epa mcl and 100 ppb cr vi i e equal to the epa mcl both as v and cr vi were immediately detectable in effluent with effluent concentrations 80 and 60 of influent respectively after the first 100 ml of water treated fig 5 similarly in a separate trial with exposure to 300 ppb pb ii i e 20 times the epa action level pb ii was detected at 60 of influent within the first 100 ml comparable evaluation of a 100 mg filter 2 8 m2 available surface area of core shell pan fe2o3 fe2o3 at ph 6 revealed significantly improved metal removal as v remained below detection limits 10 μg as l over the first 1500 ml treated cr vi remained below detection limits 6 μg cr l for the first 700 ml and pb ii exceeded detection limits 10 μg pb l after 400 ml fig 5 it is notable that the improved performance of the core shell composites in flow through systems far exceeds expectations from their performance relative to embedded composites in batch systems for example in table 1 the capacity for as v measured from isotherms was only 3 6 fold greater for pan fe2o3 fe2o3 relative to pan fe2o3 in closed batch systems under flow however pan fe2o3 fe2o3 could effectively treat at least 15 fold greater volumes of water to as v levels below detection thus in flow through treatment systems where metal removal occurs over much shorter contact times estimated 1 s for filter systems presented herein the location of the hematite in the composite is an even more important factor in performance with the external α fe2o3 shell on pan fe2o3 fe2o3 appearing markedly better for such applications unexpectedly as v did not adversely impact uptake of cr vi in flow through as breakthrough curves for solutions with only cr vi were comparable to that observed with an oxyanion mixed influent fig 5 this is another difference from results in closed batch systems and we assume that conditions under flow do not allow sufficient time for as v to displace cr vi from available binding sites i e sorption in these filters is kinetically rather than thermodynamically controlled notably the levels of sorption achieved after exposure to 4 l of 100 ppb as 100 ppb cr mixed influent i e 2 9 mg as v g and 0 7 mg cr vi g were lower than the sorption capacities measured in batch isotherms 5 0 and 3 9 mg g respectively further while effluent as v did not ever reach influent concentration during the 4 l experiment effluent cr vi matched influent concentrations after treatment of 1500 ml thus it appears that a large number of sites responsible for cr vi sorption at equilibrium i e in batch were inaccessible in the kinetically limited flow through system as a final demonstration we confirmed that the filter removal capacity could be increased by increasing the filter thickness for example we were able to double the volume of water treated before detection of pb ii in the effluent to 900 ml by simply doubling the amount of pan fe2o3 fe2o3 used to 200 mg pan fe2o3 fe2o3 with 5 7 m2 available surface area fig 6 a the amount of pb ii uptake achieved during this flow through experiment was 3 9 mg pb ii g much less than the sorption capacity determined in batch isotherms 31 mg g though the filter remained below saturation at the end of the experiment i e effluent pb ii never equaled the influent concentration 3 5 2 filter regeneration on pan fe2o3 fe2o3 both as v and cr vi sorption proved partially reversible as 15 20 of the sorbed pb ii as v and cr vi could be released into the effluent by passing clean buffer ph 6 10 mm mes through the filter at the end of a filter trial the limited reversibility of metal uptake is encouraging as a used filter is not likely to become a significant metal source if influent quality improves as expected additional testing after this buffer rinse demonstrated little additional filter capacity for as v and cr vi fig 6 larger than expected pb ii removal after this buffer wash likely reflects the considerable number of sites that remained available for pb ii binding at the end of the first trial more aggressive regenerative treatments were also explored alkaline regeneration with 1 l of 0 05 m naoh which has previously proven effective bailey et al 1992 mohan and pittman 2007 zhang et al 2004 resulted in the release of 85 of bound as v and 60 of bound cr vi accordingly metal removal with the alkaline regenerated filter was close to that of a new pristine filter fig 6b and c for pb ii treatment with 1 l of 0 1 m hno3 lai and chen 2001 theis et al 1992 removed 50 of sorbed pb ii and was able to partially restore filter performance to levels better than observed with a simple buffer wash fig 6a 3 5 3 filtration of iowa groundwater in using a 100 mg filter of pan fe2o3 fe2o3 to treat as contaminated groundwater as was not immediately detectable in the treated effluent but performance was poorer than observed in idealized buffer systems 10 mm mes at ph 6 for mason city groundwater 103 ppb as as was detectable in effluent after 1200 ml of treatment while as in clear lake groundwater was detectable much more rapidly after only 400 ml fig 7 a for clear lake groundwater samples 112 ppb as the breakthrough curve noticeably plateaued at a concentration roughly 80 of the influent this can be attributed to a pseudo steady state condition hanna et al 2014 where a constant rate of uptake for a portion of the total available as with as v predominantly present as haso4 2 is fast relative to flow through the filter after initial breakthrough adeel and luthy 1995 due to the higher ph of both groundwater samples relative to our model systems ph 8 5 groundwater versus ph 6 buffer we expected as to break through earlier in groundwater samples when using the same amount of filter material at ph 8 5 the surface of the pan fe2o3 fe2o3 becomes more negatively charged and thus less attractive to oxyanions like aso4 3 as we observed in ph edge experiments see fig s7 we suspect that the extensive differences in as breakthrough for the two groundwater samples may indicate that co solutes e g carbonate co3 2 and phosphate po4 3 can interfere with as uptake on pan fe2o3 fe2o3 as has been reported elsewhere for iron oxides jain and loeppert 2000 luther et al 2012 because as v and cr vi competed for sites on pan fe2o3 fe2o3 fig s9 as they would on pure α fe2o3 it is likely that previously reported effects of such non target co solutes can also be anticipated for the core shell material in such instances we anticipate that the mass of pan fe2o3 fe2o3 filter could be increased to increase sorption of metals in complex water matrices where inhibition from co solutes may occur another major component of the groundwater samples was particulate matter presumably arising from colloidal iron which may have associated as resulting in turbid groundwater initially 22 ntu in addition to as removal pan fe2o3 fe2o3 filters simultaneously lowered the turbidity of the treated effluent after 4 l to 0 2 ntu and removed 20 mg of suspended solids from each groundwater sample that left a visible layer of solids fig 7b while producing a cleaner finished water this also presents a challenge in terms of colloidal fouling and regeneration thus in such combined sorption and particulate filtration applications the core shell materials produced herein are likely best viewed as a single use i e non reusable technology nevertheless we are encouraged by these performance results during simulated point of use treatment for example assuming a resident of mason city ia drinks 39 ounces of water per day the average for u s adults between 2005 and 2010 drewnowski et al 2013 only 35 g less than a tenth of a pound of pan fe2o3 fe2o3 filters would be needed to reduce as below the epa maximum contaminant limit mcl for one year 4 conclusion electrospinning enabled the facile synthesis of a mechanically stable nanofiber network while hydrothermal treatment achieved a surface coating of α fe2o3 nanostructures that increased the reactive surface area available for uptake of dissolved metals composite nanofibers remained flexible and robust after hydrothermal treatment as supported by strength testing and the hydrothermal approach should be readily scalable because it does not require high pressure i e above 1 atm or temperature i e above 100 c performance of embedded pan fe2o3 and core shell pan fe2o3 fe2o3 composites for adsorption of as v cr vi cu ii and pb ii generally matched expectations from more traditional iron oxide sorbents across a range of initial metal concentrations and ph values initial rates and surface area normalized capacities for metal uptake on pan fe2o3 and pan fe2o3 fe2o3 were comparable to those measured in a suspension of 10 nm fe2o3 nanoparticles and with a commercially available iron oxide marketed for water treatment core shell pan fe2o3 fe2o3 significantly outperformed pan fe2o3 in flow through treatment systems for as v cr vi and pb ii illustrating the need for readily accessible surface binding sites in kinetically limited reactive filtration systems notably core shell nanofibers performed far better than embedded composites than anticipated from their relative performance in batch systems at thermodynamic equilibrium highlighting the importance of testing and demonstrating nanoenabled technologies under conditions most representative of their application platform in tests with as and particulate contaminated groundwater pan fe2o3 fe2o3 achieved simultaneous removal of as and suspended solids demonstrating its viability for combined sorption and filtration treatment applications

problems aggregation release and difficulty with scale up have slowed the application of nanomaterials in water treatment keller et al 2010 zhang et al 2008 the aim of the current study was to produce a nanoenabled point of use treatment technology suitable as reactive filtration media i e simultaneous particle removal and sorption for targeting dissolved metal cations and anions to accomplish this objective we used electrospinning a scalable and industrially viable approach persano et al 2013 for the tunable synthesis of nanofiber networks well suited for filtration applications ramakrishna et al 2005 2006 thavasi et al 2008 two types of hematite based polymer nanofiber composites were considered first by blending different amounts of hematite nanoparticles into polymer precursor solutions used for electrospinning we produced various polyacrylonitrile pan hematite α fe2o3 composites via a simple i e single pot one step fabrication route alternatively we also developed a subsequent hydrothermal treatment to further process these more traditional nanoparticle embedded composites into novel pan α fe2o3 core shell nanofibers by considering both nanoparticle embedded and core shell nanofiber composites our intent was to identify those treatment applications where i our simpler single pot nanofiber fabrication may be sufficient even though it likely results in some loss of hematite surface area via embedding of the nanoparticles in the polymer matrix and ii our multi step coupled electrospinning and hydrothermal nanofiber fabrication route is preferred because of the emphasis placed on external hematite surface area in the core shell material accordingly composite properties from microscopy and surface area analysis were correlated with their uptake of cu pb cr and as across a range of metal and metalloid hereafter simply metal concentrations and mixtures as well as ph values ultimately the performance of nanoparticle embedded and core shell nanofiber composites was compared and benchmarked versus commercially available gfh media as well as suspensions of hematite nanoparticles to establish potential benefits of reactive filtration technologies using composite nanofiber networks we also addressed practical considerations for the application of nanofiber composites in water treatment because inorganic e g iron oxide nanofibers can be brittle and lack material strength nalbandian et al 2015 2016 we conducted material strength testing to assess the robustness and durability of composite nanofiber networks also while cohesive iron oxide

little insight into their performance toward higher priority pollutant targets accordingly nanoparticle embedded and core shell nanofiber composites were also tested in flow through systems which included trials with authentic groundwater samples from as contaminated groundwater wells that allowed us to monitor simultaneous removal of as and suspended particles under conditions most representative of treatment applications 2 experimental methods 2 1 reagents all chemicals were reagent grade or better and used as received a detailed list of reagents is provided in the supplemental information si 2 2 nanofiber filter synthesis electrospun pan nanofibers with embedded α fe2o3 nanoparticles hereafter pan fe2o3 were prepared by electrospinning a pan precursor solution containing either 10 nm or 40 nm α fe2o3 nanoparticles that were synthesized as described elsewhere lanzl et al 2012 schwertmann and cornell 2000 details are provided in the si to generate core shell composites hereafter pan fe2o3 fe2o3 pan fe2o3 nanofibers were hydrothermally treated a piece of pan fe2o3 mat 6 cm 10 cm was placed in a 150 ml equimolar solution 0 07 or 0 14 m of fecl3 6h2o and l arginine held in a plastic container that was then loosely covered and heated at 95 c for 1 12 h bora et al 2011 after treatment mats were rinsed with deionized di water 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh and then sonicated in di water for 1 5 h to ensure the removal of extraneous material not firmly affixed to the surface 2 3 nanofiber filter characterization all materials were characterized using scanning electron microscopy sem for their size and morphology x ray diffraction xrd for their crystal phase n2 bet analysis for specific surface area acid digestion for total iron analysis x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps for surface composition and mechanical testing for material strength sizes of α fe2o3 nanoparticles were confirmed with transmission electron microscopy tem and n2 bet analysis details of these characterization approaches are given in the si 2 4 batch sorption experiments experiments with as v cr vi and cu ii were conducted in 20 ml glass vials sealed with butyl rubber septa while those with pb ii were conducted in 15 ml plastic centrifuge tubes to avoid sorption on glass approximately 5 mg of nanofibers 0 5 cm 0 5 cm piece was placed in 10 ml of appropriate buffer solution 10 mm mes or hepes isotherm kinetics and ph edge batch experiments were then initiated by spiking these solutions with as v cr vi cu ii and pb ii for isotherm experiments reactors were spiked with metal concentrations ranging from 0 3 to 200 mg l using potassium chromate sodium arsenate dibasic heptahydrate copper chloride dihydrate and lead nitrate isotherm experiments were conducted at ph 6 to ensure metal solubility for ph edge experiments solutions of either 10 mm mes for ph 6 and 6 5 or hepes for ph 7 and 8 were spiked with 4 mg l as v 3 mg l cr vi 3 mg l pb ii or 0 6 mg l cu ii the markedly lower cu ii concentration was to ensure complete solubility at each ph considered although cu ii experiments were not conducted at ph 8 due to its solubility constraints kinetic experiments examining the rate of metal uptake were also carried out at these initial concentrations at ph 6 interspecies competitive sorption was examined with mixtures of two metals at the initial concentrations and ph values considered in ph edge experiments after assembly vials were placed on a rotator cole parmer roto torque for 0 24 h all experiments employed sacrificial reactor sampling where separate identical vials or tubes were used for each parameter studied e g time initial metal concentration allowing the entire reactor volume to be sampled for dissolved metal analysis 5 ml samples were withdrawn from the reactors acidified to 2 hno3 filtered with 0 45 μm nylon filters and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes details below sorbed masses of metals were quantified from the difference between their initial and equilibrium dissolved concentration for all experiments controls were completed with buffer and metal in the absence of any sorbent material sorption of as v cr vi and cu ii on the glass vials and rubber septa and pb ii on the plastic tubes was negligible 2 5 simulated point of use treatment in flow through filtration systems for flow through filtration experiments fig s1 in the si nanofiber mats were cut to a 47 mm diameter and placed in a filter holder millipore connected to a peristaltic pump masterflex buffer solutions at ph 6 containing either 100 ppb as v and cr vi or 300 ppb pb ii were pumped through the system with a flux of 1060 l m2 h as determined gravimetrically during operation 5 ml samples were collected every 5 min acidified and filtered for analysis reversibility and regeneration of the filters in flow through was examined by subsequently passing either 2 l of 10 mm mes buffer at ph 6 a combination of 1 l of 0 05 m naoh followed by 1 l of ph 6 10 mm mes for as cr experiments or a combination of 1 l of 0 1 m hno3 followed by 1 l of ph 6 10 mm mes for pb experiments across the filter previously such alkaline and acid regeneration of iron oxides for sorption of the respective metals has been effective bailey et al 1992 lai and chen 2001 mohan and pittman 2007 theis et al 1992 zhang et al 2004 nanofiber filters were also tested in flow through filtration experiments with authentic groundwater samples containing as collected from private wells in mason city and clear lake iowa the raw groundwater from both locations had turbidity of 22 ntu ph of 8 5 and as concentrations ranging from 100 to 120 ppb additional groundwater quality characteristics are provided in table s1 2 6 dissolved metals analysis the icp oes perkinelmer optima 7000 dv was calibrated with standards for as v cu ii cr vi and pb ii preceding sample analysis a limited number of cr vi samples were also analyzed colorimetrically using the diphenylcarbazide method u s epa 1992 further details for all analytical methods are provided in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanofiber characterization and material strength testing fig 1 shows sem images nanofiber diameter distributions and specific surface areas for unamended pan the embedded pan fe2o3 composite and the hydrothermally treated core shell pan fe2o3 fe2o3 xrd confirmed that the phase of nanoparticles embedded in pan remained as α fe2o3 throughout synthesis while the hydrothermal coating on pan fe2o3 was also α fe2o3 fig s2 further histograms of nanofiber diameters revealed that the inclusion of fe2o3 shown at 33 wt of 10 nm particles relative to pan caused the average nanofiber diameter to increase from 180 30 nm to 240 40 nm although hydrothermal treatment resulted in growth of particulate nanostructures on the surface of pan fe2o3 nanofibers pan fe2o3 fe2o3 materials did not exhibit any significant increase in average diameter 250 50 nm also the thickness of all mats was relatively consistent at 0 5 mm as determined with sem from acid digestion both the embedded and the core shell composites contained less total iron 20 and 50 total fe by mass respectively than commercial gfh media 70 fe by mass despite possessing larger average diameters α fe2o3 containing composites exhibit greater specific surface area than unmodified pan we attribute this to the high surface area of the 10 nm α fe2o3 particles 80 m2 g integrated into the pan which impart some degree of surface roughness to the nanofiber mat based on sem images however variations in the mass loading of α fe2o3 nanoparticles in pan from 8 to 50 wt relative to pan did not impact composite specific surface area in contrast the extensive growth of nanostructures on the surface of core shell composites increased specific surface area by two fold from 15 m2 g for pan fe2o3 to 30 m2 g for pan fe2o3 fe2o3 notably hydrothermal treatment of pan fe2o3 did not eliminate the flexibility or wettability of the mat despite extensive surface coating with α fe2o3 pan fe2o3 and pan fe2o3 fe2o3 were hydrophilic and exhibited complete wetting i e applied water droplets fully soaked into the nanofiber mats rather than remaining as a droplet on the surface to allow for measurement of a contact angle thus they should require minimal pressure to drive membrane flux during filtration applications mats could be bent and rolled fig 1 which should help facilitate their application in reactor platforms that may optimize their performance e g spiral wound membrane filters failure loads for pan fe2o3 and pan fe2o3 fe2o3 were statistically equivalent at 0 26 0 06 and 0 22 0 03 n respectively values represent mean and standard deviations of at least n 3 measurements but these values were significantly less p 0 0358 where p values were determined in prism via one way anova with tukey s multiple comparisons test than that measured for unamended pan 0 40 0 10 n at 33 wt α fe2o3 the embedded nanoparticles and nanoparticle aggregates likely serve as areas that concentrate stress and cause failure at lower loads relative to unamended pan as has been reported elsewhere augustine et al 2016 wetzel et al 2003 further inclusion of α fe2o3 nanoparticles produced wider nanofibers and the young s modulus of electrospun nanofibers has often been found to increase with decreasing diameter because the level of molecular orientation in the nanofibers increases pai et al 2011 yao et al 2014 with pan fe2o3 and pan fe2o3 fe2o3 mats able to sustain loads in material strength testing these composite materials are vastly improved over pure fe2o3 nanofibers which are brittle and tend to break during handling so as to limit their use in filtration application nalbandian et al 2016 3 2 optimization of pan fe2o3 embedded composites for metal uptake for all nanofiber sorbents equilibrium was typically achieved after 12 h and adsorption isotherms fig 2 fig 4 were best described by the langmuir model eq 1 1 q k l q m a x c e 1 k l c e in eq 1 q is the mass of contaminant adsorbed per unit mass or specific surface area of adsorbent mg g or mg m2 k l is the langmuir coefficient l mg q max is the amount of adsorption at one monolayer mg g or mg m2 and c e is the concentration of the contaminant in solution at equilibrium mg l lakshmipathiraj et al 2006 although the langmuir model assumes reversible uptake we note that sorption on nanofibers proved only partially reversible as described below langmuir model fit parameters i e k l and q max values are summarized in table 1 and the best fit isotherms are shown in corresponding figures as solid lines these langmuir model fit parameters were used as a basis for comparing and optimizing material performance a priority was placed on maximizing material capacity thus q max values both per unit mass and surface area of sorbent were the focus of these nanofiber optimization efforts in subsequent performance evaluation metal uptake on these optimal nanofiber formulations was investigated across a broader range of conditions e g ph and in mixed metal systems and evaluated for their ability to remove metals in flow through filtration systems simulating point of use applications 3 2 1 influence of embedded hematite particle size 10 vs 40 nm for pan fe2o3 nanofibers we first evaluated how the primary particle size of the embedded α fe2o3 nanoparticles influenced uptake of cr vi fig s3 pan containing 20 wt of either 10 nm or 40 nm α fe2o3 exhibited identical sorption capacities q max 0 3 mg cr vi g although 10 nm α fe2o3 exhibits greater specific surface area than 40 nm α fe2o3 it is prone to aggregate more extensively lanzl et al 2012 this in turn could limit the amount of α fe2o3 available at the surface of pan fe2o3 composites and cause comparable reactivity regardless of α fe2o3 primary particle size 3 2 2 influence of embedded hematite mass loading the influence of α fe2o3 nanoparticle loading up to 50 wt as 10 nm α fe2o3 on cr vi and pb ii uptake was assessed at ph 6 fig 2 without α fe2o3 pan nanofibers demonstrated limited sorption of pb ii but did not sorb any cr vi this pb ii uptake is likely from the electron rich nitrile cn groups of pan which may represent a viable complexation site for cationic metal targets kampalanonwat and supaphol 2014 peter et al 2017 increasing α fe2o3 loading increased metal uptake values of q max increased from 0 1 0 01 to 1 5 0 1 mg g for cr vi and from 3 0 5 to 11 1 mg g for pb ii across the α fe2o3 loadings considered 8 50 wt relative to pan fig 2 thus evidence suggests that α fe2o3 exposed at the composite water interface represents the dominant sorbent in embedded composite systems with the amount of near surface α fe2o3 scaling proportionally with the bulk α fe2o3 content increasing α fe2o3 loading also improved the affinity of pan fe2o3 for cr vi with k l values increasing for cr vi from 2 1 to 6 3 l mg with 8 wt to 50 wt α fe2o3 cr vi forms both inner sphere monodentate and bidentate complexes and outer sphere complexes on α fe2o3 adegoke et al 2014 huang et al 2016 johnston and chrysochoou 2014 kendelewicz et al 1999 khaodhiar et al 2000 yin and ellis 2009 greater cr vi affinity with higher α fe2o3 loadings may reflect not only increased access to surface fe sites but also the influence of the pan support on the activity of these sites in contrast k l values were relatively constant for pb ii from 0 1 to 0 2 l mg suggesting a consistent affinity for pb ii even though the number of sorption sites increases pb ii commonly forms bidentate complexes with o sites on α fe2o3 bargar et al 1997 but can also precipitate on iron oxide surfaces in hydr oxide forms especially at elevated pb ii concentrations lee et al 2012 unfortunately the pb ii loading on the pan fe2o3 surface was not high enough to detect and characterize via methods including xrd or xps notably as discussed later xps suggests pb precipitates form on core shell pan fe2o3 fe2o3 see fig s4 3 3 optimization of pan fe2o3 fe2o3 core shell structures for metal uptake core shell pan fe2o3 fe2o3 nanofibers synthesized with various i α fe2o3 primary particle sizes 10 and 40 nm and loadings 20 wt to 33 wt ii hydrothermal solution concentrations 0 07 m 0 14 m fecl3 6h2o and l arginine and iii hydrothermal treatment times 1 12 h were essentially comparable in performance as assessed by cr vi sorption isotherms fig s5 we attribute their consistent performance to the relatively high loading of embedded α fe2o3 nanoparticles which provides an abundance of nucleation sites on the pan surface for the hydrothermal deposition and growth of the α fe2o3 nanostructured shell this in turn produces external surface area for cr vi uptake that is roughly constant across the synthesis conditions we explored we also developed core shell composites from pan fe2o3 nanofibers with narrower diameters these core shell composites were prepared by first electrospinning pan 33 wt α fe2o3 at low relative humidity 10 rh and subsequently coating these composites hydrothermally with fe2o3 this produced core shell nanofibers with an average diameter of 160 40 nm roughly 100 nm less than those shown in fig 1 nevertheless the q max value for cr vi did not increase on these narrower diameter materials this suggests that any gains in reactive surface area obtained by decreasing nanofiber diameter are small relative to the surface area increase afforded by the nanostructured α fe2o3 coating grown hydrothermally 3 4 performance comparison of pan fe2o3 and pan fe2o3 fe2o3 to traditional iron oxide sorbents 3 4 1 sorption isotherms adsorption isotherms for anionic as v and cr vi fig 3 and cationic cu ii and pb ii fig 4 were collected at ph 6 for pan fe2o3 33 wt of fe2o3 relative to pan pan fe2o3 fe2o3 and gfh media at ph 6 the predominant species for each metal is h2aso4 silberberg 2012 hcro4 silberberg 2012 cu2 cuppett 2006 and pb2 perera et al 2001 across all metals considered pan fe2o3 fe2o3 outperformed pan fe2o3 and commercial gfh media on the basis of available surface area often by 2 fold and achieved surface area normalized sorption capacities equivalent to suspensions of 10 nm α fe2o3 nanoparticles we anticipated that gfh media which consists of poorly crystalline akaganeite β feooh chen et al 2009 would better adsorb anions than cations at near neutral ph because it is widely marketed for as removal evoqua water technologies 2014c indeed on a per mass basis either of total sorbent mass or available fe mass gfh media was the most effective sorbent for oxyanions as v and cr vi in contrast pan fe2o3 fe2o3 pan fe2o3 and 10 nm fe2o3 nanoparticles generally exhibited greater sorption capacities for cations i e cu ii and pb ii than anions i e as v and cr vi table 1 and achieved mass normalized uptake capacities for cations that were essentially equivalent to gfh media this behavior is consistent with both nanoparticle suspensions and composite nanofibers of hematite possessing lower points of zero charge pzc than gfh media for the composite materials reactivity was also compared with that of the components from which they were assembled as one line of comparison the relative q max values for cr vi as v cu ii and pb ii at ph 6 are 1 0 1 8 7 5 10 for the 10 nm α fe2o3 suspension this trend reasonably matches that observed for pan fe2o3 1 0 1 7 5 8 9 2 indicating that embedding α fe2o3 nanoparticles in pan has little influence on their surface chemistry for binding metals for pan fe2o3 fe2o3 although the same qualitative trend was observed quantitative differences 1 1 3 4 8 7 9 may indicate slight differences in the types and abundance of surface sites on the α fe2o3 coating for core shell nanofibers for all sorbents trends in metal uptake match prior reports for this metal suite as v cr vi cu ii and pb ii on α fe2o3 ajouyed et al 2010 bargar et al 1997 peacock and sherman 2004 singh et al 1996 thus established mechanisms for metal uptake on α fe2o3 e g surface complexation bargar et al 1997 catalano et al 2008 peacock and sherman 2004 yin and ellis 2009 are likely at play in all sorbent systems accordingly the performance of α fe2o3 nanofiber composites can likely be reasonably estimated from the extensive body of work that exists for nanoparticulate α fe2o3 sorbents davis and bhatnagar 1995 jeon et al 2003 lenhart and honeyman 1999 li et al 2006 osseo asare and fuerstenau 1979 rose and bianchi mosquera 1993 shuibo et al 2009 we note however that xps suggests precipitation contributes to pb uptake at elevated concentrations e g 60 mg l of initial pb ii fig s4 on core shell pan fe2o3 fe2o3 as a final point of comparison it is worth examining the relative accessibility of hematite in embedded and core shell composites based upon their metal uptake per gram of available iron in table 1 the maximum uptake capacity per gram of available fe is generally 40 13 higher on core shell composites relative to embedded composites i e from table 1 this value represents the average with standard deviation of the ratio of q max values in mg g fe for pan fe2o3 fe2o3 and pan fe2o3 across each of the target metals investigated however while hematite is clearly more accessible in the core shell nanofibers uptake of metals per g fe is still relatively low compared to hematite dispersions e g for as v core shell and embedded composites achieve 55 and 42 respectively of the capacity of 10 nm hematite suspensions per g of fe thus regardless of the approach used for immobilization some portion of the hematite mass in nanofiber composites is unavailable for uptake relative to suspended hematite nanoparticles and their aggregates 3 4 2 uptake rates in all systems a short interval of rapid uptake typically in the first hour or less was followed by a period of slower sorption until equilibrium was achieved figs s6a and 6b notably the rates of initially rapid uptake on pan fe2o3 fe2o3 and pan fe2o3 were roughly equivalent for all metals and these values were generally comparable to or greater than those observed for gfh media equilibrium uptake of oxyanions as v and cr vi on pan fe2o3 was achieved after 1 h while equilibrium in pan fe2o3 fe2o3 systems was reached after 2 h for uptake of cations cu ii and pb ii pan fe2o3 was first to achieve equilibrium after 2 h whereas pan fe2o3 fe2o3 reached equilibrium after 5 h for cu ii and between 5 and 12 h for pb ii figs s6c and 6d in comparison gfh media had reached 50 uptake of all metals within 2 4 h and equilibrium was typically attained over 12 24 h 3 4 3 ph edge ph dependent sorption was assessed from ph 6 to 8 at relatively low initial concentrations compared to those used in isotherms 4 mg l as v 3 mg l cr vi 0 6 mg l cu ii and 3 mg l pb ii these results are shown in fig s7 for oxyanions and fig s8 for cations along with predominance diagrams for each metal over this ph range for anionic as v and cr vi sorption generally decreased with increasing ph on pan fe2o3 pan fe2o3 fe2o3 and gfh media consistent with prior reports for anion sorption on hematite i e anion uptake diminishes as the hematite surface grows more negatively charged at higher ph ajouyed et al 2010 campos and büchler 2005 martin et al 2014 mohan and pittman 2007 as with isotherms pan fe2o3 fe2o3 bound the most as v per unit surface area and also exhibited greater capacity than pan fe2o3 when sorbed as v concentrations were normalized by total sorbent mass and the mass of available fe gfh media exhibited the most uptake per unit sorbent and fe mass of all sorbents considered for uptake of cationic cu ii and pb ii the two types of composite nanofibers generally resulted in the greatest metal uptake across all ph values both for adsorption per unit surface area and on the basis of total sorbent mass and available fe a notable difference from observed performance trends for oxyanion uptake was that at the metal concentrations used in ph edge experiments lower than those in isotherms pan fe2o3 adsorbed comparable or more metal cations per unit surface area than pan fe2o3 fe2o3 there were also differences in performance of the materials toward each cation for cu ii sorption increased modestly on all sorbents but typically by no more than two fold from ph 6 to ph 7 this behavior is once again consistent with that typically observed for cation binding on more traditional iron oxide sorbents peacock and sherman 2004 pb ii uptake as a function of ph varied across the different materials pb ii uptake was relatively low on unmodified pan from ph 6 to 7 but increased nearly four fold at ph 8 to surface area normalized pb ii concentrations that rivaled nanofiber composites in contrast sorption of pb ii on pan fe2o3 fe2o3 decreased monotonically albeit only slightly from ph 6 to 8 pan fe2o3 exhibited a maximum in pb ii uptake at ph 6 5 behavior that was also observed for gfh media notably for pb ii a clear increase in adsorption is often reported with increasing ph on iron oxides barton et al 2011 shipley et al 2013 behavior that was not pronounced on our composites again this may relate to the ability of pan functionalities to influence pb ii binding particularly at higher ph values 3 4 4 competitive sorption in mixtures of as v and cr vi sorption of as v was largely unaffected fig s9a but uptake of cr vi was inhibited considerably for all materials and ph values fig s9b for pan fe2o3 cr vi uptake generally decreased three to four fold which was comparable to the extent of inhibition observed in suspensions of 10 nm α fe2o3 pan fe2o3 fe2o3 exhibited a five fold decrease in cr vi uptake in the presence of as v indeed previous studies have shown as v and cr vi to compete directly for surface sites on iron oxide with as v prevailing in equilibrium systems khaodhiar et al 2000 neither mixtures of as v and cu ii oxyanion cation nor cu ii and pb ii cation cation resulted in inhibition as discussed more extensively in the si fig s10 suggesting reasonable versatility for composite materials when applied to mixed metal systems 3 5 reactive filtration studies with model and authentic groundwater 3 5 1 filtration in model water systems a filter consisting of 100 mg of pan fe2o3 1 4 m2 available surface area was evaluated at ph 6 with 10 mm mes buffer against an influent of 100 ppb as v i e 10 times the epa mcl and 100 ppb cr vi i e equal to the epa mcl both as v and cr vi were immediately detectable in effluent with effluent concentrations 80 and 60 of influent respectively after the first 100 ml of water treated fig 5 similarly in a separate trial with exposure to 300 ppb pb ii i e 20 times the epa action level pb ii was detected at 60 of influent within the first 100 ml comparable evaluation of a 100 mg filter 2 8 m2 available surface area of core shell pan fe2o3 fe2o3 at ph 6 revealed significantly improved metal removal as v remained below detection limits 10 μg as l over the first 1500 ml treated cr vi remained below detection limits 6 μg cr l for the first 700 ml and pb ii exceeded detection limits 10 μg pb l after 400 ml fig 5 it is notable that the improved performance of the core shell composites in flow through systems far exceeds expectations from their performance relative to embedded composites in batch systems for example in table 1 the capacity for as v measured from isotherms was only 3 6 fold greater for pan fe2o3 fe2o3 relative to pan fe2o3 in closed batch systems under flow however pan fe2o3 fe2o3 could effectively treat at least 15 fold greater volumes of water to as v levels below detection thus in flow through treatment systems where metal removal occurs over much shorter contact times estimated 1 s for filter systems presented herein the location of the hematite in the composite is an even more important factor in performance with the external α fe2o3 shell on pan fe2o3 fe2o3 appearing markedly better for such applications unexpectedly as v did not adversely impact uptake of cr vi in flow through as breakthrough curves for solutions with only cr vi were comparable to that observed with an oxyanion mixed influent fig 5 this is another difference from results in closed batch systems and we assume that conditions under flow do not allow sufficient time for as v to displace cr vi from available binding sites i e sorption in these filters is kinetically rather than thermodynamically controlled notably the levels of sorption achieved after exposure to 4 l of 100 ppb as 100 ppb cr mixed influent i e 2 9 mg as v g and 0 7 mg cr vi g were lower than the sorption capacities measured in batch isotherms 5 0 and 3 9 mg g respectively further while effluent as v did not ever reach influent concentration during the 4 l experiment effluent cr vi matched influent concentrations after treatment of 1500 ml thus it appears that a large number of sites responsible for cr vi sorption at equilibrium i e in batch were inaccessible in the kinetically limited flow through system as a final demonstration we confirmed that the filter removal capacity could be increased by increasing the filter thickness for example we were able to double the volume of water treated before detection of pb ii in the effluent to 900 ml by simply doubling the amount of pan fe2o3 fe2o3 used to 200 mg pan fe2o3 fe2o3 with 5 7 m2 available surface area fig 6 a the amount of pb ii uptake achieved during this flow through experiment was 3 9 mg pb ii g much less than the sorption capacity determined in batch isotherms 31 mg g though the filter remained below saturation at the end of the experiment i e effluent pb ii never equaled the influent concentration 3 5 2 filter regeneration on pan fe2o3 fe2o3 both as v and cr vi sorption proved partially reversible as 15 20 of the sorbed pb ii as v and cr vi could be released into the effluent by passing clean buffer ph 6 10 mm mes through the filter at the end of a filter trial the limited reversibility of metal uptake is encouraging as a used filter is not likely to become a significant metal source if influent quality improves as expected additional testing after this buffer rinse demonstrated little additional filter capacity for as v and cr vi fig 6 larger than expected pb ii removal after this buffer wash likely reflects the considerable number of sites that remained available for pb ii binding at the end of the first trial more aggressive regenerative treatments were also explored alkaline regeneration with 1 l of 0 05 m naoh which has previously proven effective bailey et al 1992 mohan and pittman 2007 zhang et al 2004 resulted in the release of 85 of bound as v and 60 of bound cr vi accordingly metal removal with the alkaline regenerated filter was close to that of a new pristine filter fig 6b and c for pb ii treatment with 1 l of 0 1 m hno3 lai and chen 2001 theis et al 1992 removed 50 of sorbed pb ii and was able to partially restore filter performance to levels better than observed with a simple buffer wash fig 6a 3 5 3 filtration of iowa groundwater in using a 100 mg filter of pan fe2o3 fe2o3 to treat as contaminated groundwater as was not immediately detectable in the treated effluent but performance was poorer than observed in idealized buffer systems 10 mm mes at ph 6 for mason city groundwater 103 ppb as as was detectable in effluent after 1200 ml of treatment while as in clear lake groundwater was detectable much more rapidly after only 400 ml fig 7 a for clear lake groundwater samples 112 ppb as the breakthrough curve noticeably plateaued at a concentration roughly 80 of the influent this can be attributed to a pseudo steady state condition hanna et al 2014 where a constant rate of uptake for a portion of the total available as with as v predominantly present as haso4 2 is fast relative to flow through the filter after initial breakthrough adeel and luthy 1995 due to the higher ph of both groundwater samples relative to our model systems ph 8 5 groundwater versus ph 6 buffer we expected as to break through earlier in groundwater samples when using the same amount of filter material at ph 8 5 the surface of the pan fe2o3 fe2o3 becomes more negatively charged and thus less attractive to oxyanions like aso4 3 as we observed in ph edge experiments see fig s7 we suspect that the extensive differences in as breakthrough for the two groundwater samples may indicate that co solutes e g carbonate co3 2 and phosphate po4 3 can interfere with as uptake on pan fe2o3 fe2o3 as has been reported elsewhere for iron oxides jain and loeppert 2000 luther et al 2012 because as v and cr vi competed for sites on pan fe2o3 fe2o3 fig s9 as they would on pure α fe2o3 it is likely that previously reported effects of such non target co solutes can also be anticipated for the core shell material in such instances we anticipate that the mass of pan fe2o3 fe2o3 filter could be increased to increase sorption of metals in complex water matrices where inhibition from co solutes may occur another major component of the groundwater samples was particulate matter presumably arising from colloidal iron which may have associated as resulting in turbid groundwater initially 22 ntu in addition to as removal pan fe2o3 fe2o3 filters simultaneously lowered the turbidity of the treated effluent after 4 l to 0 2 ntu and removed 20 mg of suspended solids from each groundwater sample that left a visible layer of solids fig 7b while producing a cleaner finished water this also presents a challenge in terms of colloidal fouling and regeneration thus in such combined sorption and particulate filtration applications the core shell materials produced herein are likely best viewed as a single use i e non reusable technology nevertheless we are encouraged by these performance results during simulated point of use treatment for example assuming a resident of mason city ia drinks 39 ounces of water per day the average for u s adults between 2005 and 2010 drewnowski et al 2013 only 35 g less than a tenth of a pound of pan fe2o3 fe2o3 filters would be needed to reduce as below the epa maximum contaminant limit mcl for one year 4 conclusion electrospinning enabled the facile synthesis of a mechanically stable nanofiber network while hydrothermal treatment achieved a surface coating of α fe2o3 nanostructures that increased the reactive surface area available for uptake of dissolved metals composite nanofibers remained flexible and robust after hydrothermal treatment as supported by strength testing and the hydrothermal approach should be readily scalable because it does not require high pressure i e above 1 atm or temperature i e above 100 c performance of embedded pan fe2o3 and core shell pan fe2o3 fe2o3 composites for adsorption of as v cr vi cu ii and pb ii generally matched expectations from more traditional iron oxide sorbents across a range of initial metal concentrations and ph values initial rates and surface area normalized capacities for metal uptake on pan fe2o3 and pan fe2o3 fe2o3 were comparable to those measured in a suspension of 10 nm fe2o3 nanoparticles and with a commercially available iron oxide marketed for water treatment core shell pan fe2o3 fe2o3 significantly outperformed pan fe2o3 in flow through treatment systems for as v cr vi and pb ii illustrating the need for readily accessible surface binding sites in kinetically limited reactive filtration systems notably core shell nanofibers performed far better than embedded composites than anticipated from their relative performance in batch systems at thermodynamic equilibrium highlighting the importance of testing and demonstrating nanoenabled technologies under conditions most representative of their application platform in tests with as and particulate contaminated groundwater pan fe2o3 fe2o3 achieved simultaneous removal of as and suspended solids demonstrating its viability for combined sorption and filtration treatment applications

19221,sediment capping with activated carbon ac is an effective technique used in remediation of contaminated sediments but the ecological effects on benthic microbial activity and meiofauna communities have been largely neglected this study presents results from a 4 week experiment investigating the influence of two powdered ac materials bituminous coal based and coconut shell derived and one control material clay on biogeochemical processes and meiofauna in contaminated sediments capping with ac induced a 62 63 decrease in denitrification and a 66 87 decrease in dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra sediment porewater ph increased from 7 1 to 9 0 and 9 7 after addition of bituminous ac and biomass derived ac respectively high ph 8 persisted for at least two weeks in the bituminous ac and for at least 24 days in the coconut based ac while capping with clay had no effect on ph we observed a strong impact nitrate fluxes being halved in presence of ac on nitrification activity as nitrifiers are sensitive to high ph this partly explains the significant decrease in nitrate reduction rates since denitrification was almost entirely coupled to nitrification total benthic metabolism estimated by sediment oxygen uptake was reduced by 30 and 43 in presence of bituminous coal based ac and coconut shell derived ac respectively meiofauna abundances decreased by 60 62 in the ac treatments taken together these observations suggest that ac amendments deplete natural organic carbon intended as food to heterotrophic benthic communities phosphate efflux was 91 lower in presence of bituminous ac compared to untreated sediment probably due to its content of aluminum al oxides which have high affinity for phosphate this study demonstrates that capping with powdered ac produces significant effects on benthic biogeochemical fluxes microbial processes and meiofauna abundances which are likely due to an increase in porewater ph and to the sequestration of natural sedimentary organic matter by ac particles graphical abstract image 1 keywords sediment remediation restoration microbial activity nitrogen ph phosphorus 1 introduction sediments represent the largest ecosystem on earth in spatial coverage and metabolize large amounts of settling organic matter and pollutants through the activity of living benthic macro and microorganisms atlas 1981 middelburg et al 1993 thermodynamically oxygen and nitrate are the most valuable electron acceptors for organic matter degradation canfield et al 2005 most of benthic microbes are thus confined to surface sediments where oxygen and nitrate are available and organic matter quality and quantity peaks inorganic compounds such as nitrate ammonium phosphate and silicate are products of microbial degradation of organic matter and may be either sequestered in the sediment by geochemical processes or be released to the water column and assimilated as nutrients by microorganisms and primary producers and be retained in the food web benthic invertebrates also play a primary role in the transformation of organic matter and in the mobilization of solutes in the sediment through bioturbation and bioirrigation aller and aller 1992 kristensen 2000 nascimento et al 2012 meiofauna i e invertebrates with dimensions between 40 μm and 1 mm are the most abundant and diverse group of benthic metazoans rex et al 2006 despite their abundance and richness the functional role of meiofauna in marine ecosystem has been overlooked as most studies have prioritized the investigation of macrofauna i e invertebrates larger than 1 mm however meiofauna have recently been shown to mediate vital ecosystem functions such as the degradation of organic matter nascimento et al 2012 and denitrification bonaglia et al 2014b in aquatic sediments marine sediments are major repositories for metals and persistent organic pollutants pops derived from human activities these pollutants include dioxins polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs environmental contamination by pops and metals may be toxic to marine life and also impact important geochemical processes mediated by specialized microbes and thus compromise the natural recovery capacity of the ecosystems islam and tanaka 2004 remediation of human origin pollution is becoming a necessity in order to decrease ecological and human health risks and to meet sediment quality criteria remediation techniques generally consist in monitored natural recovery dredging mechanical removal of contaminated sediment or capping sediment isolation through covering with clean materials förstner and apitz 2007 dredging is expensive and time consuming it completely removes benthic biota and may negatively affect water quality fathollahzadeh et al 2015 classic isolation techniques with geo textiles and thick layer caps are also highly disruptive and associated with high costs as such researchers have in the last two decades focused on less expensive and less invasive thin layer capping techniques utilizing sorbent materials and especially activated carbon ac choi et al 2016 ghosh et al 2011 perelo 2010 source material for activated carbon can be derived either from coals such as bitumen or anthracite or from natural biomass e g wood seeds fruit shells these materials undergo pyrolysis and are chemically activated to enhance their surface to volume ratio marsh and reinoso 2006 and thus their reactivity the greater efficiency of powdered compared to granular ac is related to the higher probability for a diffusing contaminant to interact with powdered forms as the average distance between powder particles is much lower than that of granular materials in the media thus increasing the probability and rate of interactions zimmerman et al 2005 the efficiency of the ac materials to bind pollutants is thus inversely proportional to their particle size werner et al 2006 zimmerman et al 2005 however at longer time scales e g decades the effect of particle size becomes less apparent as sorption equilibrium will be approached werner et al 2006 recent research into sediment remediation has found that ac may cause secondary negative effects on benthic organisms two recent studies following ac capping efforts in situ demonstrated that macrofauna living in the sediment was drastically reduced cornelissen et al 2011 samuelsson et al 2015 slightly larger particle sizes are usually advised for sediment remediation applications because they induce less secondary effects compared to finer ac particles janssen and beckingham 2013 negative effects of powdered ac on macro benthic invertebrates have been observed in several studies and include decreased survival rates growth rates and lipid content as well as behavioral changes abel et al 2017 janssen and beckingham 2013 näslund et al 2012 nybom et al 2015 2016 capping with sediment clay is expected to produce less ecological impacts than ac capping but in case of remediation treatments this should be weighed against its low efficiency in reducing pop fluxes specifically from bioturbated sediments lin et al 2018 the effects of ac amendment on sediment microorganisms and meiofauna remain lesser known apparently adsorption of pcbs by granular ac seems to affect bacterial transformation of pcbs in sediments kjellerup et al 2014 but no detrimental ac effects were observed on bacterial community structure and functions in contaminated soil meynet et al 2012 only one study so far has addressed the impact of thin layer capping on bacterial production and community composition in sediments but potential mechanisms causing secondary effects were not addressed näslund et al 2012 thermally activated carbonaceous materials have been shown to potentially raise the ph of solutions by one to three units mohan and pittman jr 2006 dependent on in situ water chemistry the effects of thin layer capping on ph needs therefore to be evaluated further before ac can be used for sediment remediation applications furthermore there is an urgent need to investigate the effects of ac capping on oxygen and nutrients i e nitrogen phosphorus silicon availability which may affect vital biogeochemical processes the overall goal of this study was to assess whether ac capping influences microbial activity and meiofaunal survival in marine sediments this was assessed during a 4 week incubation experiment where sediments collected in a contaminated harbor area oskarshamn baltic sea were exposed to two different powdered ac capping materials from bitumen and coconut shells and one capping control material clay powder the treated sediments were compared to non capped control sediment cores micro distribution of sediment oxygen and ph fluxes of nutrients along with meiofauna abundance and rates of key bacterial processes were quantified this work aimed at filling important gaps in knowledge on the effects of powered ac on sediment geochemistry and microbial ecology and to advance our knowledge on possible negative secondary effects during sediment remediation with ac 2

metals pcbs and pahs björinger 2012 the contamination stems from past point sources including a battery factory a copper refinery shipyards and communal sewage the benthic community of this site is dominated by chironomids the polychaete hediste diversicolor and a few tolerant mollusk species typical of a low biodiversity disturbed community the harbor is a source of metals zinc copper lead arsenic cadmium and cobalt pcbs and dioxins into the baltic proper tobiasson and andersson 2013 currently 500 000 m3 of contaminated harbor sediments are dredged from the inner harbor with the aim to decrease transport of contaminants from the harbor to the baltic sea fathollahzadeh et al 2015 the sediment was collected using a modified box corer jonasson and olausson 1966 box cores with intact sediment were sub sampled on deck by inserting transparent plastic tubes n 27 inner diameter 4 6 cm length 30 cm directly into the box core and retrieving them half filled with undisturbed sediment and half with in situ bottom water in situ temperature was 9 c salinity was 7 1 and dissolved oxygen o2 saturation was 95 corresponding to 340 μm o2 additional bottom water was collected using a 20 l niskin water sampler samples were then transported to stockholm university at in situ temperature where they were processed within 16 h after collection in the lab the sediment cores were placed in a 30 l incubation tank filled with bottom water aquarium pumps and air stones were added to the tank to keep the solute distribution in the water overlying the sediment cores homogeneous and to maintain the water fully oxygenated one sediment core was sliced at 0 5 cm intervals and sediment samples analyzed for water content porosity and organic matter content loss on ignition loi additionally the top 1 cm slice was centrifuged and the supernatant filtered and frozen for porewater ammonium concentrations bonaglia et al 2014a the sediment cores were subsequently pre incubated in the dark and at constant temperature 9 c for five days approximately 30 of the water inside the water tank was replaced by in situ water twice a week to avoid excess buildup of waste products from the benthic metabolism following sediment capping section 2 2 the experiment was run for 28 days to test for the short term effect of capping on sediment metabolism sediment microprofiling for o2 and ph distribution were performed repeatedly during the experiment section 2 3 and whole core incubations were used to determine solute fluxes section 2 4 table 1 two days before termination of the experiment a whole core incubation experiment with addition of 15n nitrate was performed to determine nitrate reduction rates section 2 5 table 1 the experiment was terminated and sediments from each replicate were sieved and preserved for the analyses of meiofaunal community structure section 2 6 table 1 2 2 capping materials and application to the sediment thin layer sediment capping was performed using two ac materials from jacobi carbons ab kalmar sweden the first material consisted of bituminous coal based powdered ac aquasorb bp2 pac s while the second was powdered ac made of coconut shells aquasorb cp2 pac s both ac materials had the same particle size range d50 15 35 μm and their efficiency to bind pops has been previously demonstrated amstaetter et al 2012 a third material clay was used as a control for the effect of sediment capping this natural non polluted sediment clay was collected from an offshore station in the baltic proper average clay particle size was comparable to the size of the ac particles each material was weighed 2 5 g pre wetted and added to each of six replicate sediment cores resulting in a cap of ac or clay with a dose of 1 5 kg m 2 and a thickness of 4 6 mm values comparable to previous thin layer capping efforts abel et al 2017 cornelissen et al 2012 following the amendments the sediment cores n 24 were thus allocated to four treatments i e 1 the bituminous based ac treatment ac b 2 the coconut based ac treatment ac c 3 the clay treatment clay 4 the control treatment without capping ctrl structure and elemental composition of the three capping materials used for sediment capping were investigated by high resolution scanning electron microscopy sem jeol jsm 7000f equipped with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer eds oxford instruments both secondary and backscattered electron images and x ray spectra were recorded using an accelerating voltage of 15 kv and working distance of 10 mm the x ray spectra analyses were performed using the inca program package oxford instruments buckinghamshire uk briefly an aliquot of the capping materials was pelletized to render the surface smooth a site of interest of 2 5 2 5 mm

two randomly selected sediment cores from each treatment revsbech 1989 revsbech and jorgensen 1986 each sediment core was transferred to a temperature controlled aquarium microprofiles were measured by mounting single sensors on a computer controlled microprofiling unit unisense denmark oxygen was measured at a depth resolution of 200 μm and ph at a resolution of 400 μm during the measurements the overlying water was gently circulated with an air stone to ensure the establishment of a steady diffusive boundary layer dbl on the sediment surface oxygen penetration depth opd was defined as the distance between the sediment water interface and the depth of onset anoxia o2 1 μm diffusive oxygen uptake dou of the sediment was calculated from the oxygen depth profiles using fick s first law corrected for the sediment porosity dou ϕ ds d o2 dx where ϕ is the porosity of the sediment ds is the molecular diffusion coefficient for o2 in the sediment and d o2 dx indicates the variation of o2 concentration with depth in the linear interval below the sediment water interface sediment porosity vol vol was determined from density and water content of 5 mm thick sediment slices the molecular diffusion coefficient of o2 in the sediment was calculated from the diffusion coefficient in the water corrected for tortuosity 1 2ln ϕ the molecular diffusion coefficient in the water was calculated for the specific temperature 9 c and salinity 7 1 of the incubations using the marelac utility package developed in r soetaert et al 2010 which is based on the equations presented in boudreau 1997 2 4 sediment core incubation for solute fluxes a series of core incubation experiments were carried out to test the effect of sediment capping by ac on solute fluxes at the sediment water interface the incubation procedure followed the protocol of bonaglia et al 2017 briefly sediment cores n 24 received teflon coated stirring devices to ensure a well mixed water column and a stable dbl during incubations the cores were then sealed with rubber stoppers while avoiding trapping of gas bubbles in the water phase samples for o2 and nutrients were collected at the incubation start and end incubation time 8 h concentrations of o2 were measured directly in each microcosm using a microsensor samples for dissolved nutrients i e ammonium nh4 nitrate nitrite nox no3 no2 phosphate po4 3 and silica h2sio4 were immediately filtered using 0 2 μm polyethersulfone pes filters concentrations of nutrients were determined with colorimetric analysis on a segmented flow nutrient analyzer system oi analytical flow solution iv 2 5 sediment core incubation for nitrate reduction pathways following the flux incubation a second sediment core incubation experiment was carried out to determine rates of denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra according to the isotope pairing technique ipt nielsen 1992 briefly 200 ml of a 9 mm 15no3 99 4 15n atom solution was added to the tank s water to reach a concentration of ca 40 μm 15no3 triplicate water samples were collected from the tank before and after addition of no3 filtered pes 0 2 μm and refrigerated for later analysis to calculate 15no3 enrichment see below sediment cores were pre incubated uncapped overnight ca 8 h to establish a linear production of 29n2 and 30n2 in the sediment dalsgaard et al 2000 two cores were sacrificed to measure background concentrations of 29n2 and 30n2 while the remaining cores n 24 were capped with butyl rubber stoppers while avoiding bubbles and incubated with stirring for 8 h the incubation was terminated by uncapping the cores and gently mixing water and sediment in each core to slurry a plastic syringe with a 10 cm long tubing was used to sample 20 ml slurry which was allowed to overflow in a 12 ml exetainer the sample was immediately poisoned with 200 μl of a 37 formaldehyde solution for later analysis of 29n2 and 30n2 an additional poisoned slurry sample 10 ml was sampled dosed with 1 g kcl 1 3 m shaken for 30 min centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min filtered and frozen at 20 c this sample was used for analysis of the 15nh4 fraction in the ammonium pool after conversion of 15nh4 to 30n2 using hypobromite in exetainer vials warembourg 1993 the concentrations of 29n2 and 30n2 were determined by gas chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometry gc irms injecting headspace samples manually bonaglia et al 2014a dalsgaard et al 2000 2 6 analyses of meiofauna following the two incubation experiments all sediment cores were sieved sequentially through 1000 and 40 μm sieves to retrieve macrofauna and meiofauna respectively the 40 μm sediment fraction was preserved in 4 buffered formaldehyde and the meiofauna extracted by density extraction using a levasil colloidal silica akzonobel n v solution with a density of 1 21 kg dm 3 bonaglia et al 2014b briefly each 40 μm fraction was left in an erlenmeyer flask with levasil solution for 5 min the top part of the solution containing meiofauna was decanted and washed with seawater this extraction procedure was repeated twice and was followed by a third extraction that lasted 20 min the extracts were sorted to count and classify meiofauna to the group level using a binocular stereo microscope leica m80 at 60 magnification 2 7 calculations and statistical analyses total oxygen uptake tou and fluxes

sem revealed that the two ac materials presented both nanometer sized and micrometer sized pores fig 1 a and fig 1b the coconut based ac ac c has smoother surfaces whereas the bitumen based ac ac b has more fragmented surfaces with featured pores in the nanometer scale and thus potentially a larger surface to volume ratio fig 1 the clay material had a different structure and was characterized by randomly oriented exfoliated sheets often resulting in pointy sharps while pores could not be detected fig 1c elemental composition of the two ac materials was similar and was dominated by c mean 87

depth layer of oskarshamn harbor sediment this sediment had an average organic carbon content of 18 1 loi water content of 83 8 and porosity of 0 85 porewater nh4 concentration in the top 1 cm sediment layer was 151 μm in situ bottom water nutrient concentrations were 2 2 μm nh4 2 4 μm nox 0 8 μm po4 3 and 54 9 μm h2sio4 oxygen concentration microprofiles showed that o2 was always consumed and not produced in the sediment and that total o2 respiration was confined to a 0 5 mm thick layer below the water sediment interface fig 2 at the beginning of the experiment one day after the capping oxygen penetration depth opd in ctrl was 0 42 0 04 cm and it was reduced to 0 26 0 00 0 35 0 02 and 0 40 0 00 cm in ac b ac c and clay respectively fig 2 opd in ac b was significantly lower than in clay and ctrl p 0 002 table 1 after 24 days of exposure to the capping materials opd was higher in the ac treatments being 0 42 0 02 and 0 46 0 05 cm in ac b and ac c respectively compared to clay and ctrl which had opds of 0 33 0 04 and 0 39 0 01 cm respectively fig 2 this last difference however was not statistically significant p 0 05 table 1 at the beginning of the experiment day 1 microprofiles of ph in ctrl and clay showed that ph decreased sharply downward through the sediment water interface reaching a minimum ph 7 7 5 between 0 5 and 1 cm and increased with depth below this layer to stabilize at 7 5 7 8 below 1 5 cm depth fig 3 the ph profiles in ac amended sediments displayed an opposite pattern where ph increased in the first 1 5 cm below the sediment water interface reaching maximum at 0 3 0 4 cm depth ph 9 7 and 9 0 for ac b and ac c respectively fig 3 with a 0 4 0 6 cm capping layer it results that the ph peaked in the middle of the ac cap after 7 days the initially observed ph trends were still apparent although less pronounced ctrl and clay had a subsurface ph minimum ph 7 followed by a steady increase and stabilized at ph 7 5 while ac b and ac c had an evident subsurface ph maximum ph 8 5 8 9 followed by a decrease and stabilization at ph 7 8 fig 3 the ph profiles in ctrl and clay did not change between 7 and 14 days after experiment start while in the active cap layers the ph peak decreased to ph 8 1 and 8 4 in ac b and ac c respectively fig 3 after 24 days of exposure ctrl clay and ac b ph profiles all had a very similar shape while ac c maintained a relatively high ph 8 2 and constant value from the water down to 0 6 cm sediment depth and showed a minimum ph 7 at 1 cm depth fig 3 3 2 effects on nutrient and oxygen fluxes after 25 days of exposure to the capping materials differences in dissolved nutrient fluxes among treatments were statistically significant p 0 05 table 1 with the exception of ammonium fluxes which showed too much variability among replicates to result significant p 0 05 table 1 fig 4 fluxes of nitrate nitrite sum were 45 and 53 lower in ac b and ac c respectively than in ctrl p 0 001 table 1 fig 4 while fluxes in clay were 20 lower than in ctrl but this difference was not significant p 0 05 table 1 fig 4 efflux of phosphate was 91 lower in ac b 66 lower in ac c and 19 higher in clay compared to ctrl

compared to ctrl table 1 fig 4 clay although causing a 20 reduction did not significantly affect total oxygen demand p 0 05 table 1 fig 4 at day 1 diffusive oxygen uptake dou differed significantly among treatments p 0 001 table 1 and was 70 and 46 higher in the ac b and ac c respectively than in ctrl fig 4 at day 25 the trend was reversed and dou became significantly lower 44 reduction in ac b compared to ctrl p 0 03 table 1 fig 4 while ac c and clay 30 and 33 reduction respectively did not result in significant changes p 0 05 table 1 fig 4 3 3 effects on nitrate reduction pathways after 26 days of exposure to the capping materials rates of total denitrification denitrification coupled to nitrification dn denitrification of nitrate diffusing from the water column into the sediment dw and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra were significantly different among treatments p 0 05 table 1 denitrification and dn rates were approximately three times lower in ac b 63 reduction and ac c 62 reduction compared to ctrl fig 5 resulting in significant differences between ac b and ac c compared to clay and ctrl p 0 001 table 1 rates of dnra were significantly lower in ac b 66 reduction and ac c 87 reduction compared to ctrl p 0 001 table 1 clay did not induce any significant change in nitrate reduction pathways compared to ctrl p 0 05 table 1 in all treatments

ostracoda were not significantly affected by ac amendments p 0 05 suppl table 4 in addition the pcoa of meiofauna community composition showed that ctrl and clay cluster differently than the two ac treatments fig 6 further indicating that ac affected meiofauna community structure 4 discussion this study assessed chemical and biological effects of activated carbon ac amendment applied to contaminated sediments as a thin layer cap results from sediment core incubation experiments showed that ac capping had a significant impact on the main nitrate reduction pathways i e denitrification and dissimilatory reduction to ammonium dnra these two processes were reduced by 63 and 66 respectively in presence of bituminous coal based ac ac b and by 62 and 87 respectively in presence of coconut shell based ac ac c the drastic decline in coupling between nitrification and denitrification was the main cause for the decrease in denitrification activity suggesting a shortage in the supply of nitrate to denitrification the overall reduction in nitrate effluxes at the sediment water interface in spite of the decrease in the main nitrate removal processes in the sediment i e denitrification and dnra further indicates that nitrification activity was inhibited by ac capping together with ph oxygen and ammonium concentrations are considered the most critical environmental factors controlling nitrification activity in aquatic systems canfield et al 2005 our experiments show that dissolved oxygen concentrations did not significantly differ between treatments and that the same was true for ammonium fluxes however ac materials had a strong effect on ph in particular ph in the oxic sediment layer where nitrifiers are active increased to 9 0 in ac b and 9 7 in ac c one day after capping to 8 5 in ac b and 8 9 in ac c one week after capping and to 7 9 in ac b and 8 2 in ac c at the end of the experiment this corresponds to an increase of up to 2 7 ph units in the nitrification zone compared to uncapped or clay capped sediments which had a ph range of 7 7 5 throughout the experiment this increase in ph could be explained by leaching of alkaline compounds from the ac ash and or development of alkaline surface oxides and hydroxides produced upon thermal activation of the two carbonaceous materials mohan and pittman jr 2006 also the larger ph increase from ac c capping compared to ac b capping is consistent with the higher content of alkaline compounds like potassium oxy hydroxides in ac c shown in the elemental composition analysis in aquatic sediment nitrification is strongly influenced by ph and maximum rates have been demonstrated to occur at ph around 7 5 strauss et al 2002 in activated sludge systems ph optimum for nitrification activity ranges between 7 0 and 8 0 antoniou et al 1990 jones and paskins 1982 painter and loveless 1983 nitrosomonas one of the most naturally abundant ammonium oxidizers nh4 no2 displays maximum activity between ph 7 9 and 8 2 while nitrobacter a common nitrite oxidizer no2 no3 exhibits a ph optimum between 7 2 and 7 6 alleman 1985 villaverde et al 1997 in environments with high ph ph 8 and where ammonium reaches high concentrations a large fraction of the ammonium pool is present as free ammonia anthonisen et al 1976 ford et al 1980 the high organic content of oskarshamn sediments 18 1 loi led to high ammonium formation from organic matter mineralization resulting in porewater ammonium concentrations of ca 150 μm in the top 1 cm sediment layer these conditions have been shown to support an active and abundant population of nitrifiers canfield et al 2005 strauss et al 2002 we suggest that high ammonium and ph conditions such as those found in our ac capped sediments resulted in the inhibition of nitrification activity due to presence of free un ionized ammonia for example at ph 8 5 and at ammonium concentrations of about 150 μm free ammonia reaches concentrations of ca 50 μm ford et al 1980 which is toxic to nitrifying microorganisms and particularly to nitrobacter anthonisen et al 1976 ford et al 1980 meiklejohn 1954 this effect was evident in nitrate fluxes which were halved in the presence of ac the reduced supply of nitrate from nitrifiers may have caused the drastic decrease in nitrate reduction rates during the first two weeks after capping i e when ph was highest in the two ac treatments factors other than ph must explain the 62 87 decrease in nitrate reduction as these rates were measured approximately four weeks after capping when ph conditions at least in the ac b treatment had almost recovered one of these factors may be that labile organic carbon became less available in contact with ac which has a high density of surface sites and pores to maximize binding capacity for organic contaminants in sediments amstaetter et al 2012 ghosh et al 2011 an undesired ecological side effect may thus arise in natural benthic systems due to the potential of ac to reduce not only the bioavailability of organic contaminants but also that of natural sedimentary organic compounds such as nutritious amino fatty and humic acids quinlivan et al 2005 schreiber et al 2005 velten et al 2011 quantification of bulk organic carbon is commonly used in sediment biogeochemistry but does not discriminate between labile and refractory pools which makes it a poor indicator of bioavailable organic carbon arnosti and holmer 2003 direct measurements such as sediment oxygen uptake have been shown to be better proxies for quantification of available substrates to microbial communities in sediments glud 2008 by the end of our experiment sediment oxygen uptake was 30 43 lower in the ac treatments compared to the control uncapped sediments as the oxic zone was ca 5 mm thick and the cap layer 4 6 mm the lowered oxygen uptake was likely due to depletion of labile organic matter in the cap layer thus we suggest that the aerobic heterotrophic bacteria and denitrifiers were starved from being forced to colonize an environment consisting of almost pure ac with presumably extreme food scarcity in aquatic sediments denitrification and dnra are strictly dependent on organic substrates as they are processes that are almost exclusively carried out by heterotrophic bacteria burgin and hamilton 2007 giblin et al 2013 zumft 1997 organic compounds sorbed to soil or clay particles are generally available to heterotrophs due to weaker bonds crocker et al 1995 our results show that ac capping resulted in a 3 fold decrease in denitrification and up to an 8 fold reduction in dnra while clay capping did not have any significant effect on solute fluxes and microbial processes the latter observation is in line with evidence from a previous capping experiment näslund et al 2012 nutrient fluxes in particular those that are biologically mediated such as nitrate and silicate fluxes showed similar trends with both ac materials causing significantly lower effluxes than control sediment however ac is unlikely to have had a direct effect on nitrate and silicate concentrations as ac has a low affinity for inorganic nutrients callaway and aschehoug 2000 benthic phosphate fluxes deserve special attention as they are primarily regulated by sediment geochemistry rather than by biological activity phosphate efflux was significantly lowered by ac although only the decrease measured in the ac b was significant compared to the ctrl the more effective reduction of phosphate efflux in the ac b may be due to the different composition of the materials the bituminous ac contained substantial amounts of al probably in different phases of al oxides and hydroxides which have been shown to efficiently bind phosphate in brackish sediments rydin et al 2017 the majority of ac amendment tests in sediments that included biological endpoints have shown no effects on benthos 72 of studies but some studies found either positive 10 or negative secondary effects 18 janssen and beckingham 2013 to date studies on the ecological effects of ac capping have been limited almost exclusively to macrofauna studies meiofauna despite being orders of magnitude more abundant and having a more diverse community structure than macrofauna had only been considered in one toxicological study with ac known to the authors näslund et al 2012 the study found that sediment capping with a dose of 1 kg m 2 powdered ac from coconut shells compared to our 1 5 kg m 2 dose did not produce significant effects on meiofaunal abundance and community structure näslund et al 2012 the average abundance of nematodes the most common meiofaunal taxon was 30 lower in presence of ac than in untreated controls but their statistical analysis lacked power näslund et al 2012 our study showed that nematode populations were significantly reduced in presence of both ac b 64 abundance and ac c 66 the meiofauna community in oskarshamn sediments likely does not represent an undisturbed sediment meiofauna community because it has been pre exposed to contaminant mixtures in situ stark et al 2017 the benefit of reduced organic contaminant bioavailability by ac on our meiofaunal communities could not be seen here perhaps because recolonization by natural meiofauna communities was not possible in our enclosed chambers recent toxicity tests with benthic amphipods exposed to oskarshamn harbor sediment showed a positive impact of ac amendment on survival and reproduction rämö unpublished data however granular ac was used in those experiments the previously reported negative effects of ac on benthic macroinvertebrates include increased mortality reduced growth decreased lipid content and alterations of animal behavior janssen and beckingham 2013 in our experiment total meiofauna abundance was only 40 in ac b and 38 in ac c compared to ctrl in comparison clay amendment did not cause any significant mortality of meiofauna recent studies have shown that powdered activated carbon may be detrimental to benthic macrofauna as upon ingestion sharp ac particles may physically damage the gut microvilli of sediment deposit feeders abel et al 2017 nybom et al 2015 2016 it is possible that this mechanism i e decreased assimilation efficiency following damaged gut microvilli was responsible for the increased meiofauna mortality found in our study most of the added ac particles were in the 15 35 μm range and may have been ingested by large meiofauna for examples nematodes of the genus tripyloides have been shown to ingest 40 80 μm ciliates moens and vincx 1997 our results thus strongly suggest that both of the fine powdered acs used here also have impact on the resource acquisition and nutrition of meiobenthos it has been shown that ac efficiently adsorbs nutritious organic compounds such as humic and fulvic acids carbohydrates and proteins kilduff et al 1996 schreiber et al 2005 velten et al 2011 a novel hypothesis is therefore that ingested ac particles may reduce the uptake of nutrients from organic matter dissolved in the gut of meiofauna during digestion the fact that the small rotifers which feed on particles of 0 5 18 μm brönmark and hansson 2017 were not affected by ac in our study could support that either mechanical damages or sequestration of nutritious organic matter did not occur in these animals to the same extent as in larger meiofauna such as nematodes foraminifers and ostracods which could likely ingest larger fractions of the tested ac materials 5 conclusions we show both structural and functional effects of thin layer capping with two types of powdered ac and with clean sediment clay on microbial and meiofaunal benthic communities ac amendment resulted in significant decreases of both biologically mediated nutrient fluxes and rates of microbial processes likely due to increased ph of the porewater caused by the alkaline composition of the ac materials and depletion of natural organic matter which is required for the metabolism of most aerobic denitrifying bacteria and meiofauna irrespective of the ac material used this study suggests that sediment remediation with powdered ac may lead to harmful effects on microbial activity and meiofauna which provide vital ecosystem functions to the aquatic environment in contrast thin layer capping with clay did not harm microorganisms and meiofauna however powder ac capping significantly decreases contaminant fluxes from oskarshamn sediments while clay does not seem to be effective for remediation rämö unpublished data considering the stronger effects on sediment geochemistry and microbial functions caused by the coconut derived ac compared to the bituminous ac and clay we recommend that sediment capping with aluminum containing bituminous ac be performed in environments where internal phosphorus load represents an ecological problem in addition to organic contamination the functional effects described here are measured in more detail than in earlier studies with clear biogeochemical explanatory mechanisms however our results describe the situation from several hours to four weeks after sediment capping with activated carbon was performed at the end of the experiment the impact of the bituminous ac cap on ph was already attenuated we cannot exclude that deposition of fresh organic material on top of the ac layer would over time mitigate some of the observed effects in in situ remediation treatments we thus recommend that similar measurements be repeated in long term experiments further studies are needed to assess particle size effects on meiofauna abundances community structure and microbially mediated ecosystem functions as larger particles may produce fewer and less severe effects on these endpoints meanwhile we advise to restrict amendment with powdered ac to heavily contaminated sites where the local sediment pollution is a significant threat to the ecosystem and where less invasive methods such as capping with clay or monitored natural recovery cannot be pursued due to high risk of contaminant spread acknowledgements we acknowledge financial support through

19221,sediment capping with activated carbon ac is an effective technique used in remediation of contaminated sediments but the ecological effects on benthic microbial activity and meiofauna communities have been largely neglected this study presents results from a 4 week experiment investigating the influence of two powdered ac materials bituminous coal based and coconut shell derived and one control material clay on biogeochemical processes and meiofauna in contaminated sediments capping with ac induced a 62 63 decrease in denitrification and a 66 87 decrease in dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra sediment porewater ph increased from 7 1 to 9 0 and 9 7 after addition of bituminous ac and biomass derived ac respectively high ph 8 persisted for at least two weeks in the bituminous ac and for at least 24 days in the coconut based ac while capping with clay had no effect on ph we observed a strong impact nitrate fluxes being halved in presence of ac on nitrification activity as nitrifiers are sensitive to high ph this partly explains the significant decrease in nitrate reduction rates since denitrification was almost entirely coupled to nitrification total benthic metabolism estimated by sediment oxygen uptake was reduced by 30 and 43 in presence of bituminous coal based ac and coconut shell derived ac respectively meiofauna abundances decreased by 60 62 in the ac treatments taken together these observations suggest that ac amendments deplete natural organic carbon intended as food to heterotrophic benthic communities phosphate efflux was 91 lower in presence of bituminous ac compared to untreated sediment probably due to its content of aluminum al oxides which have high affinity for phosphate this study demonstrates that capping with powdered ac produces significant effects on benthic biogeochemical fluxes microbial processes and meiofauna abundances which are likely due to an increase in porewater ph and to the sequestration of natural sedimentary organic matter by ac particles graphical abstract image 1 keywords sediment remediation restoration microbial activity nitrogen ph phosphorus 1

investigation of macrofauna i e invertebrates larger than 1 mm however meiofauna have recently been shown to mediate vital ecosystem functions such as the degradation of organic matter nascimento et

necessity in order to decrease ecological and human health risks and to meet sediment quality criteria remediation techniques generally consist in monitored natural recovery dredging mechanical removal of contaminated sediment or capping sediment isolation through covering with clean materials förstner and apitz 2007 dredging is expensive and time consuming it completely removes benthic biota and may negatively affect water quality fathollahzadeh et al 2015 classic isolation techniques with geo textiles and thick layer caps are also highly disruptive and associated with high costs as such researchers have in the last two decades focused on less expensive and less invasive thin layer capping techniques utilizing sorbent materials and especially activated carbon ac choi et al 2016 ghosh et al 2011 perelo 2010 source material for activated carbon can be derived either from coals such as bitumen or anthracite or from natural biomass e g wood seeds fruit shells these materials undergo pyrolysis and are chemically activated to enhance their surface to volume ratio marsh and reinoso 2006 and thus their reactivity the greater efficiency of powdered compared to granular ac is related to the higher probability for a diffusing contaminant to interact with powdered forms as the average distance between powder particles is much lower than that of granular materials in the media thus increasing the probability and rate of interactions zimmerman et al 2005 the efficiency of the ac materials to bind pollutants is thus inversely proportional to their particle size werner et al 2006 zimmerman et al 2005 however at longer time scales e g decades the effect of particle size becomes less apparent as sorption equilibrium will be approached werner et al 2006 recent research into sediment remediation has found that ac may cause secondary negative effects on benthic organisms two recent studies following ac capping efforts in situ demonstrated that macrofauna living in the sediment was drastically reduced cornelissen et al 2011 samuelsson et al 2015 slightly larger particle sizes are usually advised for sediment remediation applications because they induce less secondary effects compared to finer ac particles janssen and beckingham 2013 negative effects of powdered ac on macro benthic invertebrates have been observed in several studies and include decreased survival rates growth rates and lipid content as well as behavioral changes abel et al 2017 janssen and beckingham 2013 näslund et al 2012 nybom et al 2015 2016 capping with sediment clay is expected to produce less ecological impacts than ac capping but in case of remediation treatments this should be weighed against its low efficiency in reducing pop fluxes specifically from bioturbated sediments lin et al 2018 the effects of ac amendment on sediment microorganisms and meiofauna remain lesser known apparently adsorption of pcbs by granular ac seems to affect bacterial transformation of pcbs in sediments kjellerup et al 2014 but no detrimental ac effects were observed on bacterial community structure and functions in contaminated soil meynet et al 2012 only one study so far has addressed the impact of thin layer capping on bacterial production and community composition in sediments but potential mechanisms causing secondary effects were not addressed näslund et al 2012 thermally activated carbonaceous materials have been shown to potentially raise the ph of solutions by one to three units mohan and pittman jr 2006 dependent on in situ water chemistry the effects of thin layer capping on ph needs therefore to be evaluated further before ac can be used for sediment remediation applications furthermore there is an urgent need to investigate the effects of ac capping on oxygen and nutrients i e nitrogen phosphorus silicon availability which may affect vital biogeochemical processes the overall goal of this study was to assess whether ac capping influences microbial activity and meiofaunal survival in marine sediments this was assessed during a 4 week incubation experiment where sediments collected in a contaminated harbor area oskarshamn baltic sea were exposed to two different powdered ac capping materials from bitumen and coconut shells and one capping control material clay powder the treated sediments were compared to non capped control sediment cores micro distribution of sediment oxygen and ph fluxes of nutrients along with meiofauna abundance and rates of key bacterial processes were quantified this work aimed at filling important gaps in knowledge on the effects of powered ac on sediment geochemistry and microbial ecology and to advance our knowledge on possible negative secondary effects during sediment remediation with ac 2

decrease transport of contaminants from the harbor to the baltic sea fathollahzadeh et al 2015 the sediment was collected using a modified box corer jonasson and olausson 1966 box cores with intact sediment were sub sampled on deck by inserting transparent plastic tubes n 27 inner diameter 4 6 cm length 30 cm directly into the box core and retrieving them half filled with undisturbed sediment

niskin water sampler samples were then transported to stockholm university at in situ temperature where they were processed within 16 h after collection in the lab the sediment cores were placed in a 30 l incubation tank filled with bottom water aquarium pumps and air stones were added to the tank to keep the solute distribution in the water overlying the sediment cores homogeneous and to maintain the water fully oxygenated one sediment core was sliced at 0 5 cm intervals and sediment samples analyzed for water content porosity and organic matter content loss on ignition loi additionally the top 1 cm slice was centrifuged and the supernatant filtered and frozen for porewater ammonium concentrations bonaglia et al 2014a the sediment cores were subsequently pre incubated in the dark and at constant temperature 9 c for five days approximately 30 of the water inside the water tank was replaced by in situ water twice a week to avoid excess buildup of waste products from the benthic metabolism following sediment capping section 2 2 the experiment was run for 28 days to test for the short term effect of capping on sediment metabolism sediment microprofiling for o2 and ph distribution were performed repeatedly during the experiment section 2 3 and whole core incubations were used to determine solute fluxes section 2 4 table 1 two days before termination of the experiment a whole core incubation experiment with addition of 15n nitrate was performed to determine nitrate reduction rates section 2 5 table 1 the experiment was terminated and sediments from each replicate were sieved and preserved for the analyses of meiofaunal community structure section 2 6 table 1 2 2 capping materials and application to the sediment thin layer sediment capping was performed using two ac materials from jacobi carbons ab kalmar sweden the first material consisted of bituminous coal based powdered ac aquasorb bp2 pac s while the second was powdered ac made of coconut shells aquasorb cp2 pac s both ac materials had the same particle size range d50 15 35 μm and their efficiency to bind pops has been previously demonstrated amstaetter et al 2012 a third material clay was used as a control for the effect of sediment capping this natural non polluted sediment clay was collected from an offshore station in the baltic proper average clay particle size was comparable to the size of the ac particles each material was weighed 2 5 g pre wetted and added to each of six replicate sediment cores resulting in a cap of ac or clay with a dose of 1 5 kg m 2 and a thickness of 4 6 mm values comparable to previous thin layer capping efforts abel et al 2017 cornelissen et al 2012 following the amendments the sediment cores n 24 were thus allocated to four

sediment core incubation for solute fluxes a series of core incubation experiments were carried out to test the effect of sediment capping by ac on solute fluxes at the sediment water interface the incubation procedure followed the protocol of bonaglia et al 2017 briefly sediment cores n 24 received teflon coated stirring devices to ensure a well mixed water column and a stable dbl during incubations the cores were then sealed with rubber stoppers while avoiding trapping of gas bubbles in the water phase samples for o2 and nutrients were collected at the incubation start and end

to calculate 15no3 enrichment see below sediment cores were pre incubated uncapped overnight ca 8 h to establish a linear production of 29n2 and 30n2 in the sediment dalsgaard et al 2000 two cores were sacrificed to measure background concentrations of 29n2 and 30n2 while the remaining cores n 24 were capped with butyl rubber stoppers while avoiding bubbles and incubated with stirring for 8 h the incubation was terminated by uncapping the cores and gently mixing water and sediment in each core to slurry a plastic syringe with a 10 cm long tubing was used to sample 20 ml slurry which was allowed to overflow in a 12 ml exetainer the sample was immediately poisoned with 200 μl of a 37 formaldehyde solution for later analysis of 29n2 and 30n2 an additional poisoned slurry sample 10 ml

conversion of 15nh4 to 30n2 using hypobromite in exetainer vials warembourg 1993 the concentrations of 29n2 and 30n2 were determined by gas chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometry gc irms injecting headspace samples manually bonaglia et al 2014a dalsgaard et al 2000 2 6 analyses of meiofauna following the two incubation experiments all sediment cores were sieved sequentially through 1000 and 40 μm sieves to retrieve macrofauna and meiofauna respectively the 40 μm sediment fraction was preserved in 4 buffered formaldehyde and the meiofauna extracted by density extraction using a levasil colloidal silica akzonobel n v solution with a density of 1 21 kg dm 3 bonaglia et al 2014b briefly each 40 μm fraction was left in an erlenmeyer flask with levasil solution for 5 min the top part of the solution containing meiofauna was decanted and washed with seawater this extraction procedure was repeated twice and was followed by a third extraction that lasted 20 min the extracts were sorted to count and classify meiofauna to the group level using a binocular stereo microscope leica m80 at 60 magnification 2 7 calculations and statistical analyses total oxygen uptake tou and fluxes

sem revealed that the two ac materials presented both nanometer sized and micrometer sized pores fig 1 a and fig 1b the coconut based ac ac c has smoother surfaces whereas the bitumen based ac ac b has more fragmented surfaces with featured pores in the nanometer scale and thus potentially a larger surface to volume ratio fig 1 the clay material had a different structure and was characterized by randomly oriented exfoliated sheets often resulting in pointy sharps while pores could not be detected fig 1c elemental composition of the two ac materials was similar and was dominated by c mean 87

depth layer of oskarshamn harbor sediment this sediment had an average organic carbon content of 18 1 loi water content of 83 8 and porosity of 0 85 porewater nh4 concentration in the top 1 cm sediment layer was 151 μm in situ bottom water nutrient concentrations were 2 2 μm nh4 2 4 μm nox 0 8 μm po4 3 and 54 9 μm h2sio4 oxygen concentration microprofiles showed that o2 was always consumed and not produced in the sediment and that total o2 respiration was confined to a 0 5 mm thick layer below the water sediment interface fig 2 at the beginning of the experiment one day after the capping oxygen penetration depth opd in ctrl was 0 42 0 04 cm and it was reduced to 0 26 0 00 0 35 0 02 and 0 40 0 00 cm in ac b ac c and clay respectively fig 2 opd in ac b was significantly lower

clay and ctrl which had opds of 0 33 0 04 and 0 39 0 01 cm respectively fig 2 this last difference however was not statistically significant p 0 05 table 1 at the beginning of the experiment day 1 microprofiles of ph in ctrl and clay showed that ph decreased sharply downward through the sediment water interface reaching a minimum ph 7 7 5 between 0 5 and 1 cm and increased with depth below this layer to stabilize at 7 5 7 8 below 1 5 cm depth fig 3 the ph profiles in ac amended sediments displayed an opposite pattern where ph increased in the first 1 5 cm below the sediment water interface reaching maximum at 0 3 0 4 cm depth ph 9 7 and 9 0 for ac b and ac c respectively fig 3 with a 0 4 0 6 cm capping layer it results that the ph peaked in the middle of the ac cap after 7 days the initially observed ph trends were still apparent although less pronounced ctrl and clay had a subsurface ph minimum ph 7 followed by a steady increase and stabilized at ph 7 5 while ac b and ac c had an evident subsurface ph maximum ph 8 5 8 9 followed by a decrease and stabilization at ph 7 8 fig 3 the ph profiles in ctrl and clay did not change between 7 and 14 days after experiment start while in the active cap layers the ph peak decreased to ph 8 1 and 8 4 in ac b and ac c respectively fig 3 after 24 days of exposure ctrl clay and ac b ph profiles all had a very similar shape while ac c maintained a relatively high ph 8 2 and constant value from the water down to 0 6 cm sediment depth and showed a minimum ph 7 at 1 cm depth fig 3 3 2 effects on nutrient and oxygen fluxes after 25

much variability among replicates to result significant p 0 05 table 1 fig 4 fluxes of nitrate nitrite sum were 45 and 53 lower in ac b and ac c respectively than in ctrl p 0 001 table 1 fig 4 while

compared to ctrl table 1 fig 4 clay although causing a 20 reduction did not significantly affect total oxygen demand p 0 05 table 1 fig 4 at day 1 diffusive oxygen uptake dou differed significantly among treatments p 0 001 table 1 and was 70 and 46 higher in the ac b and ac c respectively than in ctrl fig 4 at day 25 the trend was reversed and dou became significantly lower 44 reduction in ac b compared to ctrl p 0 03 table 1 fig 4 while ac c and clay 30 and 33 reduction respectively did not result in significant changes p 0 05 table 1 fig 4 3 3 effects on nitrate reduction pathways after 26 days of exposure to the capping materials rates of total denitrification denitrification coupled to nitrification dn denitrification of nitrate diffusing from the water column into the sediment dw and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra were significantly different among treatments p 0 05 table 1 denitrification and dn rates were approximately three times lower in ac b 63 reduction and

ostracoda were not significantly affected by ac amendments p 0 05 suppl table 4 in addition the pcoa of meiofauna community composition showed that ctrl and clay cluster differently than the two ac treatments fig 6 further indicating that ac affected meiofauna community structure 4 discussion this study assessed chemical and biological effects of activated carbon ac amendment applied to contaminated sediments as a thin layer cap results from sediment core incubation experiments showed that ac capping had a significant impact on the main nitrate reduction pathways i e denitrification and dissimilatory reduction to ammonium dnra these two processes were reduced by 63 and 66 respectively in presence of bituminous coal based ac ac b and by 62 and 87 respectively in presence of coconut shell based ac ac c the drastic decline in coupling between nitrification and denitrification was the main cause for the decrease in denitrification activity suggesting a shortage in the supply of nitrate to denitrification the overall reduction in nitrate effluxes at the sediment water interface in spite of the decrease in the main nitrate removal processes in the sediment i e denitrification and dnra further indicates that nitrification activity was inhibited by ac capping together with ph oxygen and ammonium concentrations are considered the most critical environmental factors controlling nitrification activity in aquatic systems canfield et al 2005 our experiments show that dissolved oxygen concentrations did not significantly differ between treatments and that the same was true for ammonium fluxes however ac materials had a strong effect on ph in particular ph in the oxic sediment layer where nitrifiers are active increased to 9 0 in ac b and 9 7 in ac c one day after capping to 8 5 in ac b and 8 9 in ac c one week after capping and to 7 9 in ac b and 8 2 in ac c at the end of the experiment this corresponds to an increase of up to 2 7 ph units in the nitrification zone compared to uncapped or clay capped sediments which had a ph range of 7 7 5 throughout the experiment this increase in ph could be explained by leaching of alkaline compounds from the ac ash and or development of alkaline surface oxides and hydroxides produced upon thermal activation of the two carbonaceous materials mohan and pittman jr 2006 also the larger ph increase from ac c capping compared to ac b capping is consistent with the higher content of alkaline compounds like potassium oxy hydroxides in ac c shown in the elemental composition analysis in aquatic sediment nitrification is strongly influenced by ph and maximum rates have been demonstrated to occur at ph around 7 5 strauss et al 2002 in activated sludge systems ph optimum for nitrification activity ranges between 7 0 and 8 0 antoniou et al 1990 jones and paskins 1982 painter and loveless 1983 nitrosomonas one of the most naturally abundant ammonium oxidizers nh4 no2 displays maximum activity between ph 7 9 and 8 2 while nitrobacter a common nitrite oxidizer no2 no3 exhibits a ph optimum between 7 2 and 7 6 alleman 1985 villaverde et al 1997 in environments with high ph ph 8 and where ammonium reaches high concentrations a large fraction of the ammonium pool is present as free ammonia anthonisen et al 1976 ford et al 1980 the high organic content of oskarshamn sediments 18 1 loi led to high ammonium formation from organic matter mineralization resulting in porewater ammonium concentrations of ca 150 μm in the top 1 cm sediment layer these conditions have been shown to support an active and abundant population of nitrifiers canfield et al 2005 strauss et al 2002 we suggest that high ammonium and ph conditions such as those found in our ac capped sediments resulted in the inhibition of nitrification activity due to presence of free un ionized ammonia for example at ph 8 5 and at ammonium concentrations of about 150 μm free ammonia reaches concentrations of ca 50 μm ford et al 1980 which is toxic to nitrifying microorganisms and particularly to nitrobacter anthonisen et al 1976 ford et al 1980 meiklejohn 1954 this effect was evident in nitrate fluxes which were halved in the presence of ac the reduced supply of nitrate from nitrifiers may have caused the drastic decrease in nitrate reduction rates during the first two weeks after capping i e when ph was highest in the two ac treatments factors other than ph must explain the 62 87 decrease in nitrate reduction as these rates were measured approximately four weeks after capping when ph conditions at least in the ac b treatment had almost recovered one of these factors may be that labile organic carbon became less available in contact with ac which has a high density of surface sites and pores to maximize binding capacity for organic contaminants in sediments amstaetter et al 2012 ghosh et al 2011 an undesired ecological side effect may thus arise in natural benthic systems due to the potential of ac to reduce not only the bioavailability of organic contaminants but also that of natural sedimentary organic compounds such as nutritious amino fatty and humic acids quinlivan et al 2005 schreiber et al 2005 velten et al 2011 quantification of bulk organic carbon is commonly used in sediment biogeochemistry but does not discriminate between labile and refractory pools which makes it a poor indicator of bioavailable organic carbon arnosti and holmer 2003 direct measurements such as sediment oxygen uptake have been shown to be better proxies for quantification of available substrates to microbial communities in sediments glud 2008 by the end of our experiment sediment oxygen uptake was 30 43 lower in the ac treatments compared to the control uncapped sediments as the oxic zone was ca 5 mm thick and the cap layer 4 6 mm the lowered oxygen uptake was likely due to depletion of labile organic matter in the cap layer thus we suggest that the aerobic heterotrophic bacteria and denitrifiers were starved from being forced to colonize an environment consisting of almost pure ac with presumably extreme food scarcity in aquatic sediments denitrification and dnra are strictly dependent on organic substrates as they are processes that are almost exclusively carried out by heterotrophic bacteria burgin and hamilton 2007 giblin et al 2013 zumft 1997 organic compounds sorbed to soil or clay particles are generally available to heterotrophs due to weaker bonds crocker et al 1995 our results show that ac capping resulted in a 3 fold decrease in denitrification and up to an 8 fold reduction in dnra while clay capping did not have any significant effect on solute fluxes and microbial processes the latter observation is in line with evidence from a previous capping experiment näslund et al 2012 nutrient fluxes in particular those that are biologically mediated such as nitrate and silicate fluxes showed similar trends with both ac materials causing significantly lower effluxes than control sediment however ac is unlikely to have had a direct effect on nitrate and silicate concentrations as ac has a low affinity for inorganic nutrients callaway and aschehoug 2000 benthic phosphate fluxes deserve special attention as they are primarily regulated by sediment geochemistry rather than by biological activity phosphate efflux was significantly lowered by ac although only the decrease measured in the ac b was significant compared to the ctrl the more effective reduction of phosphate efflux in the ac b may be due to the different composition of the materials the bituminous ac contained substantial amounts of al probably in different phases of al oxides and hydroxides which have been shown to efficiently bind phosphate in brackish sediments rydin et al 2017 the majority of ac amendment tests in sediments that included biological endpoints have shown no effects on benthos 72 of studies but some studies found either positive 10 or negative secondary effects 18 janssen and beckingham 2013 to date studies on the ecological effects of ac capping have been limited almost exclusively to macrofauna studies meiofauna despite being orders of magnitude more abundant and having a more diverse community structure than macrofauna had only been considered in one toxicological study with ac known to the authors näslund et al 2012 the study found that sediment capping with a dose of 1 kg m 2 powdered ac from coconut shells compared to our 1 5 kg m 2 dose did not produce significant effects on meiofaunal abundance and community structure näslund et al 2012 the average abundance of nematodes the most common meiofaunal taxon was 30 lower in presence of ac than in untreated controls but their statistical analysis lacked power näslund et al 2012 our study showed that nematode populations were significantly reduced in presence of both ac b 64 abundance and ac c 66 the meiofauna community in oskarshamn sediments likely does not represent an undisturbed sediment meiofauna community because it has been pre exposed to contaminant mixtures in situ stark et al 2017 the benefit of reduced organic contaminant bioavailability by ac on our meiofaunal communities could not be seen here perhaps because recolonization by natural meiofauna communities was not possible in our enclosed chambers recent toxicity tests with benthic amphipods exposed to oskarshamn harbor sediment showed a positive impact of ac amendment on survival and reproduction rämö unpublished data however granular ac was used in those experiments the previously reported negative effects of ac on benthic macroinvertebrates include increased mortality reduced growth decreased lipid content and alterations of animal behavior janssen and beckingham 2013 in our experiment total meiofauna abundance was only 40 in ac b and 38 in ac c compared to ctrl in comparison clay amendment did not cause any significant mortality of meiofauna recent studies have shown that powdered activated carbon may be detrimental to benthic macrofauna as upon ingestion sharp ac particles may physically damage the gut microvilli of sediment deposit feeders abel et al 2017 nybom et al 2015 2016 it is possible that this mechanism i e decreased assimilation efficiency following damaged gut microvilli was responsible for the increased meiofauna mortality found in our study most of the added ac particles were in the 15 35 μm range and may have been ingested by large meiofauna for examples nematodes of the genus tripyloides have been shown to ingest 40 80 μm ciliates moens and vincx 1997 our results thus strongly suggest that both of the fine powdered acs used here also have impact on the resource acquisition and nutrition of meiobenthos it has been shown that ac efficiently adsorbs nutritious organic compounds such as humic and fulvic acids carbohydrates and proteins kilduff et al 1996 schreiber et al 2005 velten et al 2011 a novel hypothesis is therefore that ingested ac particles may reduce the uptake of nutrients from organic matter dissolved in the gut of meiofauna during digestion the fact that the small rotifers which feed on particles of 0 5 18 μm brönmark and hansson 2017 were not affected by ac in our study could support that either mechanical damages or sequestration of nutritious organic matter did not occur in these animals to the same extent as in larger meiofauna such as nematodes foraminifers and ostracods which could likely ingest larger fractions of the tested ac materials 5 conclusions we show both structural and functional effects of thin layer capping with two types of powdered ac and with clean sediment clay on microbial and meiofaunal benthic communities ac amendment resulted in significant decreases of both biologically mediated nutrient fluxes and rates of microbial processes likely due to increased ph of the porewater caused by the alkaline composition of the ac materials and depletion of natural organic matter which is required for the metabolism of most aerobic denitrifying bacteria and meiofauna irrespective of the ac material used this study suggests that sediment remediation with powdered ac may lead to harmful effects on microbial activity and meiofauna which provide vital ecosystem functions to the aquatic environment in contrast thin layer capping with clay did not harm microorganisms and meiofauna however powder ac capping significantly decreases contaminant fluxes from oskarshamn sediments while clay does not seem to be effective for remediation rämö unpublished data considering the stronger effects on sediment geochemistry and microbial functions caused by the coconut derived ac compared to the bituminous ac and clay we recommend that sediment capping with aluminum containing bituminous ac be performed in environments where internal phosphorus load represents an ecological problem in addition to organic contamination the functional effects described here are measured in more detail than in earlier studies with clear biogeochemical explanatory mechanisms however our results describe the situation from several hours to four weeks after sediment capping with activated carbon was performed at the end of the experiment the impact of the bituminous ac cap on ph was already attenuated we cannot exclude that deposition of fresh organic material on top of the ac layer would over time mitigate some of the observed effects in in situ remediation treatments we thus recommend that similar measurements be repeated in long term experiments further studies are needed to assess particle size effects on meiofauna abundances community structure and microbially mediated ecosystem functions as larger particles may produce fewer and less severe effects on these endpoints meanwhile we advise to restrict amendment with powdered ac to heavily contaminated sites where the local sediment pollution is a significant threat to the ecosystem and where less invasive methods such as capping with clay or monitored natural recovery cannot be pursued due to high risk of contaminant spread acknowledgements we acknowledge financial support through

biofilm for example chlorine hocl and monochloramine nh2cl can be decomposed by gac via catalytic reduction forming surface oxides sontheimer et al 1988 suidan et al 1977 for h2o2 the reaction may involve an exchange of an oxonium hydroxyl group with a hydrogen peroxide anion khalil et al 2001 oxidant decay can also be ascribed to the various reactive moieties e g pyrroles basic oxides in the gac surface khalil et al 2001 sanchez polo et al 2005 biofilms and associated eps can also exert oxidant demand nh2cl can penetrate biofilms faster than hocl lee et al 2011 2018 and react with nucleic acids tryptophan and sulfur containing amino acids lechevallier et al 1988 h2o2 can also depolymerize eps through hydroxyl radicals and react with various enzymes in the biofilm e g catalase peroxidase peroxiredoxin christensen et al 1990 stewart et al 2000 winterbourn 2013 treatment engineers can take advantage of the oxidation reactions with gac and biofilm to reduce biologically derived head loss at the filter surface addition of upstream oxidants may force the growth of biomass deeper into the filter bed separating it from the upper region where the greatest amount of particle fouling occurs the oxidants may also lead to better distribution of particles through the depth of the filter due to destabilization of influent flocs if the effects of these filter clogging mechanisms become more distributed addition of oxidants may lead to an overall improved hydraulic performance without compromising biodegradation water quality objectives this approach therefore warrants further investigation this study investigates the hydraulic impacts e g distributed head loss development decay of oxidant residuals particle removal and associated biological effects from using upstream addition of hocl nh2cl and h2o2 in pilot scale gac biofilters since many water utilities operate under different media configurations e g dual and multimedia the filters were designed to have varying proportions of gac anthracite and sand the decay of oxidant residuals added upstream and during backwashing was monitored in pilot scale filters and biological inhibition was assessed

chemetrics inc and the triiodide method klassen et al 1994 cellular atp from detached biomass in the effluent of the filters was measured using luminultra s quench gone aqueous kit attached atp in full scale gac filter media core samples were measured using luminultra s deposit and surface analysis test kit head loss in each pilot filter was monitored using manometer tubes installed every 25 cm

usa and particle counters ibr usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactivity of upstream oxidants with gac biofilters 3 1 1 chlorine media type age and depth greatly impacted hocl decay in the biofilters better chlorine quenching was achieved using filters with greater gac content the upper dechlorination zone in gac serves as the influent particle sieve for direct filter operations and the lower portion the biodegradation region fig 1 a and b shows the decay profile of influent hocl through filters 1 3 at 1 8 and 0 6 mg l cl2 at a higher dose 1 8 mg l cl2 only filter 1 deep gac bed was effective in quenching chlorine chlorine decay at this condition resulted in an oxidant exposure i e time integrated concentration of cl2 in the biofilter or ct of 1 32 mg cl2 min l which was 4 times higher than for 0 6 mg l cl2 0 35 mg cl2 min l fig s3 this indicates that at elevated cl2 dose the first 0 6 m of filter 1 i e gac was exposed to hocl at a greater extent possibly causing further oxidation of deposited particles and biofilm only partial dechlorination 55 85 was achieved in both deep filter 2 and shallow gac capped filters filter 3 with residuals of 0 3 mg l and 0 9 mg l at the filter effluent respectively a similar chlorine decay profile was observed before and after backwashing fig s4 when the chlorine dose was decreased to 0 6 mg l cl2 both filter 1 deep gac bed and filter 2 deep gac cap quenched chlorine at a filter depth of 0 6 m the shallow bed gac cap filter 3 only achieved 60 dechlorination leaving a residual of about 0 2 mg l cl2 the extent of chlorine removal in filters 1 3 affected biomass development through the media bed the biodegradation zone was easily established in filter 1 deep gac compared to filters 2 and 3 gac caps where biomass growth is highly chlorine dose dependent cellular atp at the effluent of the pilot filters fig 2 a was used as an indirect measure of viable biomass within the filter bed de vera et al 2018 after the acclimation phase without oxidant addition the amount of cellular atp was 23 14 pg ml in all filter effluents once chlorine was added at the filter influent 1 8 mg l an immediate decrease in cellular atp was observed for the effluent of shallow and deep gac capped filters filters 2 and 3 the deep gac bed filter 1 retained measurable cellular atp mimicking that of the control filter without chlorine this indicates that release of metabolically active biomass in filter 1 was not impacted by the start up of chlorine due to rapid chlorine quenching by the gac media the results were consistent with the chlorine decay profiles shown in fig 1a and b where the deep gac bed filter 1 effectively dechlorinated the influent water while the two gac capped filters filters 2 3 demonstrated chlorine residual breakthrough this breakthrough suggests that disinfection occurred in the filter bed resulting in the absence of viable biomass in the filtered water the chlorine dose was next reduced from 1 8 mg l to 0 6 mg l in filters 1 3 february 2016 following the dose change the deep gac cap filter 2 provided more effective dechlorination and acclimated to baseline atp conditions within three weeks however the shallow gac cap filter 3 was still experiencing chlorine breakthrough fig 1a and inhibited biomass development no measured atp further reduction of the chlorine dose to 0 18 mg l in filter 3 march 2016 showed effective chlorine quenching and a subsequent increase in atp concentration these results indicate the need for oxidant dose optimization when aiming for biodegradation the results from the pilot filters were also confirmed using data obtained from full scale gac sand filters receiving chlorinated waters at rmwtf measurements of attached atp in gac filter cores showed increasing biomass with increasing filter depth especially after 0 5 m where chlorine residuals were close to the instrument detection limit 0 02 mg l cl2 fig 2b 3 1 2 monochloramine nh2cl was confirmed to be less reactive with gac filters than hocl fig 3 at an equivalent dose of 1 7 mg l cl2 in filter 1 hocl was removed at 0 8 m while nh2cl quenching occurred at 1 5 m pseudo first order decay constant of nh2cl fig s5 was found to be 1 3 10 2 s 1 which was about half of that for hocl k 2 8 10 2 s 1 the stability of nh2cl along the filter bed is consistent with previous studies which can be attributed to its low reactivity with gac and microbial products like eps lechevallier et al 1988 urfer et al 1997 the penetration of nh2cl can then lead to a deeper and more distributed biodegradation zone than hocl to account for the effect of biofilm and media age on nh2cl decay a separate experiment using filter 1 containing a 10 year old gac bioactive and a new gac filter i e same specifications as filter 1 in service for only a week was conducted using waters dosed with 1 7 mg l cl2 the results showed that the decay of nh2cl in old and new gac were similar fig s6 indicating that the dechlorination zone was not impacted significantly by filter age both filters completely depleted nh2cl at 1 5 m ebct 6 min with k 1 31 0 02 10 2 s 1 suggesting that nh2cl decay is mainly governed by its reaction with gac and not with the biofilm this also applies to hocl where complete removal occurred at 0 8 m using both old and new gac filters fig s6 in filters with less gac i e filter 2 0 4 m gac 0 8 m anthracite 0 3 m sand and filter 3 0 1 m gac 1 1 m anthracite 0 3 m sand passage of nh2cl can inhibit biomass growth in filter 2 fig 3b nh2cl persisted in the effluent with a residual of 0 1 mg l cl2 the presence of nh2cl residuals in the filter effluent resulted in decreased cellular atp concentrations i e 80 in filters 2 3 versus the control fig 3c potentially leading to microbial inhibition in the filter bed biomass inhibition in actual filter media samples was confirmed in the pilot study of lauderdale et al 2018 where total atp decreased up to 50 when influent nh2cl dose was increased from 0 5 to 1 5 mg l cl2 the reduction of biomass by nh2cl was also observed in another anthracite sand filter study urfer et al 1997 where nh2cl exposure dose 1 mg cl2 l led to inhibited removal of biodegradable compounds e g aoc aldehydes lechevallier et al 1988 also reported the effectiveness of nh2cl in penetrating and inactivating biofilm bacteria 3 1 3 hydrogen peroxide compared to chlorine h2o2 was found to be more stable in all media configurations figs 4a and s5 changes in peroxide concentrations were not apparent for the first 0 4 m of filter 1 fig 4 a due to lack of reactive surface biomass and low sensitivity of the chemets r 5510 method using the triiodide method klassen et al 1994 h2o2 decay in filter 1 deep gac fig s5 followed first order decay kinetics with a k 1 6 10 2 s 1 no oxidant breakthrough was observed in filter 1 despite increasing the h2o2 concentration from 2 to 10 mg l fig 4b c which is beneficial for establishing a biodegradation zone unlike chlorine and chloramine the decay of h2o2 in filter 1 was impacted by the reaction of h2o2 with both gac and the biofilm fig 4b and c shows a side by side comparison of h2o2 decay using old gac bioactive and new gac when a new gac filter was used h2o2 residuals in the effluent persisted which contrasts with old gac filters where complete h2o2 depletion occurred an 8 mg l h2o2 dose gave a residual of 1 4 mg l 83 removal at the filter effluent of the new gac the same degree of removal was also achieved when a 2 mg l h2o2 was applied residual at effluent 0 3 mg l these results suggest that h2o2 removal in filter 1 is caused by the reaction of h2o2 with gac main mechanism and with the attached biomass 17 contribution the consumption of h2o2 in the upper regions of filter 1 may impair biological processes especially at high doses e g 5 mg l urfer frund 1998 urfer et al 1997 at a low h2o2 dose e g 1 mg l removal of biodegradable compounds e g acetate formate may not be inhibited as reported in a previous lab scale anthracite sand filtration study urfer frund 1998 at this condition biodegradation can be retained probably because of failure of h2o2 to effectively penetrate the biofilm and the intracellular components responsible for biological activity this is possible as most cells are protected from damage by certain enzymes e g catalase christensen et al 1990 stewart et al 2000 the action of h2o2 against the biofilm could also lead to biomass detachment lauderdale et al 2012 stoddart and gagnon 2017 possibly clearing the upper filter layer from clogging caused by biomass growth the gac capped biofilters filters 2 3 were found less efficient in removing h2o2 due to limited gac content h2o2 concentrations in filters 2 and 3 were almost unchanged fig 4a filter 2 deep gac cap had a residual of 4 mg l h2o2 at the effluent influent h2o2 5 mg l while filter 3 shallow gac cap had a residual of 1 mg l h2o2 influent h2o2 2 mg l 3 2 oxidant reactivity in the backwash water oxidant residual profiles were also collected during the high rate water backwash containing a free chlorine residual 1 8 mg l fig s7a samples were collected once the backwash turbidity had decreased to eliminate any interferences during spectrophotometric measurement of oxidant residuals in filter 1 deep gac chlorine residual decreased from 1 8 to 1 3 mg l in the sand layer once the water entered the gac layer chlorine depletion continued due to reactions with the gac surface and demand exerted by the biofilm and adsorbed particles the biomass in the lower filter region however was expected to recover due to the intermittent nature of backwashing in filters 2 3 chlorine breakthrough was observed and a demand of about 0 3 mg l cl2 at the sand layer was measured as expected only partial dechlorination occurred in the anthracite layer of filters 2 3 and chlorine decayed faster through the deep gac cap filters 2 3 resulted in an overall chlorine residual of 0 3 0 8 mg l cl2 in the effluent backwash water the residuals were expected to lower concentrations of attached biomass similar to those observed for chlorine backwashed anthracite sand filters miltner et al 1995 backwash profiles using nh2cl were also collected the use of nh2cl during backwashing has been suggested for filters with uncontrolled growth of biomass due to its effectiveness in removing attached biomass without significantly affecting adsorption properties of gac liu et al 2016 it was also found to have no substantial effect on biodegradation of organic matter liu et al 2001 as shown in fig s7b addition of nh2cl 1 8 mg l as cl2 in the backwash water of filters 1 3 resulted in concentrations of 0 5 1 7 mg l cl2 nh2cl persisted almost entirely unchanged in filter 3 shallow gac cap while a gradual decrease was observed for filter 2 the largest removal of nh2cl was observed with the deep gac filter filter 1 the stability of h2o2 dose 10 mg l during backwashing of filters 1 3 mimics those observed for nh2cl and is dependent on gac content h2o2 decay rate filter 1 deep gac filter 2 deep gac cap filter 3 shallow gac cap the gradual h2o2 degradation in the pilot filters resulted in h2o2 residuals of 1 7 mg l fig s7c 3 3 effect of oxidant addition on filter performance the effect of oxidant addition on filter performance was first evaluated in terms of removal of toc aoc turbidity and particle counts fig s8 s9 using hocl 0 6 mg l cl2 as the oxidant there was no statistically significant difference observed with toc and aoc removal between the gac control filter no oxidant and filter 1 dosed with 0 6 mg cl2 l hocl in the influent welch s t test p values control versus filter 1 toc 0 802 aoc 0 292 toc removal in filter 1 was 5 1 while aoc removal was 39 1 less toc and aoc were removed in filters 2 and 3 compared to filter 1 likely due to minimal adsorption sites i e lower gac content and biodegradation inhibition by hocl all filters were also efficient in removing turbidity and particle counts regardless of chlorine addition fig s9 compared to the control there was a minimal change in turbidity and particle removal 7 decrease in filter 1 after addition of 0 6 mg cl2 l hocl the decrease in removal of turbidity and particles in filters 2 3 may also be linked to shallower gac bed available to hold turbidity causing particles the surface area of the subsequent coarse and less bioactive anthracite layer might also be insufficient to capture other particles that pass through the gac caps to investigate head loss development across the media bed depth water levels in manometer tubes were monitored across the filter bed regularly fig 5 fig s10 s12 at 0 6 mg l cl2 head loss in the first 0 4 m of filter 1 fig 5a was reduced by nearly 50 compared to control conditions without oxidant beyond 0 4 m the difference of head loss between the control and filter 1 remained consistent 50 at various media depths the head loss response was similar in all media configurations fig 5b c which suggests that chlorine was able to suppress the filter clogging biomass at the filter surface the linear increase in head loss at 0 1 m is likely caused by particle loading while the change in slope at 1 m is indicative of biofilm formation a noticeable shift however was apparent for filter 1 deep gac when the hocl dose was increased to 1 8 mg l cl2 operated continuously for 2 months fig 5a fig s11 at this condition head loss related to biomass became more pronounced at the bottom sand layer depth 1 2 m this change could be attributed to greater oxidant penetration that shifted biofilm development to the bottom layer where there were more favorable conditions for growth and attachment e g no oxidant residual biofilm erosion is also a likely scenario since chlorine has been reported to penetrate biofilms slowly resulting in significant reduction of biofilm thickness because of sloughing lee et al 2018 the results obtained from the pilot filters are consistent with those observed using full scale biofilters anthracite and gac of rmwtf with a chlorine dose of 1 8 mg l cl2 in the filter influent in comparison with chlorinated anthracite poor filter hydraulics were observed for chlorinated gac biofilters when 1 8 mg l cl2 was added the biomass growth in the full scale gac biofilters caused reduced filter run times from 200 to 150 h and increased turbidity and particle counts for 10 years of operation potentially due to biomass sloughing de vera et al 2018 however the chlorine dose applied in rmwtf was not optimized for biofiltration but was mostly driven by the plant ct requirements decreasing the hocl dose to 0 6 mg l could potentially improve filter performance in rmwtf as shown in the current study head loss profiles using h2o2 and nh2cl were also obtained and shown in fig s12 despite a shorter experimental duration filter runs n 2 h2o2 n 1 nh2cl significant decrease in head loss compared to a gac control filter 1 2 m gac 0 3 m sand no oxidant was observed with upstream oxidation long term experiments similar to hocl e g 2 months acclimation 2 7 months oxidant treatment would be useful in validating these results other studies agree with the observed decrease in head loss with upstream h2o2 and nh2cl using pilot scale anthracite sand filters azzeh et al 2014 demonstrated that addition of 0 5 1 mg l h2o2 in the influent decreased head loss by 40 48 which was attributed to eps degradation i e 6 and 52 decrease in proteins and polysaccharides for 0 5 and 1 mg l h2o2 respectively in addition greater than 60 reduction in terminal head loss was also observed by lauderdale et al 2012 in their peroxide enhanced pilot gac sand biofilters h2o2 1 mg l significant reductions in head loss 7 27 compared to control biofilters were also reported by stoddart and gagnon 2017 after addition of 0 4 mg l h2o2 and nutrients like ammonia 0 35 mg l n and phosphorus 0 08 mg l p to anthracite sand filters for nh2cl a drastic decrease in head loss 80 using pilot scale gac sand filters was also reported using 0 5 1 5 mg l influent nh2cl lauderdale et al 2018 3 4 guidance to utilities and future work this study explored a new biofiltration design concept which enhances hydraulic performance by relieving filter clogging at the surface of the gac filter from biomass using upstream oxidants for this approach upstream oxidation could be delayed to first establish a biological zone throughout the filter bed to promote growth of sensitive populations e g nitrifying bacteria wert et al 2008 once the filter becomes biological oxidant addition can begin using doses optimized for the desired degree of separation of particle removal and biological zones to ensure that biofilters receiving the oxidants are performing efficiently various performance metrics should be monitored these may include hydraulic filter characteristics e g head loss filter run time head loss accumulation rate and water quality characteristics such as organic load doc and utilization doc removal effluent turbidity particle counts and disinfection byproduct dbp formation potential more frequent monitoring of these metrics would be necessary to ensure that finished water quality complies with regulations prior to oxidant addition while previous results showed no significant increase in dbp formation with hocl addition in a full scale plant de vera et al 2018 this may be different in other locations where doc is high thus treatment engineers should take this risk into account on a case by case basis if dbp formation is a problem for the water utility upstream addition of h2o2 and nh2cl could be an option to minimize formation of chlorinated compounds otherwise preceding processes such as coagulation flocculation should be improved to minimize precursors entering the biofilter nutrient addition could also be an option to minimize eps production lauderdale et al 2012 if biodegradation is desired gac may be used to quench the influent h2o2 at the top layer and establish a biodegradation zone deep in the filter the optimum filter depth and ebct for h2o2 decay need to be determined experimentally in each filter if the plant aims to operate conventionally i e no biodegradation then anthracite sand filters may be used due to their low reactivity with h2o2 biomass sloughing should also be monitored e g via atp closely as biofilm detachment is expected especially at the start of oxidant addition it may be beneficial for water utilities to measure cellular atp in the filter media to ensure preservation of biodegradation despite oxidant loading oxidant doses should also be optimized to determine conditions that will both lead to better hydraulic performance and minimal filtrate turbidity oxidant doses for gac media should be low enough to maintain biological activity within the bed albeit at lower depths within the filter profile the filter influent dose should never result in a detectable residual at the filter effluent and initial screening tests could be targeted in the range of 0 2 0 6 mg l investigating the optimized dose may also be warranted as sub lethal oxidant exposures against pathogens could also induce selecting for disinfectant resistant bacteria kotlarz 2017 microbial profiling e g via culture based viability assays quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr among others is therefore important to determine presence absence of pathogenic organisms additional work is also needed using waters with various water quality e g high versus low nom and turbidity as well as filters with different depths to account for site specific differences during intermittent backwashing with oxidants the effect of biofiltration oxidant ct and potential filter stratification should also be investigated to monitor consistent distribution of particle removal and biodegradation zones further studies should also consider the point of oxidant application upstream e g directly before the filter versus before coagulation as oxidants could enhance other processes like coagulation because of surface reactions leading to destabilization of colloidal systems xie et al 2016 4 conclusions addition of oxidants to the influent of gac biofilters can improve hydraulic performance by suppressing biological fouling at the filter surface the use of oxidants may create different zones in the filter bed when used continuously in the filter influent or intermittently in the backwash which should be considered when operating a biofilter the following conclusions from adding hocl nh2cl and h2o2 during filter operations can be drawn from this study head loss reduction in gac biofilters can be achieved using optimized oxidant dosing in the filter influent as shown in experiments with chlorine the decrease in head loss occurs because of inhibition of filter clogging biomass at the filter surface suppressing biological activity to deeper filter media depths and leaving the top filter layer predominantly for particle loading gac filter configuration dual multimedia affects oxidant stability oxidants have low reactivity with anthracite and sand allowing them to breakthrough and persist in the effluent the presence of oxidant residuals may also inhibit excessive biofouling as confirmed from chlorine experiments and cellular atp measurements hocl is depleted much faster in gac filters compared to h2o2 and nh2cl the same observations were found for oxidants added in the backwash water using deep gac filters a biological zone can be established deeper within the bed due to quenching of oxidants at the top layer during continuous filter operations for utilities aiming for conventional filtration i e designed for particle removal and not biodegradation unintended biofiltration can occur if operators do not consider reactivity of oxidants with gac acknowledgements

of the filter configuration influent water quality e g nutrients and backwash protocol ikhlef and basu 2017 lauderdale et al 2012 recent studies explored having a two stage biofiltration process where stepwise removal of turbidity and biodegradable nom is achieved using sand anthracite biofilter followed by biological gac filter fu et al 2017 another approach involved addition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in the influent of gac sand filters leading to a 60 reduction of terminal head loss and controlled eps production lauderdale et al 2012 peroxide addition was suggested to increase oxidative action and degrade filter clogging eps christensen et al 1990 lauderdale et al 2012 a lab scale study also found that continuous presence of approximately 1 mg l h2o2 in the influent did not impair biodegradation of acetate and formate urfer and huck 1997 many utilities also add oxidants in the backwash water with the aim of intermittent disinfection of excess biomass and restoring hydraulic capacity of clogged filters however oxidant dosing is often not optimized during this process which can compromise backwashing objectives due to reactions of the oxidants with the filter media and biofilm for example chlorine hocl and monochloramine nh2cl can be decomposed by gac via catalytic reduction forming surface oxides sontheimer et al 1988 suidan et al 1977 for h2o2 the reaction may involve an exchange of an oxonium hydroxyl group with a hydrogen peroxide anion khalil et al 2001 oxidant decay can also be ascribed to the various reactive moieties e g pyrroles basic oxides in the gac surface khalil et al 2001 sanchez polo et al 2005 biofilms and associated eps can also exert oxidant demand nh2cl can penetrate biofilms faster than hocl lee et al 2011 2018 and react with nucleic acids tryptophan and sulfur containing amino acids lechevallier et al 1988 h2o2 can also depolymerize eps through hydroxyl radicals and react with various enzymes in the biofilm e g catalase peroxidase peroxiredoxin christensen et al 1990 stewart et al 2000 winterbourn 2013 treatment engineers can take advantage of the oxidation reactions with gac and biofilm to reduce biologically derived head loss at the filter surface addition of upstream oxidants may force the growth of biomass deeper into the filter bed separating it from the upper region where the greatest amount of particle fouling occurs the oxidants may also lead to better distribution of particles through the depth of the filter due to destabilization of influent flocs if the effects of these filter clogging mechanisms become more distributed addition of oxidants may lead to an overall improved hydraulic performance without compromising biodegradation water quality objectives this approach therefore warrants further investigation this study investigates the hydraulic impacts e g distributed head loss development decay of oxidant residuals particle removal and associated biological effects from using upstream addition of hocl nh2cl and h2o2 in pilot scale gac biofilters since many water utilities operate under different media configurations e g dual and multimedia the filters were designed to have varying proportions of gac anthracite and sand the decay of oxidant residuals added upstream and during backwashing was monitored in pilot scale filters and biological inhibition was assessed using cellular atp the corresponding effects of oxidant addition on filter head loss were also assessed at various filter depths to determine where head loss develops while also evaluating removal of

chemetrics inc and the triiodide method klassen et al 1994 cellular atp from detached biomass in the effluent of the filters was measured using luminultra s quench gone aqueous kit attached atp in full scale gac filter media core samples were measured using luminultra s deposit and surface analysis test kit head loss in each pilot filter was monitored using manometer tubes installed every 25 cm 10 in of the filter bed head loss at various filter depths was calculated from the height difference of the influent water above the filter surface and the water level from each manometer tube fig s2 toc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu japan and aoc was measured based on the method of weinrich et al 2009 the pilot filters were also equipped with turbidimeters 1720e hach usa and particle counters ibr usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactivity of upstream oxidants with gac biofilters 3 1 1 chlorine media type age and depth greatly impacted hocl decay in the biofilters better chlorine quenching was achieved using filters with greater gac content the upper dechlorination zone in gac serves as the influent particle sieve for direct filter operations and the lower portion the biodegradation region fig 1 a and b shows the decay profile of influent hocl through filters 1 3 at 1 8 and 0 6 mg l cl2 at a higher dose 1 8 mg l cl2 only filter 1 deep gac bed was effective in quenching chlorine chlorine decay at this condition resulted in an oxidant exposure i e time integrated concentration of cl2 in the biofilter or ct of 1 32 mg cl2 min l which was 4 times higher than for 0 6 mg l cl2 0 35 mg cl2 min l fig s3 this indicates that at elevated cl2 dose the first 0 6 m of filter 1 i e gac was exposed to hocl at a greater extent possibly causing further oxidation of deposited particles and biofilm only partial dechlorination 55 85 was achieved in both deep filter 2 and shallow gac capped filters filter 3 with residuals of 0 3 mg l and 0 9 mg l at the filter effluent respectively a similar chlorine decay profile was observed before and after backwashing fig s4 when the chlorine dose was decreased to 0 6 mg l cl2 both filter 1 deep gac bed and filter 2 deep gac cap quenched chlorine at a filter depth of 0 6 m the shallow bed gac cap filter 3 only achieved 60 dechlorination leaving a residual of about 0 2 mg l cl2 the extent of chlorine removal in filters 1 3 affected biomass development through the media bed the biodegradation zone was easily established in filter 1 deep gac compared to filters 2 and 3 gac caps where biomass growth is highly chlorine dose dependent cellular atp at the effluent of the pilot filters fig 2 a was used as an indirect measure of viable biomass within the filter bed de vera et al 2018 after the acclimation phase without oxidant addition the amount of cellular atp was 23 14 pg ml in all filter effluents once chlorine was added at the filter influent 1 8 mg l an immediate decrease in cellular atp was observed for the effluent of shallow and deep gac capped filters filters 2 and 3 the deep gac bed filter 1 retained measurable cellular atp mimicking that of the control filter without chlorine this indicates that release of metabolically active biomass in filter 1 was not impacted by the start up of chlorine due to rapid chlorine quenching by the gac media the results were consistent with the chlorine decay profiles shown in fig 1a and b where the deep gac bed filter 1 effectively dechlorinated the influent water while the two gac capped filters filters 2 3 demonstrated chlorine residual breakthrough this breakthrough suggests that disinfection occurred in the filter bed resulting in the absence of viable biomass in the filtered water the chlorine dose was next reduced from 1 8 mg l to 0 6 mg l in filters 1 3 february 2016 following the dose change the deep gac cap filter 2 provided more effective dechlorination and acclimated to baseline atp conditions within three weeks however the shallow gac cap filter 3 was still experiencing chlorine breakthrough fig 1a and inhibited biomass development no measured atp further reduction of the chlorine dose to 0 18 mg l in filter 3 march 2016 showed effective chlorine quenching and a subsequent increase in atp concentration these results indicate the need for oxidant dose optimization when aiming for biodegradation the results from the pilot filters were also confirmed using data obtained from full scale gac sand filters receiving chlorinated waters at rmwtf measurements of attached atp in gac filter cores showed increasing biomass with increasing filter depth especially after 0 5 m where chlorine residuals were close to the instrument detection limit 0 02 mg l cl2 fig 2b 3 1 2 monochloramine nh2cl was confirmed to be less reactive with gac filters than hocl fig 3 at an equivalent dose of 1 7 mg l cl2 in filter 1 hocl was removed at 0 8 m while nh2cl quenching occurred at 1 5 m pseudo first order decay constant of nh2cl fig s5 was found to be 1 3 10 2 s 1 which was about half of that for hocl k 2 8 10 2 s 1 the stability of nh2cl along the filter bed is consistent with previous studies which can be attributed to its low reactivity with gac and microbial products like eps lechevallier et al 1988 urfer et al 1997 the penetration of nh2cl can then lead to a deeper and more distributed biodegradation zone than hocl to account for the effect of biofilm and media age on nh2cl decay a separate experiment using filter 1 containing a 10 year old gac bioactive and a new gac filter i e same specifications as filter 1 in service for only a week was conducted using waters dosed with 1 7 mg l cl2 the results showed that the decay of nh2cl in old and new gac were similar fig s6 indicating that the dechlorination zone was not impacted significantly by filter age both filters completely depleted nh2cl at 1 5 m ebct 6 min with k 1 31 0 02 10 2 s 1 suggesting that nh2cl decay is mainly governed by its reaction with gac and not with the biofilm this also applies to hocl where complete removal occurred at 0 8 m using both old and new gac filters fig s6 in filters with less gac i e filter 2 0 4 m gac 0 8 m anthracite 0 3 m sand and filter 3 0 1 m gac 1 1 m anthracite 0 3 m sand passage of nh2cl can inhibit biomass growth in filter 2 fig 3b nh2cl persisted in the effluent with a residual of 0 1 mg l cl2 the presence of nh2cl residuals in the filter effluent resulted in decreased cellular atp concentrations i e 80 in filters 2 3 versus the control fig 3c potentially leading to microbial inhibition in the filter bed biomass inhibition in actual filter media samples was confirmed in the pilot study of lauderdale et al 2018 where total atp decreased up to 50 when influent nh2cl dose was increased from 0 5 to 1 5 mg l cl2 the reduction of biomass by nh2cl was also observed in another anthracite sand filter study urfer et al 1997 where nh2cl exposure dose 1 mg cl2 l led to inhibited removal of biodegradable compounds e g aoc aldehydes lechevallier et al 1988 also reported the effectiveness of nh2cl in penetrating and inactivating biofilm bacteria 3 1 3 hydrogen peroxide compared to chlorine h2o2 was found to be more stable in all media configurations figs 4a and s5 changes in peroxide concentrations were not apparent for the first 0 4 m of filter 1 fig 4 a due to lack of reactive surface biomass and low sensitivity of the chemets r 5510 method using the triiodide method klassen et al 1994 h2o2 decay in filter 1 deep gac fig s5 followed first order decay kinetics with a k 1 6 10 2 s 1 no oxidant breakthrough was observed in filter 1 despite increasing the h2o2 concentration from 2 to 10 mg l fig 4b c which is beneficial for establishing a biodegradation zone unlike chlorine and chloramine the decay of h2o2 in filter 1 was impacted by the reaction of h2o2 with both gac and the biofilm fig 4b and c shows a side by side comparison of h2o2 decay using old gac bioactive and new gac when a new gac filter was used h2o2 residuals in the effluent persisted which contrasts with old gac filters where complete h2o2 depletion occurred an 8 mg l h2o2 dose gave a residual of 1 4 mg l 83 removal at the filter effluent of the new gac the same degree of removal was also achieved when a 2 mg l h2o2 was applied residual at effluent 0 3 mg l these results suggest that h2o2 removal in filter 1 is caused by the reaction of h2o2 with gac main mechanism and with the attached biomass 17 contribution the consumption of h2o2 in the upper regions of filter 1 may impair biological processes especially at high doses e g 5 mg l urfer frund 1998 urfer et al 1997 at a low h2o2 dose e g 1 mg l removal of biodegradable compounds e g acetate formate may not be inhibited as reported in a previous lab scale anthracite sand filtration study urfer frund 1998 at this condition biodegradation can be retained probably because of failure of h2o2 to effectively penetrate the biofilm and the intracellular components responsible for biological activity this is possible as most cells are protected from damage by certain enzymes e g catalase christensen et al 1990 stewart et al 2000 the action of h2o2 against the biofilm could also lead to biomass detachment lauderdale et al 2012 stoddart and gagnon 2017 possibly clearing the upper filter layer from clogging caused by biomass growth the gac capped biofilters filters 2 3 were found less efficient in removing h2o2 due to limited gac content h2o2 concentrations in filters 2 and 3 were almost unchanged fig 4a filter 2 deep gac cap had a residual of 4 mg l h2o2 at the effluent influent h2o2 5 mg l while filter 3 shallow gac cap had a residual of 1 mg l h2o2 influent h2o2 2 mg l 3 2 oxidant reactivity in the backwash water oxidant residual profiles were also collected during the high rate water backwash containing a free chlorine residual 1 8 mg l fig s7a samples were collected once the backwash turbidity had decreased to eliminate any interferences during spectrophotometric measurement of oxidant residuals in filter 1 deep gac chlorine residual decreased from 1 8 to 1 3 mg l in the sand layer once the water entered the gac layer chlorine depletion continued due to reactions with the gac surface and demand exerted by the biofilm and adsorbed particles the biomass in the lower filter region however was expected to recover due to the intermittent nature of backwashing in filters 2 3 chlorine breakthrough was observed and a demand of about 0 3 mg l cl2 at the sand layer was measured as expected only partial dechlorination occurred in the anthracite layer of filters 2 3 and chlorine decayed faster through the deep gac cap filters 2 3 resulted in an overall chlorine residual of 0 3 0 8 mg l cl2 in the effluent backwash water the residuals were expected to lower concentrations of attached biomass similar to those observed for chlorine backwashed anthracite sand filters miltner et al 1995 backwash profiles using nh2cl were also collected the use of nh2cl during backwashing has been suggested for filters with uncontrolled growth of biomass due to its effectiveness in removing attached biomass without significantly affecting adsorption properties of gac liu et al 2016 it was also found to have no substantial effect on biodegradation of organic matter liu et al 2001 as shown in fig s7b addition of nh2cl 1 8 mg l as cl2 in the backwash water of filters 1 3 resulted in concentrations of 0 5 1 7 mg l cl2 nh2cl persisted almost entirely unchanged in filter 3 shallow gac cap while a gradual decrease was observed for filter 2 the largest removal of nh2cl was observed with the deep gac filter filter 1 the stability of h2o2 dose 10 mg l during backwashing of filters 1 3 mimics those observed for nh2cl and is dependent on gac content h2o2 decay rate filter 1 deep gac filter 2 deep gac cap filter 3 shallow gac cap the gradual h2o2 degradation in the pilot filters resulted in h2o2 residuals of 1 7 mg l fig s7c 3 3 effect of oxidant addition on filter performance the effect of oxidant addition on filter performance was first evaluated in terms of removal of toc aoc turbidity and particle counts fig s8 s9 using hocl 0 6 mg l cl2 as the oxidant there was no statistically significant difference observed with toc and aoc removal between the gac control filter no oxidant and filter 1 dosed with 0 6 mg cl2 l hocl in the influent welch s t test p values control versus filter 1 toc 0 802 aoc 0 292 toc removal in filter 1 was 5 1 while aoc removal was 39 1 less toc and aoc were removed in filters 2 and 3 compared to filter 1 likely due to minimal adsorption sites i e lower gac content and biodegradation inhibition by hocl all filters were also efficient in removing turbidity and particle counts regardless of chlorine addition fig s9 compared to the control there was a minimal change in turbidity and particle removal 7 decrease in filter 1 after addition of 0 6 mg cl2 l hocl the decrease in removal of turbidity and particles in filters 2 3 may also be linked to shallower gac bed available to hold turbidity causing particles the surface area of the subsequent coarse and less bioactive anthracite layer might also be insufficient to capture other particles that pass through the gac caps to investigate head loss development across the media bed depth water levels in manometer tubes were monitored across the filter bed regularly fig 5 fig s10 s12 at 0 6 mg l cl2 head loss in the first 0 4 m of filter 1 fig 5a was reduced by nearly 50 compared to control conditions without oxidant beyond 0 4 m the difference of head loss between the control and filter 1 remained consistent 50 at various media depths the head loss response was similar in all media configurations fig 5b c which suggests that chlorine was able to suppress the filter clogging biomass at the filter surface the linear increase in head loss at 0 1 m is likely caused by particle loading while the change in slope at 1 m is indicative of biofilm formation a noticeable shift however was apparent for filter 1 deep gac when the hocl dose was increased to 1 8 mg l cl2 operated continuously for 2 months fig 5a fig s11 at this condition head loss related to biomass became more pronounced at the bottom sand layer depth 1 2 m this change could be attributed to greater oxidant penetration that shifted biofilm development to the bottom layer where there were more favorable conditions for growth and attachment e g no oxidant residual biofilm erosion is also a likely scenario since chlorine has been reported to penetrate biofilms slowly resulting in significant reduction of biofilm thickness because of sloughing lee et al 2018 the results obtained from the pilot filters are consistent with those observed using full scale biofilters anthracite and gac of rmwtf with a chlorine dose of 1 8 mg l cl2 in the filter influent in comparison with chlorinated anthracite poor filter hydraulics were observed for chlorinated gac biofilters when 1 8 mg l cl2 was added the biomass growth in the full scale gac biofilters caused reduced filter run times from 200 to 150 h and increased turbidity and particle counts for 10 years of operation potentially due to biomass sloughing de vera et al 2018 however the chlorine dose applied in rmwtf was not optimized for biofiltration but was mostly driven by the plant ct requirements decreasing the hocl dose to 0 6 mg l could potentially improve filter performance in rmwtf as shown in the current study head loss profiles using h2o2 and nh2cl were also obtained and shown in fig s12 despite a shorter experimental duration filter runs n 2 h2o2 n 1 nh2cl significant decrease in head loss compared to a gac control filter 1 2 m gac 0 3 m sand no oxidant was observed with upstream oxidation long term experiments similar to hocl e g 2 months acclimation 2 7 months oxidant treatment would be useful in validating these results other studies agree with the observed decrease in head loss with upstream h2o2 and nh2cl using pilot scale anthracite sand filters azzeh et al 2014 demonstrated that addition of 0 5 1 mg l h2o2 in the influent decreased head loss by 40 48 which was attributed to eps degradation i e 6 and 52 decrease in proteins and polysaccharides for 0 5 and 1 mg l h2o2 respectively in addition greater than 60 reduction in terminal head loss was also observed by lauderdale et al 2012 in their peroxide enhanced pilot gac sand biofilters h2o2 1 mg l significant reductions in head loss 7 27 compared to control biofilters were also reported by stoddart and gagnon 2017 after addition of 0 4 mg l h2o2 and nutrients like ammonia 0 35 mg l n and phosphorus 0 08 mg l p to anthracite sand filters for nh2cl a drastic decrease in head loss 80 using pilot scale gac sand filters was also reported using 0 5 1 5 mg l influent nh2cl lauderdale et al 2018 3 4 guidance to utilities and future work this study explored a new biofiltration design concept which enhances hydraulic performance by relieving filter clogging at the surface of the gac filter from biomass using upstream oxidants for this approach upstream oxidation could be delayed to first establish a biological zone throughout the filter bed to promote growth of sensitive populations e g nitrifying bacteria wert et al 2008 once the filter becomes biological oxidant addition can begin using doses optimized for the desired degree of separation of particle removal and biological zones to ensure that biofilters receiving the oxidants are performing efficiently various performance metrics should be monitored these may include hydraulic filter characteristics e g head loss filter run time head loss accumulation rate and water quality characteristics such as organic load doc and utilization doc removal effluent turbidity particle counts and disinfection byproduct dbp formation potential more frequent monitoring of these metrics would be necessary to ensure that finished water quality complies with regulations prior to oxidant addition while previous results showed no significant increase in dbp formation with hocl addition in a full scale plant de vera et al 2018 this may be different in other locations where doc is high thus treatment engineers should take this risk into account on a case by case basis if dbp formation is a problem for the water utility upstream addition of h2o2 and nh2cl could be an option to minimize formation of chlorinated compounds otherwise preceding processes such as coagulation flocculation should be improved to minimize precursors entering the biofilter nutrient addition could also be an option to minimize eps production lauderdale et al 2012 if biodegradation is desired gac may be used to quench the influent h2o2 at the top layer and establish a biodegradation zone deep in the filter the optimum filter depth and ebct for h2o2 decay need to be determined experimentally in each filter if the plant aims to operate conventionally i e no biodegradation then anthracite sand filters may be used due to their low reactivity with h2o2 biomass sloughing should also be monitored e g via atp closely as biofilm detachment is expected especially at the start of oxidant addition it may be beneficial for water utilities to measure cellular atp in the filter media to ensure preservation of biodegradation despite oxidant loading oxidant doses should also be optimized to determine conditions that will both lead to better hydraulic performance and minimal filtrate turbidity oxidant doses for gac media should be low enough to maintain biological activity within the bed albeit at lower depths within the filter profile the filter influent dose should never result in a detectable residual at the filter effluent and initial screening tests could be targeted in the range of 0 2 0 6 mg l investigating the optimized dose may also be warranted as sub lethal oxidant exposures against pathogens could also induce selecting for disinfectant resistant bacteria kotlarz 2017 microbial profiling e g via culture based viability assays quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr among others is therefore important to determine presence absence of pathogenic organisms additional work is also needed using waters with various water quality e g high versus low nom and turbidity as well as filters with different depths to account for site specific differences during intermittent backwashing with oxidants the effect of biofiltration oxidant ct and potential filter stratification should also be investigated to monitor consistent distribution of particle removal and biodegradation zones further studies should also consider the point of oxidant application upstream e g directly before the filter versus before coagulation as oxidants could enhance other processes like coagulation because of surface reactions leading to destabilization of colloidal systems xie et al 2016 4 conclusions addition of oxidants to the influent of gac biofilters can improve hydraulic performance by suppressing biological fouling at the filter surface the use of oxidants may create different zones in the filter bed when used continuously in the filter influent or intermittently in the backwash which should be considered when operating a biofilter the following conclusions from adding hocl nh2cl and h2o2 during filter operations can be drawn from this study head loss reduction in gac biofilters can be achieved using optimized oxidant dosing in the filter influent as shown in experiments with chlorine the decrease in head loss occurs because of inhibition of filter clogging biomass at the filter surface suppressing biological activity to deeper filter media depths and leaving the top filter layer predominantly for particle loading gac filter configuration dual multimedia affects oxidant stability oxidants have low reactivity with anthracite and sand allowing them to breakthrough and persist in the effluent the presence of oxidant residuals may also inhibit excessive biofouling as confirmed from chlorine experiments and cellular atp measurements hocl is depleted much faster in gac filters compared to h2o2 and nh2cl the same observations were found for oxidants added in the backwash water using deep gac filters a biological zone can be established deeper within the bed due to quenching of oxidants at the top layer during continuous filter operations for utilities aiming for conventional filtration i e designed for particle removal and not biodegradation unintended biofiltration can occur if operators do not consider reactivity of oxidants with gac acknowledgements

reactions so that by products are not expected in the treated water ro permeate unless membrane integrity is compromised e g by pre treatment with disinfection agents such as chlorine or by biofouling agus and sedlak 2010 misdan et al 2012 ro is a physical separation process in which the passage of organic solutes through osmotic membranes is assumed to follow the solution diffusion model wang et al 2014 wijmans and baker 1995 complex solute membrane interactions can promote or hinder the solution diffusion mechanism these interactions are steric hindrance kimura et al 2003b ozaki and li 2002 electrostatic interactions nghiem et al 2006 verliefde et al 2008 and hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions kimura et al 2003b verliefde et al 2009 solute membrane interactions are in turn influenced by solute and membrane physicochemical properties feed water composition and operating conditions bellona et al 2004 the aim of this study was to quantify the removal of mps from a raw riverbank filtrate in pilot scale ro drinking water treatment and assess whether stand alone ro step can be considered for further implementation in lieu of the conventional production chain we also aimed to elucidate the transport of organic solutes through ro membranes by relating solute physicochemical properties to passage rates and by assessing the influence of the permeate flux a series of experiments were performed at the research facility of a drinking water utility in the dutch province of zuid holland so that an actual source water i e raw anaerobic riverbank filtrate could be used as ro feed water we studied the removal of thirty model polar mps relevant for the water cycle such as herbicides industrial chemicals pharmaceuticals personal care products and metabolites formed under environmental conditions the effects of the permeate flux were also investigated we introduce a ro pilot system capable of keeping hypoxic conditions while being operated in recirculation mode such system is novel and ensured that the precipitation of the dissolved iron naturally occurring in the bank filtrate used as ro feed water would not take place de facto preventing membrane fouling with this paper we report and aim to understand the removal efficiencies of known and emerging mps some of which have not been investigated either in bank filtrate or in ro filtration at all e g the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons metabolite 2 hydroxyquinoline and its isomer 4 hydroxyquinoline the industrial chemicals 2 methylamino pyridine phenylurea tetrapropylammonium and tetrabutylammonium 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and chemicals all chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade more details are provided in section s 1 of the supplementary material 2 2 mps selection scientific literature data were reviewed to select 30 model mps based on their detection in natural freshwater ro permeates and finished drinking water table 1 the compounds were amenable for analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms the mps were assigned to four physicochemical properties categories based on their charge and hydrophobicity the ph dependent octanol water distribution coefficient expressed as log d ow was used as a measure of hydrophobicity due to the inclusion of ionisable mps amongst the model compounds the log d values were calculated at ph 7 to match the ph of the natural water fed to the ro pilot more details in section 2 4 a cut off value of 2 was used to distinguish between hydrophilic and moderately hydrophobic mps in line with previous literature fujioka et al 2015a verliefde et al 2007a the chemicals were categorised as i neutral and moderately hydrophobic log d ph7 2 ii neutral hydrophilic log d ph7 2 iii anionic and iv cationic the selection ensured that a broad range of physicochemical properties were covered to support the elucidation of the removal mechanisms the molecular weight mw distribution ranged evenly from approximately 100 da 300 da with perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa being the only outlier 413 97 da the log d ph7 ranged from 1 5 acesulfame to 4 6 triclosan a variety of chemical structures were represented 2 3 mps stock solutions stock solutions with a volume of 2 l were prepared by dissolving mps with na2so3 in anaerobic ultrapure water to obtain a concentration of 14 and 28 mg l of positive and negative ms ionisation mps respectively and 17 5 g l na2so3 for each experiment one stock solution was diluted in 698 l feed water to obtain concentrations of approximately 10 and 20 μg l per mps and 50 mg l na2so3 as oxygen scavenger these concentrations guaranteed the quantification of 99 removal i e 1 passage based on the analytical method s detection limits 2 4 ro feed water raw anaerobic riverbank filtrate was freshly abstracted from a well field in the premises of the drinking water treatment plant dwtp where the experiments were conducted this bank filtrate is also used as source water by the dwtp where conventional treatment is applied the feed was kept in hypoxic conditions throughout filtration quality parameters are reported in table s 2 1 of the supplementary material 2 5 hypoxic ro pilot scale installation a pilot scale ro system was built and operated in recirculation mode to treat anaerobic riverbank filtrate under hypoxic conditions such a system was not commercially available or reported elsewhere the pilot was a closed system consisting of a 720 l stainless steel feed reservoir a high pressure pump and one 4 inch membrane pressure vessel permeate and concentrate lines were recirculated to the feed reservoir via airtight connections a detailed description and a picture of the ro pilot are provided in the supplementary material section s 3 and figure s 3 1 respectively whereas a diagram displaying the essential features of the system is provided in fig 1 the low pressure ro lpro membrane chosen for this study was an espa2 ld 4040 hydranautics oceanside ca this membrane is a typical thin film composite tfc with an active layer of cross linked aromatic polyamide designed for low pressure filtration and employed in a variety of water recycling applications fujioka et al 2012a the properties of the espa2 membrane are summarized in table 2 2 6 ro filtration protocol the 720 l feed reservoir was filled with 698 l of anaerobic riverbank filtrate while being flushed with nitrogen the mps were dosed to the feed water with a smart digital pump from grundfos b v almere the netherlands filtration was carried at a constant 15 recovery and 25 l m 2 h 1 permeate flux the temperature was kept at 20 c filtration was conducted for 4 d before taking feed and permeate samples at t 5d to minimize the influence of hydrophobic interactions on the passage of moderate hydrophobic mps verliefde et al 2007b during sampling the feed reservoir was supplied with nitrogen feed water and permeate samples v 200 ml n 2 were collected in 250 ml polypropylene bottles and frozen immediately the second part of the study was conducted in a different season and focussed on the effects of operating conditions on the removal of a sub set of 18 mps we assessed the permeate flux as the quality of temperature and ph of the riverbank filtrate at the dwtp location has proven to be very stable in time we started ro filtration by applying the protocol used for the 30 analyte set the only difference was the feed temperature which this time was kept at 13 see table s 2 after the fourth day of filtration the permeate flux was kept constant at 10 l m 2 h 1 samples were then taken at t 2 h t 5 h and t 24 h before returning the permeate flux to 25 l m 2 h 1 and repeating the sampling at t 2 h 5 h and 24 h 2 7 assessment of solute passage the rejection equation can be used to quantify the removal of solutes by ro membranes 1 r 1 c rop c rof 100 where c rop and c rof are the permeate and the bulk feed concentrations respectively similarly the passage can be defined as 2 p c rop c rof 100 in principle rejection and passage can be used to describe the same phenomenon i e the removal of a solute by membrane filtration however the observed rejection equation eq 1 quantifies the percentage of solute that has been removed by ro filtration whereas the passage eq 2 quantifies the percentage of solute in the permeate finally the ec passage was calculated by adapting eq 2 3 ecp ec rop ec rof 100 where ecrop and ecrof are the electrical conductivity in μs cm in the permeate and the in the bulk feed solution respectively chemical passage was calculated by using eq 2 and the values reported in this manuscript are the averages and ranges obtained from experimental duplicates statistical analysis was performed within the r statistical environment r core team 2017 the analysis was limited to category i 7 neutral moderate hydrophobic mps category ii 10 neutral hydrophilic mps and category iii 9 anionic mps as only three cationic mps populated category iv one way analysis of variance anova was performed to reject the null hypothesis that the physicochemical properties categories were the same in terms of passage mean pairwise comparisons between categories were conducted with post hoc tukey honestly significant difference hsd test ruxton and beauchamp 2008 both anova and tukey s hsd test were calculated with 95 confidence intervals ci in addition the spearman correlation coefficient r was calculated to assess the correlation between passage molecular weight and hydrophobicity of all model mps including cationic compounds 2 8 sample preparation a sample preparation method validated in our laboratories was adapted to this study albergamo et al 2018 the feed water samples v 1 ml n 2

results and discussion 3 1 removal of neutral and moderate hydrophobic mps neutral and moderate hydrophobic mps log d ph7 2 were substantially removed with the exception of 2 hydroxyquinoline all target analytes displayed a passage lower than 5 fig 2 the results of triclosan are not reported due to the large deviation between the measurements the hydroxyquinoline isomers selected as target mps are mid small organics 145 05 da with almost identical physicochemical properties except for the log d ph7 which is 2 4 and 1 8 for 2 and 4 hydroxyquinoline respectively due to our log d ph7 2 cut off the two isomers were assigned to different categories 2 hydroxyquinoline was regarded as moderate hydrophobic log d ph7 2 whereas 4 hydroxyquinoline as neutral hydrophilic log d ph7 2 after 4d the passage of 2 hydroxyquinoline was 8 1 0 3 fig 2 whereas that of 4 hydroxyquinoline was 3 5 0 1 fig 3 while size exclusion represents the main removal mechanism for neutral mps the rejection of moderate hydrophobic mps is also influenced by solute membrane affinity interactions these mps can adsorb onto ro membranes due to the affinity between hydrophobic moieties such as aromatic rings and hydrocarbon chains and the active layer of ro membranes kimura et al 2003a nghiem et al 2002 once membrane saturation is reached the adsorbed mps can partition through the membrane and diffuse to the permeate side in a process influenced by solute membrane affinity i e hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding verliefde et al 2009 consequently a higher rejection of moderate hydrophobic mps can be observed in the early filtration stages due to the combined effect of adsorption and size exclusion kimura et al 2003a for this reason the correlation between passage and size of hydrophobic mps appears to be weaker than that of neutral hydrophilic mps when plotting the passage of moderate hydrophobic mps as a function of their log d no clear correlation between these variables could be observed data not shown the passage differences between the hydroxyquinoline isomers could be explained by the lower hydrophilicity of 2 hydroxyquinoline and therefore its higher affinity for the active layer of the espa2 membrane which consisted of aromatic polyamide thus the removal of 2 hydroxyquinoline could also be influenced by solute membrane affinity interactions in addition to the size exclusion mechanism the higher hydrophobicity of 2 hydroxyquinoline could be confirmed by its chromatographic behaviour in a 7 min analysis run with reversed phase chromatography 2 hydroxyquinoline had a retention time tr of 5 03 min whereas the tr of 4 hydroxyquinoline was 4 03 min this is also in agreement with earlier work published by our group brulik et al 2013 the second least well removed moderate hydrophobic mp was bisphenol a for which we observed up to 4 passage the result is in accordance with the removal efficiency from spiked raw lake water in a bench scale ro filtration study comerton et al 2008 in a recent pilot scale investigation bisphenol a was rejected by approximately 75 by a cellulose triacetate cta ro membrane fujioka et al 2015a 3 2 removal of neutral hydrophilic mps the transport of neutral hydrophilic mps is mainly hindered by a sieving mechanism cf introduction thus the larger the molecule the lower its passage bellona et al 2004 fujioka et al 2012a kiso et al 1992 ozaki and li 2002 the mps selection included 10 uncharged hydrophilic compounds covering a mw range from approximately 100 da 300 da the overall removal of these mps was very high with observed passages lower than 5 for almost all compounds all neutral hydrophilic mps larger than 180 da were almost completely removed passage 1 in accordance with scientific literature a strong correlation between mw and mps removal by ro membranes was found fig 3 by adapting a method proposed by lópez muñoz et al 2009 it was estimated that the cut off value mwco of the espa2 membrane in our operating conditions corresponded to approximately 140 da which is in accordance with findings from yangali quintanilla et al 2010 however the mwco of ro membranes is not an absolute value and should be used for semi qualitative prediction only as expected the smallest mps displayed the lowest removal efficiencies 1h benzotriazole 119 05 da and tolyltriazole 133 15 da showed 25 4 and 17 4 passage respectively the third least well removed neutral hydrophilic mp was phenylurea 136 06 da for which we quantified 10 1 passage to the best of our knowledge this compound has not been investigated in membrane filtration before the addition of a methyl group to 1h benzotriazole resulted in a decreased passage of the methylated derivative tolyltriazole which supports size exclusion as main removal mechanism this is in accordance with previous research where a correlation between removal and number of methyl groups was observed steinle darling et al 2007 the removal efficiencies of benzotriazoles quantified in this study were in close agreement with observations from a full scale advanced water recycling plant where ro was applied to treat secondary wastewater treatment effluents where 70 and 85 rejection were observed for 1h benzotriazole and methyl 1h benzotriazole respectively loi et al 2013 in a separate study on advanced water recycling where ro permeate was used for groundwater replenishment the average removal efficiencies were 51 and 53 for 1h benzotriazole and its methylated derivatives respectively busetti et al 2015 it is challenging to explain the lower removal efficiencies reported in the latter study since no details about feed water characteristics and ro operational parameters were given by the authors whose goal was the validation of an analytical method nevertheless the lower removal might be attributed to a different feed water composition higher feed water temperature or to the employment of a more open ro membrane the benzotriazoles are small emerging contaminants which are frequently and globally detected in the water cycle in the high ng l to low μg l range due to their incomplete removal by conventional wastewater treatment giger et al 2006 loos et al 2013 van leerdam et al 2009 in general small neutral mps like the benzotriazoles are not fully retained by lpro membranes observations from a dtwp in which the production chain consisted of riverbank filtration aeration a split stream treatment with ro and full stream active carbon filtration suggest that the combined treatments are only partially effective on small neutral mps kegel et al 2010 observation from a full scale municipal wastewater treatment plant upgraded with post ozonation followed by sand filtration hollender et al 2009 showed that a medium ozone dose 0 6 g o3 g 1 doc led to 70 removal of 1h benzotriazole where necessary the passage of small neutral mps such as the benzotriazoles could be lowered by employing tighter ro membranes in general the removal efficiencies of ro drinking water treatment can be maximised following combination with other treatments however the smallest neutral polar mps might still be detectable in the permeate boleda et al 2011 3 3 removal of ionic mps as expected excellent removal of anionic mps was observed passage 1 the espa2 has its isoelectric point at ph 4 tu chivas nghiem 2015 and a zeta potential of 40 mv at ph 7 fujioka et al 2013 consequently it displayed a net negative charge at the operating feed ph the electrostatic repulsion between anionic solutes and negatively charged membranes represents an additional mechanism that leads to low passage ozaki and li 2002 the results are shown in fig 4 considering the behaviour of neutral polar compounds in ro filtration and the mw of the anionic mps investigated steric hindrance should be considered in addition to electrostatic repulsion when interpreting the low passage values of negatively charged mps observed in this study two quaternary ammonium ions were selected as cationic mps along with 2 methylamino pyridine we observed passage of 2 5 0 1 and 0 3 0 1 for tetrapropylammonium and tetrabutylammonium respectively whereas the passage of 2 methylamino pyridine the smallest cation was 8 8 0 1 these values although limited to three compounds only suggest a decreasing passage trend with increasing mw and a higher transport of cationic mps compared to anionic mps of comparable size passage of positively charged mps during ro filtration can be expected due to charge concentration polarization i e a localized increase in concentration of cations onto the negatively charged active layer due to electrostatic attractions leading to lower rejection fujioka et al 2015b verliefde et al 2008 3 4 statistical analysis the passage values of the mps in category i ii and iii were log transformed and visualised in a box and whisker plot this highlighted the overall lower passage of anionic mps compared to neutral compounds fig 5 the anova test run on this dataset returned a p value of 0 00297 with 95 ci indicating significant difference in the mean passage amongst the three categories the tukey s test showed modest difference between category i and iii p 0 04077 significant difference between category ii and iii p 0 00264 whereas the differences between category i and ii were not significant p 0 66295 these results indicate a significant relationship between passage and compound physicochemical properties as categorised in this study and highlight the role of electrostatic repulsion in preventing transport of anionic mps through tfc ro membranes however the additional effects of size should not be excluded when interpreting the low passage of anionic mps as commented in the previous section 3 3 hydrophobicity expressed as log d had no significant impact on the passage of neutral polar organics to gain more insights data of all mps excluding triclosan 29 compounds were pulled together and the spearman correlations between mw log d and passage were assessed passage and mw showed good correlation r 0 77 p 0 01 contrary to the log d r 0 20 p 0 31 this highlights i the overall relevance of compound size in hindering transport of polar organics through tfc ro membranes and ii the lack of relationship between passage and hydrophobicity which is in line with the results obtained from the anova and the tukey s test the results of the statistical analysis pointed to compound mw as a prominent physicochemical property and in part to charge to explain the passage of polar mps through ro membranes the clear trend between passage and mw can be used to qualitatively predict the passage especially in ro systems equipped with tfc membranes of known mwco for mps which deprotonate at operating feed water ph even lower passage figures could be expected despite the lack of significance between category i and category ii the impact of solute membrane affinity interactions on the passage of uncharged organics needs further assessment caution should be exercised when predicting the passage of neutral compounds exhibiting high log d values as seen for bisphenol a which displayed 4 passage despite its size of 228 29 da 3 5 influence of permeate flux the overall removal efficiencies of the investigated mps at t 5 d data not shown were comparable to those presented in sections 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 and therefore the results and discussion in this section are limited to the compounds for which we quantified more than 1 passage i e 1h benzotriazole tolyltriazole 2 hydroxyquinoline and paracetamol with the exception of 2 hydroxyquinoline the highest passages were observed for neutral hydrophilic mps in accordance with scientific literature the effects of the permeate flux were more prominent on the smallest mps fujioka et al 2012b and an inverse correlation between passage and permeate flux could be observed verliefde et al 2009 after 2 h of filtration at a permeate flux of 10 l m 2 h 1 no relevant passage variations could be observed with the exception of 2 hydroxyquinoline which increased from 9 to 15 after 5 h the passage of the four target mps was almost doubled compared to the previous measurements whereas after 24 h the passage decreased to values which were higher than those observed at a permeate flux of 25 l m 2 h 1 1h benzotriazole passage increased from 22 2 to 30 2 tolyltriazole from 15 2 to 18 2 2 hydroxyquinoline from 8 7 0 2 to 14 4 and paracetamol from 3 2 0 6 to 4 0 4 for 25 l m 2 h 1 after 2 h and 10 l m 2 h 1 after 24 h respectively when the flux was set back to 25 l m 2 h 1 the mps passage after 24 h was comparable to that observed after 4 d of filtration suggesting repeatability of the methodology and reversibility of the membrane structure from these measurements we could obtain four different mps passage profiles as a function of filtration time fig 6 the behavior of polar mps deviated from that of the ec passage which increased at the lower permeate flux but remained stable throughout filtration at a given permeate flux fig 6 bottom based on the ec data these variations in mps passage cannot be attributed to changes in membrane properties e g enlargement of intramolecular spaces within the active layer or membrane charge the results suggest that the transport of small hydrophilic mps is enhanced within at least the first 5 h following a pressure drop possibly due to accumulation onto or within the membrane and subsequent permeation unknown matrix effects leading to higher passage cannot be excluded to the best of our knowledge the passage profiles obtained from the results of this study have not been reported before and can provide information worth considering when designing mps rejection experiments from an untreated water matrix by ro in recirculation mode based on our results and depending on the quality of the feed water it can be advised to discharge the permeate produced within at least 5 h following a pressure drop and to monitor the permeate quality during the subsequent 24 h 4 conclusions ro proved to be a robust barrier against most polar mps overall the passage figures observed for the investigated set of compounds ranged from less than 1 25 in standard conditions statistical analysis showed significant influence of physicochemical properties on compound passage compound size and passage were highly correlated for neutral mps and charge for anionic mps determining key factors were also membrane chemistry and feed water properties neutral and moderate hydrophobic mps showed a weak inverse correlation between size and passage however in some cases passage values higher than those of a hydrophilic compound of comparable size were observed neutral hydrophilic mps showed a strong inverse correlation between size and passage when larger than 180 da nearly no passage was observed the smaller uncharged hydrophilic mp 1h benzotriazole 119 05 da displayed up to 25 5 passage anionic mps displayed almost no passage whereas minor breakthrough of cationic mps of comparable size was observed ro carried at a low permeate flux resulted in higher mps passage particularly for small neutral hydrophilic mps for at least 5 h following a pressure drop strong passage fluctuations were observed in summary the passage size correlation can be used to qualitatively predict the behavior of neutral mps in ro system equipped with tfc membranes of known mwco for anionic mps even lower passage figures could be expected for neutral mps the influence of solute membrane affinity h bonding or non polar interactions should be taken into account when predicting passage this study encourages further investigation

19223,the robustness of reverse osmosis ro against polar organic micropollutants mps was investigated in pilot scale drinking water treatment experiments were carried in hypoxic conditions to treat a raw anaerobic riverbank filtrate spiked with a mixture of thirty model compounds the chemicals were selected from scientific literature data based on their relevance for the quality of freshwater systems ro permeate and drinking water mps passage and the influence of permeate flux were evaluated with a typical low pressure ro membrane and quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry a strong inverse correlation between size and passage of neutral hydrophilic compounds was observed this correlation was weaker for moderately hydrophobic mps anionic mps displayed nearly no passage due to electrostatic repulsion with the negatively charged membrane surface whereas breakthrough of small cationic mps could be observed the passage figures observed for the investigated set of mps ranged from less than 1 25 statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between physicochemical properties and passage the effects of permeate flux were more pronounced for small neutral mps which displayed a higher passage after a pressure drop graphical abstract image 1 keywords reverse osmosis ro drinking water treatment polar micropollutants mps 1 introduction the occurrence of organic micropollutants mps in natural drinking water sources is regarded as a high priority environmental issue loos et al 2013 luo et al 2014 schwarzenbach et al 2006 in particular polar mps can be highly water soluble and mobile reemtsma et al 2016 potentially reaching source waters and even finished drinking water benotti et al 2009 eschauzier et al 2012 reemtsma et al 2016 there is concern over the potential effects of human exposure to trace concentrations of individual compounds or chemical mixtures via drinking water brack et al 2015 schriks et al 2010 drinking water utilities tend to i use the cleanest sources available and ii implement advanced treatments to remove unwanted chemicals riverbank filtration is an efficient natural pre treatment used by several drinking water utilities across europe capable of lowering biological and chemical impurities as a result of mechanical retention adsorption and bio chemical degradation taking place during infiltration of surface water through the riverbank and the subsurface tufenkji et al 2002 not all mps are eliminated by riverbank filtration bertelkamp et al 2014 huntscha et al 2013 and therefore additional treatment might still be necessary in this article we focus on reverse osmosis ro drinking water treatment applied to raw bank filtrate ro filtration per se doesn t involve chemical

filtrate in pilot scale ro drinking water treatment and assess whether stand alone ro step can be considered for further implementation in lieu of the conventional production chain we also aimed to elucidate the transport of organic solutes through ro membranes by relating solute physicochemical properties to passage rates and by assessing the influence of the permeate flux a series of experiments were performed at the research facility of a drinking water utility in the dutch province of zuid holland so that an actual source water i e raw anaerobic riverbank filtrate could be used as ro feed water we studied the removal of thirty model polar mps relevant for the water cycle such as herbicides industrial chemicals pharmaceuticals personal care products and metabolites formed under environmental conditions the effects of the permeate flux were also investigated we introduce a ro pilot system capable of keeping hypoxic conditions while being operated in recirculation mode such system is novel and ensured that the precipitation of the dissolved iron naturally occurring in the bank filtrate used as ro feed water would not take place de facto preventing membrane fouling

scientific literature data were reviewed to select 30 model mps based on their detection in natural freshwater ro permeates and finished drinking water table 1 the compounds were amenable for analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms the mps were assigned to four physicochemical properties categories based on their charge and hydrophobicity the ph dependent octanol water distribution coefficient expressed as log d ow was used as a measure of hydrophobicity due to the inclusion of ionisable mps amongst the model compounds the log d values were calculated at ph 7 to match the ph of the natural water fed to the ro pilot more details in section 2 4 a cut off value of 2 was used to distinguish between hydrophilic and moderately hydrophobic mps

anionic and iv cationic the selection ensured that a broad range of physicochemical properties were covered to support the elucidation of the removal mechanisms the molecular weight mw distribution ranged evenly from approximately 100 da 300 da with perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa being the only outlier 413 97 da the log d ph7 ranged from 1 5 acesulfame to 4 6 triclosan a variety of chemical

mg l of positive and negative ms ionisation mps respectively and 17 5 g l na2so3 for each experiment one stock solution was diluted in 698 l feed water to obtain concentrations of approximately 10 and 20 μg l per mps and 50 mg l na2so3 as oxygen scavenger these concentrations guaranteed the quantification of 99 removal i e 1 passage based on the analytical method s detection limits 2 4 ro feed water raw anaerobic riverbank filtrate was freshly abstracted from a well field in the premises of the drinking water treatment plant dwtp where the experiments were conducted this bank filtrate is also used as source water by the dwtp where conventional treatment is applied the feed was kept in hypoxic conditions throughout filtration quality parameters are reported in table s 2 1 of the supplementary material 2 5 hypoxic ro pilot scale installation a pilot scale ro system was built and operated in recirculation mode to treat anaerobic riverbank filtrate under hypoxic conditions such a system was not commercially available or reported elsewhere the pilot was a closed system consisting of a 720 l stainless steel feed reservoir a high pressure pump and one 4 inch membrane pressure vessel permeate and concentrate lines were recirculated to the feed reservoir via airtight connections a detailed description and a picture of the ro pilot are provided in the supplementary material section s 3 and figure s 3 1 respectively whereas a diagram displaying the essential features of the system is provided in fig 1 the low pressure ro lpro membrane chosen for this study was an espa2 ld 4040 hydranautics oceanside ca this membrane is a typical thin film composite tfc with an active layer of cross linked aromatic polyamide designed for low pressure filtration and employed in a variety of water recycling applications fujioka et al 2012a the properties of the espa2 membrane are summarized in table 2 2 6 ro filtration protocol the 720 l feed reservoir was filled with 698 l of anaerobic riverbank filtrate while being flushed with nitrogen the mps were dosed to the feed water with a smart digital pump from grundfos b v almere the netherlands filtration was carried at a constant 15 recovery and 25 l m 2 h 1 permeate flux the temperature was kept at 20 c filtration was conducted for 4 d before taking feed and permeate samples at t 5d to minimize the influence of hydrophobic interactions on the passage of moderate hydrophobic mps verliefde et al 2007b during sampling the feed reservoir was supplied with nitrogen feed water and permeate samples v 200 ml n 2 were collected in 250 ml polypropylene bottles and frozen immediately the second part of the study was conducted in a different season and focussed on the effects of operating conditions on the removal of a sub set of 18 mps we assessed the permeate flux as the quality of temperature and ph of the riverbank filtrate at the dwtp location has proven to be very stable in time we started ro filtration by applying the protocol used for the 30 analyte set the only difference was the feed temperature which this time was kept at 13 see table s 2 after the fourth day of filtration the permeate flux was kept constant at 10 l m 2 h 1 samples were then taken at t 2 h t 5 h and t 24 h before returning the permeate flux to 25 l m 2 h 1 and repeating the sampling at t 2 h 5 h and 24 h 2 7 assessment of solute passage the rejection equation can be used to quantify the removal of solutes by ro membranes 1 r 1 c rop c rof 100 where c rop and c rof are the permeate and the bulk feed concentrations respectively similarly the passage can be defined as 2 p c rop c rof 100 in principle rejection and passage can be used to describe the same phenomenon i e the removal of a solute by membrane filtration however the observed rejection equation eq 1 quantifies the percentage of solute that has been removed by ro filtration whereas the passage eq 2 quantifies the percentage of solute in the permeate finally the ec passage was calculated by adapting eq 2 3 ecp ec rop ec rof 100 where ecrop and ecrof are the electrical conductivity in μs cm in the permeate and the in the bulk feed solution respectively chemical passage was calculated by using eq 2 and the values reported in this manuscript are the averages and ranges obtained from experimental duplicates statistical analysis was performed within the r statistical environment r core team 2017 the analysis was limited to category i 7 neutral moderate hydrophobic mps category ii 10 neutral hydrophilic mps and category iii 9 anionic mps as only three cationic mps populated category iv one way analysis of variance anova was performed to reject the null hypothesis that the physicochemical properties categories were the same in terms of passage mean pairwise comparisons between categories were conducted with post hoc tukey honestly significant difference hsd test ruxton and beauchamp 2008 both anova and tukey s hsd test were calculated with 95 confidence intervals ci in addition the spearman correlation coefficient r was calculated to assess the correlation between passage molecular weight and hydrophobicity of all model mps including cationic compounds 2 8 sample preparation a sample preparation method validated in our laboratories was adapted to this study albergamo et al 2018 the feed water samples v 1 ml n 2

results and discussion 3 1 removal of neutral and moderate hydrophobic mps neutral and moderate hydrophobic mps log d ph7 2 were substantially removed with the exception of 2 hydroxyquinoline all target analytes displayed a passage lower than 5 fig 2 the results of triclosan are not reported due to the large deviation between the measurements the hydroxyquinoline isomers selected as target mps are mid small organics 145 05 da with almost identical physicochemical properties except for the log d ph7 which is 2 4 and 1 8 for 2 and 4 hydroxyquinoline respectively due to our log d ph7 2 cut off the two isomers were assigned to different categories 2 hydroxyquinoline was regarded as moderate hydrophobic log d ph7 2 whereas 4 hydroxyquinoline as neutral hydrophilic log d ph7 2 after 4d the passage of 2 hydroxyquinoline was 8 1 0 3 fig 2 whereas that of 4 hydroxyquinoline was 3 5 0 1 fig 3 while size exclusion represents the main removal mechanism for neutral mps the rejection of moderate hydrophobic mps is also influenced by solute membrane affinity interactions these mps can adsorb onto ro membranes due to the affinity between hydrophobic moieties such as aromatic rings and hydrocarbon chains and the active layer of ro membranes kimura et al 2003a nghiem et al 2002 once membrane saturation is reached the adsorbed mps can partition through the membrane and diffuse to the permeate side in a process influenced by solute membrane affinity i e hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding verliefde et al 2009 consequently a higher rejection of moderate hydrophobic mps can be observed in the early filtration stages due to the combined effect of adsorption and size exclusion kimura et al 2003a for this reason the correlation between passage and size of hydrophobic mps appears to be weaker than that of neutral hydrophilic mps when plotting the passage of moderate hydrophobic mps as a function of their log d no clear correlation between these variables could be observed data not shown the passage differences between the hydroxyquinoline isomers could be explained by the lower hydrophilicity of 2 hydroxyquinoline and therefore its higher affinity for the active layer of the espa2 membrane which consisted of aromatic polyamide thus the removal of 2 hydroxyquinoline could also be influenced by solute membrane affinity interactions in addition to the size exclusion mechanism the higher hydrophobicity of 2 hydroxyquinoline could be confirmed by its chromatographic behaviour in a 7 min analysis run with reversed phase chromatography 2 hydroxyquinoline had a retention time tr of 5 03 min whereas the tr of 4 hydroxyquinoline was 4 03 min this is also in agreement with earlier work published by our group brulik et al 2013 the second least well removed moderate hydrophobic mp was bisphenol a for which we observed up to 4 passage the result is in accordance with the removal efficiency from spiked raw lake water in a bench scale ro filtration study comerton et al 2008 in a recent pilot scale investigation bisphenol a was rejected by approximately 75 by a cellulose triacetate cta ro membrane fujioka et al 2015a 3 2 removal of neutral hydrophilic mps the transport of neutral hydrophilic mps is mainly hindered by a sieving mechanism cf introduction thus the larger the molecule the lower its passage bellona et al 2004 fujioka et al 2012a kiso et al 1992 ozaki and li 2002 the mps selection included 10 uncharged hydrophilic compounds covering a mw range from approximately 100 da 300 da the overall removal of these mps was very high with observed passages lower than 5 for almost all compounds all neutral hydrophilic mps larger than 180 da were almost completely removed passage 1 in accordance with scientific literature a strong correlation between mw and mps removal by ro membranes was found fig 3 by adapting a method proposed by lópez muñoz et al 2009 it was estimated that the cut off value mwco of the espa2 membrane in our operating conditions corresponded to approximately 140 da which is in accordance with findings from yangali quintanilla et al 2010 however the mwco of ro membranes is not an absolute value and should be used for semi qualitative prediction only as expected the smallest mps displayed the lowest removal efficiencies 1h benzotriazole 119 05 da and tolyltriazole 133 15 da showed 25 4 and 17 4 passage respectively the third least well removed neutral hydrophilic mp was phenylurea 136 06 da for which we quantified 10 1 passage to the best of our knowledge this compound has not been investigated in membrane filtration before the addition of a methyl group to 1h benzotriazole resulted in a decreased passage of the methylated derivative tolyltriazole which supports size exclusion as main removal mechanism this is in accordance with previous research where a correlation between removal and number of methyl groups was observed steinle darling et al 2007 the removal efficiencies of benzotriazoles quantified in this study were in close agreement with observations from a full scale advanced water recycling plant where ro was applied to treat secondary wastewater treatment effluents where 70 and 85 rejection were observed for 1h benzotriazole and methyl 1h benzotriazole respectively loi et al 2013 in a separate study on advanced water recycling where ro permeate was used for groundwater replenishment the average removal efficiencies were 51 and 53 for 1h benzotriazole and its methylated derivatives respectively busetti et al 2015 it is challenging to explain the lower removal efficiencies reported in the latter study since no details about feed water characteristics and ro operational parameters were given by the authors whose goal was the validation of an analytical method nevertheless the lower removal might be attributed to a different feed water composition higher feed water temperature or to the employment of a more open ro membrane the benzotriazoles are small emerging contaminants which are frequently and globally detected in the water cycle in the high ng l to low μg l range due to their incomplete removal by conventional wastewater treatment giger et al 2006 loos et al 2013 van leerdam et al 2009 in general small neutral mps like the benzotriazoles are not fully retained by lpro membranes observations from a dtwp in which the production chain consisted of riverbank filtration aeration a split stream treatment with ro and full stream active carbon filtration suggest that the combined treatments are only partially effective on small neutral mps kegel et al 2010 observation from a full scale municipal wastewater treatment plant upgraded with post ozonation followed by sand filtration hollender et al 2009 showed that a medium ozone dose 0 6 g o3 g 1 doc led to 70 removal of 1h benzotriazole where necessary the passage of small neutral mps such as the benzotriazoles could be lowered by employing tighter ro membranes in general the removal efficiencies of ro drinking water treatment can be maximised following combination with other treatments however the smallest neutral polar mps might still be detectable in the permeate boleda et al 2011 3 3 removal of ionic mps as expected excellent removal of anionic mps was observed passage 1 the espa2 has its isoelectric point at ph 4 tu chivas nghiem 2015 and a zeta potential of 40 mv at ph 7 fujioka et al 2013 consequently it displayed a net negative charge at the operating feed ph the electrostatic repulsion between anionic solutes and negatively charged membranes represents an additional mechanism that leads to low passage ozaki and li 2002 the results are shown in fig 4 considering the behaviour of neutral polar compounds in ro filtration and the mw of the anionic mps investigated steric hindrance should be considered in addition to electrostatic repulsion when interpreting the low passage values of negatively charged mps observed in this study two quaternary ammonium ions were selected as cationic mps along with 2 methylamino pyridine we observed passage of 2 5 0 1 and 0 3 0 1 for tetrapropylammonium and tetrabutylammonium respectively whereas the passage of 2 methylamino pyridine the smallest cation was 8 8 0 1 these values although limited to three compounds only suggest a decreasing passage trend with increasing mw and a higher transport of cationic mps compared to anionic mps of comparable size passage of positively charged mps during ro filtration can be expected due to charge concentration polarization i e a localized increase in concentration of cations onto the negatively charged active layer due to electrostatic attractions leading to lower rejection fujioka et al 2015b verliefde et al 2008 3 4 statistical analysis the passage values of the mps in category i ii and iii were log transformed and visualised in a box and whisker plot this highlighted the overall lower passage of anionic mps compared to neutral compounds fig 5 the anova test run on this dataset returned a p value of 0 00297 with 95 ci indicating significant difference in the mean passage amongst the three categories the tukey s test showed modest difference between category i and iii p 0 04077 significant difference between category ii and iii p 0 00264 whereas the differences between category i and ii were not significant p 0 66295 these results indicate a significant relationship between passage and compound physicochemical properties as categorised in this study and highlight the role of electrostatic repulsion in preventing transport of anionic mps through tfc ro membranes however the additional effects of size should not be excluded when interpreting the low passage of anionic mps as commented in the previous section 3 3 hydrophobicity expressed as log d had no significant impact on the passage of neutral polar organics to gain more insights data of all mps excluding triclosan 29 compounds were pulled together and the spearman correlations between mw log d and passage were assessed passage and mw showed good correlation r 0 77 p 0 01 contrary to the log d r 0 20 p 0 31 this highlights i the overall relevance of compound size in hindering transport of polar organics through tfc ro membranes and ii the lack of relationship between passage and hydrophobicity which is in line with the results obtained from the anova and the tukey s test the results of the statistical analysis pointed to compound mw as a prominent physicochemical property and in part to charge to explain the passage of polar mps through ro membranes the clear trend between passage and mw can be used to qualitatively predict the passage especially in ro systems equipped with tfc membranes of known mwco for mps which deprotonate at operating feed water ph even lower passage figures could be expected despite the lack of significance between category i and category ii the impact of solute membrane affinity interactions on the passage of uncharged organics needs further assessment caution should be exercised when predicting the passage of neutral compounds exhibiting high log d values as seen for bisphenol a which displayed 4 passage despite its size of 228 29 da 3 5 influence of permeate flux the overall removal efficiencies of the investigated mps at t 5 d data not shown were comparable to those presented in sections 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 and therefore the results and discussion in this section are limited to the compounds for which we quantified more than 1 passage i e 1h benzotriazole tolyltriazole 2 hydroxyquinoline and paracetamol with the exception of 2 hydroxyquinoline the highest passages were observed for neutral hydrophilic mps in accordance with scientific literature the effects of the permeate flux were more prominent on the smallest mps fujioka et al 2012b and an inverse correlation between passage and permeate flux could be observed verliefde et al 2009 after 2 h of filtration at a permeate flux of 10 l m 2 h 1 no relevant passage variations could be observed with the exception of 2 hydroxyquinoline which increased from 9 to 15 after 5 h the passage of the four target mps was almost doubled compared to the previous measurements whereas after 24 h the passage decreased to values which were higher than those observed at a permeate flux of 25 l m 2 h 1 1h benzotriazole passage increased from 22 2 to 30 2 tolyltriazole from 15 2 to 18 2 2 hydroxyquinoline from 8 7 0 2 to 14 4 and paracetamol from 3 2 0 6 to 4 0 4 for 25 l m 2 h 1 after 2 h and 10 l m 2 h 1 after 24 h respectively when the flux was set back to 25 l m 2 h 1 the mps passage after 24 h was comparable to that observed after 4 d of filtration suggesting repeatability of the methodology and reversibility of the membrane structure from these measurements we could obtain four different mps passage profiles as a function of filtration time fig 6 the behavior of polar mps deviated from that of the ec passage which increased at the lower permeate flux but remained stable throughout filtration at a given permeate flux fig 6 bottom based on the ec data these variations in mps passage cannot be attributed to changes in membrane properties e g enlargement of intramolecular spaces within the active layer or membrane charge the results suggest that the transport of small hydrophilic mps is enhanced within at least the first 5 h following a pressure drop possibly due to accumulation onto or within the membrane and subsequent permeation unknown matrix effects leading to higher passage cannot be excluded to the best of our knowledge the passage profiles obtained from the results of this study have not been reported before and can provide information worth considering when designing mps rejection experiments from an untreated water matrix by ro in recirculation mode based on our results and depending on the quality of the feed water it can be advised to discharge the permeate produced within at least 5 h following a pressure drop and to monitor the permeate quality during the subsequent 24 h 4 conclusions ro proved to be a robust barrier against most polar mps overall the passage figures observed for the investigated set of compounds ranged from less than 1 25 in standard conditions statistical analysis showed significant influence of physicochemical properties on compound passage compound size and passage were highly correlated for neutral mps and charge for anionic mps determining key factors were also membrane chemistry and feed water properties neutral and moderate hydrophobic mps showed a weak inverse correlation between size and passage however in some cases passage values higher than those of a hydrophilic compound of comparable size were observed neutral hydrophilic mps showed a strong inverse correlation between size and passage when larger than 180 da nearly no passage was observed the smaller uncharged hydrophilic mp 1h benzotriazole 119 05 da displayed up to 25 5 passage anionic mps displayed almost no passage whereas minor breakthrough of cationic mps of comparable size was observed ro carried at a low permeate flux resulted in higher mps passage particularly for small neutral hydrophilic mps for at least 5 h following a pressure drop strong passage fluctuations were observed in summary the passage size correlation can be used to qualitatively predict the behavior of neutral mps in ro system equipped with tfc membranes of known mwco for anionic mps even lower passage figures could be expected for neutral mps the influence of solute membrane affinity h bonding or non polar interactions should be taken into account when predicting passage this study encourages further investigation of ro applied to bank filtrate higher removal efficiencies could be achieved by using tighter membranes larger membrane elements or multi stage ro acknowledgments this study was funded by the drinking

19224,the understanding of fouling behavior and mechanism is critical for fouling control in membrane processes this study adopted a novel fluorescence front face excitation emission matrix ff eem approach to characterize the fluorescence foulants deposited on membrane surface methods for quantifying protein and humic substances deposited on ultrafiltration uf membrane were established foulants deposited on the membrane surface during the uf of model foulants bovine serum albumin bsa and humic acids ha and wastewater effluent organic matter efom were quantified using the ff eem and liquid eem coupled with mass balance calculation the foulants mass data obtained by ff eem were further used to analyze fouling mechanism involved in uf the ff eem based method was more accurate than the liquid eem based method as the problems associated with liquid eem based method such as the error propagation in the mass balance calculation and the ineffectiveness of inner filter correction were avoided in ff eem based method the fouling resistance did not correlate well with the amount of foulants as the major fouling mechanism instead of the mass of foulants mainly determined the extent of fouling this work demonstrated ff eem could be a powerful tool for investigating fouling evolution and fouling mechanism in uf process graphical abstract image 1 keywords ultrafiltration membrane fouling fluorescence spectroscopy front face excitation emission matrix ff eem 1 introduction membrane technology is widely used for various environmental applications due to its advantages in energy efficiency simplicity manufacturing scalability and small footprint park et al 2017 however all membrane techniques are subjected to the challenge of membrane fouling huang et al 2008 khan et al 2013 meng et al 2017 to achieve effective fouling control the precise description on the evolution of membrane fouling is required flux decline under constant pressure mode or transmembrane pressure tmp rise under constant flux mode is the most commonly used way to describe membrane fouling however the information obtained by this way is very limited in order to characterize the foulants deposited on membrane foulants were removed and further characterized henderson et al 2011 kimura et al 2004 liu et al 2011 however the detailed procedures for removing foulants varies in different studies e g the foulants were scrapped using sheet wiped with sponge removed by backwash or extracted using acid base henderson et al 2011 kimura et al 2004 liu et al 2011 this difference may impair the comparability of the results in different studies besides the procedures highly depend on the personal experimental skill which may lead to inaccurate conclusions some researches estimated the foulants on membrane through mass balance calculation detailed in the eq s1 in supplementary information jermann et al 2007 qu et al 2012 the mass balance based method for quantifying the foulants is indirect and the measuring error would be propagated and magnified in the mass balance calculation as shown in eq s2 in the si a variety of novel techniques using ultrasonic electrical or optical approach have been developed for directly characterizing fouling layer evolution during membrane filtration chai et al 2007 and sim et al 2013b investigated the ultrasonic time domain reflectometry utdr for detecting the fouling layer development using sound waves an electrical impedance spectroscopy eis was used to characterize membrane fouling via alternating electrical currents cen et al 2015 sim et al 2013a optical characterization approaches such as direct observation through the membrane dotm technique cen et al 2015 li et al 1998 and optical coherence tomography oct gao et al 2014 li et al 2016 were also documented for characterizing membrane surface coverage and foulants depth profiles however the ultrasonic based approach i e utdr was limited by the small difference in acoustic properties between fouling layer and water or a membrane sim et al 2013b the interpretation of nyquist plot as well as modelling of conductance and capacitance in eis analysis were complicated and it is difficult to be carried out in many polymer membranes due to the high impedance of the material chen et al 2004 besides the resolution 0 5 μm of optical based approaches dotm and oct can only characterize the particulate fouling instead of the fouling caused by dissolved organic matter dom chen et al 2004 li et al 2016 fluorescence spectroscopy has been widely used in membrane fouling investigation for its high sensitivity and selectivity henderson et al 2009 fluorescence excitation and emission matrix eem analysis is commonly applied for characterizing dom in diluted solution with optical absorbance at 254 nm uv254 0 05 the conventional fluorescence eem can only be used to characterize the solutions involving in membrane filtration i e feed permeate and retentate but not to measure the foulants deposited on membrane surface opaque liquid or solid substances also contain fluorophores but they cannot be observed using conventional fluorescence spectrometer alternatively the fluorescence of these opaque samples can be measured from the front which is called front face fluorescence as shown in fig s1 in si eisinger and flores 1979 different from the conventional fluorescence eem fig s1a front face fluorescence ff eem is performed by orienting a sample surface at 30 60 relative to the incident beam fig s1b this method has been coupled with multi scanning

it has been even used for quantifying fluorescence micro pollutants polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons polychlorinated biphenyls and btex absorbed on the flat disk membrane made by c18 silica or polymer

applications of ff eem indicated that the ff eem based method could be able to quantify the fluorescence foulants deposited on membrane however study using this ff eem for characterizing fluorescence foulants deposited on the membrane surface during membrane filtration is very rare pawlowski et al 2016 first reported the application of ff eem to fouling characterization in reverse electrodialysis by using spectrofluorometer connecting to an optical sensor coupled with principle components analysis pca they found that humic substances in the feed water reduced the intrinsic fluorescence of the ion exchange membrane but the quenching effect of humic substance on the fluorescence of other foulants was not considered peleato et al 2017 characterized membrane fouling in uf process with pre coagulation for drinking water treatment using the front face fluorometer with fiber probe but only single excitation emission wavelength pair i e tryptophan like fluorescence at ex em 230 340 nm instead of the full eem spectra was used and the fluorescence overlap was not considered the possible interference of humic substances on the other fluorophores was not considered in this study either besides both of these two studies used optical probe as an accessory of ff eem the optical probe allowed non destructive and in situ fluorescence detection but the distance between the probe and sample as well as the orientation angle of the probe should be fixed precisely in every measurement the natural light should be properly shielded to prevent entering into the optical sensor and interfering with the emission signal detection to avoid the possible interferences occurred in the measurement with the optical probe some researches in other fields fixed the sample inside the spectrofluorometer using a front face sample holder fig s1b like a cuvette used for liquid eem measurement kulmyrzaev et al 2005 sahar et al 2009 this approach could be much easier and more economic as the optical probe accessory was not used however this method has not been adopted for characterizing membrane fouling so far therefore the aim of this study was to establish method for characterizing the fluorescence foulants deposited on ultrafiltration uf membrane surface using ff eem with front face sample holder and to apply this method to quantify the foulant evolution and analyze the fouling mechanism in uf fouling tests using model foulants bovine serum albumin bsa and humic acid ha solutions and real water sample effluent organic matter from wastewater treatment plant denoted as efom the ff eem method was compared with the conventional liquid eem method coupled with mass balance in terms of quantifying the foulants in the uf tests in addition fouling mechanisms were also analyzed by fitting the foulants mass build up data obtained by ff eem to the hermia s models hermia 1982 2 material and methods 2 1 ff eem measurement fluorescence spectra of virgin fouled membrane surface was recorded using a spectrofluorometer f7000 hitachi japan mounted with a front face sample holder with an incident angle of 30 orient koji china as shown in fig s1 the incident angle of 30 was chosen due to the less reflected light and the larger distributed area of incident light which decreased the sensitivity of the measurement to the precise placement of samples in the holder lakowicz 2006 it was found that the water moisture content in the membrane sample would influence the ff eem measurement thus the membrane specimens were first dried at 60 c for 1 h and cooled down to room temperature prior to measurement then a slice 6 mm 8 mm was cut from the membrane specimen to be fixed into the front face holder with a quartz coverslip for measurement fig s1b it was found that the focusing area of the excitation light onto the membrane was around 3 mm 6 mm fig s2 in si which was comparable to the field of view 0 2 mm 5 mm in microscope or confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm refer to the method used in microscope and clsm analyses multiple samples from different spots of each membrane were also prepared and measured using ff eem here to capture possible variation due to the fouling heterogeneity or possible bias induced by the pretreatment steps ff eems were generated by scanning over excitation wavelengths of 220 450 nm at interval of 5 nm and emission wavelengths of 250 550 nm at interval of 1 nm excitation and emission slit widths were set at 5 nm yu et al 2015 photomultiplier tube pmt voltage was optimized to 550 v to acquire enough sensitivity without fluorescence saturation peleato et al 2017 scanning speed was set to 2400 nm min to ensure the stability and accuracy xiao et al 2018 2 2 parafac analysis it was found that the polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf uf membrane 100 kda tianchuang china used in this study also exhibited fluorescence and it was overlapped with the fluorescence spectra of foulants fig 1 in order to quantify the foulants on the membrane surface the fluorescences of foulants and membrane were decomposed by parafac analysis parafac modelling procedures were conducted according to the tutorial published by murphy et al 2013 using dreem toolbox http openfluor weebly com dreem html in matlab version 2014 mathworks inc natick ma the parafac model was validated following methods including split half analysis variance explained and core consistency diagnostic 2 3 standard curve establishment in order to quantify the foulants on the fouled membrane calibration curves were made by loading known amounts of the standard foulants i e bsa and ha sigma aldrich co llc st louis mo usa on membrane and subjected to ff eem measurement briefly 30 μl of bsa ha or mixture of bsa and ha at different concentrations was uniformly dropped on the 6 mm 8 mm virgin membrane and it was dried at 60 c for 1 h and then cooled down to room temperature for ff eem measurement the solution dropped on the membrane did not penetrate through the membrane no color was found on the opposite side of a membrane dropped with ha after dry this ensured the foulants were totally deposited on the membrane surface standard curve was made by fitting the fluorescence response of foulants obtained from ff eem measurement coupled with parafac modelling against the known specific mass mass per unit area of foulants deposited on the membrane it was found that the presence of ha influenced the front face fluorescence of bsa on membrane surface standard curve of bsa in the presence of different amount of ha was established by analyzing the fluorescence of different amounts of bsa and ha on the membrane 0 150 mg m2 the dropping amount was designed table s1 according to central composite design ccd and analyzed by response surface methodology using design expert software version 10 0 6 stat ease inc minneapolis mn the bsa fluorescence response obtained from ff eem coupled with parafac was used for the statistical analysis and calibration curve establishment 2 4 uf experiments uf tests were conducted using 10 mg l of bsa alone total organic carbon toc 5 21 0 01 mg l 10 mg l ha alone toc 4 98 0 05 mg l a mixture containing 2 mg l bsa and 8 mg l ha toc 5 12 0 03 mg l and efom toc 5 56 0 05 mg l as the feed water respectively more detailed analysis on the efom can be found in the si the bsa and ha mixture with a doc ratio of 2 8 was chosen to simulate the characteristics of the real feed of uf e g surface water or wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent filloux et al 2012 the ph of all uf feeds was adjusted to 7 0 before the uf tests the efom sample was collected from the effluent of a wwtp in harbin china filtered by 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane and stored at 4 c prior to being used the conductivity of efom sample was 700 μs cm 1 and thus all the conductivities of bsa ha and mixture of bsa and ha solutions were adjusted to 700 μs cm 1 by adding nacl beforehand in order to keep a comparable ion strength uf experiments were performed using dead end filtration cell as previously described chang et al 2015 a schematic diagram of the setup is shown in fig s3 in supporting information briefly a 20 ml filtration cell was continuously fed by a 1 l glass reservoir the uf was performed in dead end mode and neither side stream nor backwash was used the flux of the filtration cell was controlled at 240 l m2h using a peristaltic pump bt100 2j longer precision pump co ltd baoding china a pvdf uf membrane disk tianchuang waterpure equipment co ltd hangzhou china with effective filtration area of 4 15 cm2 and molecular weight cut off mwco of 100 kda was fixed into the filtration cell a pressure transducer ptp708 tuopo electric foshan china was mounted between the filtration cell and the suction pump to monitor the tmp and it was connected to a computer for data logging at every 30s uf experiments using different feed solutions 10 mg l bsa 10 mg l ha 2 mg l bsa 8 mg l ha and efom were repeated and stopped at different filtration durations 5 15 30 45 60 min and the time when tmp exceeded 50 kpa for collecting membrane specimens which were fouled to different extents the membrane specimens were characterized using ff eem the foulants deposited on the membrane were calculated according to the standard curves obtained the fouling resistance at the end of each uf test was calculated according to darcy s law 1 r f δ p δ p 0 μ j where r f is the fouling resistance m 1 δp and δp 0 are the tmp pa at the end and the tmp pa at beginning of the uf test respectively μ is the dynamic viscosity pa s j is the permeate flux l m2 h the specific fouling resistance r fouling resistance per unit foulant mass m mg was also calculated for each uf test 2 r r f m f where r f is the fouling resistance m 1 in eq 1 m f is the specific mass of foulants mass per unit aera mg m2 obtained by ff eem based method 2 5 foulants quantification based on liquid eem measurement mass of foulants on uf membrane was also determined by liquid eem coupled with mass balance calculation the eems of feed permeate and retentate in each uf test were measured using a spectrofluorometer f7000 hitachi japan with a 1 cm quartz cuvette fig s1a the parameters for the liquid eem analysis were the same as the ff eem except for the pmt voltage which was adjusted to 700 v for a better sensitivity ultraviolet and visible uvvis absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer cary 300 uv vis varian australia for inner filter correction using eq 3 lakowicz 2006 3 f c o r r e c t e d f o b s e r v e d 10 o d e x o d e m 2 where od ex and od em are optical density i e light absorbance at excitation and emission wavelengths f observed and f corrected are the fluorescence intensity that measured by the spectrofluometer and fluorescence intensity after inner filter correction respectively the eems of bsa and ha solution at known concentrations were also measured all the eems were included into one dataset and subjected to parafac analysis the fluorescence intensity at the maximum f max was calculated by multiplying the maximum excitation loading and maximum emission loading for each component by its score obtained from the parafac model the f max is proportional to the concentration of corresponding fluorescence component murphy et al 2013 stedmon and bro 2008 the f max of standard samples were used to established the calibration curves and the calibration curves were made using the pure solutions of protein and ha the amounts of ha like substances and protein like substances in efom samples were calculated using the f max of parafac components and the calibration curves obtained the foulants mass was calculated according to the mass balance equation eq s1 it should be noted that the fluorescence components in efom used in this study showed similar fluorescence feature as those of bsa and ha figs s4 and s5 which indicated the similar property of efom fluorescence components and bsa ha thus the bsa and ha were also used as standards to quantify the fluorescence components in efom another liquid eem based foulants characterization method in which foulants were removed by rinse scrub or backwash and then characterized was not used in this study this was because the rinse step greatly depended on the personal experimental skill and the wash off method cannot retrieve all the foulants figs s6 and s7 which could incur a bias henderson et al 2011 liu et al 2011 2 6 other analytical methods dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of each sample was determined using a toc analyzer multi n c 2100s analytic jena germany a fluorescence microscope bx5 olympus tokyo japan was also employed for observing virgin and fouled membrane surface at a magnification factor of 4 2 7 fouling mechanism analysis fouling mechanisms involved in uf filtration were analyzed using the mass of foulant determined by ff eem based method according to hermia s model under constant flux condition as below hermia 1982 huang et al 2008 4 d p d m f k p n where p is defined as follows p δp δp 0 and m f is the specific mass of foulants mass per unit aera mg doc m2 obtained by ff eem based method it should be noted that the m f was adopted in eq 3 instead of filtration time or filtration volume used in other studies huang et al 2008 qu et al 2014 in these studies the m f data could not be readily determined in previous studies it was assumed that the rejection of foulants by the membrane was constant as filtration time increasing as indicated by the previous studies and thus dm f in the eq 3 could be equal to dt or dv huang et al 2008 qu et al 2014 however the m f could be measured in our study using the ff eem thus the mf instead of filtration time volumes was used to avoid any possible deviations resulting from the assumption k is a constant varying according to different modes of fouling the exponent n characterizes the filtration mechanism mode table 1 the specific mass of foulants m f data were fitted against the p obtained in the uf tests according to the intergral forms of eq 3 as shown in eq 4 7 table 1 the major fouling mechanism was identified according to the correlation coefficiency r 2 of the fitting to each model 2 8 statistical analysis the significance of difference was determined using analysis of variance anova at the p 0 05 significance level all analyses were performed using the spss software package ibm spss statistics 19 spss inc somers ny 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration curve establishment for determining foulants mass on membrane using ff eem in order to quantify the foulants deposited on the membrane by ff eem standard curves were established by measuring the membrane surface loaded with known amounts of foulants as the same fluorophore in solid and solution may give different peak features in eems the solid phase bsa powder and bsa solution 10 mg l were first measured using ff eem fig s1b and conventional eem fig s1a respectively as expected the bsa solution gave bimodal peaks at ex em 220 325 nm and ex em 270 325 nm whereas the solid phase bsa showed a unimodal peak at ex em 290 330 nm fig 1 it seems like both peaks of bsa solution red shifted along the excitation wavelength and merged into a single peak in the solid state sample other studies also reported this change of peak position of bsa from liquid to solid form ammari et al 2014 mounier et al 2017 the pvdf membrane also exhibited multiple fluorescence peaks in ff eem as shown in fig 1 since the fluorescence peaks of solid phase bsa and those of membrane overlapped parafac analysis was used to decompose the bsa and membrane fluorescence fig s8 and table s2 in si the f max of bsa calculated from parafac analysis was plotted against the amount of deposited bsa to obtain the calibration curve fig s9a a strong correlation between deposited bsa amount and f max was found r 2 0 995 which suggested this method could give a satisfied accuracy for bsa quantification it should be noted that the sample prepared by dropping foulants on the membrane surface might be different from the foulants formed by pressure driven uf thus a bsa calibration curve was also established by using the samples prepared by uf of 10 mg l bsa for different durations the standard curve was similar to that obtained by using dropping method with p value 0 720 0 05 fig s9a and fig s11 which suggested the pressure applied during uf did not significantly impact the foulant surface and the ff eem measurement besides it was concerned that the too many foulants on the membrane would invalid the ff eem measurement as the excitation light could not penetrate into very thick foulants layer the experimental data showed that the fluorescence response was linearly correlated with the foulants as long as the deposited bsa did not exceed 2000 mg m2 fig s9 which suggested that the method was valid within a limited range humic substances are another common foulants for uf different from the fluorescence spectra of ha solution solid phase ha did not show any peaks in ff eem fig 2 the disappearance of fluorescence peak of ha from liquid to solid form was attributed to the strong inner filter effect resulting from the presence of highly light absorptive chromophores in ha ammari et al 2014 mounier et al 2017 muller et al 2011 interestingly the intrinsic fluorescence of pvdf membrane was also quenched to different extents as ha deposited observations of virgin membrane bsa fouled membrane and ha fouled membrane using fluorescence microscopy with ultraviolet excitation light source showed that there was a significant suppression of membrane intrinsic fluorescence in the presence of ha fig 2c this was consistent with the report of pawlowski et al 2016 who found humic substances from river water decreased fluorescence of ion exchange membrane according to this observation the fluorescence of membrane surface deposited with different known amounts of ha using ff eem was determined as shown in fig 3 the fluorescence intensity of membrane decreased with the increasing amounts of deposited ha the fluorescence intensity at the peak position of the membrane fluorescence ex em 275 375 nm was plotted against the amount of deposited ha and fitted with linear regression to obtain the calibration curve the linear range was up to 100 mg ha m2 as shown in fig s10 a fairly high r 2 value 0 994 was obtained which suggested this quantitative method was valid fig s10 in real circumstances the solution chemistry of the foulants solution may be varied which could affect the ff eem detection thus the effect of ph and conductivity ion strength of foulants solution on the ff eem measurement was also examined the results showed that the solution chemistry did not significantly influence the ff eem results as shown in fig s12 the dry treatment prior to ff eem measurement might eliminate the effect of solution chemistry besides the characteristics of membrane could also influence the ff eem analysis a hydrophilic cellulose acetate ca membrane was compared with a pvdf membrane used before by ff eem measurement no significant difference was found in the ff eem measurement of bsa using these two kinds of membrane fig s13 in real situation protein like and humic like foulants always coexist in the feed of uf process therefore the foulants deposited on the membrane surface could also contain both protein and humic substances henderson et al 2011 liu et al 2011 in order to establish the ff eem method for measuring the foulants containing both protein and ha the membranes deposited with different amounts of bsa and ha were characterized the deposited ha still correlated well with the membrane fluorescence in the presence of bsa as the effect of deposited bsa on the membrane intrinsic fluorescence was marginal fig 2c and fig s9b however it was observed the presence of ha significantly suppressed the fluorescence of bsa response surface methodology and ccd were used to quantitatively illustrate co effect of bsa and ha deposited on the fluorescence response of bsa in ff eem measurement different amounts of bsa and ha according to ccd table s1 in si were loaded on the membrane surface and characterized using ff eem parafac analysis was conducted to decompose the fluorescence spectra of bsa and membrane the fluorescence intensity obtained was subjected to the response surface analysis it is showed that the bsa fluorescence response increased with increasing amounts of bsa deposited while it decreased as ha increased fig 4 a significant correlation p 0 0001 and r 2 0 9505 was achieved which suggested the goodness of the fit was satisfactory for quantifying the bsa in the presence of ha table s5 as such the amount of deposited bsa can be calculated using the fluorescence intensity of bsa deposited obtained by parafac and deposited ha as eq 5 obtained from the response surface analysis 5 bsa response 2 5114 bsa 0 2709 ha 0 0203 bsa ha 42 6478 the ha deposited on membrane can still be calculated using the fluorescence intensity of membrane obtained by parafac regardless the amount of bsa being attached fig s15 it should be noted that all the samples from the uf tests and the standard samples were included in a dataset and subjected to the parafac analysis thus the fluorescence responses of standard foulants and the unknown samples were obtained from one parafac model this avoided the bias of the parafac results derived from different parafac models the protein like substances and humic like substances deposited on the membrane surface in uf of efom were also quantified by this method with bsa and ha as standards due to the similar feature of fluorescence components in efom in this study compared with bsa and ha as shown in figs s4 and s5 the method for quantifying foulant mass on membrane using the ff eem coupled with parafac and surface response analysis was henceforth abbreviated as ff eem based method while the foulant mass quantification method by using liquid eem coupled with parafac and mass balance calculation was abbreviated as liquid eem based method 3 2 quantification of mass of foulants in uf ff eem vs liquid eem in order to characterize the evolution of foulants mass during the uf a series of uf tests using different feeds were conducted the mass of foulants during uf tests were obtained by the ff eem based method as well as liquid eem based method as shown in fig 5 the fouling resistance eq 1 at each sampling point is also shown in fig 5 it can be found that the deposited foulants with relatively smaller errors were obtained using ff eem compared with those calculated by liquid eem based method and the deviation of the foulant mass determined by liquid eem based method increased as the uf went on this could be attributed to the error propagation in the mass balance calculation the deviation of foulant mass calculated by mass balance eq s1 was a combination of errors in the liquid eem measurements of the feed permeate and retentate and the errors were further amplified by the increasing filtration volume during uf detailed in si eq s2 the total mass of foulants was also calculated using doc mass balance the increasing deviation was also found as a result of the error propagation fig s16 in comparison the ff eem based method was proven to be much more precise as it avoided such drawback it can be also found that the mean values of bsa or protein like substances determined by the liquid eem based method were lower than those obtained from ff eem based method in the presence of humic substances in fig 5 c and d this may be attributed to the strong quenching effect of ha on bsa or protein in liquid eem measurement which could not be totally retrieved by the inner filter correction as shown in fig s17 in the ff eem based method the quenching effect of ha on bsa fluorescence was taken into consideration and quantified using response surface methodology and ccd in the standard curve establishment thus the underestimate of the mass of bsa or the protein like in the mixture foulants deposited on the membrane was avoided in the ff eem based method which also explains the accuracy of the ff eem based method 3 3 relationship between foulants buildup and fouling evolution fouling mechanism analysis as shown in fig 5 the fast buildup of foulant mass in bsa fouling test did not result in a rapid increase of fouling resistance compared to the other fouling tests the tmp profiles shown in fig 6 also indicated that the fouling rates in uf tests with different feed were in an order of bsa ha ha efom bsa which was totally different from the foulants buildup tendency in different uf tests bsa bsa ha efom ha shown in fig 5 this result suggested that the membrane fouling was not solely determined by the amount of foulants mass deposited on the membrane the specific fouling resistance r in eq 2 in each uf test was calculated using data in fig 5 as shown in fig 7 the specific fouling resistances varied significantly in different fouling tests the highest and lowest specific resistance were found in the ha and bsa fouling test respectively the specific resistances in the uf tests fed by bsa ha mixture and efom were quite similar p value 0 811 0 05 it should be noted that the specific fouling resistance calculation for the efom fouling test did not consider the mass of polysaccharides since it could not be detected by ff eem however the polysaccharides may not alter the specific resistance in efom test significantly since the polysaccharides content in the efom used in this study only accounted for 5 of toc protein 18 and humic substances 72 details can be found in the si the significant difference in specific fouling resistance suggested that the quantity of the foulants was not an only factor that influenced the fouling resistance other factors such as different fouling mechanisms may contribute to the severity of membrane fouling in order to elucidate the fouling mechanism in uf tests the foulant mass obtained by ff eem based approach and the corresponding tmp data were fitted to the modified hermia s model table 1 the r 2 value indicated the goodness of the modelling for each fouling test as shown in table 2 the higher r 2 value for cake formation model in the bsa fouling test suggested that the cake layer formation was the major fouling mechanism the fouling in uf test fed with ha solution was mainly governed by the standard pore blocking while intermediate pore blocking was identified as the dominated fouling mechanism in the bsa ha mixture fouling test and efom fouling test the results indicated that majority of the bsa foulant was deposited on the membrane surface and formed a loose cake layer which did not result in greater fouling resistance than those for the other fouling tests in the ha fouling test the standard pore blocking mechanism indicated that most of the ha foulant entered into the membrane pore and led to pore constriction and blocking which led to a higher specific fouling resistance than the other tests for the bsa ha fouling and efom fouling the intermediate pore blocking suggested parts of the foulants deposited onto the pores and blocked them whereas the rest foulants deposited onto the foulants which already deposited on the membrane this fouling mechanism could result in a moderate specific fouling resistance therefore the difference in specific fouling resistances fig 7 was mainly attributed to the various fouling mechanisms led by different foulants in the feed table 2 in virtue of this novel fouling characterization approach this work found that the major fouling mechanism rather than the quantity of foulants might play an important role in determine the uf membrane fouling this finding indicated that changing the fouling mechanism from pore blocking to cake layer formation might be effective in terms of fouling control it has also been reported that artificial cake layer formation by pre depositing particles was effective for fouling mitigation in uf cai et al 2008 2013 this implied the mechanism oriented fouling control strategy might be promising for fouling mitigation in uf processes 3 4 implications this study investigated the application of the ff eem to the fouling characterization in the uf the foulants mass deposited on the membrane in uf were accurately determined using this method which gave more in depth understanding of fouling behavior and fouling mechanism this indicated the ff eem could serve as a powerful tool for fouling analysis in uf it has been reported that the ff eem coupled with an optical probe for characterizing suspended liquid or solid surface pawlowski et al 2016 peleato et al 2017 sá et al 2017 which suggested it was possible to use the ff eem as a non destructive and in situ fluorescence characterization technique it should be noted that the characteristics of feed water in various uf processes for drinking water treatment and advanced treatment of wastewater was fairly complex where various known unknown fluorescence compounds and quenchers could be present in the water hence special consideration and individual calibration for each case are necessary besides the heterogeneity of the membrane surface and the foulants layer would influence the ff eem measurement since only small piece of membrane can be characterized in each measurement thus further study is warranted to overcome this drawback may be using the eem coupled with optical fiber with an x y motorized stage could allow a scan over much larger area on whole membrane this study is just a proof of concept work for applying the ff eem to fouling analysis in uf factors that would interfere the ff eem characterization will be investigated in details and the corresponding improvement will be made in our future study 4 conclusions this study adopted a new fluorescence spectroscopic method i e ff eem to characterize the foulants deposited on membrane surface methods for quantifying the model foulants bsa and ha and the efom deposited on uf membrane were established ff eem based method was compared to the liquid eem coupled with mass balance based method in terms of foulants quantification in the uf of bsa ha a mixture of bsa and ha and efom major fouling mechanisms were identified by modelling the foulants build up data to the hermia s model the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the mass of protein foulant was accurately quantified using ff eem coupled with parafac analysis to decompose the fluorescence 2 the amount of ha was measured by quantifying the decrease of membrane intrinsic fluorescence using ff eem as the ha could quench the fluorescence of membrane and the extent of quenching had linear correlation to the amount of ha deposited on the membrane besides the amount of protein in the presence of ha was accurately determined by quantifying the quenching effect of ha on protein using response surface analysis 3 ff eem based method was more accurate than the liquid eem coupled with mass balance method in terms of foulants quantification in the uf 4 the ff eem characterization suggested that the fouling resistance was not consistent with the quantity of foulants as the major fouling mechanism instead of the mass of foulants mainly determined the extent of fouling 5 over all the ff eem based method has the potential to be a powerful tool for analyzing uf fouling evolution and fouling mechanism acknowledgments this research was jointly supported by the national science

19224,the understanding of fouling behavior and mechanism is critical for fouling control in membrane processes this study adopted a novel fluorescence front face excitation emission matrix ff eem approach to characterize the fluorescence foulants deposited on membrane surface methods for quantifying protein and humic substances deposited on ultrafiltration uf membrane were established foulants deposited on the membrane surface during the uf of model foulants bovine serum albumin bsa and humic acids ha and wastewater effluent organic matter efom were quantified using the ff eem and liquid eem coupled with mass balance calculation the foulants mass data obtained by ff eem were further used to analyze fouling mechanism involved in uf the ff eem based method was more accurate than the liquid eem based method as the problems associated with liquid eem based method such as the error propagation in the mass balance calculation and the ineffectiveness of inner filter correction were avoided in ff eem based method the fouling resistance did not correlate well with the amount of foulants as the major fouling mechanism instead of the mass of foulants mainly determined the extent of fouling this work demonstrated ff eem could be a powerful tool for investigating fouling evolution and fouling mechanism in uf process graphical abstract image 1 keywords ultrafiltration membrane fouling fluorescence spectroscopy front face excitation emission matrix ff eem 1 introduction membrane technology is widely used for various environmental applications due to its advantages in energy efficiency simplicity manufacturing scalability and small footprint park et al 2017 however all membrane techniques are subjected to the challenge of membrane fouling huang et al 2008 khan et al 2013 meng et al 2017 to achieve effective fouling control the precise description on the evolution of membrane fouling is required flux decline under constant pressure mode or transmembrane pressure tmp rise under constant flux mode is the most commonly used way to describe membrane fouling however the information obtained by this way is very limited in order to characterize the foulants deposited on membrane foulants were removed and further characterized henderson et al 2011 kimura et al 2004 liu et al 2011 however the detailed procedures for removing foulants varies in different studies e g the foulants were scrapped using sheet wiped with sponge removed by backwash or extracted using acid base henderson et al 2011 kimura et al 2004 liu et al 2011 this difference may impair the comparability of the results in different studies besides the procedures highly depend on the personal experimental skill which may lead to inaccurate conclusions some researches estimated the foulants on membrane through mass balance calculation detailed in the eq s1 in supplementary information jermann et al 2007 qu et al 2012 the mass balance based method for quantifying the foulants is indirect and the measuring error would be propagated and magnified in the mass balance calculation as shown in eq s2 in the si a variety of novel techniques using ultrasonic electrical or optical approach have been developed for directly characterizing fouling layer evolution during membrane filtration chai et al 2007 and sim et al 2013b investigated the ultrasonic time domain reflectometry utdr for detecting the fouling layer development using sound waves an electrical impedance spectroscopy eis was used to characterize membrane fouling via alternating electrical currents cen et al 2015 sim et al 2013a optical characterization approaches such as direct observation through the membrane dotm technique cen et al 2015 li et al 1998 and optical coherence tomography oct gao et al 2014 li et al 2016 were also documented for characterizing membrane surface coverage and foulants depth profiles however the ultrasonic based approach i e utdr was limited by the small difference in acoustic properties between fouling layer and water or a membrane sim et al 2013b the interpretation of nyquist plot as well as modelling of conductance and capacitance in eis analysis were complicated and it is difficult to be carried out in many polymer membranes due to the high impedance of the material chen et al 2004 besides the resolution 0 5 μm of optical based approaches dotm and oct can only characterize the particulate fouling instead of the fouling caused by dissolved organic matter dom chen et al 2004 li et al 2016 fluorescence spectroscopy has been widely used in membrane fouling investigation for its high sensitivity and selectivity henderson et al 2009 fluorescence excitation and emission matrix eem analysis is commonly applied for characterizing dom in diluted solution with optical absorbance at 254 nm uv254 0 05 the conventional fluorescence eem can only be used to characterize the solutions involving in membrane filtration i e feed permeate and retentate but not to measure the foulants deposited on membrane surface opaque liquid or solid substances also contain fluorophores but they cannot be observed using conventional fluorescence spectrometer alternatively the fluorescence of these opaque samples can be measured from the front which is called front face fluorescence as shown in fig s1 in si eisinger and flores 1979 different from the conventional fluorescence eem fig s1a front face fluorescence ff eem is performed by orienting a sample surface at 30 60 relative to the incident beam fig s1b this method has been coupled with multi scanning technique i e eem and multi way spectral deconvolution algorithms i e parallel factor parafac analysis stedmon and bro 2008 to characterize and quantify the fluorescence in on dairy products

it has been even used for quantifying fluorescence micro pollutants polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons polychlorinated biphenyls and btex absorbed on the flat disk membrane made by c18 silica or polymer for detecting low concentration of these micro pollutants in water algarra et al 2000 2005 bortolato et al 2008 dmitrienko et al 2001 poziomek et al 1991 whitcomb and campiglia 2001 these quantitative applications of ff eem indicated that the ff eem based method could be able to quantify the fluorescence foulants deposited on membrane however study using this ff eem for characterizing fluorescence foulants deposited on the membrane surface during membrane filtration is very rare pawlowski et al 2016 first reported the application of ff eem to fouling characterization in reverse electrodialysis by using spectrofluorometer connecting to an optical sensor coupled with principle components analysis pca they found that humic substances in the feed water reduced the intrinsic fluorescence of the ion exchange membrane but the quenching effect of humic substance on the fluorescence of other foulants was not considered peleato et al 2017 characterized membrane fouling in uf process with pre coagulation for drinking water treatment using the front face fluorometer with fiber probe but only single excitation emission wavelength pair i e tryptophan like fluorescence at ex em 230 340 nm instead of the full eem spectra was used and the fluorescence overlap was not considered the possible interference of humic substances on the other fluorophores was not considered in this study either besides both of these two studies used optical probe as an accessory of ff eem the optical probe allowed non destructive and in situ fluorescence detection but the distance between the probe and sample as well as the orientation angle of the probe should be fixed precisely in every measurement the natural light should be properly shielded to prevent entering into the optical sensor and interfering with the emission signal detection to avoid the possible interferences occurred in the measurement with the optical probe some researches in other fields fixed the sample inside the spectrofluorometer using a front face sample holder fig s1b like a cuvette used for liquid eem measurement kulmyrzaev et al 2005 sahar et al 2009 this approach could be much easier and more economic as the optical probe accessory was not used however this method has not been adopted for characterizing membrane fouling so far therefore the aim of this study was to establish method for characterizing the fluorescence foulants deposited on ultrafiltration uf membrane surface using ff eem with front face sample holder and to apply this method to quantify the foulant evolution and analyze the fouling mechanism in uf fouling tests using model foulants bovine serum albumin bsa and humic acid ha solutions and real water sample effluent organic matter from wastewater treatment plant denoted as efom the ff eem method was compared with the conventional liquid eem method coupled with mass balance in terms of quantifying the foulants in the uf tests in addition fouling mechanisms were also analyzed by fitting the foulants mass build up data obtained by ff eem to the hermia s models hermia 1982 2 material and methods 2 1 ff eem measurement fluorescence spectra of virgin fouled membrane surface was recorded using a spectrofluorometer f7000 hitachi japan mounted with a front face sample holder with an incident angle of 30 orient koji china as shown in fig s1 the incident angle of 30 was chosen due to the less reflected light and the larger distributed area of incident light which decreased the sensitivity of the measurement to the precise placement of samples in the holder lakowicz 2006 it was found that the water moisture content in the membrane sample would influence the ff eem measurement thus the membrane specimens were first dried at 60 c for 1 h and cooled down to room temperature prior to measurement then a slice 6 mm 8 mm was cut from the membrane specimen to be fixed into the front face holder with a quartz coverslip for measurement fig s1b it was found that the focusing area of the excitation light onto the membrane was around 3 mm 6 mm fig s2 in si which was comparable to the field of view 0 2 mm 5 mm in microscope or confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm refer to the method used in microscope and clsm analyses multiple samples from different spots of each membrane were also prepared and measured using ff eem here to capture possible variation due to the fouling heterogeneity or possible bias induced by the pretreatment steps ff eems were generated by scanning over excitation wavelengths of 220 450 nm at interval of 5 nm and emission wavelengths of 250 550 nm at interval of 1 nm excitation and emission slit widths were set at 5 nm yu et al 2015 photomultiplier tube pmt voltage was optimized to 550 v to acquire enough sensitivity without fluorescence saturation peleato et al 2017 scanning speed was set to 2400 nm min to ensure the stability and accuracy xiao et al 2018 2 2 parafac analysis it was found that the polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf uf membrane 100 kda tianchuang china used in this study also exhibited fluorescence and it was overlapped with the fluorescence spectra of foulants fig 1 in order to quantify the foulants on the membrane surface the fluorescences of foulants and membrane were decomposed by parafac analysis parafac modelling procedures were conducted according to the tutorial published by murphy et al 2013 using dreem toolbox http openfluor weebly com dreem html in matlab version 2014 mathworks inc natick ma the parafac model was validated following methods including split half analysis variance explained and core consistency diagnostic 2 3 standard curve establishment in order to quantify the foulants on the fouled membrane calibration curves were made by loading known amounts of the standard foulants i e bsa and ha sigma aldrich co llc st louis mo usa on membrane and subjected to ff eem measurement briefly 30 μl of bsa ha or mixture of bsa and ha at different concentrations was uniformly dropped on the 6 mm 8 mm virgin membrane and it was dried at 60 c for 1 h and then cooled down to room temperature for ff eem measurement the solution dropped on the membrane did not penetrate through the membrane no color was found on the opposite side of a membrane dropped with ha after dry this ensured the foulants were totally deposited on the membrane surface standard curve was made by fitting the fluorescence response of foulants obtained from ff eem measurement coupled with parafac modelling against the known specific mass mass per unit area of foulants deposited on the membrane it was found that the presence of ha influenced the front face fluorescence of bsa on membrane surface standard curve of bsa in the presence of different amount of ha was established by analyzing the fluorescence of different amounts of bsa and ha on the membrane 0 150 mg m2 the dropping amount was designed table s1 according to central composite design ccd and analyzed by response surface methodology using design expert software version 10 0 6 stat ease inc minneapolis mn the bsa fluorescence response obtained from ff eem coupled with parafac was used for the statistical analysis and calibration curve establishment 2 4 uf experiments uf tests were conducted using 10 mg l of bsa alone total organic carbon toc 5 21 0 01 mg l 10 mg l ha alone toc 4 98 0 05 mg l a mixture containing 2 mg l bsa and 8 mg l ha toc 5 12 0 03 mg l and efom toc 5 56 0 05 mg l as the feed water respectively more detailed analysis on the efom can be found in the si the bsa and ha mixture with a doc ratio of 2 8 was chosen to simulate the characteristics of the real feed of uf e g surface water or wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent filloux et al 2012 the ph of all uf feeds was adjusted to 7 0 before the uf tests the efom sample was collected from the effluent of a wwtp in harbin china filtered by 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane and stored at 4 c prior to being used the conductivity of efom sample was 700 μs cm 1 and thus all the conductivities of bsa ha and mixture of bsa and ha solutions were adjusted to 700 μs cm 1 by adding nacl beforehand in order to keep a comparable ion strength uf experiments were performed using dead end filtration cell as previously described chang et al 2015 a schematic diagram of the setup is shown in fig s3 in supporting information briefly a 20 ml filtration cell was continuously fed by a 1 l glass reservoir the uf was performed in dead end mode and neither side stream nor backwash was used the flux of the filtration cell was controlled at 240 l m2h using a peristaltic pump bt100 2j longer precision pump co ltd baoding china a pvdf uf membrane disk tianchuang waterpure equipment co ltd hangzhou china with effective filtration area of 4 15 cm2 and molecular weight cut off mwco of 100 kda was fixed into the filtration cell a pressure transducer ptp708 tuopo electric foshan china was mounted between the filtration cell and the suction pump to monitor the tmp and it was connected to a computer for data logging at every 30s uf experiments using different feed solutions 10 mg l bsa 10 mg l ha 2 mg l bsa 8 mg l ha and efom were repeated and stopped at different filtration durations 5 15 30 45 60 min and the time when tmp exceeded 50 kpa for collecting membrane specimens which were fouled to different extents the membrane specimens were characterized using ff eem the foulants deposited on the membrane were calculated according to the standard curves obtained the fouling resistance at the end of each uf test was calculated according to darcy s law 1 r f δ p δ p 0 μ j where r f is the fouling resistance m 1 δp and δp 0 are the tmp pa at the end and the tmp pa at beginning of the uf test respectively μ is the dynamic viscosity pa s j is the permeate flux l m2 h the specific fouling resistance r fouling resistance per unit foulant mass m mg was also calculated for each uf test 2 r r f m f where r f is the fouling resistance m 1 in eq 1 m f is the specific mass of foulants mass per unit aera mg m2 obtained by ff eem based method 2 5 foulants quantification based on liquid eem measurement mass of foulants on uf membrane was also determined by liquid eem coupled with mass balance calculation the eems of feed permeate and retentate in each uf test were measured using a spectrofluorometer f7000 hitachi japan with a 1 cm quartz cuvette fig s1a the parameters for the liquid eem analysis were the same as the ff eem except for the pmt voltage which was adjusted to 700 v for a better sensitivity ultraviolet and visible uvvis absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer cary 300 uv vis varian australia for inner filter correction using eq 3 lakowicz 2006 3 f c o r r e c t e d f o b s e r v e d 10 o d e x o d e m 2 where od ex and od em are optical density i e light absorbance at excitation and emission wavelengths f observed and f corrected are the fluorescence intensity that measured by the spectrofluometer and fluorescence intensity after inner filter correction respectively the eems of bsa and ha solution at known concentrations were also measured all the eems were included into one dataset and subjected to parafac analysis the fluorescence intensity at the maximum f max was calculated by multiplying the maximum excitation loading and maximum emission loading for each component by its score obtained from the parafac model the f max is proportional to the concentration of corresponding fluorescence component murphy et al 2013 stedmon and bro 2008 the f max of standard samples were used to established the calibration curves and the calibration curves were made using the pure solutions of protein and ha the amounts of ha like substances and protein like substances in efom samples were calculated using the f max of parafac components and the calibration curves obtained the foulants mass was calculated according to the mass balance equation eq s1 it should be noted that the fluorescence components in efom used in this study showed similar fluorescence feature as those of bsa and ha figs s4 and s5 which indicated the similar property of efom fluorescence components and bsa ha thus the bsa and ha were also used as standards to quantify the fluorescence components in efom another liquid eem based foulants characterization method in which foulants were removed by rinse scrub or backwash and then characterized was not used in this study this was because the rinse step greatly depended on the personal experimental skill and the wash off method cannot retrieve all the foulants figs s6 and s7 which could incur a bias henderson et al 2011 liu et al 2011 2 6 other analytical methods dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of each sample was determined using a toc analyzer multi n c 2100s analytic jena germany a fluorescence microscope bx5 olympus tokyo japan was also employed for observing virgin and fouled membrane surface at a magnification factor of 4 2 7 fouling mechanism analysis fouling mechanisms involved in uf filtration were analyzed using the mass of foulant determined by ff eem based method according to hermia s model under constant flux condition as below hermia 1982 huang et al 2008 4 d p d m f k p n where p is defined as follows p δp δp 0 and m f is the specific mass of foulants mass per unit aera mg doc m2 obtained by ff eem based method it should be noted that the m f was adopted in eq 3 instead of filtration time or filtration volume used in other studies huang et al 2008 qu et al 2014 in these studies the m f data could not be readily determined in previous studies it was assumed that the rejection of foulants by the membrane was constant as filtration time increasing as indicated by the previous studies and thus dm f in the eq 3 could be equal to dt or dv huang et al 2008 qu et al 2014 however the m f could be measured in our study using the ff eem thus the mf instead of filtration time volumes was used to avoid any possible deviations resulting from the assumption k is a constant varying according to different modes of fouling the exponent n characterizes the filtration mechanism mode table 1 the specific mass of foulants m f data were fitted against the p obtained in the uf tests according to the intergral forms of eq 3 as shown in eq 4 7 table 1 the major fouling mechanism was identified according to the correlation coefficiency r 2 of the fitting to each model 2 8 statistical analysis the significance of difference was determined using analysis of variance anova at the p 0 05 significance level all analyses were performed using the spss software package ibm spss statistics 19 spss inc somers ny 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration curve establishment for determining foulants mass on membrane using ff eem in order to quantify the foulants deposited on the membrane by ff eem standard curves were established by measuring the membrane surface loaded with known amounts of foulants as the same fluorophore in solid and solution may give different peak features in eems the solid phase bsa powder and bsa solution 10 mg l were first measured using ff eem fig s1b and conventional eem fig s1a respectively as expected the bsa solution gave bimodal peaks at ex em 220 325 nm and ex em 270 325 nm whereas the solid phase bsa showed a unimodal peak at ex em 290 330 nm fig 1 it seems like both peaks of bsa solution red shifted along the excitation wavelength and merged into a single peak in the solid state sample other studies also reported this change of peak position of bsa from liquid to solid form ammari et al 2014 mounier et al 2017 the pvdf membrane also exhibited multiple fluorescence peaks in ff eem as shown in fig 1 since the fluorescence peaks of solid phase bsa and those of membrane overlapped parafac analysis was used to decompose the bsa and membrane fluorescence fig s8 and table s2 in si the f max of bsa calculated from parafac analysis was plotted against the amount of deposited bsa to obtain the calibration curve fig s9a a strong correlation between deposited bsa amount and f max was found r 2 0 995 which suggested this method could give a satisfied accuracy for bsa quantification it should be noted that the sample prepared by dropping foulants on the membrane surface might be different from the foulants formed by pressure driven uf thus a bsa calibration curve was also established by using the samples prepared by uf of 10 mg l bsa for different durations the standard curve was similar to that obtained by using dropping method with p value 0 720 0 05 fig s9a and fig s11 which suggested the pressure applied during uf did not significantly impact the foulant surface and the ff eem measurement besides it was concerned that the too many foulants on the membrane would invalid the ff eem measurement as the excitation light could not penetrate into very thick foulants layer the experimental data showed that the fluorescence response was linearly correlated with the foulants as long as the deposited bsa did not exceed 2000 mg m2 fig s9 which suggested that the method was valid within a limited range humic substances are another common foulants for uf different from the fluorescence spectra of ha solution solid phase ha did not show any peaks in ff eem fig 2 the disappearance of fluorescence peak of ha from liquid to solid form was attributed to the strong inner filter effect resulting from the presence of highly light absorptive chromophores in ha ammari et al 2014 mounier et al 2017 muller et al 2011 interestingly the intrinsic fluorescence of pvdf membrane was also quenched to different extents as ha deposited observations of virgin membrane bsa fouled membrane and ha fouled membrane using fluorescence microscopy with ultraviolet excitation light source showed that there was a significant suppression of membrane intrinsic fluorescence in the presence of ha fig 2c this was consistent with the report of pawlowski et al 2016 who found humic substances from river water decreased fluorescence of ion exchange membrane according to this observation the fluorescence of membrane surface deposited with different known amounts of ha using ff eem was determined as shown in fig 3 the fluorescence intensity of membrane decreased with the increasing amounts of deposited ha the fluorescence intensity at the peak position of the membrane fluorescence ex em 275 375 nm was plotted against the amount of deposited ha and fitted with linear regression to obtain the calibration curve the linear range was up to 100 mg ha m2 as shown in fig s10 a fairly high r 2 value 0 994 was obtained which suggested this quantitative method was valid fig s10 in real circumstances the solution chemistry of the foulants solution may be varied which could affect the ff eem detection thus the effect of ph and conductivity ion strength of foulants solution on the ff eem measurement was also examined the results showed that the solution chemistry did not significantly influence the ff eem results as shown in fig s12 the dry treatment prior to ff eem measurement might eliminate the effect of solution chemistry besides the characteristics of membrane could also influence the ff eem analysis a hydrophilic cellulose acetate ca membrane was compared with a pvdf membrane used before by ff eem measurement no significant difference was found in the ff eem measurement of bsa using these two kinds of membrane fig s13 in real situation protein like and humic like foulants always coexist in the feed of uf process therefore the foulants deposited on the membrane surface could also contain both protein and humic substances henderson et al 2011 liu et al 2011 in order to establish the ff eem method for measuring the foulants containing both protein and ha the membranes deposited with different amounts of bsa and ha were characterized the deposited ha still correlated well with the membrane fluorescence in the presence of bsa as the effect of deposited bsa on the membrane intrinsic fluorescence was marginal fig 2c and fig s9b however it was observed the presence of ha significantly suppressed the fluorescence of bsa response surface methodology and ccd were used to quantitatively illustrate co effect of bsa and ha deposited on the fluorescence response of bsa in ff eem measurement different amounts of bsa and ha according to ccd table s1 in si were loaded on the membrane surface and characterized using ff eem parafac analysis was conducted to decompose the fluorescence spectra of bsa and membrane the fluorescence intensity obtained was subjected to the response surface analysis it is showed that the bsa fluorescence response increased with increasing amounts of bsa deposited while it decreased as ha increased fig 4 a significant correlation p 0 0001 and r 2 0 9505 was achieved which suggested the goodness of the fit was satisfactory for quantifying the bsa in the presence of ha table s5 as such the amount of deposited bsa can be calculated using the fluorescence intensity of bsa deposited obtained by parafac and deposited ha as eq 5 obtained from the response surface analysis 5 bsa response 2 5114 bsa 0 2709 ha 0 0203 bsa ha 42 6478 the ha deposited on membrane can still be calculated using the fluorescence intensity of membrane obtained by parafac regardless the amount of bsa being attached fig s15 it should be noted that all the samples from the uf tests and the standard samples were included in a dataset and subjected to the parafac analysis thus the fluorescence responses of standard foulants and the unknown samples were obtained from one parafac model this avoided the bias of the parafac results derived from different parafac models the protein like substances and humic like substances deposited on the membrane surface in uf of efom were also quantified by this method with bsa and ha as standards due to the similar feature of fluorescence components in efom in this study compared with bsa and ha as shown in figs s4 and s5 the method for quantifying foulant mass on membrane using the ff eem coupled with parafac and surface response analysis was henceforth abbreviated as ff eem based method while the foulant mass quantification method by using liquid eem coupled with parafac and mass balance calculation was abbreviated as liquid eem based method 3 2 quantification of mass of foulants in uf ff eem vs liquid eem in order to characterize the evolution of foulants mass during the uf a series of uf tests using different feeds were conducted the mass of foulants during uf tests were obtained by the ff eem based method as well as liquid eem based method as shown in fig 5 the fouling resistance eq 1 at each sampling point is also shown in fig 5 it can be found that the deposited foulants with relatively smaller errors were obtained using ff eem compared with those calculated by liquid eem based method and the deviation of the foulant mass determined by liquid eem based method increased as the uf went on this could be attributed to the error propagation in the mass balance calculation the deviation of foulant mass calculated by mass balance eq s1 was a combination of errors in the liquid eem measurements of the feed permeate and retentate and the errors were further amplified by the increasing filtration volume during uf detailed in si eq s2 the total mass of foulants was also calculated using doc mass balance the increasing deviation was also found as a result of the error propagation fig s16 in comparison the ff eem based method was proven to be much more precise as it avoided such drawback it can be also found that the mean values of bsa or protein like substances determined by the liquid eem based method were lower than those obtained from ff eem based method in the presence of humic substances in fig 5 c and d this may be attributed to the strong quenching effect of ha on bsa or protein in liquid eem measurement which could not be totally retrieved by the inner filter correction as shown in fig s17 in the ff eem based method the quenching effect of ha on bsa fluorescence was taken into consideration and quantified using response surface methodology and ccd in the standard curve establishment thus the underestimate of the mass of bsa or the protein like in the mixture foulants deposited on the membrane was avoided in the ff eem based method which also explains the accuracy of the ff eem based method 3 3 relationship between foulants buildup and fouling evolution fouling mechanism analysis as shown in fig 5 the fast buildup of foulant mass in bsa fouling test did not result in a rapid increase of fouling resistance compared to the other fouling tests the tmp profiles shown in fig 6 also indicated that the fouling rates in uf tests with different feed were in an order of bsa ha ha efom bsa which was totally different from the foulants buildup tendency in different uf tests bsa bsa ha efom ha shown in fig 5 this result suggested that the membrane fouling was not solely determined by the amount of foulants mass deposited on the membrane the specific fouling resistance r in eq 2 in each uf test was calculated using data in fig 5 as shown in fig 7 the specific fouling resistances varied significantly in different fouling tests the highest and lowest specific resistance were found in the ha and bsa fouling test respectively the specific resistances in the uf tests fed by bsa ha mixture and efom were quite similar p value 0 811 0 05 it should be noted that the specific fouling resistance calculation for the efom fouling test did not consider the mass of polysaccharides since it could not be detected by ff eem however the polysaccharides may not alter the specific resistance in efom test significantly since the polysaccharides content in the efom used in this study only accounted for 5 of toc protein 18 and humic substances 72 details can be found in the si the significant difference in specific fouling resistance suggested that the quantity of the foulants was not an only factor that influenced the fouling resistance other factors such as different fouling mechanisms may contribute to the severity of membrane fouling in order to elucidate the fouling mechanism in uf tests the foulant mass obtained by ff eem based approach and the corresponding tmp data were fitted to the modified hermia s model table 1 the r 2 value indicated the goodness of the modelling for each fouling test as shown in table 2 the higher r 2 value for cake formation model in the bsa fouling test suggested that the cake layer formation was the major fouling mechanism the fouling in uf test fed with ha solution was mainly governed by the standard pore blocking while intermediate pore blocking was identified as the dominated fouling mechanism in the bsa ha mixture fouling test and efom fouling test the results indicated that majority of the bsa foulant was deposited on the membrane surface and formed a loose cake layer which did not result in greater fouling resistance than those for the other fouling tests in the ha fouling test the standard pore blocking mechanism indicated that most of the ha foulant entered into the membrane pore and led to pore constriction and blocking which led to a higher specific fouling resistance than the other tests for the bsa ha fouling and efom fouling the intermediate pore blocking suggested parts of the foulants deposited onto the pores and blocked them whereas the rest foulants deposited onto the foulants which already deposited on the membrane this fouling mechanism could result in a moderate specific fouling resistance therefore the difference in specific fouling resistances fig 7 was mainly attributed to the various fouling mechanisms led by different foulants in the feed table 2 in virtue of this novel fouling characterization approach this work found that the major fouling mechanism rather than the quantity of foulants might play an important role in determine the uf membrane fouling this finding indicated that changing the fouling mechanism from pore blocking to cake layer formation might be effective in terms of fouling control it has also been reported that artificial cake layer formation by pre depositing particles was effective for fouling mitigation in uf cai et al 2008 2013 this implied the mechanism oriented fouling control strategy might be promising for fouling mitigation in uf processes 3 4 implications this study investigated the application of the ff eem to the fouling characterization in the uf the foulants mass deposited on the membrane in uf were accurately determined using this method which gave more in depth understanding of fouling behavior and fouling mechanism this indicated the ff eem could serve as a powerful tool for fouling analysis in uf it has been reported that the ff eem coupled with an optical probe for characterizing suspended liquid or solid surface pawlowski et al 2016 peleato et al 2017 sá et al 2017 which suggested it was possible to use the ff eem as a non destructive and in situ fluorescence characterization technique it should be noted that the characteristics of feed water in various uf processes for drinking water treatment and advanced treatment of wastewater was fairly complex where various known unknown fluorescence compounds and quenchers could be present in the water hence special consideration and individual calibration for each case are necessary besides the heterogeneity of the membrane surface and the foulants layer would influence the ff eem measurement since only small piece of membrane can be characterized in each measurement thus further study is warranted to overcome this drawback may be using the eem coupled with optical fiber with an x y motorized stage could allow a scan over much larger area on whole membrane this study is just a proof of concept work for applying the ff eem to fouling analysis in uf factors that would interfere the ff eem characterization will be investigated in details and the corresponding improvement will be made in our future study 4 conclusions this study adopted a new fluorescence spectroscopic method i e ff eem to characterize the foulants deposited on membrane surface methods for quantifying the model foulants bsa and ha and the efom deposited on uf membrane were established ff eem based method was compared to the liquid eem coupled with mass balance based method in terms of foulants quantification in the uf of bsa ha a mixture of bsa and ha and efom major fouling mechanisms were identified by modelling the foulants build up data to the hermia s model the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the mass of protein foulant was accurately quantified using ff eem coupled with parafac analysis to decompose the fluorescence 2 the amount of ha was measured by quantifying the decrease of membrane intrinsic fluorescence using ff eem as the ha could quench the fluorescence of membrane and the extent of quenching had linear correlation to the amount of ha deposited on the membrane besides the amount of protein in the presence of ha was accurately determined by quantifying the quenching effect of ha on protein using response surface analysis 3 ff eem based method was more accurate than the liquid eem coupled with mass balance method in terms of foulants quantification in the uf 4 the ff eem characterization suggested that the fouling resistance was not consistent with the quantity of foulants as the major fouling mechanism instead of the mass of foulants mainly determined the extent of fouling 5 over all the ff eem based method has the potential to be a powerful tool for analyzing uf fouling evolution and fouling mechanism acknowledgments this research was jointly supported by the national science
