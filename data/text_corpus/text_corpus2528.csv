potential in environmental protection 29 this application of juncus in sr aops has been rarely reported as far as we know tetracycline tc an important broad spectrum antibacterial antibiotic has been extensively used in the therapeutic treatment and breeding industries 30 unfortunately most of tc and its metabolites are released into aquatic environment through urine and feces due to poor metabolic transformation long term exposure to tc may cause antibiotic resistance genes args in microorganisms 31 therefore it is of great significance to degrade tc in water environment herein fe3o4 nanoparticles anchored on the surface of carbon tubes derived from the biomass juncus fe3o4 jdc was fabricated via simple soaking and subsequent calcination treatment when used as a pms activator to

in a conical flask of 250 ml capacity under continuous stirring and 10 mg l of tc pollutant solution 100 ml was used the catalyst was firstly introduced into tc solution to accomplish the equilibrium of adsorption desorption about 30 min before pms was added at given time intervals 2 ml of tc solution was collected through 0 22 μm filter membrane and immediately detected on uv 2700 uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu japan at 357 nm the absorption spectra of different tc concentrations are shown in fig s1a and tc concentration during the reaction was estimated according to the

demand cod was recorded by 5b 1b v8 cod digestion apparatus lian hua tech co ltd leached fe from the catalyst was measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer 700 series icp oes china 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fe3o4 jdc fig 1a depicts the xrd pattern of fe3o4 jdc in which the diffraction peaks located at 30 1 35 4 43 1 53 4 56 9 and 62 5 can well index to 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 crystal planes of fe3o4 phase respectively jcpds no 89 3854 32 of particular note is that a broad diffraction peak at around 24 is assigned to the carbon derived from the juncus fig s2 33 34 sem images of pure jdc fig s3 imply that it features three dimensional network structures composed of hollow tubular fibers with a diameter of 5 μm although some wrinkles are observed on the surface of bare jdc it possesses a smooth surface meanwhile we characterized the elemental composition of the obtained pure jdc and found that it was mainly composed of c o n and s of which c and o were the dominating elements fig s4 in contrast sem images of fe3o4 jdc fig 1b and c reveal that fe3o4 nanoparticles are uniformly anchored on the surface of jdc and jdc also retains the unique tube structure besides edx elemental mapping images fig 1d verify that fe o and c are evenly distributed along with the tube structure of jdc tem image further signifies that abundant fe3o4 nanoparticles are densely modified on the jdc fig 1e hrtem image fig 1f exhibits that lattice fringe with plane distance of 0 250 nm correspond to 311 plane of fe3o4 furthermore the magnetic property of fe3o4 jdc was also measured fig s5 and fe3o4 jdc displays an s shaped magnetization curve with a saturation magnetization value ms of 7 69 emu g and low remanent magnetization 0 96 emu g xps analyses were conducted to acquire detailed information on the elemental compositions and oxidation states of fe3o4 jdc xps survey spectrum fig 2a discloses the binding energies of 711 1 532 1 and 284 8 ev are identified as fe 2p o 1s and c 1s respectively from the fe 2p spectrum fig 2b it has two main peaks of fe 2p3 2 710 9 ev fe2 713 1 ev fe3 and fe 2p1 2 724 5 ev fe2 726 5 ev fe3 and two satellite peaks appeared at 718 0 and 733 7 ev 35 the xps spectrum of c 1s fig 2c indicates that it can be split into three peaks at 284 8 286 2 and 288 8 ev which respectively correspond to cc co and co 36 as displayed in fig 2d the appearance of three peaks at 531 2 532 1 and 533 2 ev can be respectively assigned to feo oh and co 37 38 all these observations demonstrate the successful fabrication of fe3o4 nanoparticles 3 2 catalytic performance of fe3o4 jdc the catalytic performance of fe3o4 jdc and jdc was investigated by removing tc in different systems from fig 3a the removal efficiencies of fe3o4 jdc and jdc in the absence of pms toward tc within 60 min are 16 and 12 respectively manifesting that their adsorption performance is poor 12 9 of tc removal efficiency was recorded via the addition of pms alone meaning that a small amount of tc can be oxidized by sole pms the simultaneous use of catalyst and pms significantly promotes tc degradation approximately 90 2 of tc is degraded in 60 min by fe3o4 jdc pms system while only 46 2 by jdc pms system indicating that fe3o4 nanoparticles remarkably improve the catalytic activity of jdc for pms activation according to the rate constant k value fig s6 fe3o4 jdc pms system is the topmost 0 0384 min 1 and is 3 73 times of jdc pms system in addition maximum pms decomposition efficiency fig 3b and best chemical oxygen demand cod removal rate fig s7 are 63 9 and 64 7 respectively which are obtained in fe3o4 jdc pms system tc degradation efficiency of our fe3o4 jdc pms system is parallel or even superior to other reported catalysts listed in table s1 moreover fe3o4 jdc pms system also shows prominent catalytic degradation performance toward other pollutants mb mo hq ofx and mox under the same conditions and all of them can be removed above 80 which demonstrates its universality fig 3c 3 3 possible mechanism of fe3o4 jdc activating pms to identify the contribution of different active species to tc removal scavenging experiments were examined as depicted in fig 4a the addition of tert butyl alcohol tba quenching oh does not dramatically impact on tc removal while degradation efficiency declines to 83 4 when ethanol etoh quenching so4 and oh 39 was added to the reaction system meanwhile l histidine l h was served as a trapping agent to verify the presence of 1o2 unlike etoh and tba the introduction of l h obviously inhibits tc degradation only 71 8 however the reaction of l h with pms is inevitable 40 so we cannot accurately verify the quenching effect toward 1o2 furthermore p benzoquinone p bq was selected as a quencher for superoxide radicals o2 because the recombination of o2 can also form 1o2 41 tc degradation efficiency is suppressed only 78 6 with the addition of p bq suggesting the existence of o2 the above results demonstrate that all of 1o2 o2 and so4 have non negligible contributions to tc degradation while the effect of oh is ignored because the k value is only limited by 5 3 10 in the presence of tba fig s8 42 epr tests were further employed to confirm their presence the free radicals so4 oh and o2 were captured by 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo while 1o2 was captured by 4 amino 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp as presented in fig 4 b d characteristic peaks of dmpo so4 dmpo oh temp 1o2 and dmpo o2 all appear evidencing both non radical and radical pathways are involved in the tc removal process via fe3o4 jdc pms system based on the aforementioned investigations a possible pms activation mechanism by fe3o4 jdc for tc degradation is proposed fig 4e tc degradation involves two pathways on the one hand a non radical oxidation process is proposed that is the generation of 1o2 text s1 eqs 1 11 it is reported that carbon induced pms activation is a singlet oxygen 1o2 based generating process 43 firstly the co group that existed in carbon materials possesses lone pair electrons which interact with hso5 to produce 1o2 44 this process can be confirmed by the decrease of the co group after use in fig s9c from 5 8 to 5 5 and fig s9d from 35 9 to 23 9 secondly due to the increase from 32 8 to 43 2 of adsorbed surface hydroxyl groups oh after use fig s9d iron ions on the surface of fe3o4 jdc can combine with them to form fe ii iii oh and further reacts with hso5 to produce the coordination bond fe ii ho oso3 which subsequently is decomposed to generate 1o2 by breaking this bond accompanied by the cycle of fe ii fe iii 45 thirdly o2 can work as a precursor of 1o2 thus some of the 1o2 can be generated by o2 recombination 46 additionally 1o2 can be also generated by the self decomposition of pms 47 on the other hand there is also a radical oxidation removal process text s1 eqs 12 19 fe ii on the catalyst would be considered as active sites and react with hso5 to produce so4 which could further react with h2o to produce oh 48 the plentiful free flowing electrons in the sp2 hybridized carbon shell can also provide enormous energy for promoting electron transfer from catalyst to hso5 to break up the o3sooh bond thus generating so4 and oh 49 ultimately tc molecules are oxidized by those active species to small molecule intermediate productions even carbon dioxide and water which is the reason why the cod value decreases during the whole activation process the cycle of fe ii fe iii redox acts a crucial part in preserving high catalytic activity hence the appreciable catalytic performance of fe3o4 jdc can be ascribed to the synergistic effects of fe3o4 nanoparticles and the special nature of jdc 3 4 reusability of fe3o4 jdc to assess the stability and reusability of fe3o4 jdc we conducted five recycling experiments under the same reaction conditions the catalyst after each run was collected by magnetic separation fig s10 washed with ultrapure water and ethanol three times and then dried at 60 c overnight and used for the next run because there was a small fraction of catalyst left within the liquid we measured the quantity loss by recovery experiments three times which were 20 8 22 5 and 21 2 respectively from fig 3d tc degradation efficiencies gradually decrease from 90 2 to 81 1 in 60 min after five cycles which shows noteworthy stability and reusability meanwhile the amounts of leached fe were detected by icp oes and the results fig s11 imply that the leaching of fe mainly appears in the first cycle 0 174 mg l while significantly reduces in the following cycles and the concentration of leached fe of the last cycle is 0 038 mg l besides the maintained morphology fig s12 and the near identical xrd patterns fig s13 before and after recycling tests also evidence the robust structural stability of fe3o4 jdc the decrease in the catalytic activation may be assigned that metal ions are released from the catalyst during the reaction process and the fe3o4 jdc adsorbs some intermediates on the surface after use reducing the active sites 4 conclusion in summary we successfully synthesized fe3o4 jdc by soaking and calcination strategy and then demonstrated its high efficiency as a sr aops catalyst to activate pms for degrading organic pollutants it suggests that such fe3o4 jdc pms system has superior catalytic activity toward tc degradation 90 2 60 min and other pollutants above 80 moreover fe3o4 jdc shows excellent magnetic separation ability stability and reusability radical scavenging and epr tests elucidate that 1o2 and o2 so4 and oh all participate in the tc degradation reaction this work not only offers a high efficiency sr aops catalyst in order to removal pollutants but would break a path to explore juncus derived carbon as an attractive 3d support for catalysts toward applications in environmental

recombination 46 additionally 1o2 can be also generated by the self decomposition of pms 47 on the other hand there is also a radical oxidation removal process text s1 eqs 12 19 fe ii on the catalyst would be considered as active sites and react with hso5 to produce so4 which could further react with h2o to produce oh 48 the plentiful free flowing electrons in the sp2 hybridized carbon shell can also provide enormous energy for promoting electron transfer from catalyst to hso5 to break up the o3sooh bond thus generating so4 and oh 49 ultimately tc molecules are oxidized by those active species to small molecule intermediate productions even carbon dioxide and water which is the reason why the cod value decreases during the whole activation process the cycle of fe ii fe iii redox acts a crucial part in preserving high catalytic activity hence the appreciable catalytic performance of fe3o4 jdc can be ascribed to the synergistic effects of fe3o4 nanoparticles and the special nature of jdc 3 4 reusability of fe3o4 jdc to assess the stability and reusability of fe3o4 jdc we conducted five recycling experiments under the same reaction conditions the catalyst after each run was collected by magnetic separation fig s10 washed with ultrapure water and ethanol three times and then dried at 60 c overnight and used for the next run because there was a small fraction of catalyst left within the liquid we measured the quantity loss by recovery experiments three times which were 20 8 22 5 and 21 2 respectively from fig 3d tc degradation efficiencies gradually decrease from 90 2 to 81 1 in 60 min after five cycles which shows noteworthy stability and reusability meanwhile the amounts of leached fe were detected by icp oes and the results fig s11 imply that the leaching of fe mainly appears in the first cycle 0 174 mg l while significantly reduces in the following cycles and the concentration of leached fe of the last cycle is 0 038 mg l besides the maintained morphology fig s12 and the near identical xrd patterns fig s13 before and after recycling tests also evidence the robust structural stability of fe3o4 jdc the decrease in the catalytic activation may be assigned that metal ions are released from the catalyst during the reaction process and the fe3o4 jdc adsorbs some intermediates on the surface after use reducing the active sites 4 conclusion in summary we successfully synthesized fe3o4 jdc by soaking and calcination strategy and then demonstrated its high efficiency as a sr aops catalyst to activate pms for degrading organic pollutants it suggests that such fe3o4 jdc pms system has superior catalytic activity toward tc degradation 90 2 60 min and other pollutants above 80 moreover fe3o4 jdc shows excellent magnetic separation ability stability and reusability radical scavenging and epr tests elucidate that 1o2 and o2 so4 and oh all participate in the tc degradation reaction this work not only offers a high efficiency sr aops catalyst in order to removal pollutants but would break a path to explore juncus derived carbon as an attractive 3d support for catalysts toward applications in environmental

12641,sludge reduction technologies can be used as an alternative plan to dispose of excess sludge in wastewater treatment plants but the sustainability of these strategies is a challenging task in this study the potential environmental implications of innovative technologies based on lab scale results published in the literature were assessed from the life cycle assessment lca view point accordingly three different scenarios using various sludge reduction mechanisms were selected and analyzed the scenarios include 1 an integrated oxic setting anaerobic and ultrasound process 2 a sequencing batch reactor sbr with an anaerobic side stream reactor to its return activated sludge line and 3 the anaerobic anoxic oxic system in conjunction with an ozone reactor lca was conducted through the cml ia baseline 2000 method a sensitivity analysis was also done in order to determine how changes in the inputs are affecting the overall sustainability of the system the environmental impact evaluation of three scenarios indicated that the integrated sbr with an anaerobic side stream reactor was the most efficient and sustainable alternative in environmental terms although the upgraded sbr system was not the best alternative in terms of sludge reduction 65 versus 78 for scenario 1 and 70 for scenario 3 it showed the highest overall performance and also demonstrated the lowest environmental impact compared to other scenarios because the scenarios studied were cutting edge and provided novel sludge reduction strategies based on lab scale results published in the literature a comprehensive economic analysis and scale up considerations are recommended to effectively assist decision makers in guiding the development of emerging technologies graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords life cycle assessment environmental impacts life cycle inventory wastewater treatment technologies sludge reduction sensitivity analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction currently sewage sludge ss as a byproduct of wastewater treatment plants wwtps is one of the most troublesome challenges 52 ss is mainly produced in biological processes due to biodegradable compounds and organic inorganic particulates excess sludge management for an integrated sustainability evaluation requires three factors namely technical environmental and economic considerations 3 57 excess sludge accounts for 25 65 of overall operating expenses in a wwtp according to comprehensive studies 72 75 in this regard researchers have discovered that the best way for sludge management is reduction at origin which means that instead of decreasing sludge after production surplus sludge should be reduced at the point of creation in the waterline of wwtps 8 various physical chemical and biological technologies are applied to reach sludge reduction based on lysis cryptic growth uncoupling metabolism maintenance metabolism and microbial predation mechanisms 13 26 77 cao et al 9 discovered that ultrasound has great potential for reducing sludge production a 10 min treatment period was shown to be more cost effective for sludge reduction with a 44 reduction achieved with an ultrasonic intensity of 0 25 w ml disintegration of bio flocs and cryptic growth are the main causes of the decrease from ferrentino et al 18 s point of view using an anaerobic side stream reactor assr in a conventional activated sludge line is a complex biological technology that can reduce sludge generation in wastewater treatment plants sludge yields could be reduced by 40 60 without causing any detrimental consequences in addition sludge ozonation is one of the most successful methods for producing the highest degree of disintegration 48 additionally o3 can indirectly oxidize a wide range of pollutants by producing free hydroxyl radicals ho 2 it is widely documented that partial ozonation of returned sludge in an activated sludge process can significantly minimize excess sludge generation 60 the short time application of ozonation also enhances the sludge s settling qualities and decreases scumming and bulking 4 10 other works on sludge minimization have also been evaluated and reviewed 7 12 15 19 34 46 52 59 68 69 however most of these strategies only employ a single mechanism to reduce sludge simultaneous use of these techniques can result in greater sludge reduction while also improving the treatment plant s overall efficiency moreover the environmental impacts of combined sludge reduction mechanisms have not been studied yet a comprehensive life cycle assessment lca of sludge reduction strategies is recommended to effectively confirm their sustainability 22 lca is an approach for assessing a product process or service system s environmental impact across its full life cycle also it is an effective tool for evaluating the environmental consequences of wwtps lca has been used in the wastewater treatment area since the 1990s 14 many studies have used lca to evaluate different processes such as membrane bioreactors mbr 23 71 73 sequencing batch reactors sbr 61 63 anaerobic anoxic oxic aao systems 1 and different types of oxic setting anaerobic osa systems 37 39 lca can be applied to all stages of research including building operation and demolition however in some circumstances such as in wastewater treatment plants researchers simply look at the process phase therefore picking the right methodology is determined by the goal 5 according to recent studies methods such as cml ia baseline 2000 and recipe midpoint h were the most practical for demonstrating the function of key parameters and analyzing the results gained 6 25 the cml ia baseline 2000 approach is reliable and offers decision makers comprehensive insights 16 the goals of this paper are twofold the first one is a study of three innovative treatment methods from the most recent scientific papers which involves combining various mechanisms to reduce sludge production in the wastewater handling units of a plant in this regard the most widely used biological treatment methods in the world osa sbr and aao systems which were integrated with cutting edge technologies such as ultrasound process anaerobic side stream reactor and ozonation system in order to reduce sludge production were chosen as the representative combined processes in this study the selected methods include 1 combining the osa and ultrasound process from the results of romero pareja et al 68 2 adding an anaerobic side stream reactor assr to the sbr s return active sludge line according to the findings of ferrentino et al 19 and 3 using the aao system in conjunction with an ozone reactor studied by qiang et al 59 first of all the overall performance of these methods cod tn and tp removal efficiencies in liquid line and their sludge reduction efficiencies percent of sludge reduction and sludge yields were compared according to the reported results in the second step after a complete performance study of the chosen scenarios a life cycle assessment analysis was conducted by simapro software v9 0 to effectively confirm their sustainability and identify an ideal strategy for achieving the overall sustainability of wwtps therefore international standards and recommendations by iso 33 were applied to compare the environmental impacts of three innovative combined sludge reduction scenarios and choose the most sustainable one 2 material and methods 2 1 the selection and description of the sludge reduction scenarios three sludge reduction scenarios in wastewater processing units were chosen and explored in this study which were successfully applied by recent researchers the selected approaches comprise the most extensively used biological treatment methods osa sbr and aao combined with cutting edge technology such as ultrasonic processing anaerobic side stream reactor and ozonation systems scenario 1 s1 osa ultrasound system romero pareja et al 68 proposed a promising technique for reducing the amount of sludge produced at the treatment plant without negative consequences for its overall performance in this study the osa process in combination with ultrasound treatment was successfully applied to reduce waste sludge and improve overall performance in a lab scale system the flow diagram and system boundary used in the process are presented in fig 1 a scenario 2 s2 sbr assr system ferrentino et al 19 offered a developed sequencing batch reactor sbr in combination with an anaerobic side stream reactor assr which has a significant impact on sludge reduction and overall nutrient removal efficiency without any negative effect on the effluent quality or the settling characteristics of the activated sludge the flow diagram and system boundary used in the process are presented in fig 1 b scenario 3 s3 aa0 sludge ozonation system qiang et al 59 propose an advanced anaerobic anoxic oxic aao process coupled with an ozone reactor which offers many benefits including simultaneous biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal and significantly improved sludge settle ability excess sludge reduction could be achieved within the activated sludge system by combining the activated sludge process with sludge ozonation the flow diagram and system boundary used in the process are presented in fig 1 c 2 1 1 a review of the studied scenarios for sludge reduction for conventional activated sludge cas systems the average amount of sludge generated is around 0 4 0 6 kg tss kg codremoved which needs a high cost of treatment and can impose substantial concerns on the environment and human health if not properly handled 20 in recent years sludge reduction strategies in wwtps have gotten a lot of attention due to sludge management and economic issues most sludge minimization procedures include mechanical freezing or milling chemical alkaline hydrolysis or ozonation thermal microwave irradiation or pyrolysis and biological enzymolysis processes in this study three advanced technologies utilizing various sludge reduction mechanisms such as uncoupled metabolism cell lysis and destruction of extracellular polymeric substances eps were selected as shown in fig 2 22 as shown in fig 2 a the energy gap between catabolism and anabolism grows as a result of uncoupled metabolism decreasing the amount of energy available for anabolism as a result bacteria spend less energy on the synthesis of new cells since they must first satisfy their maintenance activities before expending energy on growth as a result the biomass output is reduced as is the sludge production as shown in fig 2 b some sludge reduction strategies cause cell lysis resulting in the solubilization of cellular components which consequently provides the substrate for further biodegradation as a result the cell lysis process reduces the amount of sludge produced overall fig 2 c illustrates the destruction of extracellular polymeric substances eps one option for reducing sludge bulk is to act on the inert particles and convert them at least partially to biodegradable substances there is no unique method for increasing the biodegradability of inert substances ozonation for example is considered to be a powerful oxidant on all sludge contents whether cellular biomass or inert compounds resulting in enhanced solubilization and probable biodegradability of the molecules released in scenario 1 as reported by romero pareja et al 68 uncoupled metabolism in the anaerobic reactor and cell lysis in the ultrasound us chamber are the main sludge reduction mechanisms msrm and can achieve yobs of around 0 051 kg tss kg codremoved in scenario 2 as offered by ferrentino et al 19 the msrm involves uncoupling metabolism in conjunction with cell lysis and destruction of eps which occurs in assr and can obtain yobs of around 0 117 kg tss kg codremoved in scenario 3 as suggested by qiang et al 59 the msrm is cell lysis and eps destruction that take place in the ozone reactor and can reach yobs of around 0 07 kg tss kg codremoved the operational parameters of each system including ph temperature dissolved oxygen content etc are shown in table 1 as shown in table 1 the operational conditions of the selected sludge reduction approaches are different because various chemical and biological treatment processes were employed to reduce sludge production the primary goal of this study was to analyze various sludge reduction strategies under various operational conditions to see how the procedures would impact the environment while effectively reducing the sludge it is worth noting that the sludge yield before implementing different scenarios to reduce sludge production was nearly the same 0 3 0 05 gtss g cod allowing us to compare the treatment strategies appropriately 19 59 68 fig 3 a and b illustrate a review of the findings of the sludge reduction which includes sludge generation and overall system performance respectively by analyzing the sludge reduction results obtained in the research as shown in fig 3 a scenario 1 with the ultrasound process showed the highest amount of sludge reduction about 78 followed by scenario 3 with the sludge ozonation process about 70 and then scenario 2 with assr about 67 when compared to their own control systems although there are numerous advantages to reducing sludge care must be taken to ensure that this technique does not compromise the system s overall performance as shown in fig 3 b the percent removal of cod in all scenarios is above 85 meaning they have good performance and no significant reduction in cod removal was observed in addition because of the varied anoxic oxic conditions s2 and s3 have outstanding nutrient removal performance which is similar to 21 findings furthermore scenario 1 has a very low tp removal percentage which is due to the ultrasound process and can be ignored 68 similarly according to z wei et al 78 because wwtps are frequently associated with high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions upgrading wwtps to comply with low carbon or zero carbon usage in the context of carbon neutrality is gaining traction besides the technical performance the sludge reduction techniques require energy as well as chemical reagents which have negative effects on the environment therefore a comprehensive life cycle assessment was conducted to effectively confirm their sustainability in this study it should be noted that the scenarios investigated which were based on lab scale results reported in the literature 19 59 68 were cutting edge and presented novel ideas that had not yet reached the scale up stage scaling up these scenarios will require confirmation of the environmental assessments as well as technical performance analysis 17 in addition as lehtoranta et al 42 explain the cost of treatment in the wwtp is proportional to the amount of organic matter and nutrients treated in each scenario 2 2 life cycle assessment lca methodologies the iso 14040 series defines lca as a four step standardized process that includes purpose specification life cycle inventory lci life cycle impact assessment lcia and life cycle interpretation 31 the following is a list of the precise contents of each stage 2 2 1 definitions of purpose the purpose of this research was to evaluate and analyze the life cycle environmental impacts of three promising sludge reduction scenarios for low strength wastewater with an influent cod of 300 50 mg l as well as to identify their primary environmental hotspots 2 2 1 1 functional unit fu a functional unit is an essential unit that could also represent the main and functional aspects of the system as a result scientists can do a more accurate sensitivity analysis and compare the input and output of various treatment methods 32 in this study 1 m3 of treated wastewater was chosen as a functional unit 2 2 1 2 lca boundary the lca boundary shows how the system s input products and output are linked to their life cycles energy use transportation and finally decomposition 45 70 fig 1 illustrates valuable data about the system boundary of each selected scenario the construction phase was not considered within the scope of this lca study and hence is not included in the system boundaries due to a lack of data instead the operation phase of the water line and sludge line was analyzed the primary treatment i e screening unit and tertiary treatment i e disinfection unit were not included in the system boundaries since they were not included for the purpose of this lca analysis the sludge line involves a typical sludge treatment procedure including thickening anaerobic digestion and dewatering units that consumes about 0 2 kwh kg of solids electricity 49 and about 12 g kg of solids polyelectrolytes 2 2 2 life cycle inventory lci the life cycle inventory provides detailed information on all compartments of the investigated system including input variables output data and continuous activity 1 table 2 presents the life cycle inventory information for the water line and sludge line in three scenarios investigated parameters for the water line were power influent effluent chemicals and greenhouse gas ghg emissions those for the sludge line were electricity chemicals and transportation as shown in table 2 low strength wastewater with nearly the same cod 0 3 0 05 kg m3 tn 0 045 0 005 kg m3 and tp 0 004 0 001 kg m3 concentrations was employed for the experiments which allowed us to compare the treatment strategies appropriately for the preparation of synthetic wastewater in scenarios 1 and 3 glucose was similarly used as the main carbon source 59 68 the synthetic wastewater in scenario 3 was prepared from a source of carbon glucose a source of nitrogen nh4cl and a source of phosphate kh2po4 trace metals mo mn zn co b ni al cu mg ca k fe were also added to make the desired synthetic wastewater alkalinity was supplied with nahco3 and ph was controlled 59 the influent wastewater at scenario 1 was composed of 90 synthetic wastewater from a carbon source of glucose and other nitrogen phosphorous and some trace metal sources and 10 actual wastewater obtained from an urban wwtp 68 scenario 2 used the fresh primary effluent from an urban wastewater treatment plant 19 since the particulate cod is removed in the primary sedimentation tanks and soluble cod is increased as a result this can be quite comparable to synthetic wastewater 1 electricity most of the electricity used for conventional secondary treatment is for 1 biological treatment by the activated sludge process which requires energy for aeration blowers 2 pumping systems for the transfer of wastewater liquid sludge biosolids and process water and 3 wastewater treatment equipment such as mixers ultrasound process and ozonation system 47 the details of each scenario s power consumption are given in the table 3 the energy required for the ozonation process in s3 includes feed gas preparation ozone generation and application which ranged from 25 to 30 kwh kg of ozone produced according to 58 as described before the power consumption was collected for each electricity consuming device in the wastewater treatment process this study s data collection was also closely linked to li et al 43 moreover the characterization of medium voltage electricity was taken from the ecoinvent 3 3 database 2 chemical polyelectrolyte was considered to be the organic polymer coagulant in sludge thickening and dewatering in all three scenarios only in the aao process was ozone injected into the sludge line for sludge reduction 3 greenhouse gas ghg ghgs such as ch4 n2o and co2 were found to be released directly from biological reactors anaerobic anoxic and aerobic tanks moreover guidelines from the 29 based on a 100 year time frame were used to compute gas emissions 4 transportation it was assumed that the chemicals used in the scenarios were produced by the same factory situated 30 km away from the plant landfilling was selected for the final disposal of waste sludge landfills are one of the most popular methods for the final disposal of sewage sludge since they are inexpensive and simple to operate especially in developing countries 79 the landfill site was assumed to be located 3 km outside the plant it was also considered that small trucks 10 t were used for the transportation of sludge and chemical materials in general the influent and effluent emission to water parts of the data collection such as cod ammonium total nitrogen and total phosphorus were obtained from the original paper 19 59 68 and the results may have varied due to differences in wastewater treatment performance 2 2 3 impact assessment the cml ia baseline v3 05 methodology based on a problem oriented midpoint approach was used in the life cycle impact assessment lcia of three scenarios due to its characterization factors and precise results obtained from previous studies to compare the environmental footprints of the processes 50 53 54 80 wastewater treatment plants in general have a negative influence on climate change environmental quality and ecotoxicity 64 therefore this study considers eight impact categories for midpoint characterization including depletion of abiotic resources elements ultimate reserves and fossil fuels human toxicity global warming acidification freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity marine aquatic ecotoxicology and eutrophication the life cycle impact subcategories were selected based on 1 the importance of the system under study and 2 impact categories assessed in prior lca research 27 30 65 since heavy metal concentrations in sludge were not available in any of the three scenarios the impact of terrestrial ecotoxicity was not considered which was in good agreement with ignatowicz 28 s findings furthermore the impacts of ozone layer depletion and photochemical oxidation were ignored in this study because they were found to be negligible 2 2 4 interpretation the findings are interpreted based on the involvement of various components in each environmental impact category such as electricity consumption chemical usage transportation and direct emissions of pollutants in addition the normalization factors from the cml ia method were used for the normalization of the environmental impact categories at the midpoints based on per person per year 2 2 5 sensitivity analysis the impact of the most crucial assumptions on the final results is assessed via sensitivity analysis it involves suggesting some alternative scenarios to the base case scenario and evaluating the probable environmental impacts of those alternative scenarios to achieve this goal various factors are modified into acceptable ranges of variation to see if the lca s results are significantly dependent on particular assumptions therefore according to epa guidelines the normalized sensitivity coefficient sij is defined as a ratio of the percentage change in the output variable yi to a 10 change in the input variable xi see formula 1 1 s ij yi yi xi xi the following is an example of how a parameter s effect on the model output can be interpreted 1 sij 0 25 shows that a parameter has almost no impact on the model s output 2 0 25 sij 1 means that a parameter is influential and 3 1 sij 2 signifies that a parameter has a major influence in this regard the sensitivity analysis was done to evaluate the accuracy and correctness of the retrieved file data transportation was not considered in the sensitivity analysis due to its insignificant impact 3 result and discussion 3 1 life cycle assessment of three investigated scenarios 3 1 1 life cycle impact analysis lcia results the simapro software was used to compute the life cycle impact categories for the three scenarios table 4 shows the amounts of the impacts of each category as calculated using the cml ia baseline v3 05 impact assessment method in addition the lcia results are graphically displayed in fig 4 to better understand the comparison of scenarios 3 2 abiotic depletion potential adp abiotic depletion fossil fuels adfp and acidification potential ap as shown in fig 5 electricity and chemicals have the greatest impact on the liquid line moreover in the sludge line as a result of lower sludge production the impact of electricity and chemical usage for sludge treatment is very low therefore the combined impact of electricity and chemicals in the sludge line is seen as a whole adp is generally related to the extraction or usage of resources 51 as shown in fig 5 a electricity production in s1 s2 and s3 as a result of raw resource consumption contributes about 97 93 and 63 of total ad potential respectively it is worth noting that chemical usage accounts for approximately 34 1 of total ad potential in s3 acidification is typically caused by hydrolysis and oxidation processes that release so2 and nox causing harm to human health and environmental resources 35 37 the primary contributors to acidification in s1 utilizing the cml technique were sulfur dioxide 71 4 nitrogen oxide 24 4 and ammonia 4 this finding is in line with the findings of tabesh et al 74 who focused on the detrimental impacts of nox so2 and ammonium on the acidification process in addition kalbar karmakar and asolekar 37 used a life cycle approach to compare several wastewater treatment technologies and discovered that the activated sludge process emits 0 19 kg so2 and the sequencing batch reactor emits 0 34 kg so2 which was primarily due to electricity generation for wwtp operation similarly s3 has the highest ap adfp and adp in comparison to the other situations due to the use of power as shown in fig 5 b and c 3 3 eutrophication potential ep and global warming potential gwp100a direct emissions have a significant impact on the global warming potential gwp and eutrophication potential ep of plants 61 phosphorus is the main limiting component in aquatic bodies which can contribute to eutrophication due to its extended presence even though nitrogen and its derivatives are co limiting variables in algal growth and dissolved oxygen depletion the management of freshwater eutrophication is primarily determined by phosphorus concentrations 24 these would be comparable to indirect emissions from the use of power and chemicals therefore direct emissions were investigated in order to identify the particular contributions of cod tn and tp to ep and gwp in this study as shown in fig 6 a tp in the effluent of s1 caused the most impact on the eutrophication category about 0 0122 kg po4 eq compared to other scenarios and this was due to the insignificant tp removal in the ultrasound system however s2 has the best tp removal performance and as a result the least contribution to the eutrophication category about 0 003 kg po4 eq in three scenarios tn is the second most important cause followed by cod and a minimal impact on eutrophication from power and chemical usage indirect impact rodriguez garcia et al 67 also pointed out that power and chemical use have an insignificant effect in this category tn contributes to s1 s2 and s3 by about 42 32 and 13 in the eutrophication category as shown s3 has the best performance in tn removal about nine times more than s1 due to the benefits of nutrient removal of a2o systems piao et al 56 found that their wwtp which used the a2o method and had a greater nutrient removal rate resulted in a lower ep impact overall results from fig 6 b show that s3 has the least impact on the eutrophication category and s1 has the most impact the impacts on the gwp category fig 7 are differentially related to three primary items 1 direct emissions as well as 2 electricity use and 3 chemical consumption as indirect emissions 66 the result of power consumption and chemical usage in s3 is about 1 2 and 1 7 times more than in s1 and s2 this was due to high power usage because of enhanced treatment and chemical ozone usage for sludge reduction in addition the highest direct ghg emissions also occurred in s3 using the a2o process as shown in fig 7 a this was due to the high removal efficiencies of cod and tn 94 in the a2o process which resulted in the higher production of n2o and ch4 moreover these findings are in good agreement with previous investigations by hernández padilla et al 25 who reported the contribution of methane and co2 in the climate change category in addition tabesh et al 74 referred to the negative impacts of n2o emissions generated during the nitrification and denitrification processes of wastewater treatment on gwp chai et al 11 also demonstrated the significant effects of co2 n2o and electricity on greenhouse gas emissions the overall result from fig 7 b shows that s3 has the highest gwp and s2 has the lowest 3 4 human toxicity potential htp heavy metal toxicity has proven to be a major threat and there are several health risks associated with it in the htps as shown in fig 8 b s3 has a higher impact than s1 and s2 about 1 2 and 1 7 times respectively this was due to higher power usage particularly in the wastewater treatment line the power consumption resulted in the emission of thallium and selenium into the water as well as the diffusion of chromium vi and hydrogen fluoride into the air which mainly contributed to the htps this is attributed to 98 in s1 and 97 in s2 because of the consumption of chemicals ozone accounts for approximately 19 of total htp electricity accounts for almost 80 of total htp in s3 3 5 marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential maetp according to the present study maetp has the greatest impact on overall ecotoxicity which is similar to prior studies 36 39 41 this is due to the fact that the impact of chemical and energy consumption and other defining characteristics of this category is frequently higher than other impact categories as shown in fig 8 c s3 has the greatest environmental impact in the maetp category since its electricity consumption and chemical usage are higher in comparison with other scenarios 3 6 sensitivity analysis the findings of the environmental impact assessment in three scenarios show that nutrients in the effluent as well as electricity consumption and chemical usage only in s3 are the most important factors affecting environmental impacts table 5 depicts the effects of altering 10 of chosen inventory component values in s1 s2 and s3 on environmental impacts environmental impact subcategories such as adp adfp gwp htp fawep maep and ap in three scenarios varied from 4 to 9 9 to respond to the change in electricity consumption by 10 similarly the calculated sensitivity coefficients sij were in the range of 0 25 to 1 which indicates that the mentioned impacts are influential to the 10 increase in electricity consumption moreover varying the electricity has no effect on ep because the sij 0 25 in all three scenarios piao et al 56 similarly reported that electricity usage was the most sensitive factor especially in acidification and ecotoxicity to respond to a 10 change in tp and tn concentrations in the influent eutrophication ep changed by 9 7 in s1 9 4 in s2 and 8 9 in s3 correspondingly sensitivity coefficients of 0 97 in s1 0 94 in s2 and 0 89 in s3 this indicates that ep is influential in changing the influent tp and tn the other categories were basically unaffected while sensitivity coefficients were lower than 0 25 finally chemical consumption shows fewer effects on all the categories however varying 10 chemical usage has the highest impact on adp in the range of 3 4 therefore adp is influential in chemical change due to the calculated sij in the range of 0 25 to 1 in s3 4 conclusion and outlook for the future the purpose of this research was to find out the advantages and disadvantages of three innovative treatment technologies utilizing various mechanisms to improve sludge reduction uncoupled metabolism cell lysis and eps destruction without any significant changes in the overall treatment performance of the system by the lca approach a review of the results of sludge reduction performance in three selected lab scale scenarios indicates that the range of sludge production varied between 0 013 and 0 03 kg m3 which is within the optimum range furthermore to select a long term solution to individualize the significant indicators several impact subcategories were studied using the cml ia baseline v3 05 method the following are some of the most important findings from the current study scenario 3 s3 aa0 sludge ozonation system demonstrated the highest environmental impacts in all categories except for ep mainly due to the higher chemicals and power consumption however because of the great removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from the effluent it had the lowest ep it shows that the aao process would be an excellent method for preventing eutrophication furthermore s3 demonstrates the medium range sludge production among the three scenarios scenario 1 s1 osa ultrasound system has the highest ep due to the lower nutrient and cod removal compared to s2 and s3 moreover s1 has the lowest sludge production compared to others and it s due to the ultrasound process s1 has the second highest impact of all the categories after s3 scenario 2 s2 sbr assr system exhibits the most effective and environmentally friendly solution having the lowest impact in seven of the eight categories evaluated and a medium impact on ep as a result of the nutrient removal performance the main reason for this is that s1 and s3 employed more advanced treatment methods ultrasound and ozonation respectively to significantly reduce the production of sludge in comparison to s2 but they also consumed more resources energy and chemicals which could lead to more indirect emissions and adverse environmental effects the results of a sensitivity analysis of the three processes show that nutrients in effluent and power consumption are the factors most important in causing environmental consequences whereas chemical consumption and transportation have little impact due to low chemical use in conclusion due to the excellent sludge reduction performance in all scenarios 65 the environmental impacts of the scenarios have received more attention therefore scenario 2 including the sbr assr system could be considered the best sustainable sludge reduction strategy economic analysis and scaling up are needed to confirm the results of this study and help investment decision makers come up with a complete and integrated way to do this task on a full scale in addition the integration of results from lca and risk analysis in the context of a multi criteria decision analytic approach

12641,sludge reduction technologies can be used as an alternative plan to dispose of excess sludge in wastewater treatment plants but the sustainability of these strategies is a challenging task in this study the potential environmental implications of innovative technologies based on lab scale results published in the literature were assessed from the life cycle assessment lca view point accordingly three different scenarios using various sludge reduction mechanisms were selected and analyzed the scenarios include 1 an integrated oxic setting anaerobic and ultrasound process 2 a sequencing batch reactor sbr with an anaerobic side stream reactor to its return activated sludge line and 3 the anaerobic anoxic oxic system in conjunction with an ozone reactor lca was conducted through the cml ia baseline 2000 method a sensitivity analysis was also done in order to determine how changes in the inputs are affecting the overall sustainability of the system the environmental impact evaluation of three scenarios indicated that the integrated sbr with an anaerobic side stream reactor was the most efficient and sustainable alternative in environmental terms although the upgraded sbr system was not the best alternative in terms of sludge reduction 65 versus 78 for scenario 1 and 70 for scenario 3 it showed the highest overall performance and also demonstrated the lowest environmental impact compared to other scenarios because the scenarios studied were cutting edge and provided novel sludge reduction strategies based on lab scale results published in the literature a comprehensive economic analysis and scale up considerations are recommended to effectively assist decision makers in guiding the development of emerging technologies graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords life cycle assessment environmental impacts life cycle inventory wastewater treatment technologies sludge reduction sensitivity analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction currently sewage sludge ss as a byproduct of wastewater treatment plants wwtps is one of the most troublesome challenges 52 ss is mainly produced in biological processes due to biodegradable compounds and organic inorganic particulates excess sludge management for an integrated sustainability evaluation requires three factors namely technical environmental and economic considerations 3 57 excess sludge accounts for 25 65 of overall operating expenses in a wwtp according to comprehensive studies 72 75 in this regard researchers have discovered that the best way for sludge management is reduction at origin which means that instead of decreasing sludge after production surplus sludge should be reduced at the point of creation in the waterline of wwtps 8 various physical chemical and biological technologies are applied to reach sludge reduction based on lysis cryptic growth uncoupling metabolism maintenance metabolism and microbial predation mechanisms 13 26 77 cao et al 9 discovered that ultrasound has great potential for reducing sludge production a 10 min treatment period was shown to be more cost effective for sludge reduction with a 44 reduction achieved with an ultrasonic intensity of 0 25 w ml disintegration of bio flocs and cryptic growth are the main causes of the decrease from ferrentino et al 18 s point of view using an anaerobic side stream reactor assr in a conventional activated sludge line is a complex biological technology that can reduce sludge generation in wastewater treatment plants sludge yields could be reduced by 40 60 without causing any detrimental consequences in addition sludge ozonation is one of the most successful methods for producing the highest degree of disintegration 48 additionally o3 can indirectly oxidize a wide range of pollutants by producing free hydroxyl radicals ho 2 it is widely documented that partial ozonation of returned sludge in an activated sludge process can significantly minimize excess sludge generation 60 the short time application of ozonation also enhances the sludge s settling qualities and decreases scumming and bulking 4 10 other works on sludge minimization have also been evaluated and reviewed 7 12 15 19 34 46 52 59 68 69 however most of these strategies only employ a single mechanism to reduce sludge simultaneous use of these techniques can result in greater sludge reduction while also improving the treatment plant s overall efficiency moreover the environmental impacts of combined sludge reduction mechanisms have not been studied yet a comprehensive life cycle assessment lca of sludge reduction strategies is recommended to effectively confirm their sustainability 22 lca is an approach for assessing a product process or service system s environmental impact across its full life cycle also it is an effective tool for evaluating the environmental consequences of wwtps lca has been used in the wastewater treatment area since the 1990s 14 many studies have used lca to evaluate different processes such as membrane bioreactors mbr 23 71 73 sequencing batch reactors sbr 61 63 anaerobic anoxic oxic aao systems 1 and different types of oxic setting anaerobic osa systems 37 39 lca can be applied to all stages of research including building operation and demolition however in some circumstances such as in wastewater treatment plants researchers simply look at the process phase therefore picking the right methodology is determined by the goal 5 according to recent studies methods such as cml ia baseline 2000 and recipe midpoint h were the most practical for demonstrating the function of key parameters and analyzing the results gained 6 25 the cml ia baseline 2000 approach is reliable and offers decision makers comprehensive insights 16 the goals of this paper are twofold the first one is a study of three innovative treatment methods from the most recent scientific papers which involves combining various mechanisms to reduce sludge production in the wastewater handling units of a plant in this regard the most widely used biological treatment methods in the world osa sbr and aao systems which were integrated with cutting edge technologies such as ultrasound process anaerobic side stream reactor and ozonation system in order to reduce sludge production were chosen as the representative combined processes in this study the selected methods include 1 combining the osa and ultrasound process from the results of romero pareja et al 68 2 adding an anaerobic side stream reactor assr to the sbr s return active sludge line according to the findings of ferrentino et al 19 and 3 using the aao system in conjunction with an ozone reactor studied by qiang et al 59 first of all the overall performance of these methods cod tn and tp removal efficiencies in liquid line and their sludge reduction efficiencies percent of sludge reduction and sludge yields were compared according to the reported results in the second step after a complete performance study of the chosen scenarios a life cycle assessment analysis was conducted by simapro software v9 0 to effectively confirm their sustainability and identify an ideal strategy for achieving the overall sustainability of wwtps therefore international standards and recommendations by iso 33 were applied to compare the environmental impacts of three innovative combined sludge reduction scenarios and choose the most sustainable one 2 material and methods 2 1 the selection and description of the sludge reduction scenarios three sludge reduction scenarios in wastewater processing units were chosen and explored in this study which were successfully applied by recent researchers the selected approaches comprise the most extensively used biological treatment methods osa sbr and aao combined with cutting edge technology such as ultrasonic processing anaerobic side stream reactor and ozonation systems scenario 1 s1 osa ultrasound system romero pareja et al 68 proposed a promising technique for reducing the amount of sludge produced at the treatment plant without negative consequences for its overall performance in this study the osa process in combination with ultrasound treatment was successfully applied to reduce waste sludge and improve overall performance in a lab scale system the flow diagram and system boundary used in the process are presented in fig 1 a scenario 2 s2 sbr assr system ferrentino et al 19 offered a developed sequencing batch reactor sbr in combination with an anaerobic side stream reactor assr which has a significant impact on sludge reduction and overall nutrient removal efficiency without any negative effect on the effluent quality or the settling characteristics of the activated sludge the flow diagram and system boundary used in the process are presented in fig 1 b scenario 3 s3 aa0 sludge ozonation system qiang et al 59 propose an advanced anaerobic anoxic oxic aao process coupled with an ozone reactor which offers many benefits including simultaneous biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal and significantly improved sludge settle ability excess sludge reduction could be achieved within the activated sludge system by combining the activated sludge process with sludge ozonation the flow diagram and system boundary used in the process are presented in fig 1 c 2 1 1 a review of the studied scenarios for sludge reduction for conventional activated sludge cas systems the average amount of sludge generated is around 0 4 0 6 kg tss kg codremoved which needs a high cost of treatment and can impose substantial concerns on the environment and human health if not properly handled 20 in recent years sludge reduction strategies in wwtps have gotten a lot of attention due to sludge management and economic issues most sludge minimization procedures include mechanical freezing or milling chemical alkaline hydrolysis or ozonation thermal microwave irradiation or pyrolysis and biological enzymolysis processes in this study three advanced technologies utilizing various sludge reduction mechanisms such as uncoupled metabolism cell lysis and destruction of extracellular polymeric substances eps were selected as shown in fig 2 22 as shown in fig 2 a the energy gap between catabolism and anabolism grows as a result of uncoupled metabolism decreasing the amount of energy available for anabolism as a result bacteria spend less energy on the synthesis of new cells since they must first satisfy their maintenance activities before expending energy on growth as a result the biomass output is reduced as is the sludge production as shown in fig 2 b some sludge reduction strategies cause cell lysis resulting in the solubilization of cellular components which consequently provides the substrate for further biodegradation as a result the cell lysis process reduces the amount of sludge produced overall fig 2 c illustrates the destruction of extracellular polymeric substances eps one option for reducing sludge bulk is to act on the inert particles and convert them at least partially to biodegradable substances there is no unique method for increasing the biodegradability of inert substances ozonation for example is considered to be a powerful oxidant on all sludge contents whether cellular biomass or inert compounds resulting in enhanced solubilization and probable biodegradability of the molecules released in scenario 1 as reported by romero pareja et al 68 uncoupled metabolism in the anaerobic reactor and cell lysis in the ultrasound us chamber are the main sludge reduction mechanisms msrm and can achieve yobs of around 0 051 kg tss kg codremoved in scenario 2 as offered by ferrentino et al 19 the msrm involves uncoupling metabolism in conjunction with cell lysis and destruction of eps which occurs in assr and can obtain yobs of around 0 117 kg tss kg codremoved in scenario 3 as suggested by qiang et al 59 the msrm is cell lysis and eps destruction that take place in the ozone reactor and can reach yobs of around 0 07 kg tss kg codremoved the operational parameters of each system including ph temperature dissolved oxygen content etc are shown in table 1 as shown in table 1 the operational conditions of the selected sludge reduction approaches are different because various chemical and biological treatment processes were employed to reduce sludge production the primary goal of this study was to analyze various sludge reduction strategies under various operational conditions to see how the procedures would impact the environment while effectively reducing the sludge it is worth noting that the sludge yield before implementing different scenarios to reduce sludge production was nearly the same 0 3 0 05 gtss g cod allowing us to compare the treatment strategies appropriately 19 59 68 fig 3 a and b illustrate a review of the findings of the sludge reduction which includes sludge generation and overall system performance respectively by analyzing the sludge reduction results obtained in the research as shown in fig 3 a scenario 1 with the ultrasound process showed the highest amount of sludge reduction about 78 followed by scenario 3 with the sludge ozonation process about 70 and then scenario 2 with assr about 67 when compared to their own control systems although there are numerous advantages to reducing sludge care must be taken to ensure that this technique does not compromise the system s overall performance as shown in fig 3 b the percent removal of cod in all scenarios is above 85 meaning they have good performance and no significant reduction in cod removal was observed in addition because of the varied anoxic oxic conditions s2 and s3 have outstanding nutrient removal performance which is similar to 21 findings furthermore scenario 1 has a very low tp removal percentage which is due to the ultrasound process and can be ignored 68 similarly according to z wei et al 78 because wwtps are frequently associated with high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions upgrading wwtps to comply with low carbon or zero carbon usage in the context of carbon neutrality is gaining traction besides the technical performance the sludge reduction techniques require energy as well as chemical reagents which have negative effects on the environment therefore a comprehensive life cycle assessment was conducted to effectively confirm their sustainability in this study it should be noted that the scenarios investigated which were based on lab scale results reported in the literature 19 59 68 were cutting edge and presented novel ideas that had not yet reached the scale up stage scaling up these scenarios will require confirmation of the environmental assessments as well as technical performance analysis 17 in addition as lehtoranta et al 42 explain the cost of treatment in the wwtp is proportional to the amount of organic matter and nutrients treated in each scenario 2 2 life cycle assessment lca methodologies the iso 14040 series defines lca as a four step standardized process that includes purpose specification life cycle inventory lci life cycle impact assessment lcia and life cycle interpretation 31 the following is a list of the precise contents of each stage 2 2 1 definitions of purpose the purpose of this research was to evaluate and analyze the life cycle environmental impacts of three promising sludge reduction scenarios for low strength wastewater with an influent cod of 300 50 mg l as well as to identify their primary environmental hotspots 2 2 1 1 functional unit fu a functional unit is an essential unit that could also represent the main and functional aspects of the system as a result scientists can do a more accurate sensitivity analysis and compare the input and output of various treatment methods 32 in this study 1 m3 of treated wastewater was chosen as a functional unit 2 2 1 2 lca boundary the lca boundary shows how the system s input products and output are linked to their life cycles energy use transportation and finally decomposition 45 70 fig 1 illustrates valuable data about the system boundary of each selected scenario the construction phase was not considered within the scope of this lca study and hence is not included in the system boundaries due to a lack of data instead the operation phase of the water line and sludge line was analyzed the primary treatment i e screening unit and tertiary treatment i e disinfection unit were not included in the system boundaries since they were not included for the purpose of this lca analysis the sludge line involves a typical sludge treatment procedure including thickening anaerobic digestion and dewatering units that consumes about 0 2 kwh kg of solids electricity 49 and about 12 g kg of solids polyelectrolytes 2 2 2 life cycle inventory lci the life cycle inventory provides detailed information on all compartments of the investigated system including input variables output data and continuous activity 1 table 2 presents the life cycle inventory information for the water line and sludge line in three scenarios investigated parameters for the water line were power influent effluent chemicals and greenhouse gas ghg emissions those for the sludge line were electricity chemicals and transportation as shown in table 2 low strength wastewater with nearly the same cod 0 3 0 05 kg m3 tn 0 045 0 005 kg m3 and tp 0 004 0 001 kg m3 concentrations was employed for the experiments which allowed us to compare the treatment strategies appropriately for the preparation of synthetic wastewater in scenarios 1 and 3 glucose was similarly used as the main carbon source 59 68 the synthetic wastewater in scenario 3 was prepared from a source of carbon glucose a source of nitrogen nh4cl and a source of phosphate kh2po4 trace metals mo mn zn co b ni al cu mg ca k fe were also added to make the desired synthetic wastewater alkalinity was supplied with nahco3 and ph was controlled 59 the influent wastewater at scenario 1 was composed of 90 synthetic wastewater from a carbon source of glucose and other nitrogen phosphorous and some trace metal sources and 10 actual wastewater obtained from an urban wwtp 68 scenario 2 used the fresh primary effluent from an urban wastewater treatment plant 19 since the particulate cod is removed in the primary sedimentation tanks and soluble cod is increased as a result this can be quite comparable to synthetic wastewater 1 electricity most of the electricity used for conventional secondary treatment is for 1 biological treatment by the activated sludge process which requires energy for aeration blowers 2 pumping systems for the transfer of wastewater liquid sludge biosolids and process water and 3 wastewater treatment equipment such as mixers ultrasound process and ozonation system 47 the details of each scenario s power consumption are given in the table 3 the energy required for the ozonation process in s3 includes feed gas preparation ozone generation and application which ranged from 25 to 30 kwh kg of ozone produced according to 58 as described before the power consumption was collected for each electricity consuming device in the wastewater treatment process this study s data collection was also closely linked to li et al 43 moreover the characterization of medium voltage electricity was taken from the ecoinvent 3 3 database 2 chemical polyelectrolyte was considered to be the organic polymer coagulant in sludge thickening and dewatering in all three scenarios only in the aao process was ozone injected into the sludge line for sludge reduction 3 greenhouse gas ghg ghgs such as ch4 n2o and co2 were found to be released directly from biological reactors anaerobic anoxic and aerobic tanks moreover guidelines from the 29 based on a 100 year time frame were used to compute gas emissions 4 transportation it was assumed that the chemicals used in the scenarios were produced by the same factory situated 30 km away from the plant landfilling was selected for the final disposal of waste sludge landfills are one of the most popular methods for the final disposal of sewage sludge since they are inexpensive and simple to operate especially in developing countries 79 the landfill site was assumed to be located 3 km outside the plant it was also considered that small trucks 10 t were used for the transportation of sludge and chemical materials in general the influent and effluent emission to water parts of the data collection such as cod ammonium total nitrogen and total phosphorus were obtained from the original paper 19 59 68 and the results may have varied due to differences in wastewater treatment performance 2 2 3 impact assessment the cml ia baseline v3 05 methodology based on a problem oriented midpoint approach was used in the life cycle impact assessment lcia of three scenarios due to its characterization factors and precise results obtained from previous studies to compare the environmental footprints of the processes 50 53 54 80 wastewater treatment plants in general have a negative influence on climate change environmental quality and ecotoxicity 64 therefore this study considers eight impact categories for midpoint characterization including depletion of abiotic resources elements ultimate reserves and fossil fuels human toxicity global warming acidification freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity marine aquatic ecotoxicology and eutrophication the life cycle impact subcategories were selected based on 1 the importance of the system under study and 2 impact categories assessed in prior lca research 27 30 65 since heavy metal concentrations in sludge were not available in any of the three scenarios the impact of terrestrial ecotoxicity was not considered which was in good agreement with ignatowicz 28 s findings furthermore the impacts of ozone layer depletion and photochemical oxidation were ignored in this study because they were found to be negligible 2 2 4 interpretation the findings are interpreted based on the involvement of various components in each environmental impact category such as electricity consumption chemical usage transportation and direct emissions of pollutants in addition the normalization factors from the cml ia method were used for the normalization of the environmental impact categories at the midpoints based on per person per year 2 2 5 sensitivity analysis the impact of the most crucial assumptions on the final results is assessed via sensitivity analysis it involves suggesting some alternative scenarios to the base case scenario and evaluating the probable environmental impacts of those alternative scenarios to achieve this goal various factors are modified into acceptable ranges of variation to see if the lca s results are significantly dependent on particular assumptions therefore according to epa guidelines the normalized sensitivity coefficient sij is defined as a ratio of the percentage change in the output variable yi to a 10 change in the input variable xi see formula 1 1 s ij yi yi xi xi the following is an example of how a parameter s effect on the model output can be interpreted 1 sij 0 25 shows that a parameter has almost no impact on the model s output 2 0 25 sij 1 means that a parameter is influential and 3 1 sij 2 signifies that a parameter has a major influence in this regard the sensitivity analysis was done to evaluate the accuracy and correctness of the retrieved file data transportation was not considered in the sensitivity analysis due to its insignificant impact 3 result and discussion 3 1 life cycle assessment of three investigated scenarios 3 1 1 life cycle impact analysis lcia results the simapro software was used to compute the life cycle impact categories for the three scenarios table 4 shows the amounts of the impacts of each category as calculated using the cml ia baseline v3 05 impact assessment method in addition the lcia results are graphically displayed in fig 4 to better understand the comparison of scenarios 3 2 abiotic depletion potential adp abiotic depletion fossil fuels adfp and acidification potential ap as shown in fig 5 electricity and chemicals have the greatest impact on the liquid line moreover in the sludge line as a result of lower sludge production the impact of electricity and chemical usage for sludge treatment is very low therefore the combined impact of electricity and chemicals in the sludge line is seen as a whole adp is generally related to the extraction or usage of resources 51 as shown in fig 5 a electricity production in s1 s2 and s3 as a result of raw resource consumption contributes about 97 93 and 63 of total ad potential respectively it is worth noting that chemical usage accounts for approximately 34 1 of total ad potential in s3 acidification is typically caused by hydrolysis and oxidation processes that release so2 and nox causing harm to human health and environmental resources 35 37 the primary contributors to acidification in s1 utilizing the cml technique were sulfur dioxide 71 4 nitrogen oxide 24 4 and ammonia 4 this finding is in line with the findings of tabesh et al 74 who focused on the detrimental impacts of nox so2 and ammonium on the acidification process in addition kalbar karmakar and asolekar 37 used a life cycle approach to compare several wastewater treatment technologies and discovered that the activated sludge process emits 0 19 kg so2 and the sequencing batch reactor emits 0 34 kg so2 which was primarily due to electricity generation for wwtp operation similarly s3 has the highest ap adfp and adp in comparison to the other situations due to the use of power as shown in fig 5 b and c 3 3 eutrophication potential ep and global warming potential gwp100a direct emissions have a significant impact on the global warming potential gwp and eutrophication potential ep of plants 61 phosphorus is the main limiting component in aquatic bodies which can contribute to eutrophication due to its extended presence even though nitrogen and its derivatives are co limiting variables in algal growth and dissolved oxygen depletion the management of freshwater eutrophication is primarily determined by phosphorus concentrations 24 these would be comparable to indirect emissions from the use of power and chemicals therefore direct emissions were investigated in order to identify the particular contributions of cod tn and tp to ep and gwp in this study as shown in fig 6 a tp in the effluent of s1 caused the most impact on the eutrophication category about 0 0122 kg po4 eq compared to other scenarios and this was due to the insignificant tp removal in the ultrasound system however s2 has the best tp removal performance and as a result the least contribution to the eutrophication category about 0 003 kg po4 eq in three scenarios tn is the second most important cause followed by cod and a minimal impact on eutrophication from power and chemical usage indirect impact rodriguez garcia et al 67 also pointed out that power and chemical use have an insignificant effect in this category tn contributes to s1 s2 and s3 by about 42 32 and 13 in the eutrophication category as shown s3 has the best performance in tn removal about nine times more than s1 due to the benefits of nutrient removal of a2o systems piao et al 56 found that their wwtp which used the a2o method and had a greater nutrient removal rate resulted in a lower ep impact overall results from fig 6 b show that s3 has the least impact on the eutrophication category and s1 has the most impact the impacts on the gwp category fig 7 are differentially related to three primary items 1 direct emissions as well as 2 electricity use and 3 chemical consumption as indirect emissions 66 the result of power consumption and chemical usage in s3 is about 1 2 and 1 7 times more than in s1 and s2 this was due to high power usage because of enhanced treatment and chemical ozone usage for sludge reduction in addition the highest direct ghg emissions also occurred in s3 using the a2o process as shown in fig 7 a this was due to the high removal efficiencies of cod and tn 94 in the a2o process which resulted in the higher production of n2o and ch4 moreover these findings are in good agreement with previous investigations by hernández padilla et al 25 who reported the contribution of methane and co2 in the climate change category in addition tabesh et al 74 referred to the negative impacts of n2o emissions generated during the nitrification and denitrification processes of wastewater treatment on gwp chai et al 11 also demonstrated the significant effects of co2 n2o and electricity on greenhouse gas emissions the overall result from fig 7 b shows that s3 has the highest gwp and s2 has the lowest 3 4 human toxicity potential htp heavy metal toxicity has proven to be a major threat and there are several health risks associated with it in the htps as shown in fig 8 b s3 has a higher impact than s1 and s2 about 1 2 and 1 7 times respectively this was due to higher power usage particularly in the wastewater treatment line the power consumption resulted in the emission of thallium and selenium into the water as well as the diffusion of chromium vi and hydrogen fluoride into the air which mainly contributed to the htps this is attributed to 98 in s1 and 97 in s2 because of the consumption of chemicals ozone accounts for approximately 19 of total htp electricity accounts for almost 80 of total htp in s3 3 5 marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential maetp according to the present study maetp has the greatest impact on overall ecotoxicity which is similar to prior studies 36 39 41 this is due to the fact that the impact of chemical and energy consumption and other defining characteristics of this category is frequently higher than other impact categories as shown in fig 8 c s3 has the greatest environmental impact in the maetp category since its electricity consumption and chemical usage are higher in comparison with other scenarios 3 6 sensitivity analysis the findings of the environmental impact assessment in three scenarios show that nutrients in the effluent as well as electricity consumption and chemical usage only in s3 are the most important factors affecting environmental impacts table 5 depicts the effects of altering 10 of chosen inventory component values in s1 s2 and s3 on environmental impacts environmental impact subcategories such as adp adfp gwp htp fawep maep and ap in three scenarios varied from 4 to 9 9 to respond to the change in electricity consumption by 10 similarly the calculated sensitivity coefficients sij were in the range of 0 25 to 1 which indicates that the mentioned impacts are influential to the 10 increase in electricity consumption moreover varying the electricity has no effect on ep because the sij 0 25 in all three scenarios piao et al 56 similarly reported that electricity usage was the most sensitive factor especially in acidification and ecotoxicity to respond to a 10 change in tp and tn concentrations in the influent eutrophication ep changed by 9 7 in s1 9 4 in s2 and 8 9 in s3 correspondingly sensitivity coefficients of 0 97 in s1 0 94 in s2 and 0 89 in s3 this indicates that ep is influential in changing the influent tp and tn the other categories were basically unaffected while sensitivity coefficients were lower than 0 25 finally chemical consumption shows fewer effects on all the categories however varying 10 chemical usage has the highest impact on adp in the range of 3 4 therefore adp is influential in chemical change due to the calculated sij in the range of 0 25 to 1 in s3 4 conclusion and outlook for the future the purpose of this research was to find out the advantages and disadvantages of three innovative treatment technologies utilizing various mechanisms to improve sludge reduction uncoupled metabolism cell lysis and eps destruction without any significant changes in the overall treatment performance of the system by the lca approach a review of the results of sludge reduction performance in three selected lab scale scenarios indicates that the range of sludge production varied between 0 013 and 0 03 kg m3 which is within the optimum range furthermore to select a long term solution to individualize the significant indicators several impact subcategories were studied using the cml ia baseline v3 05 method the following are some of the most important findings from the current study scenario 3 s3 aa0 sludge ozonation system demonstrated the highest environmental impacts in all categories except for ep mainly due to the higher chemicals and power consumption however because of the great removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from the effluent it had the lowest ep it shows that the aao process would be an excellent method for preventing eutrophication furthermore s3 demonstrates the medium range sludge production among the three scenarios scenario 1 s1 osa ultrasound system has the highest ep due to the lower nutrient and cod removal compared to s2 and s3 moreover s1 has the lowest sludge production compared to others and it s due to the ultrasound process s1 has the second highest impact of all the categories after s3 scenario 2 s2 sbr assr system exhibits the most effective and environmentally friendly solution having the lowest impact in seven of the eight categories evaluated and a medium impact on ep as a result of the nutrient removal performance the main reason for this is that s1 and s3 employed more advanced treatment methods ultrasound and ozonation respectively to significantly reduce the production of sludge in comparison to s2 but they also consumed more resources energy and chemicals which could lead to more indirect emissions and adverse environmental effects the results of a sensitivity analysis of the three processes show that nutrients in effluent and power consumption are the factors most important in causing environmental consequences whereas chemical consumption and transportation have little impact due to low chemical use in conclusion due to the excellent sludge reduction performance in all scenarios 65 the environmental impacts of the scenarios have received more attention therefore scenario 2 including the sbr assr system could be considered the best sustainable sludge reduction strategy economic analysis and scaling up are needed to confirm the results of this study and help investment decision makers come up with a complete and integrated way to do this task on a full scale in addition the integration of results from lca and risk analysis in the context of a multi criteria decision analytic approach

12642,in this study synergistic effects of mechanochemically synthesized metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite for effective treatment of real acid mine drainage amd was meticulously reported the obtained results were underpinned using the state of the art analytical techniques and instruments such as ftir hr fib sem eds xrf and xrd the ph redox equilibrium in c language was employed to complement experimental results optimum conditions were observed to be 45 60 min of mixing time 10 g l 1 of feedstock dosage i e nanocomposite and ambient temperature and ph the metal content fe mn cr cu ni pb al and zn embedded in real amd matrices was practically depleted 99 removal and sulphate greatly reduced 50 phreeqc predicted metals to exist as mono di and tri valents including variety of chemical complexes and they precipitated as metals hydroxides oxy hydroxides carbonates and oxy hydro sulphates this synergistic treatment approach holds great promise for the sustainable management of real amd effluents from coal mining activities and can provide a simple and effective solution for its management thenceforth softening and filtration technologies will need to be coupled to this process to further enhance the reclamation of drinking and to explore possible recovery of valuable minerals from the generated sludge graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords acid mine drainage amd or acid rock drainage ard acid mine drainage treatment metakaolinite metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite mgo nanoparticle data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the mining of coal and gold has been at the forefront of the economic status of numerous developed and developing countries and specifically the latter this primarily attributed to its indispensable contribution towards the gross domestic products gdp job creation poverty alleviation and other agglomeration advantages such as the establishment of shopping centres development of residential areas construction of decent roads and social amenities amongst others 1 2 contrary to numerous socio economic benefits mining of coal and gold is notoriously known for the production of toxic and hazardous wastewater that poses danger and ecological stress to different receiving aquatic and terrestrial environments 3 in particular mine effluents are generally acidic in nature and they are popularly known as acid mine drainage amd or acid rock drainage ard but this depends on the underlying geology and associated minerals 2 3 acid mine drainage constitutes notable levels of inorganic substances such as metals e g al fe cu mn ni and zn metalloids oxyanions radionuclides and rare earth metals such as uranium along with high acidity h and total dissolved solids tds 2 4 5 the physicochemical properties of amd greatly vary and this is dependent on the geological stratas being subjected to weathering for example the oxidation of pyrite fes2 or other sulphide bearing minerals which is typically catalysed by certain bacteria communities will result in reddish amd rich in iron and sulphate 8 while the opposite is the case for mn and al rich mine water or mine water that ingress through dolomitic or carbonates prior being decanted into the receiving environmental compartment since there is partial passive treatment of the mine water before seepage chemical constituents embedded in real amd matrices are toxic and hazardous to living organisms and they could lead to the development of numerous mutagenic teratogenic and carcinogenic effects on exposure as a regulatory requirement this wastewater matrix requires prudent and pragmatic treatment prior discharge to different receiving environments 2 7 8 various conventional proven and emerging technologies both on passive and active approach including their hybrid generation have been employed for the treatment of amd at laboratory pilot and real environments but these technologies have their relative advantages and disadvantages 2 9 11 however the paramount quest and main goal is to avert possible ecological impacts that could emanate from the discharge of mine effluents and these rely on different mechanisms such as precipitation adsorption filtration ion exchange bio sorption desalination and crystallization 5 11 12 these techniques have advantages and disadvantages with adsorption and precipitation been regarded the best technology primarily due to their reliance to the locally available materials that are cheap and affordable while filtration desalination ion exchange and bio sorption are considered effective but they pose numerous challenges due to their high energy requirements and generation of brine bio sorption has undesired limitations due to high space demand selective affinity to pollutants nutrients essentiality sorption modalities and poor performance in concentrated solutions 2 3 10 furthermore precipitation and adsorption create viable options for minerals recovery and valorisation 15 18 adsorption has a challenge of quick saturation but has higher efficacy for anionic species such as sulphate while precipitation is effective and non selective for metals 19 therefore exploring the synergy of adsorption and precipitation could go a long way in addressing the challenges of amd treatment specifically by increasing the removal of metals and sulphates 2 15 specifically clay based minerals such as bentonite clay montmorillonite and vermiculite have been widely used for the treatment of real amd but the application of metakaoline has never been explored 13 15 different ca na and mg based oxides hydroxides and carbonates have been used for the treatment of amd 7 19 22 with mgo nps receiving paramount attention due to their selective nature and higher mn removal efficacies however mgo has limited capacity for the removal of sulphate due to its high solubility and the formation of its magnesium sulphate complex unless if ca is available to aid the removal of sulphate as gypsum 1 16 as such to enhance the sulphate removal ability of mgo nps minerals could be synthesized as composites and this aids to yield synergistic effects and complementary efficacies masindi 27 explored the use of bentonite clay and magnesite for the treatment of gold amd the study achieved higher removal efficacies for pollutants and increased the ph significantly however the use of mgo nps in combination with metakaolinite has never being explored and this will be the first time in design and execution to assess the efficacy of metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite for the treatment of real amd furthermore the nanocomposite will be synthesized using mechanochemical synthesis via the calcination process and vibratory ball milling these process enhance the reactive sites amorphousize the material and enrich the surface areas of the material the state of the art analytical techniques and phreeqc geochemical modelling will explicitly be used to underpin experimental results this will go a long way in curtailing potential impacts that are linked to real amd 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples collection real amd was collected from a coal mine in mpumalanga province south africa the effluent was seeping through the toe of a coal stockpile this real amd is concentrated and fully oxidised due to evaporation and exposure to atmospheric oxygen hence fe iii will present in elevated concentration the wide mouth high density polyethylene hdpe bottles were used for sample collection while the suspended solids and debris were removed by filtration using macherey nagel filter papers mn 615 ø125mm after collection samples were stored in a cooled bag and transferred to the laboratory ca rich mgo np was procured from sterkfontein carbonates the metakaolinite clay was supplied by the council for scientific and industrial research csir material science division the samples were dry when received and they were in the particle size range of 32 μm 2 2 the synthesis of the nanocomposite this study adopted the method which was recently proposed by masindi 27 the nanocomposite was synthesized using mechanochemical milling of specified ratios of metakaolinite and ca rich mgo nps specifically the vibratory ball miller was effectively utilised for the synthesis process the powdered metakaolinite 500 g and ca rich mgo nps 500 g were mixed at 1 1 w w mass ratios the mixture was then crushed and homogenised using the retsch rs 200 miller the mixture was milled for 30 min at 1600 rpm the mixture was then calcined at 1000 c to strip off carbonates and volatile compounds including other impurities thenceforth the mixture was re milled at 1600 rpm for 30 min using the retsch rs 200 miller thereafter the homogenised and synthesized nanocomposite was passed through 32 nm particle size sieve the product nanocomposite was then kept in the sealed zip lock plastic bags for utilization in the treatment of real amd from coal mining activities the same procedure was followed to produce more nanocomposites for the treatment of real effluents emanating from coal mining activities 2 3 treatment of real amd optimisation studies batch experimental approach was used for the treatment of real amd using the synthesized metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite the experiments were performed in the graded volumetric flasks loaded with 1000 ml of real amd the mixtures were mixed for specified interval and dosages as elucidated below the overhead stirrers mounted on a philip and bird stirrer equipped with six propellers were utilised to fulfil the goals of this study the examined ranges for the contact time and the nanocomposite dosages during the treatment of real coal amd treatment amd volume 1000 ml and mixing speed 250 rpm were done with 13 experimental runs in the ratio dosage time of g were 10 5 10 10 10 15 10 30 10 45 0 5 60 1 60 2 5 60 5 60 10 60 15 60 to enhance the trustworthiness of the results the experiments were performed in triplicate and results are presented in mean values therefore the parameters that were considered in the optimisation studies comprise i contact time i e mixing duration of the nanocomposite with real amd and ii nanocomposite dosage i e the nanocomposite mass per amd volume the effect of these two main parameters on amd treatment efficiency was examined by first varying the contact time and then the nanocomposite dosage therefore the optimum contact time was first identified and then used to identify the optimum nanocomposite dosage it should be noted that the nanocomposite mass was measured using an analytical balance with the precision being restricted to 2 decimal places post optimisation studies the water was treated at optimum condition using the nanocomposite the percentage removal of the contaminants contained in amd after the nanocomposite treatment was estimated using eq 1 1 removal efficiency c 0 c e c 0 100 where c0 is the initial concentration of any defined contaminant and ce is the final concentration of the same contaminant after treatment 2 4 sample characterisation to identify the chemical species contained in the examined aqueous samples real amd and real mww before and after treatment with nanocomposite as well as to identify the purity of the procured individual materials and the composition of the synthesized nanocomposite and of the sludge that is generated from the interaction of the nanocomposite with real amd resultant sludge thereafter different analytical techniques were employed specifically state of art analytical pieces of equipment were used in the iso iec 17025 2017 accredited laboratory as discussed below for the characterisation of the in situ properties i e ph electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds of real amd before and after treatment a multi parameter probe hanna instrument hi9828 was used the chemical species contained in the raw and treated amd were measured by means of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes agilent technologies 5110 coupled with agilent sps 4 auto sampler and the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo scientific s xseries 2 coupled with asx 520 auto sampler thermo fisher scientific s gallery plus discrete analyser photo spectrometer was used for base metals analyses including sulphates the listed pieces of equipment were utilised inter changeably depending on availability and characterisation needs national institute of standards and technology nist standards reference materials and quality control procedures were duly considered during the experiments and analyses to ascertain the mineralogical characteristics of the i synthesized nanocomposite and iii resultant sludge from the interaction of the nanocomposite with real amd x ray diffraction xrd panalytical s x pert pro x ray diffractometer along with philips pw 1710 diffractometer with graphite secondary monochromatic source were used was used their elemental compositions were ascertained using x ray fluorescence xrf thermo scientific s arl perform x sequential x sequential xrf spectrometer coupled with the uniquant software for standardless quantitative analysis furthermore the metals and anions functional groups were ascertained using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir making use of perkin elmer spectrum 100 ftir spectrometer coupled with perkin elmer s universal attenuated total reflectance atr sampling accessory with a diamond crystal to corroborate and complement the xrd and xrf results the morphological mapping properties and elemental properties were ascertained using high resolution hr field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem smartsem auriga coupled with focused ion beam fib and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds eds sem and fib sem allows for precise and highly accurate measurements while detailed and high resolution and practically undistorted imagery can be also obtained 2 5 geochemical modelling to complement the experimental results and determine the aqueous species and mineral phases that are more likely to be synthesized from the interaction of the nanocomposite and real amd geochemical modelling was applied the primary aim was to determine the speciation and calculate the saturation indices sis of the mineral phases based on compositions of raw water and feedstock minerals in particular the ph redox equilibrium in c language phreeqc geochemical model with the use of the wateq4f database were employed 17 18 furthermore the chemical species which were more likely to precipitate were determined using the modelled saturation indexes si whereby si values lower than unity 1 denote an under saturated solution si values equal to unity 1 denote a saturated solution and lastly si values higher than unity 1 denote a supersaturated solution 3 results and discussion this section is divided into two section of which section 3 1 is the water quality and section 3 4 is the solids characterisation 3 1 optimisation studies to evaluate the effect of contact time and nanocomposite dosage a wide range table 1 of values for each parameter were examined and results are discussed below 3 1 1 effect of mixing time the variation on the ec ph ca and mg levels fig 1a including the percentage removal of inorganic contaminants fig 1b as a function of contact time is shown in fig 1 a and b as expected fig 1a there was a general increase in ec ph ca and mg levels with an increase in the reaction time an increase in ec denotes the dissolution of chemicals e g ca and mg from the matrices of the synthesized nanocomposite into aqueous solution similarly the ph of the supernatant was observed to increase with an increase in contact time and the base metals this could be explained by the dissolution of base metals ca and mg from the matrices of the synthesized nanocomposite as summarised in eqs 2 5 1 2 mgo h 2 o mg 2 2 oh 3 cao h 2 o ca 2 2 oh base metals contribute to the addition of hydroxyl groups into the aquasphere hence leading to the formation of metals hydroxides and an increase in ph the ph increased from 2 to 10 5 after 60 min the dissolution rates were high for mg as compared to ca mg ca and this could be linked to mgo np being the prominent component of the nanocomposite the ec increased from 1700 to 2400 ms cm at 60 min a steep increase was observed to be rapid from 0 to 15 min thereafter a gradual increase in ec was noted as denoted by the flat plateau a proportional relationship was observed between ca mg and ec hence confirming that the introduction of ca and mg is also contributing to an increase in ec of the supernatant in light of the obtained results from approximately 30 to 60 min there was no significant change in the ph ec mg and ca that was observed during the reaction time however 45 min could be taken as the optimum time for the treatment of real amd using the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite phreeqc geochemical model also predicted ca and mg to exist as divalent species in aqueous solution moreover the model also predicted these base cations to exist as different complexes in aqueous solution and these include sulphate and hydroxide complexes as such 45 min will be used in the subsequent optimisation studies in addition the variations in the percentage removal of the main chemical species from real amd as a function of mixing times are shown in fig 2b there was an increase in the percentage removal of inorganic contaminants with an increase in contact time fig 2b within the first 15 min majority of inorganic contaminants were above 80 of percentage removal except for sulphate which attained close to 30 removal efficacy thenceforth over 95 removal efficacy was observed for al fe mn zn pb and cr except for ni cu and so₄2 after 45 min the system was observed to have stabilized in terms of contaminants removal and this could be confirmed by the linear plateau for all the contaminants in particular the removal efficacy for contaminants registered the following sequence fe mn al zn ni cr pb cu so₄2 with 99 9 99 9 99 9 99 9 99 3 97 9 95 94 and 50 respectively in light of the obtained results 45 min is adequate for the removal of inorganic contaminants from aqueous solutions phreeqc geochemical model predicted these inorganic contaminants to exist as di and tri valents in aqueous solution including complexes of hydroxides and sulphates moreover chemicals species were predicted to be removed as hydroxides sulphates oxyhydrosulphates metals sulphates and carbonates results obtained in this study precisely corroborate results reported in other studies 16 18 20 furthermore contaminants were attenuated using different mechanisms such as adsorption precipitation ion exchange isomorphous substitution co precipitation and co adsorption amongst others interestingly shorter justified the ecological friendliness of the proposed technology since more energy translates to more energy requirements 3 1 2 effect of the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite dosage variation on the ec ph ca and mg levels fig 2a including the percentage removal of inorganic contaminants fig 2b as a function of feedstock dosage is shown in fig 2 a and b as shown in fig 2a the ec of the supernatant was observed to increase with an increase in the nanocomposite dosage this could be explained by an increase in dosage that proportionally translates into an increase in the substance that dissolves in water specifically the mg which increased from 550 mg l 1 to 3500 mg l 1 a similar trend was observed for ph mg and ca when the dosage was increasing factors that could also be contribution towards an increase in ec is the exchange of cations between the synthesized nanocomposite and the real amd solution moreover there was an increase in ph from 2 to 10 9 at 15 g of the nanocomposite this could be linked to an increase in alkalinity as denoted by eqs 2 and 3 including the phreeqc geochemical model a rapid increase in ph was observed from 0 5 to 10 g thereafter there was no significant changes in ph hence denoting 10 g l 1 w v as the optimum dosage elevated ph will foster the precipitation of metals as metals hydroxides amongst other phases post ph 10 the mg level was observed to reduce and this could be explained by the precipitation of magnesite as brucite i e mg oh 2 furthermore phreeqc predicted ca and mg to exist as divalent species in water the complexes were predicted to be sulphates and hydroxyl groups the variations in the percentage removal of the main chemical species from real amd as a function of the nanocomposite dosage are shown in fig 2b the effects of metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite dosages on the percentage removal of inorganic contaminants as a function of feedstock dosage are shown in fig 2b as was expected there was an increase in the percentage removal of inorganic contaminants with an increase in the nanocomposite dosage except for al and fe which demonstrated leaching at 0 5 g thereafter their removal was observed to increase with an increase in the nanocomposite dosage the leaching of al and fe was expected since this was reported in literature 30 the authors reported the ph of 1 3 5 as conducive for leaching of minerals from bentonite clay matrices this has corroborated what has been reported in literature 31 the authors highlighted the feasibility of recovering al from kaolinite through acid leaching and this was the case in this study since ph was 2 a gradual increase in ph to 3 5 led to an increase in the removal of al iii and fe iii interestingly the percentage removal for al fe mn pb ni zn cr and cu were observed to be 99 9 while the removal of sulphate from real amd was observed to be 50 phreeqc geochemical model predicted the removal of metals as hydroxide eq 4 sulphates species eqs 5 and 6 and carbonates 4 m n noh m oh n 5 al h 2 o 3 oh 3 so 4 2 al h 2 o 3 oh so 4 2 oh 6 fe h 2 o 3 oh 3 so 4 2 fe h 2 o 3 oh so 4 2 oh the reaction mechanisms corroborate what has been predicted by phreeqc geochemical model regarding the so4 2 content which was not fully removed even at the higher examined dosage whereas there is a trade off in so4 2 removal and the nanocomposite dosage since after the 10 g l 1 dosage only small increases in so4 2 percentage removal were observed therefore it appears that the 10 g l 1 is the optimum dosage for both metals and so4 removal mechanisms for sulphate removal were observed to be adsorption precipitation complexation co precipitation and co adsorption specifically as gypsum di tri metals sulphates epsomite and oxyhydrosulphates 3 2 effective treatment of real amd at optimum conditions the physicochemical properties of the raw and metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite treated real amd are reported in table 1 after the optimum conditions for contact time and metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite dosage were identified the real amd was therefore treated under these conditions these conditions were also examined in the optimization studies for metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite dosage 45 min of contact time and 10 g l 1 of metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite dosage however they were repeated here as well as shown in table 1 the use of the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite could provide a viable option for effective management of real amd in particular metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite treatment largely reduced the levels of the contaminants contained in real amd suggesting that it is possible to treat real and concentrated amd this hybrid process makes uses of synergies between adsorption ion exchange and precipitation primarily due to the chemical components embedded in its matrices as shown in table 2 the ph of real amd was observed to increase from 2 to 10 5 indicating that the alkalinity released from the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite matrices played an indispensable role in the attenuation of metals and their precipitation interestingly it was observed that nearly all 100 al fe and cr content was removed while the percentage removal for zn was 99 7 99 6 for ni and al 99 5 for pb 98 7 for cu and 50 for so₄2 lastly an increase of ca mg and ec was observed and this could be attributed to dissolution of mg and ca from the matrices of the synthesized metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite the presence of fe and s in elevated concentration possible imply that the type of mine water being treated in this study emanate from the oxidation of pyrite 32 thenceforth other inorganic contaminants denotes the presence of other sulphide minerals i e zn cu zn and ni that associate to coal during its genesis 6 worryingly the mg level was not reduced but instead was observed to have increased since mg was released from the matrices of the nanocomposite through dissolution during the interaction of metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite in light of the obtained results and to foster the concept of circular economy and wastewater valorisation the product stream could be treated using the reverse osmosis ro to reclaim drinking water and fight against food insecurities and availability of safe water that is suitable for human consumption alternatively mixing raw amd as to treat both the raw amd and neutralise the ph of the nanocomposite treated effluent co treatment could be pursued therefore results suggest that this hybrid co treatment method which relies on synergies between the chemical species embodied in the nanocomposite matrices could be promising for the management of real amd particularly in the developing world setting where wastewater infrastructure is typically undeveloped or underdeveloped 2 furthermore both treated effluents can provide an alternative source of water e g for irrigation or even for groundwater recharge provided that further treatment is pursued and therefore address at least partly water pressures concerns in water scarce countries such as south africa overall this amd treatment method appears to be promising for the effective management of mine effluents while at the same time it could open new avenues for water reclamation and therefore also promote un s sdgs to further support the aforementioned results for amd the detailed characterisation of the solid materials that are produced during the amd treatment are meticulously discussed in the subsequent section 3 3 solid materials characterisation this section provides insight on the fate and partitioning of chemical species contained in the synthesized metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite and real amd for this reason individual materials and their nanocomposite matrices were studied along with the resultant sludge the sludge that is produced from the interaction of amd with metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite by doing so the results regarding the quality of the treated amd are corroborated and verified 3 3 1 elemental compositions first the elemental compositions of metakaolinite mgo np metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite and the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite amd resultant sludge were examined by means of xfr and then were also estimated using high resolution sem eds the xrf results are shown in table 2 as shown in table 3 metakaolinite mgo np metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite and the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite amd resultant sludge comprised elements which are prevalent in their mother material and the amd specifically the metakaolinite comprised al and si as the main components hence the name aluminosilicate traces of other chemical constituents i e ca and ti were observed to be present and there were trivial traces of other chemical constituents the obtained results corroborate what has been reported in literature 33 34 high level of al justify the leaching of al from the matrices of the nanocomposite the mgo nps were observed to be enrich of mg ca and si hence the name ca enriched mgo the presence of al mg ca and si in these materials justifies the potential of attenuating contaminants from mine water using different mechanisms furthermore the synthesized nanocomposite was observed to comprise chemical constituents that prevail in individual materials hence confirming their genesis of which the main components were observed to be mg si al and ca amongst trivial traces of other chemicals after contacting metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite with real amd solution the resultant sludge comprised elements which are prevalent in real amd and the nanocomposite specifically the resultant sludge comprises elevated levels of fe and s while al si mg ti and ca were observed to have reduced these are the major contaminants in amd hence confirming that the nanocomposite is acting as a sink of major and trace contaminants in amd this finding corroborates the icp ms results as reported in the optimization studies results revealed fe to have increased from 0 73 to 17 19 and s from 0 81 to 8 02 while si reduced from 25 38 to 16 85 mg from 42 25 to 14 61 and al from 19 60 to 15 74 and ca reduced from 4 02 to 2 19 there was a shift in the level of minute elements but this was insignificant lower reduction in al denotes that this mineral is chemically stable in the interlayers of the nanocomposite while the reduction in mg confirms what has been reported in the icp results where the concentrations of mg and ca were leaching out of water this further cement the addition of alkalinity in water hence promoting the precipitation of metals reduction in al could be explained by the initial leaching in low ph the findings from this section further corroborate what has been predicted by phreeqc geochemical model where metals were predicted to be removed as hydroxides oxyhydroxides oxy hydrosulphates carbonates and metals sulphates including gypsum the loss of ignition loi was also observed to be high this could be mainly traced back to water since this material is hydrated and to a lesser extent to volatile compounds organic matter and carbonates 3 3 2 morphological and microstructural properties the morphological and microstructural properties of a the metakaolinite b the mgo np c the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite and d the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite amd resultant sludge are shown in fig 3 a d to attain magnificent imagery with limited distortion hr fe sem was duly employed the morphological and microstructural properties of a the metakaolinite b the mgo np c the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite and d the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite amd resultant sludge are duly summarised in fig 3 a d 1 μm 200 nm and 100 nm first in metakaolinite the material was observed to comprise leafy like structure and heterogeneous traits consisting of irregularly shaped particles fig 3a this microstructural property was observed to be the same in different magnifications hence confirming that there is no change in microstructural properties similar results were reported by el alouani et al 35 moreover the mgo nps were observed to comprise the heterogeneous mixtures of octagonal nano sheets connected to each other fig 3b the microstructural properties were observed to be the same in different magnifications and this corroborates what has been reported in literature 1 furthermore the nanocomposite was observed to comprise leafy like and octagonal nano sheets sandwiched together as a heterogeneous mixture fig 3c lastly the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite amd resultant sludge was observed to comprise rod like and nanosheets blended to each other in a heterogeneous fashion the results confirm the microstructural transformation of the material and this confirms that there is deposition of new mineral phases to the sludge from amd fig 3d this further corroborates the removal and dissolution of contaminants from amd the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite amd resultant sludge interaction the results were the same in all the magnification 3 3 3 elemental distribution mapping using eds to further corroborate the xrf and the sem eds results regarding the elemental compositions of the examined solid samples elemental distribution mapping was also carried out using the fe sem instrument s eds capabilities results are shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 a the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite comprised mg si al o and ca as dominant elements along with minute levels of s ti and fe the elements were fairly distributed across the surface hence confirming their predominance moreover the distribution of these elements on the surface of the material further confirms the genesis of this nanocomposite the obtained results correspond to what has been reported in the xrf and eds furthermore the resultant sludge produced from the interaction of metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite with amd fig 4b comprised o si al fe s ca and mg as major elements traces of na were observed to be present the obtained results are congruent to what has been predicted by phreeqc geochemical model where sulphate was removed as gypsum this could be confirmed by the presence of notable levels of ca s and o similar results have been reported in the literature 1 in addition to the gypsum results al fe and o were observed to be present and this could imply the formation of al and fe hydroxide however phreeqc further denoted that these chemical are removed as oxy hydro sulphates metal hydro sulphates and hydroxide amongst others and this could be explained by the presence of o fe and al mg was also observed to be present but this could be linked to the mother material which comprise the metakaolinite and ca rich mgo nps matrices specifically the ca rich mgo nps part lastly the obtained results corroborate what has been reported in the icp ms oes results on the raw and product water quality and this meticulously demonstrate the fate of chemical components post the treatment of real amd with the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite 3 3 4 mineralogical properties the mineralogical compositions and crystal phases of the examined solid samples were identified using xrd and results are shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the crystal mineral phases of the metakaolinite the mgo nps the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite and metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite amd resultant sludge were identified as shown in the peak identification which is assigned to the diffractogram metakaolinite was observed to comprise mullite quartz cristobalite hematite kaolinite rutile and calcite and mgo nps comprise periclase brucite quartz calcite anhydrite and magnesite the composite was observed to comprise minerals which were present in individual materials and they include periclase quartz mullite calcite cristobalite magnesite kaolinite and kieserite the presence of base metals and si species will significantly contribute to the addition of alkalinity and this will aid in the removal of metals through precipitation co precipitation and adsorption as predicted by phreeqc geochemical model specifically the silicate will react with acidity in real amd using ion exchange as a mechanism hence increasing the ph of the product water eqs 7 11 36 7 sioh sio h 8 2 sioh ca 2 2 sioca 2 h 9 sioca m e 2 hoh siom ca 2 2 oh 10 sioh mg 2 siomg h 11 siomg m e 2 hoh siom mg 2 2 oh the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite amd resultant sludge comprised the gypsum cristobalite quartz mullite and kaolinite finally the noisy signal in the spectrogram of the resultant sludge denotes the presence of amorphous phases in its matrix fig 5 furthermore the reaction of the nanocomposite and real amd is in agreement with the xrd eds mapping xrf and phreeqc geochemical modelling results and this could further be explained by the following equations 37 12 cao h 2 o ca oh 2 13 mgso 4 ca oh 2 mg oh 2 caso 4 the presence of kaolinite mullite quartz and cristobalite demonstrate the chemical stability of the synthesized nanocomposite lastly the disappearance of periclase calcite and magnesite confirms the alkalinity in the product water as explained in eqs 2 3 3 3 5 functional groups finally the ftir spectrums and elemental compositions of the solid samples were also identified along with their functional groups and wavenumbers cm 1 results of a the metakaolinite b the mgo nps c the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite and d the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite amd resultant sludge are shown in fig 6 i and ii as shown in fig 6i a d the obtained ftir results corroborates the xrf xrd eds sem and phreeqc geochemical modelling results in a nutshell it appears that the use of the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite can act as an innovative avenue for the treatment of real amd therefore with this hybrid co treatment method the effective management of real amd from coal mining can be achieved while water could also be reclaimed using polishing technologies this is of particularly importance for south africa and other countries and areas that are affected by water scarcity and notorious mining activities as shown in fig 6 ii a metakaolinite has al o and si as major elements along with traces of fe ca ti and mg minute levels of k cr and s were also observed in the matrices high al si and o confirms that metakaolinite is an aluminosilicate mineral moreover the used mgo nps comprised mg o and ca as the main components fig 6ii b this confirms that the material is magnesium oxide that is rich in ca hence the name ca rich mgo np the raw metakaolinite and mgo nps were used for the synthesis of metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite fig 6ii c the nanocomposite was observed to comprise elements that predominates individual materials and they include mg o si al ca and fe exchangeable base cations such as na and k were observed to be present in the matrices of the material the results corroborate the xrf results however after contacting amd fig 6ii d the level of fe s ca was observed to have increased hence confirming the formation of fe hydroxide metals oxy hydrosulphate and gypsum as predicted by the phreeqc geochemical model mg si and al were observed to have decrease hence denoting dissolution leaching of these chemical species from the matrices and inter layers of the nanocomposite this could be confirmed by their increase in the product water as reported by icp ms oes and elevated electrical conductivity ms cm of the treated water findings obtained in this study further confirm that the synthesized nanocomposite has the ability to scavenge contaminants from real amd and this could be confirmed by their fate as confirmed by multiple tools such as the icp ms xrf sem eds and phreeqc geochemical model 4 estimation of the saturation indices sis the results for the estimation of mineral precipitation during the treatment of real amd with the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite are presented in table 3 as shown in table 3 elements existed as di valents tri valents oxyanions and complexes including carbonates in aqueous solution the carbonates could also be linked to atmospheric interactions during the treatment of real amd with the synthesized nanocomposite however after contacting the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite variety of minerals were observed to be formed as predicted by phreeqc geochemical model thenceforth the obtained mineral is congruent to what has been reported in ftir xrd xrf and hr fib sem eds including amorphous phases that could not be detected using xrd since its capability are limited to crystalline phases lastly the obtained results further corroborate what has been reported in the literature 17 19 5 conclusions and recommendations this study successfully proved the feasibility of mechanochemically synthesizing the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite and its application for effective treatment of real amd

introduction the mining of coal and gold has been at the forefront of the economic status of numerous developed and developing countries and specifically the latter this primarily attributed to its indispensable contribution towards the gross domestic products gdp job creation poverty alleviation and other agglomeration advantages such as the establishment of shopping centres development of residential areas construction of decent roads and social amenities amongst others 1 2 contrary to numerous socio economic benefits mining of coal and gold is notoriously known for the production of toxic and hazardous wastewater that poses danger and ecological stress to different receiving aquatic and terrestrial environments 3 in particular mine effluents are generally acidic in nature and they are popularly known as acid mine drainage amd or acid rock drainage ard but this depends on the underlying geology and associated minerals 2 3 acid mine drainage constitutes notable levels of inorganic substances such as metals e g al fe cu mn ni and zn metalloids oxyanions radionuclides and rare earth metals such as uranium along with high acidity h and total dissolved solids tds 2 4 5 the physicochemical properties of amd greatly vary and this is dependent on the geological stratas being subjected to weathering for example the oxidation of pyrite fes2 or other sulphide bearing minerals which is typically catalysed by certain bacteria communities will result in reddish amd rich in iron and sulphate 8 while the opposite is the case for mn and al rich mine water or mine water that ingress through dolomitic or carbonates prior being decanted into the receiving environmental compartment since there is partial passive treatment of the mine water before seepage chemical constituents embedded in real amd matrices are toxic and hazardous to living organisms and they could lead to the development of numerous mutagenic teratogenic and carcinogenic effects on exposure as a regulatory requirement this wastewater matrix requires prudent and pragmatic treatment prior discharge to different receiving environments 2 7 8 various conventional proven and emerging technologies both on passive and active approach including their hybrid generation have been employed for the treatment of amd at laboratory pilot and real environments but these technologies have their relative advantages and disadvantages 2 9 11 however the paramount quest and main goal is to avert possible ecological impacts that could emanate from the discharge of mine effluents and these rely on different mechanisms such as precipitation adsorption filtration ion exchange bio sorption desalination and crystallization 5 11 12 these techniques have advantages and disadvantages with adsorption and precipitation been regarded the best technology primarily due to their reliance to the locally available materials that are cheap and affordable while filtration desalination ion exchange and bio sorption are considered effective but they pose numerous challenges due to their high energy requirements and generation of brine bio sorption has undesired limitations due to high space demand selective affinity to pollutants nutrients essentiality sorption modalities and poor performance in concentrated solutions 2 3 10 furthermore precipitation and adsorption create viable options for minerals recovery and valorisation 15 18 adsorption has a challenge of quick saturation but has higher efficacy for anionic species such as sulphate while precipitation is effective and non selective for metals 19 therefore exploring the synergy of adsorption and precipitation could go a long way in addressing the challenges of amd treatment specifically by increasing the removal of metals and sulphates 2 15 specifically clay based minerals such as bentonite clay montmorillonite and vermiculite have been widely used for the treatment of real amd but the application of metakaoline has never been explored 13 15 different ca na and mg based oxides hydroxides and carbonates have been used for the treatment of amd 7 19 22 with mgo nps receiving paramount attention due to their selective nature and higher mn removal efficacies however mgo has limited capacity for the removal of sulphate due to its high solubility and the formation of its magnesium sulphate complex unless if ca is available to aid the removal of sulphate as gypsum 1 16 as such to enhance the sulphate removal ability of mgo nps minerals could be synthesized as composites and this aids to yield synergistic effects and complementary efficacies masindi 27 explored the use of bentonite clay and magnesite for the treatment of gold amd the study achieved higher removal efficacies for pollutants and increased the ph significantly however the use of mgo nps in combination with metakaolinite has never being explored and this will be the first time in design and execution to assess the efficacy of metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite for the treatment of real amd furthermore the nanocomposite will be synthesized using mechanochemical synthesis via the calcination process and vibratory ball milling these process enhance the reactive sites amorphousize the material and enrich the surface areas of the material the state of the art analytical techniques and phreeqc geochemical modelling will explicitly be used to underpin experimental results this will go a long way in curtailing potential impacts that are linked to real amd 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples collection real amd was collected from a coal mine in mpumalanga province south africa the effluent was seeping through the toe of a coal stockpile this real amd is concentrated and fully oxidised due to evaporation and exposure to atmospheric oxygen hence fe iii will present in elevated concentration the wide mouth high density polyethylene hdpe bottles were used for sample collection while the suspended solids and debris were removed by filtration using macherey nagel filter papers mn 615 ø125mm after collection samples were stored in a cooled bag and transferred to the laboratory ca rich mgo np was procured from sterkfontein carbonates the metakaolinite clay was supplied by the council for scientific and industrial research csir material science division the samples were dry when received and they were in the particle size range of 32 μm 2 2 the synthesis of the nanocomposite this study adopted the method which was recently proposed by masindi 27 the nanocomposite was synthesized using mechanochemical milling of specified ratios of metakaolinite and ca rich mgo nps specifically the vibratory ball miller was effectively utilised for the synthesis process the powdered metakaolinite 500 g and ca rich mgo nps 500 g were mixed at 1 1 w w mass ratios the mixture was then crushed and homogenised using the retsch rs 200 miller the mixture was milled for 30 min at 1600 rpm the mixture was then calcined at 1000 c to strip off carbonates and volatile compounds including other impurities thenceforth the mixture was re milled at 1600 rpm for 30 min using the retsch rs 200 miller thereafter the homogenised and synthesized nanocomposite was passed through 32 nm particle size sieve the product nanocomposite was then kept in the sealed zip lock plastic bags for utilization in the treatment of real amd from coal mining activities the same procedure was followed to produce more nanocomposites for the treatment of real effluents emanating from coal mining activities 2 3 treatment of real amd optimisation studies batch experimental approach was used for the treatment of real amd using the synthesized metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite the experiments were performed in the graded volumetric flasks loaded with 1000 ml of real amd the mixtures were mixed for specified interval and dosages as elucidated below the overhead stirrers mounted on a philip and bird stirrer equipped with six propellers were utilised to fulfil the goals of this study the examined ranges for the contact time and the nanocomposite dosages during the treatment of real coal amd treatment amd volume 1000 ml and mixing speed 250 rpm were done with 13 experimental runs in the ratio dosage time of g were 10 5 10 10 10 15 10 30 10 45 0 5 60 1 60 2 5 60 5 60 10 60 15 60 to enhance the trustworthiness of the results the experiments were performed in triplicate and results are presented in mean values therefore the parameters that were considered in the optimisation studies comprise i contact time i e mixing duration of the nanocomposite with real amd and ii nanocomposite dosage i e the nanocomposite mass per amd volume the effect of these two main parameters on amd treatment efficiency was examined by first varying the contact time and then the nanocomposite dosage therefore the optimum contact time was first identified and then used to identify the optimum nanocomposite dosage it should be noted that the nanocomposite mass was measured using an analytical balance with the precision being restricted to 2 decimal places post optimisation studies the water was treated at optimum condition using the nanocomposite the percentage removal of the contaminants contained in amd after the nanocomposite treatment was estimated using eq 1 1 removal efficiency c 0 c e c 0 100 where c0 is the initial concentration of any defined contaminant and ce is the final concentration of the same contaminant after treatment 2 4 sample characterisation to identify the chemical species contained in the examined aqueous samples real amd and real mww before and after treatment with nanocomposite as well as to identify the purity of the procured individual materials and the composition of the synthesized nanocomposite and of the sludge that is generated from the interaction of the nanocomposite with real amd resultant sludge thereafter different analytical techniques were employed specifically state of art analytical pieces of equipment were used in the iso iec 17025 2017 accredited laboratory as discussed below for the characterisation of the in situ properties i e ph electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds of real amd before and after treatment a multi parameter probe hanna instrument hi9828 was used the chemical species contained in the raw and treated amd were measured by means of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes agilent technologies 5110 coupled with agilent sps 4 auto sampler and the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo scientific s xseries 2 coupled with asx 520 auto sampler thermo fisher scientific s gallery plus discrete analyser photo spectrometer was used for base metals analyses including sulphates the listed pieces of equipment were utilised inter changeably depending on availability and characterisation needs national institute of standards and technology nist standards reference materials and quality control procedures were duly considered during the experiments and analyses to ascertain the mineralogical characteristics of the i synthesized nanocomposite and iii resultant sludge from the interaction of the nanocomposite with real amd x ray diffraction xrd panalytical s x pert pro x ray diffractometer along with philips pw 1710 diffractometer with graphite secondary monochromatic source were used was used their elemental compositions were ascertained using x ray fluorescence xrf thermo scientific s arl perform x sequential x sequential xrf spectrometer coupled with the uniquant software for standardless quantitative analysis furthermore the metals and anions functional groups were ascertained using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir making use of perkin elmer spectrum 100 ftir spectrometer coupled with perkin elmer s universal attenuated total reflectance atr sampling accessory with a diamond crystal to corroborate and complement the xrd and xrf results the morphological mapping properties and elemental properties were ascertained using high resolution hr field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem smartsem auriga coupled with focused ion beam fib and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds eds sem and fib sem allows for precise and highly accurate measurements while detailed and high resolution and practically undistorted imagery can be also obtained 2 5 geochemical modelling to complement the experimental results and determine the aqueous species and mineral phases that are more likely to be synthesized from the interaction of the nanocomposite and real amd geochemical modelling was applied the primary aim was to determine the speciation and calculate the saturation indices sis of the mineral phases based on compositions of raw water and feedstock minerals in particular the ph redox equilibrium in c language phreeqc geochemical model with the use of the wateq4f database were employed 17 18 furthermore the chemical species which were more likely to precipitate were determined using the modelled saturation indexes si whereby si values lower than unity 1 denote an under saturated solution si values equal to unity 1 denote a saturated solution and lastly si values higher than unity 1 denote a supersaturated solution 3 results and discussion this section is divided into two section of which section 3 1 is the water quality and section 3 4 is the solids characterisation 3 1 optimisation studies to evaluate the effect of contact time and nanocomposite dosage a wide range table 1 of values for each parameter were examined and results are discussed below 3 1 1 effect of mixing time the variation on the ec ph ca and mg levels fig 1a including the percentage removal of inorganic contaminants fig 1b as a function of contact time is shown in fig 1 a and b as expected fig 1a there was a general increase in ec ph ca and mg levels with an increase in the reaction time an increase in ec denotes the dissolution of chemicals e g ca and mg from the matrices of the synthesized nanocomposite into aqueous solution similarly the ph of the supernatant was observed to increase with an increase in contact time and the base metals this could be explained by the dissolution of base metals ca and mg from the matrices of the synthesized nanocomposite as summarised in eqs 2 5 1 2 mgo h 2 o mg 2 2 oh 3 cao h 2 o ca 2 2 oh base metals contribute to the addition of hydroxyl groups into the aquasphere hence leading to the formation of metals hydroxides and an increase in ph the ph increased from 2 to 10 5 after 60 min the dissolution rates were high for mg as compared to ca mg ca and this could be linked to mgo np being the prominent component of the nanocomposite the ec increased from 1700 to 2400 ms cm at 60 min a steep increase was observed to be rapid from 0 to 15 min thereafter a gradual increase in ec was noted as denoted by the flat plateau a proportional relationship was observed between ca mg and ec hence confirming that the introduction of ca and mg is also contributing to an increase in ec of the supernatant in light of the obtained results from approximately 30 to 60 min there was no significant change in the ph ec mg and ca that was observed during the reaction time however 45 min could be taken as the optimum time for the treatment of real amd using the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite phreeqc geochemical model also predicted ca and mg to exist as divalent species in aqueous solution moreover the model also predicted these base cations to exist as different complexes in aqueous solution and these include sulphate and hydroxide complexes as such 45 min will be used in the subsequent optimisation studies in addition the variations in the percentage removal of the main chemical species from real amd as a function of mixing times are shown in fig 2b there was an increase in the percentage removal of inorganic contaminants with an increase in contact time fig 2b within the first 15 min majority of inorganic contaminants were above 80 of percentage removal except for sulphate which attained close to 30 removal efficacy thenceforth over 95 removal efficacy was observed for al fe mn zn pb and cr except for ni cu and so₄2 after 45 min the system was observed to have stabilized in terms of contaminants removal and this could be confirmed by the linear plateau for all the contaminants in particular the removal efficacy for contaminants registered the following sequence fe mn al zn ni cr pb cu so₄2 with 99 9 99 9 99 9 99 9 99 3 97 9 95 94 and 50 respectively in light of the obtained results 45 min is adequate for the removal of inorganic contaminants from aqueous solutions phreeqc geochemical model predicted these inorganic contaminants to exist as di and tri valents in aqueous solution including complexes of hydroxides and sulphates moreover chemicals species were predicted to be removed as hydroxides sulphates oxyhydrosulphates metals sulphates and carbonates results obtained in this study precisely corroborate results reported in other studies 16 18 20 furthermore contaminants were attenuated using different mechanisms such as adsorption precipitation ion exchange isomorphous substitution co precipitation and co adsorption amongst others interestingly shorter justified the ecological friendliness of the proposed technology since more energy translates to more energy requirements 3 1 2 effect of the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite dosage variation on the ec ph ca and mg levels fig 2a including the percentage removal of inorganic contaminants fig 2b as a function of feedstock dosage is shown in fig 2 a and b as shown in fig 2a the ec of the supernatant was observed to increase with an increase in the nanocomposite dosage this could be explained by an increase in dosage that proportionally translates into an increase in the substance that dissolves in water specifically the mg which increased from 550 mg l 1 to 3500 mg l 1 a similar trend was observed for ph mg and ca when the dosage was increasing factors that could also be contribution towards an increase in ec is the exchange of cations between the synthesized nanocomposite and the real amd solution moreover there was an increase in ph from 2 to 10 9 at 15 g of the nanocomposite this could be linked to an increase in alkalinity as denoted by eqs 2 and 3 including the phreeqc geochemical model a rapid increase in ph was observed from 0 5 to 10 g thereafter there was no significant changes in ph hence denoting 10 g l 1 w v as the optimum dosage elevated ph will foster the precipitation of metals as metals hydroxides amongst other phases post ph 10 the mg level was observed to reduce and this could be explained by the precipitation of magnesite as brucite i e mg oh 2 furthermore phreeqc predicted ca and mg to exist as divalent species in water the complexes were predicted to be sulphates and hydroxyl groups the variations in the percentage removal of the main chemical species from real amd as a function of the nanocomposite dosage are shown in fig 2b the effects of metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite dosages on the percentage removal of inorganic contaminants as a function of feedstock dosage are shown in fig 2b as was expected there was an increase in the percentage removal of inorganic contaminants with an increase in the nanocomposite dosage except for al and fe which demonstrated leaching at 0 5 g thereafter their removal was observed to increase with an increase in the nanocomposite dosage the leaching of al and fe was expected since this was reported in literature 30 the authors reported the ph of 1 3 5 as conducive for leaching of minerals from bentonite clay matrices this has corroborated what has been reported in literature 31 the authors highlighted the feasibility of recovering al from kaolinite through acid leaching and this was the case in this study since ph was 2 a gradual increase in ph to 3 5 led to an increase in the removal of al iii and fe iii interestingly the percentage removal for al fe mn pb ni zn cr and cu were observed to be 99 9 while the removal of sulphate from real amd was observed to be 50 phreeqc geochemical model predicted the removal of metals as hydroxide eq 4 sulphates species eqs 5 and 6 and carbonates 4 m n noh m oh n 5 al h 2 o 3 oh 3 so 4 2 al h 2 o 3 oh so 4 2 oh 6 fe h 2 o 3 oh 3 so 4 2 fe h 2 o 3 oh so 4 2 oh the reaction mechanisms corroborate what has been predicted by phreeqc geochemical model regarding the so4 2 content which was not fully removed even at the higher examined dosage whereas there is a trade off in so4 2 removal and the nanocomposite dosage since after the 10 g l 1 dosage only small increases in so4 2 percentage removal were observed therefore it appears that the 10 g l 1 is the optimum dosage for both metals and so4 removal mechanisms for sulphate removal were observed to be adsorption precipitation complexation co precipitation and co adsorption specifically as gypsum di tri metals sulphates epsomite and oxyhydrosulphates 3 2 effective treatment of real amd at optimum conditions the physicochemical properties of the raw and metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite treated real amd are reported in table 1 after the optimum conditions for contact time and metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite dosage were identified the real amd was therefore treated under these conditions these conditions were also examined in the optimization studies for metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite dosage 45 min of contact time and 10 g l 1 of metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite dosage however they were repeated here as well as shown in table 1 the use of the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite could provide a viable option for effective management of real amd in particular metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite treatment largely reduced the levels of the contaminants contained in real amd suggesting that it is possible to treat real and concentrated amd this hybrid process makes uses of synergies between adsorption ion exchange and precipitation primarily due to the chemical components embedded in its matrices as shown in table 2 the ph of real amd was observed to increase from 2 to 10 5 indicating that the alkalinity released from the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite matrices played an indispensable role in the attenuation of metals and their precipitation interestingly it was observed that nearly all 100 al fe and cr content was removed while the percentage removal for zn was 99 7 99 6 for ni and al 99 5 for pb 98 7 for cu and 50 for so₄2 lastly an increase of ca mg and ec was observed and this could be attributed to dissolution of mg and ca from the matrices of the synthesized metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite the presence of fe and s in elevated concentration possible imply that the type of mine water being treated in this study emanate from the oxidation of pyrite 32 thenceforth other inorganic contaminants denotes the presence of other sulphide minerals i e zn cu zn and ni that associate to coal during its genesis 6 worryingly the mg level was not reduced but instead was observed to have increased since mg was released from the matrices of the nanocomposite through dissolution during the interaction of metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite in light of the obtained results and to foster the concept of circular economy and wastewater valorisation the product stream could be treated using the reverse osmosis ro to reclaim drinking water and fight against food insecurities and availability of safe water that is suitable for human consumption alternatively mixing raw amd as to treat both the raw amd and neutralise the ph of the nanocomposite treated effluent co treatment could be pursued therefore results suggest that this hybrid co treatment method which relies on synergies between the chemical species embodied in the nanocomposite matrices could be promising for the management of real amd particularly in the developing world setting where wastewater infrastructure is typically undeveloped or underdeveloped 2 furthermore both treated effluents can provide an alternative source of water e g for irrigation or even for groundwater recharge provided that further treatment is pursued and therefore address at least partly water pressures concerns in water scarce countries such as south africa overall this amd treatment method appears to be promising for the effective management of mine effluents while at the same time it could open new avenues for water reclamation and therefore also promote un s sdgs to further support the aforementioned results for amd the detailed characterisation of the solid materials that are produced during the amd treatment are meticulously discussed in the subsequent section 3 3 solid materials characterisation this section provides insight on the fate and partitioning of chemical species contained in the synthesized metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite and real amd for this reason individual materials and their nanocomposite matrices were studied along with the resultant sludge the sludge that is produced from the interaction of amd with metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite by doing so the results regarding the quality of the treated amd are corroborated and verified 3 3 1 elemental compositions first the elemental compositions of metakaolinite mgo np metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite and the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite amd resultant sludge were examined by means of xfr and then were also estimated using high resolution sem eds the xrf results are shown in table 2 as shown in table 3 metakaolinite mgo np metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite and the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite amd resultant sludge comprised elements which are prevalent in their mother material and the amd specifically the metakaolinite comprised al and si as the main components hence the name aluminosilicate traces of other chemical constituents i e ca and ti were observed to be present and there were trivial traces of other chemical constituents the obtained results corroborate what has been reported in literature 33 34 high level of al justify the leaching of al from the matrices of the nanocomposite the mgo nps were observed to be enrich of mg ca and si hence the name ca enriched mgo the presence of al mg ca and si in these materials justifies the potential of attenuating contaminants from mine water using different mechanisms furthermore the synthesized nanocomposite was observed to comprise chemical constituents that prevail in individual materials hence confirming their genesis of which the main components were observed to be mg si al and ca amongst trivial traces of other chemicals after contacting metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite with real amd solution the resultant sludge comprised elements which are prevalent in real amd and the nanocomposite specifically the resultant sludge comprises elevated levels of fe and s while al si mg ti and ca were observed to have reduced these are the major contaminants in amd hence confirming that the nanocomposite is acting as a sink of major and trace contaminants in amd this finding corroborates the icp ms results as reported in the optimization studies results revealed fe to have increased from 0 73 to 17 19 and s from 0 81 to 8 02 while si reduced from 25 38 to 16 85 mg from 42 25 to 14 61 and al from 19 60 to 15 74 and ca reduced from 4 02 to 2 19 there was a shift in the level of minute elements but this was insignificant lower reduction in al denotes that this mineral is chemically stable in the interlayers of the nanocomposite while the reduction in mg confirms what has been reported in the icp results where the concentrations of mg and ca were leaching out of water this further cement the addition of alkalinity in water hence promoting the precipitation of metals reduction in al could be explained by the initial leaching in low ph the findings from this section further corroborate what has been predicted by phreeqc geochemical model where metals were predicted to be removed as hydroxides oxyhydroxides oxy hydrosulphates carbonates and metals sulphates including gypsum the loss of ignition loi was also observed to be high this could be mainly traced back to water since this material is hydrated and to a lesser extent to volatile compounds organic matter and carbonates 3 3 2 morphological and microstructural properties the morphological and microstructural properties of a the metakaolinite b the mgo np c the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite and d the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite amd resultant sludge are shown in fig 3 a d to attain magnificent imagery with limited distortion hr fe sem was duly employed the morphological and microstructural properties of a the metakaolinite b the mgo np c the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite and d the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite amd resultant sludge are duly summarised in fig 3 a d 1 μm 200 nm and 100 nm first in metakaolinite the material was observed to comprise leafy like structure and heterogeneous traits consisting of irregularly shaped particles fig 3a this microstructural property was observed to be the same in different magnifications hence confirming that there is no change in microstructural properties similar results were reported by el alouani et al 35 moreover the mgo nps were observed to comprise the heterogeneous mixtures of octagonal nano sheets connected to each other fig 3b the microstructural properties were observed to be the same in different magnifications and this corroborates what has been reported in literature 1 furthermore the nanocomposite was observed to comprise leafy like and octagonal nano sheets sandwiched together as a heterogeneous mixture fig 3c lastly the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite amd resultant sludge was observed to comprise rod like and nanosheets blended to each other in a heterogeneous fashion the results confirm the microstructural transformation of the material and this confirms that there is deposition of new mineral phases to the sludge from amd fig 3d this further corroborates the removal and dissolution of contaminants from amd the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite amd resultant sludge interaction the results were the same in all the magnification 3 3 3 elemental distribution mapping using eds to further corroborate the xrf and the sem eds results regarding the elemental compositions of the examined solid samples elemental distribution mapping was also carried out using the fe sem instrument s eds capabilities results are shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 a the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite comprised mg si al o and ca as dominant elements along with minute levels of s ti and fe the elements were fairly distributed across the surface hence confirming their predominance moreover the distribution of these elements on the surface of the material further confirms the genesis of this nanocomposite the obtained results correspond to what has been reported in the xrf and eds furthermore the resultant sludge produced from the interaction of metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite with amd fig 4b comprised o si al fe s ca and mg as major elements traces of na were observed to be present the obtained results are congruent to what has been predicted by phreeqc geochemical model where sulphate was removed as gypsum this could be confirmed by the presence of notable levels of ca s and o similar results have been reported in the literature 1 in addition to the gypsum results al fe and o were observed to be present and this could imply the formation of al and fe hydroxide however phreeqc further denoted that these chemical are removed as oxy hydro sulphates metal hydro sulphates and hydroxide amongst others and this could be explained by the presence of o fe and al mg was also observed to be present but this could be linked to the mother material which comprise the metakaolinite and ca rich mgo nps matrices specifically the ca rich mgo nps part lastly the obtained results corroborate what has been reported in the icp ms oes results on the raw and product water quality and this meticulously demonstrate the fate of chemical components post the treatment of real amd with the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite 3 3 4 mineralogical properties the mineralogical compositions and crystal phases of the examined solid samples were identified using xrd and results are shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the crystal mineral phases of the metakaolinite the mgo nps the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite and metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite amd resultant sludge were identified as shown in the peak identification which is assigned to the diffractogram metakaolinite was observed to comprise mullite quartz cristobalite hematite kaolinite rutile and calcite and mgo nps comprise periclase brucite quartz calcite anhydrite and magnesite the composite was observed to comprise minerals which were present in individual materials and they include periclase quartz mullite calcite cristobalite magnesite kaolinite and kieserite the presence of base metals and si species will significantly contribute to the addition of alkalinity and this will aid in the removal of metals through precipitation co precipitation and adsorption as predicted by phreeqc geochemical model specifically the silicate will react with acidity in real amd using ion exchange as a mechanism hence increasing the ph of the product water eqs 7 11 36 7 sioh sio h 8 2 sioh ca 2 2 sioca 2 h 9 sioca m e 2 hoh siom ca 2 2 oh 10 sioh mg 2 siomg h 11 siomg m e 2 hoh siom mg 2 2 oh the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite amd resultant sludge comprised the gypsum cristobalite quartz mullite and kaolinite finally the noisy signal in the spectrogram of the resultant sludge denotes the presence of amorphous phases in its matrix fig 5 furthermore the reaction of the nanocomposite and real amd is in agreement with the xrd eds mapping xrf and phreeqc geochemical modelling results and this could further be explained by the following equations 37 12 cao h 2 o ca oh 2 13 mgso 4 ca oh 2 mg oh 2 caso 4 the presence of kaolinite mullite quartz and cristobalite demonstrate the chemical stability of the synthesized nanocomposite lastly the disappearance of periclase calcite and magnesite confirms the alkalinity in the product water as explained in eqs 2 3 3 3 5 functional groups finally the ftir spectrums and elemental compositions of the solid samples were also identified along with their functional groups and wavenumbers cm 1 results of a the metakaolinite b the mgo nps c the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite and d the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite amd resultant sludge are shown in fig 6 i and ii as shown in fig 6i a d the obtained ftir results corroborates the xrf xrd eds sem and phreeqc geochemical modelling results in a nutshell it appears that the use of the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite can act as an innovative avenue for the treatment of real amd therefore with this hybrid co treatment method the effective management of real amd from coal mining can be achieved while water could also be reclaimed using polishing technologies this is of particularly importance for south africa and other countries and areas that are affected by water scarcity and notorious mining activities as shown in fig 6 ii a metakaolinite has al o and si as major elements along with traces of fe ca ti and mg minute levels of k cr and s were also observed in the matrices high al si and o confirms that metakaolinite is an aluminosilicate mineral moreover the used mgo nps comprised mg o and ca as the main components fig 6ii b this confirms that the material is magnesium oxide that is rich in ca hence the name ca rich mgo np the raw metakaolinite and mgo nps were used for the synthesis of metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite fig 6ii c the nanocomposite was observed to comprise elements that predominates individual materials and they include mg o si al ca and fe exchangeable base cations such as na and k were observed to be present in the matrices of the material the results corroborate the xrf results however after contacting amd fig 6ii d the level of fe s ca was observed to have increased hence confirming the formation of fe hydroxide metals oxy hydrosulphate and gypsum as predicted by the phreeqc geochemical model mg si and al were observed to have decrease hence denoting dissolution leaching of these chemical species from the matrices and inter layers of the nanocomposite this could be confirmed by their increase in the product water as reported by icp ms oes and elevated electrical conductivity ms cm of the treated water findings obtained in this study further confirm that the synthesized nanocomposite has the ability to scavenge contaminants from real amd and this could be confirmed by their fate as confirmed by multiple tools such as the icp ms xrf sem eds and phreeqc geochemical model 4 estimation of the saturation indices sis the results for the estimation of mineral precipitation during the treatment of real amd with the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite are presented in table 3 as shown in table 3 elements existed as di valents tri valents oxyanions and complexes including carbonates in aqueous solution the carbonates could also be linked to atmospheric interactions during the treatment of real amd with the synthesized nanocomposite however after contacting the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite variety of minerals were observed to be formed as predicted by phreeqc geochemical model thenceforth the obtained mineral is congruent to what has been reported in ftir xrd xrf and hr fib sem eds including amorphous phases that could not be detected using xrd since its capability are limited to crystalline phases lastly the obtained results further corroborate what has been reported in the literature 17 19 5 conclusions and recommendations this study successfully proved the feasibility of mechanochemically synthesizing the metakaolinite ca rich mgo nanocomposite and its application for effective treatment of real amd from coal mining activities the obtained results were underpinned using the state of the art analytical techniques and instruments such as ftir hr fib sem eds xrf and xrd the ph redox equilibrium in c language phreeqc was employed to complement experimental results optimum conditions were observed to be 45 60 min of mixing time 10 g l 1 of feedstock dosage i e nanocomposite and ambient temperature and ph the metal content fe mn cr cu ni pb al and zn embedded in real amd matrices was practically depleted 99 removal and sulphate so₄2 greatly reduced 50 phreeqc predicted metals to exist as mono di and tri valents including variety of chemical complexes and carbonates and they precipitated as metals hydroxides oxy hydroxides carbonates and oxy hydro sulphates this synergistic treatment approach holds great promise for the sustainable management of real amd effluents from coal mining activities and can provide a simple and effective solution for its management thenceforth softening and filtration technologies will need to be coupled to this process to further enhance the reclamation of drinking and to explore possible recovery of valuable minerals from the generated sludge

the ntp process however to the best of the authors knowledge one of the most crucial determinants of ntp the energy yield has not been systematically assessed herein a comprehensive review of recent research findings provided and the systems reported in the literature have been reviewed and compared in addition the factors influencing the ntp oxidation systems such as the effect of the applied voltage and frequency pollutants initial concentration output power ph and conductivity of the solution time of discharge and removal efficiency were also reviewed and presented in this work we confirmed that even though ntp degradation of sops can be very effective to improve the performance and energy yield of ntp its coupling with other catalytic processes should be attempted furthermore it was evidenced that the energy yield was considerably greater for the catalytic ntp technique than for the single ntp up to x600 times more synergistic hence future works should aim toward this direction and overcome the catalyst related challenges keywords non thermal plasma contaminants of emerging concern water treatment energy yield catalysis abbreviations ntp non thermal plasma sops

used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as a result of the anthropogenic activities of modern times synthetic organic pollutants sops such as pharmaceuticals dyes pesticides and other persistent compounds have been detected in aquatic environments by numerous studies 1 6 besides urban and agriculture runoffs groundwaters are considered to be the most significant sop receptors 7 10 sops remain in treated effluents released into bodies of water since common physicochemical and biological sewage treatment methods cannot wholly remove these compounds 11 therefore it is greatly important to remove the sops in the water and wastewater to protect human health and the environment 12 numerous methods such as adsorption coagulation membrane separation osmosis photocatalysis ion exchange chemical oxidation catalysis and electrochemical technique etc have turned out to be research hotspots for various applications several of these methods might be effective but are exclusive and tough to practice for instance adsorption process cannot show the complete elimination of contaminates and produces secondary pollutants 13 15 moreover hydrolysis and photolysis as another degradation pathways of pesticides might generate toxic chemicals and pose threats to the environment 16 over recent years novel approaches in particular solutions utilizing advanced oxidation processes aops have received remarkable attention in the treatment of water polluted by sops that are non biodegradable and harmful to the environment 17 20 today among the aops non thermal plasma ntp technology is progressively considered a remarkable technique in the field of water treatment 21 25 ntp includes a lot of high energy particles which facilitate degradation of sops along with a demonstration of high removal efficiency simple operation and eco friendly aspects this technology not only changes the phase of the contaminant e g adsorption but also eliminates sops which is a unique advantage 26 moreover it has been shown that ntp reactors offer significant modifications that conventional water treatment processes cannot provide including quick interaction with sops compatibility with established treatment processes energy yield and low capital costs 27 the rapid growth of research on the use of plasma systems in water treatment has led researchers to focus on the technical and energy characteristics of these systems the results of previous studies indicated that the evaluation of the energy aspects of advanced aops especially plasma based systems should be considered as one of the basic criteria for judging their performance and effectiveness 28 31 furthermore a key point that plasma researchers concurred on was that the effectiveness of plasma systems in removing aqueous pollutants should be considered by calculating the energy efficiency concepts 32 33 this need stems from the amount of electrical energy required in these systems i e from the applied voltage which ranges from about a few kilovolts to several tens of kilovolts and generally it is agreed upon that the high energy consumption of these systems is one of the obstacles to their development which has been reported in previous studies 34 35 as the available number of experimental ntp studies grows specialized thematic reviews that elucidate and summarize key aspects toward of development of better technology are required and this fact has become apparent in the use of plasma in water treatment to fulfill this knowledge gap we previously conducted a review study 36 on a category of plasma systems the application of dielectric barrier discharge dbd catalysts however the existence of a wide range of experimental studies and the importance of energy issues have revealed a research gap in the field of the energy yield of ntp systems additionally former review studies including ntp technology have addressed chemical and physical interaction performance efficiency and environmental applications of the ntp process 36 41 besides to the best of the author s knowledge there is no review study on the energy aspects of ntp technologies for the treatment of water pollutants therefore the present review focuses on ntp reactors used for water treatment and the critical aspects of energy yield as well as provides insight on the so called synergistic effect of catalysts and ntp which is unclear and an in depth review that would explain these issues is still lacking moreover for the first time and on a large scale this study collected data on the energy yield of different types of ntp reactors and provided an in depth discussion on the energy yield of these systems to evaluate the effects of process factors on this efficiency to better address the specific objectives and present the overall research field the relevant literature of peer reviewed papers was determined by applying preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma based method 42 and inclusion criteria 2 method the method of review and synthesis is broadly based on the methodology of systematic literature review systematic reviews comply with a variety of scientific approaches that clearly attempt to restrict systematic error especially by attempting to identify appraise and synthesize all relevant studies 43 systematic reviews were originally developed in the field of medicine but have now become a recognized tool for other fields of study including environmental science research 44 the detailed steps followed in the review are described below 2 1 search strategy a comprehensive search was conducted electronically to identify published papers dealing with the energy yield of ntp technologies for sops removal from water until october 2022 the search was conducted in three categories of sources including web of science pubmed and scopus search terms were included in two conceptual categories energy and ntp applications in water the first category of search terms on energy included terms like energy yield energy consumption energy efficiency etc the second category i e on ntp applications in water included terms like dielectric barrier discharge dbd pulsed plasma discharge gliding arc discharge non thermal plasma water aqueous and solution search queries were carefully designed to include both these conceptual categories to ensure that the search was comprehensive and yet revealed only the relevant results see supplementary materials 2 2 screening and selection of studies a two stage screening of all the search results was carried out first stage screening was done on title and abstract where documents were screened and based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria english publications studies from the field of water and wastewater studies research papers and research papers that discussed energy yield were included documents that were shortlisted after the first stage screening were screened in the second stage based on their full text the same criteria of inclusion and exclusion were applied in both stages of screening papers that were shortlisted after second stage screening were included for data extraction and synthesis fig 1 shows the result of the prisma search and screening processes 3 ntp fundamentals and sop degradation mechanisms plasma is known as the fourth state of matter that comprises partial or fully ionized gas it also contains a significant portion of charged particles such as ions and or electrons 45 electromagnetic forces and thermal energy can ionize gas molecules 46 this ionized gas includes a diverse variety of active particles including electrons molecules in their basic or energized states gas atoms free radicals and charged ions 47 48 based on the relative temperature between electrons ions and neutrals plasmas can be classified as thermal equilibrium thermal plasma and nonthermal equilibrium non thermal plasma 49 in thermal equilibrium plasma the electron temperature te ion temperature ti and neutral temperature tn are all the same values on the contrary the energy transfer between light electrons and heavy particles ions and neutrals is inefficient in ntp and the power introduced to plasma influences electrons therefore the electron temperature te is significantly higher than that of ions ti and neutrals tn indicating that te ti tn 36 regarding the phase of plasma discharging there are three main types as follows a plasma discharge above a liquid surface b direct plasma discharge inside a liquid solution and c plasma discharge in gas bubbles in liquid water 50 in the case of plasma generated above the liquid the quantity of plasma produced depends on the gas electrical discharge which is caused by the equivalent decomposition energy of the atmospheric gas 51 however the existence of the liquid layer acts as an electrode and changes both the plasma discharge features and the chemical reactions that appear at the gas liquid boundary the explanation for this is that the discharge current is carried ionically which has considerably lower movement than electrons in hard state matters furthermore water contributes with a lot lower secondary electron emission potential compared to other metals and is more prone to be split and evaporate 52 on the other hand the gas liquid plasma produced can initiate numerous bulk phase reactions in a liquid significantly oxidative agents e g o3 oh o produced at the gas liquid interface will diffuse in water and start the oxidation processes 53 the way for direct plasma is formed in liquid is highly complex because liquids are denser than gases 54 in the case of direct plasma discharge inside a liquid solution the electrical currents are transferred by heavy ions in the liquid solution that is intensely impressed with liquid conductivity 50 55 plasma discharges in gas bubbles in liquid water are fully restricted by the solution molecules that act instead of an electrode typically the plasma discharges into water vapor bubbles can be classified as this type the essential chemical concepts of this plasma discharge are mostly analogous to that of the gas phase discharge coupled with the water layer as an electrode 56 nevertheless plasma in a bubble possesses a high reaction medium of gas and solution expanding the performance for gaseous agents dispersed into the solution and requiring less energy to produce the plasma than immediately in the solution 57 these mentioned plasma discharges present a broad spectrum of distinct discharge characteristics and great differences in the thermal condition of gas and electron 58 to further illustrate these aspects the key points related to electrical discharges are discussed below 3 1 formation of hydroxyl radical the dynamic interactions of water molecules with electrical discharge result in producing oh and h through hydrolysis ionization and vibrational charged solution molecules as shown in fig 2 59 as an example pulsed plasma generates charged particles owning energy levels of approximate 5 20 ev which can start the reactions of vibrationally charged solution molecules with energy 1 ev splitting of water with energy up to 7 ev and auto dissociation of water energy 13 ev as illustrated in fig 2 the energized water molecules have vibrationally rotationally shifted to a lower energy condition allowing the production of certain radical species 59 60 oh radicals are known as the essential oxidants that influence most oxidation processes in aop water purification their interactions with organic molecules are usually classified into three types of pathways hydrogen atom extraction oxidizing inclusion to conjugated double bonds and redox reactions 61 referring to hydrocarbons containing at least one double bond or alcohols hydrogen atom transfer is essential for sop s remediation with yielding water 62 same as olefins or aromatic hydrocarbons the oh addition in single bonds of carbon atoms of organic compounds can create carbon centered radicals with an oh functional group at the alpha carbon atom furthermore reduction of oh to oh by an organic molecule is significantly important when hydrogen abstraction or electrophilic addition processes are hampered via simultaneous halogen replacement or non bonding interactions 63 3 2 formation of oxygen agents as oxygen molecules contact with plasma discharge oxygen atoms can be produced through disjunction of o2 as well as enhances the production of oh as below 64 1 o h 2 o 2 ho moreover the o atom may also directly interact with pollutants as well as participate in the reactions that help in the development of o3 generation when combined with o2 65 as a highly oxidizing allotropic source of o2 o3 behaves better after it serves as an energy transfer acceptor to initiate subsequent reactions 66 in neutral solutions or pure water o3 breaks down across a cyclic chain process to create oh 66 in addition o3 may react with ho2 as follows with the existence of h2o2 in the plasma device 67 2 h 2 o 2 h h o 2 3 o 3 h o 2 o 2 oh o 2 3 3 formation of hydrogen peroxide the diffusion of oh is limited due to its short lifetime 3 7 10 9s 68 hence an enduring plasma agent h2o2 can be generated using the recombination of oh particularly in the instances of submerged plasmas most organic compounds do not greatly interact with h2o2 with a noticeable effect in water treatment due to its low oxidation potential nonetheless h2o2 boosts the plasma s bilateral ionizability and has an important impact on plasma chemistry 69 hence significant oh amounts may be produced directly or indirectly in the presence of h2o2 by different reactions e g dissociation photolysis and catalytic reactions 3 4 formation of reductive species besides the contribution of oxidizing agents to sops removal the existence of reducing agents formed at plasma discharge generated the pathways in which water pollutants are eliminated through reductive removal mechanisms 38 among reducing agents aqueous electrons are produced by irradiating high capacity electrons inside water due to the high electron affinity of the aqueous electron it acts as a core function in the removal of sops 70 furthermore hydrogen radicals are created immediately by the electron impact with water molecules and as a result of the reaction of hydrated electrons with acids 71 on the other hand the hydrogen radicals are known as reducing species which undertake two broad groups of interactions with sops a h complement to insatiable bond and b h disjunction saturated molecules 71 3 5 generation and emission of uv light as the product of the exciting species relaxation in lower energic states produced by interactions between electrons and neutral molecules all plasmas including saturated solutions present uv light emissions when an sop molecule m is exposed to uv radiation it absorbs radiation and is induced into a higher energy level m it can be then noted that the process of degradation of organic molecules has begun 72 4 m hv m products the uv photons not just degrade organic compounds photolytically through uv light but also separate the h2o2 and o3 there leading to the production of oh in the plasma system in exchange these additional hydroxyl radicals eliminate toxins and thereby improve the use of power energy inputs 4 types of ntp systems reported in the literature 4 1 dielectric barrier discharge dielectric barrier discharge dbd is non thermodynamic low pressure plasma or atmospheric plasma in which the temperature of electrons is significantly greater than heavy particle temperatures the low operating costs because of the reduced gas and energy demands are the most characteristic aspects of dbd other benefits are the welterweight and the potential for dbd integration close to other compartments dbd discharges are generally regarded as suitable for many uses as a high electron 1 10 ev energy is available when the gas is maintained at room temperature 73 in this type of discharge the energy available is dependent on the use of electrical obstacles such as quartz added to electrodes in the discharge gaps with alterable voltages utilized to the electrodes which have provided the possibility to prevent the development of spark plants terminate electromechanical corrosion and almost uniformly distribute the discharge over the whole electrode field 74 in dbd devices several configurations can be made usually planar using dielectric or cylindric distinctions spaced parallel plates or using coaxial plates between them with a dielectric tube 75 various dbd structures have been developed to meet the specifications of different applications as seen in fig 3 typically the widely utilized dbd configurations can be subdivided into volume based discharge dbd volumes 76 surface based discharge dbd surface settings 76 and dbd capillary settings 77 depending on the general structure actual discharge location and electrodes volume discharges are discharges that are inflamed between the electrodes in an enclosed space fig 3a b while still on the barrier surface the discharge exists fig 3c 78 in the case of half dbd a simple discharge is induced and superimposed on dbd as one electrode has direct contact with the plasma for a half cycle the superimposed direct discharge will result in sputtering and possible pollution by the electrode material to the plasma where higher voltages are provided 79 in addition the chemical inactivity of the glass plate has the advantage of elementary spectrometry to prevent the accumulation of the surface of the material analytes a cylindrical dbd reactor comprises a circular stainless steel rod a dielectric barrier of quartz glass with a specific internal and outside radius and a ground electrode as shown in fig 3 d the cylindric dbd system comprises primarily a focal electrode and a second concurrent electrode with a minimum dial barrier tube with a cylindrical dial 80 the cylindrical dbd structure fig 3b can create a sealed voluminous discharge area which makes it useful for gas conversion and plasma catalytic processes applications this surface discharge sparks the surface barrier and spreads across the surface fig 3c due to micro scale and excellent analytical results the capillary dbd was identified in several sectors in particular for analytical chemistry 80 81 the commonly utilized dbd capillary in the loop pin ring or single pin configurations is shown in fig 3d for the dbd ring and pin ring various plasmas including plasma jets early plasma and plasma coincident are produced during a positive discharge period 82 initially the earliest plasma is produced within the capillary and the plasma jet at its outlet accompanied by the plasma coincidence between the two electrodes the plasma that presents at the same time has more dissociative than the early plasma or plasma jet 77 83 4 2 pulsed plasma discharge pulsed plasma discharge or pulsed corona discharge is formed in a needle electrode in which the electrical setup is attached to the high voltage terminal such as tips pinpoints or thin wires and a plate electrode is grounded as is illustrated in fig 4 84 some materials have been used as an electrode in pulsed plasma discharge like titanium copper and ceramic coated stainless steel 85 the pulseless mechanism in the plasma discharge will produce a strong electric flux in the gaseous phase or aqueous phase from dc electric discharge 86 consequently many chemical oxidation products are generated the discharge of h2o2 and o3 as key chemical active molecules occurs in air or oxygen bubbling into water 87 the compaction of oh and o radicals produced depends upon the existence of the bubbled gas as stated in different studies 88 as opposed to the pulsed plasma discharge the dc corona system has the benefit of steady radical agent formation but the drawback of high energy consumption is due to its continuous operation 63 4 3 gliding arc discharge conventional ntps cannot supply increased electron temperatures high electron densities and extremely non equilibrium structures simultaneously 89 numerous chemical plasma systems require a high degree of non equilibrium of plasma flow as well as a high level of strength plasma sprayed high power will contribute to increased reactor efficiency while non equilibrium circumstances need reaction affinity 90 as a result it is critical to integrate the profits of thermal plasma and ntps that can be utilized for wide ranging environmental pollution control fuel conversion and hydrogen processing gliding arc discharge can possess both thermal plasma and ntp characteristics 91 92 gliding arc discharge has a moderately high electron density and shows a strongly non equilibrium nature as a result gliding arc discharge is very effective for the abovementioned applications the temperature of plasma discharge immediately drops to gas temperature and the plasma conductivity remains high approximately te 1 ev following this passage the gliding arc discharge evolution fig 5 begins in unbalanced environments t gas te 93 5 energy and performance evaluation of ntp systems reported in the literature literature offers a variety of ntp reactors that have been studied for water treatment accordingly many researchers have reported fast and effective degradation of sops during utilizing a variety of ntp reactors to compare the said body of knowledge the performance of the most used ntp reactors in the removal of sops from water is summarized in table 1 in addition the energy yield of ntp technologies was presented in both units of g kwh and mmol kwh for better comparison in general investigating the situation of plasma in water treatment revealed that the attempts carried out to improve the efficiency of the ntp technologies were focused on energy aspects which aim to accomplish efficient use of energy and enhance water remediation based on the findings reported in table 1 dbd and pdp reactors were the most widely used while gad reactors were only evaluated in a few cases to remove organic pollutants as shown in table 1 on average dbd reactors were able to remove 74 and ppd reactors about 75 2 of studied sops from water in terms of energy yield dbd reactors had an average rate of 14 7 mmol kwh and ppd reactors had 97 06 mmol kwh further analysis showed that the range of removal efficiency changes in dbd and ppd reactors were 50 to 100 and 59 to 100 respectively in the case of energy yield the energy yield changes for dbd and ppd were from 0 001 to 132 244 mmol kwh and 0 036 to 196 16 mmol kwh respectively of course it should be noted here that gad reactors have generally been reported in studies of disinfection and the inactivation of bacteria in aqueous environments 94 97 these studies were excluded as out of the scope of the present study sops from these results it can be stated that the ppd configuration has a functional advantage and better energy efficiency than the dbd configuration in removing emerging organic pollutants from aquatic environments the results of this review study were consistent with the results of the study of malik et al in which the relative energy yields of several ntp reactors used for removing organic dyes have been presented the results of malik s study showed that ppd reactors have more relative energy efficiencies than dbd reactors for organic compounds removal from water 98 examining the ntp systems used in the literature revealed the reason for the superiority of pdp over dbd in energy efficiency and removal efficiency the highest energy yield for pdp reactors was achieved because spraying of treated water has been done in the discharge zone of pdp reactors 38 54 58 based on this effect the contact surface of the water droplets with the oxidizing agents in the plasma charge is increased thus providing a higher yield of oxidation of organic compounds than the amount of energy entering the system 125 as a result the amount of energy yield per unit of input energy increases regardless of the types of ntp reactors the issue of carrier gas is also one of the factors affecting the removal efficiency and energy yield of these systems herein pure oxygen and air as commonly employed gases for the ntp treatment of sops from water are discussed there are some other carrier gases including argon 126 and nitrogen 127 but they have very limited application and hence are not discussed here therefore the descriptive analysis of the removal efficiency and energy yield of ntp was calculated based on the carrier gas the results of this section showed that the range of the removal efficiencies of studied sops from the water was 50 to 100 when the gases carried were oxygen or air the median value of the removal efficiency results had 84 5 and 73 respectively for oxygen and air as a gas carrier moreover the obtained range of energy yield was 0 03 to 196 16 mmol kwh with a median value of 4 08 mmol kwh for oxygen and 0 001 3 7 mmol kwh with a median value of 3 70 mmol kwh for air as a gas carrier from the above mentioned evaluation it can be concluded that when the ntp system is operated with oxygen gas it has better performance and higher energy yield than air which is in line with previous research in this field previously the effects of carrier gas on the efficiency of plasma systems on the degradation of sops have been evaluated by researchers 98 128 130 these works indicated that the use of high purity oxygen gas has more advantages over nitrogen gas and air in terms of its ability to ionize and form a thicker mass of oxidizing agents for example as shown in reddy et al s study oxygen bubbling indicated better degradation efficiency than single air and argon gas in a dbd reactor 128 however lewis et al reported the opposite in the gad reactor they observed that higher amounts of the destruction of sops were obtained when the air was used as a plasma carrier instead of oxygen and nitrogen 130 generally discharging into a gas liquid interface the characteristics and types of the gas carrier will impact the creation of gaseous species which in turn will be transmitted through the liquid 131 another point is that the smaller the thickness of the air water interface in liquid gas discharge plasmas will result in the higher the energy yield of the systems this point was observed experimentally in the study of vácha et al 132 the main three electrode geometries employed in literature are dielectric barrier discharge dbd pulsed discharge plasma pdp and gliding arc discharge gad these geometries have been tested and it was reported that different electrode geometries have distinct effect on plasma removal performance further results indicated that the dbd plasma was superior to pdp and gad plasmas in sops degradation 6 ntp energy yield aspects it is well established within the literature of advanced technologies on environmental applications that a distinction can be made between energy demand and energy yield these dimensions arise from previous reports such as 133 134 assessing the energy efficiency performance of technologies is the first step to functional energy management in environmental purification also the electrical energy demand of water and wastewater treatment to reach required standards could play an essential role in evaluating the performance of related technologies 135 according to the latter aspect the energy yield or energy efficiency is a high related indicator of the quantity of energy consumed by ntp systems consumed for the degradation of sops about the energy required for their operation the energy efficiency of ntp configurations is measured by computing the energy yield needed to break down the pollutant initial concentration as reported by 98 136 and is a key metric to be considered during the treatment of water by ntp systems investigations on the energy yield of ntp devices were experimentally carried out by 100 137 142 energy yield measurement in the ntp systems was conducted considering the working of ntp with a specific carrier gas the initial concentration of pollutants the discharge power requirements the operation time and the ntp removal efficiency besides the pollutants removal efficiency may be better demonstrated by the number of pollutants decomposed per unit of energy the energy yield value has been mostly calculated in the literature using the following equation eq 5 5 y e c 0 v k p t where c0 mg l is the initial concentration of the pollutant v l is the ntp reactor volume k is the ntp degradation efficiency t h is the ntp discharge time and p kw is the discharge power the functional equation enables a comparison of findings among different ntp alternatives and published literature acting as a reference to which all flows in the system are linked the equation allowed the user to recognize the most suitable optimization of the ntp power pollutant concentration relationships in the diversified removal methods eligible for guaranteeing the best energy efficient remediation processes by conserving rational performances 143 however few papers have reported energy yield aspects in mol kwh 144 in the present review study to provide a suitable criterion for better assessment of the ntp energy efficiency concerning the wide range of organic compounds studied all energy data extracted from the papers were converted from g kwh to mmol kwh previous studies have developed quantitative analysis based on performance modeling for the evaluation of energy parameters such as the discharge power and the energy yield to address the ntp energy yield analysis the input energy and energy yield values from ntp publications were reviewed and gathered table 2 as can be seen in table 2 the target compound ntp type voltage frequency power and water quality were the defining parameters which influence energy yield and removal efficiency within the ntp process several authors have shown that the ntp performance plays a decisive role in achieving the system energy yield according to previous works 101 108 113 145 146 the ntp removal rate is the key factor in increasing the yield of energy while a low removal rate inhibits the yield contrary to that note in a previous study it was found that the energy yield decreased as a function of time with decreasing the ntp degradation rate 147 the presence of fragmented molecules and by products that compete with target molecules have been identified as other factors limiting energy yield because of their competitive reactions occurring between themselves or with their parent compounds in a study by hama aziz et al acetic acid and oxalic acid were considered by products of diclofenac and ibuprofen degradation this work showed that although complete degradation of diclofenac and ibuprofen by ozonation and dbd were achieved however a considerable number of acetate and oxalate remained as intermediates this is especially important for the ozonation process in which the energy yield was evaluated as higher than dbd 148 ultimately the choice of the treatment technology should account for such aspects 6 1 effect of applied voltage and frequency the energy efficiency of the pollutant s degradation by ntp processes depends on the energy input which in turn relates to applied voltage and frequency 149 the effect of the applied voltage and frequency on the energy yield has been studied in several works these works have showed that the sops removal processes are accelerated by increasing voltage frequency and applied voltage hence the sops removal reactions are activated by the increase in frequency and voltage however some studies have shown that the energy yield is decreased by increasing the applied voltage 150 151 in contrast several works indicated that the energy yield increased when the applied voltage increased 149 152 154 as an objective overarching evaluation the results of applied voltage changes on energy yield in selected studies are shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 with the increase of voltage applied in the ntp degradation system the energy yield of ntp has changed more in methylene blue removal than other pollutants however with increasing voltage from 20 2 to 26 2 kv in the plasma system the energy yield of the ntp system in removing enrofloxacin showed limited change which could be related to the nature of the studied compounds in the case of the applied frequency several studies showed that the energy yield increased with increasing the applied frequency 152 154 however other researchers have depicted that the energy yield decreased with applied frequency increasing 153 the increasing energy yield with increasing applied voltage was justified because by increasing the applied voltage on the ntp system the electric field intensity increases so it should be expected that the rate of dissociation ionization and excitation of liquid or gaseous molecules be enhanced and subsequently the reaction medium filled with a higher quantity of reactive species another discussion focused on this issue that the power plasma discharge may increase the number of reactive plasma species through adjusting energy based factors such as applied voltage and pulse frequency this facilitates the transmission of ntp reactivity to the target solution for treatment contrary to previous explanations zhou et al have reported a decreased energy yield when the applied voltage was further increased to 14 4 kv for alizarin yellow orange ii and methylene blue degradation they reported that a 32 increase in applied voltage could be considered a factor reducing the energy yield of ntp 154 this finding confirms the results of singh et al who indicated that more noticeable energy waste in form of heat may also be caused by the increased applied voltage leading to an energy yield reduction 155 generally at a specially applied voltage the enhanced generation of ntp reactive species does not achieve an upper energy yield therefore for a desirable energy yield it should be considered that both increased applied voltage and frequency lead to two key actions a convert ntp energy to heat energy and b generation of a non negligible percentage of ros or rns which may take over the role of scavengers of ozone and hydroxyl radicals in water and thus reduce energy yield 56 therefore it seems that future studies should be conducted at adjusted or well controlled applied voltage and frequency which are considered the optimum energy based factors of their study finally similarly to the power discharge the input applied voltage as a function of plasma time affects the ntp energy yield the effects of applied voltage on the energy yield of ntp have been evaluated regarding the pollutant s removal efficiency in a study by zhang et al 108 the energy yield decreased slightly from 0 37 mmol kwh to 0 30 mmol kwh as the applied voltage increased from 18 kv to 24 kv however it was observed that the plasma time was reduced by 18 min instead 6 2 effect of initial concentration several attempts have been made to demonstrate the effect of initial pollutant concentration on the energy yield of ntp it has been conclusively shown that the energy yield rises with an increasing initial concentration of pollutants 106 110 149 156 158 the effect of selected sops initial concentration on energy yield is shown in fig 7 as depicted in fig 7 changes in energy yield based on increasing initial concentration have been reported in some compounds high range but in other sops the same effect was very low the highest increase in energy yield 17 17 to 31 08 mmol kwh belonged to the degradation of a soluble azo dye while the lowest changes 0 83 to 0 27 mmol kwh were reported for levofloxacin on the other hand the interaction between the initial concentration of pollutants and the discharge power of ntp on energy efficiency showed that the energy yield increases with higher initial concentrations incorporating the same discharge power and the energy yield reduces with raising discharge power at a constant initial concentration 110 the way initial concentration affects the energy yield is influenced by the removal efficiency a detailed examination showed that with the enhancement of removal efficiency the initial concentration in the ntp system slowly decreases which lowers the feasibility of impacts between pollutant molecules and the ntp reactive species and ultimately results in lower energy yields in the ntp reaction 106 more specifically a gradual decrease in the concentration of target organic matter in the ntp system causes less pollution degradation per unit of energy consumption in the ntp system all papers considered in the present review have reported that the energy yield of the ntp systems increased when the initial concentration of pollutants was increased in general the increase of initial concentration allows an increase of molecules available to the active species produced during the plasma process and as a result the system s energy yield is expected to improve in addition some studies have indicated the association of the energy yield with the nature and concentration of synthetic dye molecules for instance ghodbane et al obtained 111 the energy yield of about 5 76 mmol kwh for acid blue 25 solutions by glow discharge above water however this value was higher than the eosin degradation 0 044 mmol kwh and methylene orange 0 07 mmol kwh and lower than that for removal of rhodamine b 9 77 mmol kwh 98 6 3 effect of output power the effects of discharge power on the energy yield of ntp in water treatment have been evaluated in the literature in the current review two selected studies have examined the changes in output power of the plasma system and its effects on the observed energy yield fig 8 in plasma physics the output power is the amount of energy transferred per unit of time by comparing the diagrams of changes in output power and energy efficiency for both pollutants it can be seen that the energy efficiency decreased with increasing plasma output power to remove cefixime while in glucocorticoids removal the energy yield of plasma reactor was increased with increasing output power previous research has indicated that the energy yield primary increases with the increase of output power until it reaches its peak point and then begins to decline while continuously increasing the plasma discharge time the energy yield decreases with increasing output power to better illustrate these relationships as shown in zhang et al s study 159 the maximum hydroxyl radicals quantity was acquired at 9 2 w energy yield of 2 2 mmol kwh but at the same time the lowest was reported at 3 5 w energy yield of 5 51 mmol kwh suggesting that increased output power would result in a greater number of oh radicals similar conditions were also observed for ozone 159 based on these outcomes it can be further explained that although the higher removal efficiency is obtained with higher output power however it does not necessarily mean increasing energy yield the intervention of the initial concentration of pollutants is another issue in the study of the effects of plasma power on energy yield which was the subject of a study by zhao et al fig 9 they observed that the initial concentration of p nitrophenol of 200mg l and output power of 380 w the energy yield was 2 15mmol kwh in return with an initial concentration of 100mg l and 220 w the energy yield was 0 71 mmol kwh 158 these results show that low input power values with more concentrated contaminant solutions are appropriate for enhancing the energy yield this conclusion is logically explained as follows in lower output power the effective plasma temperature is maintained at normal levels which leads to less energy loss to heat and ultimately increased energy efficiency however the rate of removal decreases because of the lower energetic power the discharge power is another major parameter in the ntp energy yield as reported in previous studies it could be seen that the energy yield decreased as the discharge power increased for instance the energy yield of ntp in ciprofloxacin removal was decreased from 0 021 mmol kwh at 9 8 w to 6 10 3 mmol kwh at 32 6 w after 20 min of plasma discharge 101 the discharge power energy yield analysis has indicated that it was difficult to gather both the high removal efficiency and a better energy yield simultaneously because the increased input power causes increased energy waste like heat 108 6 4 effects of ph and conductivity of the solution the ph and conductivity of the aqueous matrix are important factors that influence ntp degradation in various manners it was reported that the degradation rate of 4 chlorophenol in water with higher conductivity was lower than that of the low conductivity whether catalyst was present in the pulsed discharge plasma process or not 160 an increasing water conductivity along with the plasma discharge has been proved which favors the disproportionation of no2 into no3 and no 113 despite the effects of ph and conductivity of solution are complicated a few recent studies provide indications for the effect of initial ph on energy yield following the number of reactive species generated during the ntp process the pollutant s structural changes and the characteristics of ntp discharge bubbles according to the results of previous studies the maximum energy yield was obtained in acidic ph followed by neutral ph and alkaline ph 111 149 as an illustration jose and philip 149 have indicated an 28 43 mmol kwh of energy yield for chlorobenzene in 6 min and at solution ph 3 while it was only 15 99 mmol kwh at a ph of 12 at lower ph a higher degree of oh radicals are produced and the breakdown of h2o2 consequently is impeded 161 in similarly low ph conditions the liquid bubbles produced during ntp discharge develop into positively charged by adsorbing h ions and as a result they may not merge into larger bubbles accordingly the high number of reactive species produced in ntp bubbles transfer to the solution containing pollutants leading to their rapid breakdown 162 as such the highest energy yield was reported in acidic ph and it was reduced through an increase in the removal rate on the other hand at higher ph the energy yield and removal efficiency reduce which seems to be because of the absorption of oh radical by oh and also the formation of declining species such as electrons in a liquid matrix e 163 6 5 effect of time of discharge one of the most decisive factors in increasing energy yield is plasma discharge time however except for the study of petrović et al 164 this factor was not studied independently in previous studies this study expressed energy yield as the quantities of removed reactive dye g for the used up plasma energy kwh according to the duration of the ntp discharge time the results of petrović et al s study showed that the energy yield decreased at a higher rate from 6 05 to 4 33 mmol kwh in the first 5 min of the plasma process but then the intensity of energy yield decreased 164 the reason for the decrease in the intensity of the declining trend in energy yield over time could be that at the beginning of plasma discharge the kinetic rate of oxidation reactions is very high 165 as the reaction is continued in the ntp reactor the concentration of the target compounds is decreased resulting in diminishing the kinetic and thus downward the trend of energy yield 166 6 6 effect of removal efficiency based on the existing literature what is certain is that there is an inverse relationship between energy yield and the effectiveness of plasma system performance in removing pollutants from aquatic environments regardless of the applied pulse voltage and frequency basically with enhanced removal efficiency the energy yield decreases this was observed ordinarily for the application of the ntp processes for the removal of pollutants from aqueous matrixes 167 depending on circumstances and because of the growth of the removal efficiency the amounts of contaminants that are to be removed are reduced as a result by reducing the output power of the plasma discharge system the energy efficiency will decrease the effect of the type of place where plasma is formed on the energy yield was another point that has been assessed in a few studies while lu et al and jiang et al indicated that the energy yield of 2 4 dichlorophenol removal by glow discharge plasma was about 0 92 mmol kwh 63 168 another study by hama aziz et al 169 demonstrated that the dbd reactor with argon gas has an energy yield of about 19 38 mmol kwh moreover the application of pulsed discharge plasma for 4 chlorophenol degradation with obtained an energy yield of 3 81 mmol kwh at 50 removal efficiency 170 therefore it can be concluded that the plasma formed in the gas liquid zone might be more effective than that of the plasma formed on the liquid interface 7 catalytic ntp energy yield energy consumption is an important factor in assessing the performance and energy yield in ntp applications accordingly it is proposed that ntp devices commonly require coupling with other methods such as catalysis recently a combined process joining ntp and catalysts for improvement of the removal of sops and energy yield has been established 114 137 157 171 173 the recent literature has indicated that this coupling removal technique has reasonable aspects for degrading numerous sops in aqueous environments 114 137 157 171 173 the catalytic materials can improve the performance of the ntp system reducing the time required for degradation and mineralization particularly in presence of catalysts it is possible to achieve a simultaneous degradation and mineralization behavior confirming the low concentration of reaction by products 174 consequently it will be required to establish a proper catalyst to introduce an energy optimized plasma catalytic configuration 114 137 157 171 173 as illustrated in section 2 the energy in the ntp process is mostly transformed into the form of energetic electrons powerful electric fields and uv emissions these effects are regularly followed by the generation of specific reactive molecules such as o3 e 2 07 v and h2o2 e 1 76 v the addition of catalysts notably improves the output of chemical species and their potential in generating oh e 2 80 v has been expected as such many attempts have been made to improve energy yield in ntp by adding catalysts table 3 outlines several case studies of ntp systems for pollutant removal with various catalyst additions as shown in table 3 the energy yield in the catalytic ntp mode was much higher than in the plain ntp process for example ren et al 112 showed that there was an obvious synergy between ntp and coooh in trans ferulic acid degradation and the synergistic strength level obtained 2 76 at a coooh dosage of 0 5 g l at the same time the synergy between coooh and ntp increased the energy yield 10 6 mmol kwh of trans ferulic acid degradation by ntp 3 7 mmol kwh about a 186 rise in the energy yield the effect of catalyst dosage on the energy yield of levofloxacin removal by ntp indicated 106 that the energy yield was increased with increasing catalyst loading for similar catalyst amounts the energy yield was reduced with increasing levofloxacin removal efficiency and plasma time when the catalysts loading was 0 490 g the energy yield was obtained to be 1 5 mmol kwh while the energy yield was reduced to 0 88 mmol kwh at zero catalysts loading according to section 2 the ntp process can generate many powerful oxidizing species which can eliminate high complex pollutants in water through direct or indirect reactions simultaneously uv is also formed during ntp and photocatalysts can be used to make full use of the formed uv and species for the first time in literature in this study a proposition for the calculation of the synergistic effect in the issue of energy yield is provided using the data obtained from previous studies eq 6 was used to quantify the synergistic effect between catalyst and ntp for energy yield enhancement while the new concept of the synergistic effect of some catalysts used in the ntp process was presented in fig 10 6 synergistic effect cat a lytic ntp energy yield ntp energy yield ntp energy yield 100 as shown in fig 10 among the catalysts used in the ntp literature in the present study the tio2 rgo composite and the tio2 fe3o4 composite had maximum 633 3 and minimum effect 31 9 respectively in the ntp degradation process several works have explored ntp systems combined with tio2 based catalysts for example wang et al indicated that the higher energy yield and generation of oxidative species were reached in a pulsed corona discharge system assisted with tio2 176 xin et al 177 observed that the energy yield of ntp on malachite green removal by the ag3po4 tio2 catalyst increased compared to single tio2 nevertheless single tio2 or metallic doped tio2 has restrictions on increased capacity of energy efficiency which have been taken into consideration as the inadequate uv absorption strength and confined recombination ability of the electron hole pairs due to the metallic doping instability 178 therefore graphene oxide go by having high mobility of electrons excessive adsorption surface area high energy converting and superior stability 179 has been loaded on tio2 and was used in combination with ntp zhang et al 150 showed that the dbd energy yield was significantly improved to 0 079 mmol kwh after 18 min of discharge plasma assisted with 0 4 g l tio2 rgo at 18 kv compared with the single dbd 0 99 mmol kwh furthermore results indicated a slight increase in energy yield when the added tio2 rgo in dbd was 0 4 g l this phenomenon can be described by the fact that a high amount of tio2 rgo amplified light scattering and limited uv transmitting which reduced the photocatalytic performance yield as can be seen from table 3 and fig 10 titanium dioxide tio2 has been intensively studied as a catalyst material to remove sops in the catalytic ntp system this photocatalyst has enriched the degradation field with appreciable removal rate but it still lacks some of the crucial characteristics of the semiconductor photocatalysts such as low charge recombination high separation and high redox ability 180 surface properties of photocatalyst materials in the photocatalytic process is another important issue that has a significant impact on the catalytic performance as reported by 181 the addition of silver iodide to the surface of tio2 increased the debromination efficiency of polybrominated diphenyl ethers other studies showed that the efficiency of the photocatalyst can be increased by doping in the following ways bad gap narrowing oxygen vacancies formation of impurity energy levels unique surface area electron trapping etc 182 183 8 conclusions perspectives and outlook different types of ntp systems have been used to deal with pollutants from water indicating a good potential for further application to deal with sops due to the high sop removal effectiveness during the ntp treatment moreover ntp reactors can provide significant advantages which conventional water treatment processes cannot provide including quick interaction with sops compatibility with established treatment processes high energy yield and low capital costs nevertheless the energy yield of the ntp treatment systems is one of the greatest challenges faced in their applications which influences their operating costs and overall performance for the ntp removal of the sops reviewed herein the energy yield was widely diverse in addition to the expected association with the molecular structure noticeable differences among similar works were observed even for the same compound confirming the large influence of the type of ntp design and the experimental conditions gas carrier pollutant initial concentration input energy and water characteristics moreover the evaluation of the energy and performance of ntp systems on the sops degradation has proved that ppd configuration has a functional advantage and better energy efficiency than dbd configuration in removing sops from aquatic environments besides when the ntp system is operated with oxygen gas as the carrier gas it has better performance and higher energy yield than air which is in line with previous works our ntp energy yield aspects analysis indicated that it can be heavily influenced by several factors including applied voltage and pulse frequency initial pollutant concentration output power ph and conductivity of a solution time of plasma discharge catalyst adding and removal efficiency the energy yield demonstrated a dual character either increasing or decreasing with the applied voltage and applied frequency however the energy yield always improves with an increasing initial concentration of pollutants within some limits in the case of the ntp output power the energy yield primary increases with the increase of output power until it reaches its peak point and then begins to decline depending on the predominant oxidant species the energy yield in both acidic and alkaline environments can reach high levels moreover the catalytic ntp energy yield analysis in the present study confirmed that even though ntp degradation of sops can be very effective to increase the energy yield and decrease the reaction time many types of catalysts have been used for the degradation of sops our analysis evidenced that the energy yield was significantly higher for the catalytic ntp process than single ntp however the fundamental studies aiming to enhance the ntp catalytic system have mainly focused on the synergistic effect between the plasma and the catalyst among the catalysts used in the ntp literature the tio2 rgo composite and the tio2 fe3o4 composite had maximum and minimum effect respectively in the ntp degradation process we have to underline here that identifying a suitable catalyst based on the synergistic effect on energy efficiency is still a major challenge finally the available literature has generally considered reaction mechanisms and performance of ntps whereas the energy yield of ntps has been severely less investigated to bring ntp as near as possible to the field more comparative examinations will be required which consider the energy yield of ntp as the key factor to implementation declaration of

12643,non thermal plasma ntp is a novel oxidation method for water and wastewater treatment which involves the interaction among free oxidative species ultraviolet light and synthetic organic pollutants sops so far former review studies including the use of ntp technology for sops removal have only addressed the chemical interaction performance efficiency and environmental applications of the ntp process however to the best of the authors knowledge one of the most crucial determinants of ntp the energy yield has not been systematically assessed herein a comprehensive review of recent research findings provided and the systems reported in the literature have been reviewed and compared in addition the factors influencing the ntp oxidation systems such as the effect of the applied voltage and frequency pollutants initial concentration output power ph and conductivity of the solution time of discharge and removal efficiency were also reviewed and presented in this work we confirmed that even though ntp degradation of sops can be very effective to improve the performance and energy yield of ntp its coupling with other catalytic processes should be attempted furthermore it was evidenced that the energy yield was considerably greater for the catalytic ntp technique than for the single ntp up to x600 times more synergistic hence future works should aim toward this direction and overcome the catalyst related challenges keywords non thermal plasma contaminants of emerging concern water treatment energy yield catalysis abbreviations ntp non thermal plasma sops

used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as a result of the anthropogenic activities of modern times synthetic organic pollutants sops such as pharmaceuticals dyes pesticides and other persistent compounds have been detected in aquatic environments by numerous studies 1 6 besides urban and agriculture runoffs groundwaters are considered to be the most significant sop receptors 7 10 sops remain in treated effluents released into bodies of water since common physicochemical and biological sewage treatment methods cannot wholly remove these compounds 11 therefore it is greatly important to remove the sops in the water and wastewater to protect human health and the environment 12 numerous methods such as adsorption coagulation membrane separation osmosis photocatalysis ion exchange chemical oxidation catalysis and electrochemical technique etc have turned out to be research hotspots for various applications several of these methods might be effective but are exclusive and tough to practice for instance adsorption process cannot show the complete elimination of contaminates and produces secondary pollutants 13 15 moreover hydrolysis and photolysis as another degradation pathways of pesticides might generate toxic chemicals and pose threats to the environment 16 over recent years novel approaches in particular solutions utilizing advanced oxidation processes aops have received remarkable attention in the treatment of water polluted by sops that are non biodegradable and harmful to the environment 17 20 today among the aops non thermal plasma ntp technology is progressively considered a remarkable technique in the field of water treatment 21 25 ntp includes a lot of high energy particles which facilitate degradation of sops along with a demonstration of high removal efficiency simple operation and eco friendly aspects this technology not only changes the phase of the contaminant e g adsorption but also eliminates sops which is a unique advantage 26 moreover it has been shown that ntp reactors offer significant modifications that conventional water treatment processes cannot provide including quick interaction with sops compatibility with established treatment processes energy yield and low capital costs 27 the rapid growth of research on the use of plasma systems in water treatment has led researchers to focus on the technical and energy characteristics of these systems the results of previous studies indicated that the evaluation of the energy aspects of advanced aops especially plasma based systems should be considered as one of the basic criteria for judging their performance and effectiveness 28 31 furthermore a key point that plasma researchers concurred on was that the effectiveness of plasma systems in removing aqueous pollutants should be considered by calculating the energy efficiency concepts 32 33 this need stems from the amount of electrical energy required in these systems i e from the applied voltage which ranges from about a few kilovolts to several tens of kilovolts and generally it is agreed upon that the high energy consumption of these systems is one of the obstacles to their development which has been reported in previous studies 34 35 as the available number of experimental ntp studies grows specialized thematic reviews that elucidate and summarize key aspects toward of development of better technology are required and this fact has become apparent in the use of plasma in water treatment to fulfill this knowledge gap we previously conducted a review study 36 on a category of plasma systems the application of dielectric barrier discharge dbd catalysts however the existence of a wide range of experimental studies and the importance of energy issues have revealed a research gap in the field of the energy yield of ntp systems additionally former review studies including ntp technology have addressed chemical and physical interaction performance efficiency and environmental applications of the ntp process 36 41 besides to the best of the author s knowledge there is no review study on the energy aspects of ntp technologies for the treatment of water pollutants therefore the present review focuses on ntp reactors used for water treatment and the critical aspects of energy yield as well as provides insight on the so called synergistic effect of catalysts and ntp which is unclear and an in depth review that would explain these issues is still lacking moreover for the first time and on a large scale this study collected data on the energy yield of different types of ntp reactors and provided an in depth discussion on the energy yield of these systems to evaluate the effects of process factors on this efficiency to better address the specific objectives and present the overall research field the relevant literature of peer reviewed papers was determined by applying preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma based method 42 and inclusion criteria 2 method the method of review and synthesis is broadly based on the methodology of systematic literature review systematic reviews comply with a variety of scientific approaches that clearly attempt to restrict systematic error especially by attempting to identify appraise and synthesize all relevant studies 43 systematic reviews were originally developed in the field of medicine but have now become a recognized tool for other fields of study including environmental science research 44 the detailed steps followed in the review are described below 2 1 search strategy a comprehensive search was conducted electronically to identify published papers dealing with the energy yield of ntp technologies for sops removal from water until october 2022 the search was conducted in three categories of sources including web of science pubmed and scopus search terms were included in two conceptual categories energy and ntp applications in water the first category of search terms on energy included terms like energy yield energy consumption energy efficiency etc the second category i e on ntp applications in water included terms like dielectric barrier discharge dbd pulsed plasma discharge gliding arc discharge non thermal plasma water aqueous and solution search queries were carefully designed to include both these conceptual categories to ensure that the search was comprehensive and yet revealed only the relevant results see supplementary materials 2 2 screening and selection of studies a two stage screening of all the search results was carried out first stage screening was done on title and abstract where documents were screened and based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria english publications studies from the field of water and wastewater studies research papers and research papers that discussed energy yield were included documents that were shortlisted after the first stage screening were screened in the second stage based on their full text the same criteria of inclusion and exclusion were applied in both stages of screening papers that were shortlisted after second stage screening were included for data extraction and synthesis fig 1 shows the result of the prisma search and screening processes 3 ntp fundamentals and sop degradation mechanisms plasma is known as the fourth state of matter that comprises partial or fully ionized gas it also contains a significant portion of charged particles such as ions and or electrons 45 electromagnetic forces and thermal energy can ionize gas molecules 46 this ionized gas includes a diverse variety of active particles including electrons molecules in their basic or energized states gas atoms free radicals and charged ions 47 48 based on the relative temperature between electrons ions and neutrals plasmas can be classified as thermal equilibrium thermal plasma and nonthermal equilibrium non thermal plasma 49 in thermal equilibrium plasma the electron temperature te ion temperature ti and neutral temperature tn are all the same values on the contrary the energy transfer between light electrons and heavy particles ions and neutrals is inefficient in ntp and the power introduced to plasma influences electrons therefore the electron temperature te is significantly higher than that of ions ti and neutrals tn indicating that te ti tn 36 regarding the phase of plasma discharging there are three main types as follows a plasma discharge above a liquid surface b direct plasma discharge inside a liquid solution and c plasma discharge in gas bubbles in liquid water 50 in the case of plasma generated above the liquid the quantity of plasma produced depends on the gas electrical discharge which is caused by the equivalent decomposition energy of the atmospheric gas 51 however the existence of the liquid layer acts as an electrode and changes both the plasma discharge features and the chemical reactions that appear at the gas liquid boundary the explanation for this is that the discharge current is carried ionically which has considerably lower movement than electrons in hard state matters furthermore water contributes with a lot lower secondary electron emission potential compared to other metals and is more prone to be split and evaporate 52 on the other hand the gas liquid plasma produced can initiate numerous bulk phase reactions in a liquid significantly oxidative agents e g o3 oh o produced at the gas liquid interface will diffuse in water and start the oxidation processes 53 the way for direct plasma is formed in liquid is highly complex because liquids are denser than gases 54 in the case of direct plasma discharge inside a liquid solution the electrical currents are transferred by heavy ions in the liquid solution that is intensely impressed with liquid conductivity 50 55 plasma discharges in gas bubbles in liquid water are fully restricted by the solution molecules that act instead of an electrode typically the plasma discharges into water vapor bubbles can be classified as this type the essential chemical concepts of this plasma discharge are mostly analogous to that of the gas phase discharge coupled with the water layer as an electrode 56 nevertheless plasma in a bubble possesses a high reaction medium of gas and solution expanding the performance for gaseous agents dispersed into the solution and requiring less energy to produce the plasma than immediately in the solution 57 these mentioned plasma discharges present a broad spectrum of distinct discharge characteristics and great differences in the thermal condition of gas and electron 58 to further illustrate these aspects the key points related to electrical discharges are discussed below 3 1 formation of hydroxyl radical the dynamic interactions of water molecules with electrical discharge result in producing oh and h through hydrolysis ionization and vibrational charged solution molecules as shown in fig 2 59 as an example pulsed plasma generates charged particles owning energy levels of approximate 5 20 ev which can start the reactions of vibrationally charged solution molecules with energy 1 ev splitting of water with energy up to 7 ev and auto dissociation of water energy 13 ev as illustrated in fig 2 the energized water molecules have vibrationally rotationally shifted to a lower energy condition allowing the production of certain radical species 59 60 oh radicals are known as the essential oxidants that influence most oxidation processes in aop water purification their interactions with organic molecules are usually classified into three types of pathways hydrogen atom extraction oxidizing inclusion to conjugated double bonds and redox reactions 61 referring to hydrocarbons containing at least one double bond or alcohols hydrogen atom transfer is essential for sop s remediation with yielding water 62 same as olefins or aromatic hydrocarbons the oh addition in single bonds of carbon atoms of organic compounds can create carbon centered radicals with an oh functional group at the alpha carbon atom furthermore reduction of oh to oh by an organic molecule is significantly important when hydrogen abstraction or electrophilic addition processes are hampered via simultaneous halogen replacement or non bonding interactions 63 3 2 formation of oxygen agents as oxygen molecules contact with plasma discharge oxygen atoms can be produced through disjunction of o2 as well as enhances the production of oh as below 64 1 o h 2 o 2 ho moreover the o atom may also directly interact with pollutants as well as participate in the reactions that help in the development of o3 generation when combined with o2 65 as a highly oxidizing allotropic source of o2 o3 behaves better after it serves as an energy transfer acceptor to initiate subsequent reactions 66 in neutral solutions or pure water o3 breaks down across a cyclic chain process to create oh 66 in addition o3 may react with ho2 as follows with the existence of h2o2 in the plasma device 67 2 h 2 o 2 h h o 2 3 o 3 h o 2 o 2 oh o 2 3 3 formation of hydrogen peroxide the diffusion of oh is limited due to its short lifetime 3 7 10 9s 68 hence an enduring plasma agent h2o2 can be generated using the recombination of oh particularly in the instances of submerged plasmas most organic compounds do not greatly interact with h2o2 with a noticeable effect in water treatment due to its low oxidation potential nonetheless h2o2 boosts the plasma s bilateral ionizability and has an important impact on plasma chemistry 69 hence significant oh amounts may be produced directly or indirectly in the presence of h2o2 by different reactions e g dissociation photolysis and catalytic reactions 3 4 formation of reductive species besides the contribution of oxidizing agents to sops removal the existence of reducing agents formed at plasma discharge generated the pathways in which water pollutants are eliminated through reductive removal mechanisms 38 among reducing agents aqueous electrons are produced by irradiating high capacity electrons inside water due to the high electron affinity of the aqueous electron it acts as a core function in the removal of sops 70 furthermore hydrogen radicals are created immediately by the electron impact with water molecules and as a result of the reaction of hydrated electrons with acids 71 on the other hand the hydrogen radicals are known as reducing species which undertake two broad groups of interactions with sops a h complement to insatiable bond and b h disjunction saturated molecules 71 3 5 generation and emission of uv light as the product of the exciting species relaxation in lower energic states produced by interactions between electrons and neutral molecules all plasmas including saturated solutions present uv light emissions when an sop molecule m is exposed to uv radiation it absorbs radiation and is induced into a higher energy level m it can be then noted that the process of degradation of organic molecules has begun 72 4 m hv m products the uv photons not just degrade organic compounds photolytically through uv light but also separate the h2o2 and o3 there leading to the production of oh in the plasma system in exchange these additional hydroxyl radicals eliminate toxins and thereby improve the use of power energy inputs 4 types of ntp systems reported in the literature 4 1 dielectric barrier discharge dielectric barrier discharge dbd is non thermodynamic low pressure plasma or atmospheric plasma in which the temperature of electrons is significantly greater than heavy particle temperatures the low operating costs because of the reduced gas and energy demands are the most characteristic aspects of dbd other benefits are the welterweight and the potential for dbd integration close to other compartments dbd discharges are generally regarded as suitable for many uses as a high electron 1 10 ev energy is available when the gas is maintained at room temperature 73 in this type of discharge the energy available is dependent on the use of electrical obstacles such as quartz added to electrodes in the discharge gaps with alterable voltages utilized to the electrodes which have provided the possibility to prevent the development of spark plants terminate electromechanical corrosion and almost uniformly distribute the discharge over the whole electrode field 74 in dbd devices several configurations can be made usually planar using dielectric or cylindric distinctions spaced parallel plates or using coaxial plates between them with a dielectric tube 75 various dbd structures have been developed to meet the specifications of different applications as seen in fig 3 typically the widely utilized dbd configurations can be subdivided into volume based discharge dbd volumes 76 surface based discharge dbd surface settings 76 and dbd capillary settings 77 depending on the general structure actual discharge location and electrodes volume discharges are discharges that are inflamed between the electrodes in an enclosed space fig 3a b while still on the barrier surface the discharge exists fig 3c 78 in the case of half dbd a simple discharge is induced and superimposed on dbd as one electrode has direct contact with the plasma for a half cycle the superimposed direct discharge will result in sputtering and possible pollution by the electrode material to the plasma where higher voltages are provided 79 in addition the chemical inactivity of the glass plate has the advantage of elementary spectrometry to prevent the accumulation of the surface of the material analytes a cylindrical dbd reactor comprises a circular stainless steel rod a dielectric barrier of quartz glass with a specific internal and outside radius and a ground electrode as shown in fig 3 d the cylindric dbd system comprises primarily a focal electrode and a second concurrent electrode with a minimum dial barrier tube with a cylindrical dial 80 the cylindrical dbd structure fig 3b can create a sealed voluminous discharge area which makes it useful for gas conversion and plasma catalytic processes applications this surface discharge sparks the surface barrier and spreads across the surface fig 3c due to micro scale and excellent analytical results the capillary dbd was identified in several sectors in particular for analytical chemistry 80 81 the commonly utilized dbd capillary in the loop pin ring or single pin configurations is shown in fig 3d for the dbd ring and pin ring various plasmas including plasma jets early plasma and plasma coincident are produced during a positive discharge period 82 initially the earliest plasma is produced within the capillary and the plasma jet at its outlet accompanied by the plasma coincidence between the two electrodes the plasma that presents at the same time has more dissociative than the early plasma or plasma jet 77 83 4 2 pulsed plasma discharge pulsed plasma discharge or pulsed corona discharge is formed in a needle electrode in which the electrical setup is attached to the high voltage terminal such as tips pinpoints or thin wires and a plate electrode is grounded as is illustrated in fig 4 84 some materials have been used as an electrode in pulsed plasma discharge like titanium copper and ceramic coated stainless steel 85 the pulseless mechanism in the plasma discharge will produce a strong electric flux in the gaseous phase or aqueous phase from dc electric discharge 86 consequently many chemical oxidation products are generated the discharge of h2o2 and o3 as key chemical active molecules occurs in air or oxygen bubbling into water 87 the compaction of oh and o radicals produced depends upon the existence of the bubbled gas as stated in different studies 88 as opposed to the pulsed plasma discharge the dc corona system has the benefit of steady radical agent formation but the drawback of high energy consumption is due to its continuous operation 63 4 3 gliding arc discharge conventional ntps cannot supply increased electron temperatures high electron densities and extremely non equilibrium structures simultaneously 89 numerous chemical plasma systems require a high degree of non equilibrium of plasma flow as well as a high level of strength plasma sprayed high power will contribute to increased reactor efficiency while non equilibrium circumstances need reaction affinity 90 as a result it is critical to integrate the profits of thermal plasma and ntps that can be utilized for wide ranging environmental pollution control fuel conversion and hydrogen processing gliding arc discharge can possess both thermal plasma and ntp characteristics 91 92 gliding arc discharge has a moderately high electron density and shows a strongly non equilibrium nature as a result gliding arc discharge is very effective for the abovementioned applications the temperature of plasma discharge immediately drops to gas temperature and the plasma conductivity remains high approximately te 1 ev following this passage the gliding arc discharge evolution fig 5 begins in unbalanced environments t gas te 93 5 energy and performance evaluation of ntp systems reported in the literature literature offers a variety of ntp reactors that have been studied for water treatment accordingly many researchers have reported fast and effective degradation of sops during utilizing a variety of ntp reactors to compare the said body of knowledge the performance of the most used ntp reactors in the removal of sops from water is summarized in table 1 in addition the energy yield of ntp technologies was presented in both units of g kwh and mmol kwh for better comparison in general investigating the situation of plasma in water treatment revealed that the attempts carried out to improve the efficiency of the ntp technologies were focused on energy aspects which aim to accomplish efficient use of energy and enhance water remediation based on the findings reported in table 1 dbd and pdp reactors were the most widely used while gad reactors were only evaluated in a few cases to remove organic pollutants as shown in table 1 on average dbd reactors were able to remove 74 and ppd reactors about 75 2 of studied sops from water in terms of energy yield dbd reactors had an average rate of 14 7 mmol kwh and ppd reactors had 97 06 mmol kwh further analysis showed that the range of removal efficiency changes in dbd and ppd reactors were 50 to 100 and 59 to 100 respectively in the case of energy yield the energy yield changes for dbd and ppd were from 0 001 to 132 244 mmol kwh and 0 036 to 196 16 mmol kwh respectively of course it should be noted here that gad reactors have generally been reported in studies of disinfection and the inactivation of bacteria in aqueous environments 94 97 these studies were excluded as out of the scope of the present study sops from these results it can be stated that the ppd configuration has a functional advantage and better energy efficiency than the dbd configuration in removing emerging organic pollutants from aquatic environments the results of this review study were consistent with the results of the study of malik et al in which the relative energy yields of several ntp reactors used for removing organic dyes have been presented the results of malik s study showed that ppd reactors have more relative energy efficiencies than dbd reactors for organic compounds removal from water 98 examining the ntp systems used in the literature revealed the reason for the superiority of pdp over dbd in energy efficiency and removal efficiency the highest energy yield for pdp reactors was achieved because spraying of treated water has been done in the discharge zone of pdp reactors 38 54 58 based on this effect the contact surface of the water droplets with the oxidizing agents in the plasma charge is increased thus providing a higher yield of oxidation of organic compounds than the amount of energy entering the system 125 as a result the amount of energy yield per unit of input energy increases regardless of the types of ntp reactors the issue of carrier gas is also one of the factors affecting the removal efficiency and energy yield of these systems herein pure oxygen and air as commonly employed gases for the ntp treatment of sops from water are discussed there are some other carrier gases including argon 126 and nitrogen 127 but they have very limited application and hence are not discussed here therefore the descriptive analysis of the removal efficiency and energy yield of ntp was calculated based on the carrier gas the results of this section showed that the range of the removal efficiencies of studied sops from the water was 50 to 100 when the gases carried were oxygen or air the median value of the removal efficiency results had 84 5 and 73 respectively for oxygen and air as a gas carrier moreover the obtained range of energy yield was 0 03 to 196 16 mmol kwh with a median value of 4 08 mmol kwh for oxygen and 0 001 3 7 mmol kwh with a median value of 3 70 mmol kwh for air as a gas carrier from the above mentioned evaluation it can be concluded that when the ntp system is operated with oxygen gas it has better performance and higher energy yield than air which is in line with previous research in this field previously the effects of carrier gas on the efficiency of plasma systems on the degradation of sops have been evaluated by researchers 98 128 130 these works indicated that the use of high purity oxygen gas has more advantages over nitrogen gas and air in terms of its ability to ionize and form a thicker mass of oxidizing agents for example as shown in reddy et al s study oxygen bubbling indicated better degradation efficiency than single air and argon gas in a dbd reactor 128 however lewis et al reported the opposite in the gad reactor they observed that higher amounts of the destruction of sops were obtained when the air was used as a plasma carrier instead of oxygen and nitrogen 130 generally discharging into a gas liquid interface the characteristics and types of the gas carrier will impact the creation of gaseous species which in turn will be transmitted through the liquid 131 another point is that the smaller the thickness of the air water interface in liquid gas discharge plasmas will result in the higher the energy yield of the systems this point was observed experimentally in the study of vácha et al 132 the main three electrode geometries employed in literature are dielectric barrier discharge dbd pulsed discharge plasma pdp and gliding arc discharge gad these geometries have been tested and it was reported that different electrode geometries have distinct effect on plasma removal performance further results indicated that the dbd plasma was superior to pdp and gad plasmas in sops degradation 6 ntp energy yield aspects it is well established within the literature of advanced technologies on environmental applications that a distinction can be made between energy demand and energy yield these dimensions arise from previous reports such as 133 134 assessing the energy efficiency performance of technologies is the first step to functional energy management in environmental purification also the electrical energy demand of water and wastewater treatment to reach required standards could play an essential role in evaluating the performance of related technologies 135 according to the latter aspect the energy yield or energy efficiency is a high related indicator of the quantity of energy consumed by ntp systems consumed for the degradation of sops about the energy required for their operation the energy efficiency of ntp configurations is measured by computing the energy yield needed to break down the pollutant initial concentration as reported by 98 136 and is a key metric to be considered during the treatment of water by ntp systems investigations on the energy yield of ntp devices were experimentally carried out by 100 137 142 energy yield measurement in the ntp systems was conducted considering the working of ntp with a specific carrier gas the initial concentration of pollutants the discharge power requirements the operation time and the ntp removal efficiency besides the pollutants removal efficiency may be better demonstrated by the number of pollutants decomposed per unit of energy the energy yield value has been mostly calculated in the literature using the following equation eq 5 5 y e c 0 v k p t where c0 mg l is the initial concentration of the pollutant v l is the ntp reactor volume k is the ntp degradation efficiency t h is the ntp discharge time and p kw is the discharge power the functional equation enables a comparison of findings among different ntp alternatives and published literature acting as a reference to which all flows in the system are linked the equation allowed the user to recognize the most suitable optimization of the ntp power pollutant concentration relationships in the diversified removal methods eligible for guaranteeing the best energy efficient remediation processes by conserving rational performances 143 however few papers have reported energy yield aspects in mol kwh 144 in the present review study to provide a suitable criterion for better assessment of the ntp energy efficiency concerning the wide range of organic compounds studied all energy data extracted from the papers were converted from g kwh to mmol kwh previous studies have developed quantitative analysis based on performance modeling for the evaluation of energy parameters such as the discharge power and the energy yield to address the ntp energy yield analysis the input energy and energy yield values from ntp publications were reviewed and gathered table 2 as can be seen in table 2 the target compound ntp type voltage frequency power and water quality were the defining parameters which influence energy yield and removal efficiency within the ntp process several authors have shown that the ntp performance plays a decisive role in achieving the system energy yield according to previous works 101 108 113 145 146 the ntp removal rate is the key factor in increasing the yield of energy while a low removal rate inhibits the yield contrary to that note in a previous study it was found that the energy yield decreased as a function of time with decreasing the ntp degradation rate 147 the presence of fragmented molecules and by products that compete with target molecules have been identified as other factors limiting energy yield because of their competitive reactions occurring between themselves or with their parent compounds in a study by hama aziz et al acetic acid and oxalic acid were considered by products of diclofenac and ibuprofen degradation this work showed that although complete degradation of diclofenac and ibuprofen by ozonation and dbd were achieved however a considerable number of acetate and oxalate remained as intermediates this is especially important for the ozonation process in which the energy yield was evaluated as higher than dbd 148 ultimately the choice of the treatment technology should account for such aspects 6 1 effect of applied voltage and frequency the energy efficiency of the pollutant s degradation by ntp processes depends on the energy input which in turn relates to applied voltage and frequency 149 the effect of the applied voltage and frequency on the energy yield has been studied in several works these works have showed that the sops removal processes are accelerated by increasing voltage frequency and applied voltage hence the sops removal reactions are activated by the increase in frequency and voltage however some studies have shown that the energy yield is decreased by increasing the applied voltage 150 151 in contrast several works indicated that the energy yield increased when the applied voltage increased 149 152 154 as an objective overarching evaluation the results of applied voltage changes on energy yield in selected studies are shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 with the increase of voltage applied in the ntp degradation system the energy yield of ntp has changed more in methylene blue removal than other pollutants however with increasing voltage from 20 2 to 26 2 kv in the plasma system the energy yield of the ntp system in removing enrofloxacin showed limited change which could be related to the nature of the studied compounds in the case of the applied frequency several studies showed that the energy yield increased with increasing the applied frequency 152 154 however other researchers have depicted that the energy yield decreased with applied frequency increasing 153 the increasing energy yield with increasing applied voltage was justified because by increasing the applied voltage on the ntp system the electric field intensity increases so it should be expected that the rate of dissociation ionization and excitation of liquid or gaseous molecules be enhanced and subsequently the reaction medium filled with a higher quantity of reactive species another discussion focused on this issue that the power plasma discharge may increase the number of reactive plasma species through adjusting energy based factors such as applied voltage and pulse frequency this facilitates the transmission of ntp reactivity to the target solution for treatment contrary to previous explanations zhou et al have reported a decreased energy yield when the applied voltage was further increased to 14 4 kv for alizarin yellow orange ii and methylene blue degradation they reported that a 32 increase in applied voltage could be considered a factor reducing the energy yield of ntp 154 this finding confirms the results of singh et al who indicated that more noticeable energy waste in form of heat may also be caused by the increased applied voltage leading to an energy yield reduction 155 generally at a specially applied voltage the enhanced generation of ntp reactive species does not achieve an upper energy yield therefore for a desirable energy yield it should be considered that both increased applied voltage and frequency lead to two key actions a convert ntp energy to heat energy and b generation of a non negligible percentage of ros or rns which may take over the role of scavengers of ozone and hydroxyl radicals in water and thus reduce energy yield 56 therefore it seems that future studies should be conducted at adjusted or well controlled applied voltage and frequency which are considered the optimum energy based factors of their study finally similarly to the power discharge the input applied voltage as a function of plasma time affects the ntp energy yield the effects of applied voltage on the energy yield of ntp have been evaluated regarding the pollutant s removal efficiency in a study by zhang et al 108 the energy yield decreased slightly from 0 37 mmol kwh to 0 30 mmol kwh as the applied voltage increased from 18 kv to 24 kv however it was observed that the plasma time was reduced by 18 min instead 6 2 effect of initial concentration several attempts have been made to demonstrate the effect of initial pollutant concentration on the energy yield of ntp it has been conclusively shown that the energy yield rises with an increasing initial concentration of pollutants 106 110 149 156 158 the effect of selected sops initial concentration on energy yield is shown in fig 7 as depicted in fig 7 changes in energy yield based on increasing initial concentration have been reported in some compounds high range but in other sops the same effect was very low the highest increase in energy yield 17 17 to 31 08 mmol kwh belonged to the degradation of a soluble azo dye while the lowest changes 0 83 to 0 27 mmol kwh were reported for levofloxacin on the other hand the interaction between the initial concentration of pollutants and the discharge power of ntp on energy efficiency showed that the energy yield increases with higher initial concentrations incorporating the same discharge power and the energy yield reduces with raising discharge power at a constant initial concentration 110 the way initial concentration affects the energy yield is influenced by the removal efficiency a detailed examination showed that with the enhancement of removal efficiency the initial concentration in the ntp system slowly decreases which lowers the feasibility of impacts between pollutant molecules and the ntp reactive species and ultimately results in lower energy yields in the ntp reaction 106 more specifically a gradual decrease in the concentration of target organic matter in the ntp system causes less pollution degradation per unit of energy consumption in the ntp system all papers considered in the present review have reported that the energy yield of the ntp systems increased when the initial concentration of pollutants was increased in general the increase of initial concentration allows an increase of molecules available to the active species produced during the plasma process and as a result the system s energy yield is expected to improve in addition some studies have indicated the association of the energy yield with the nature and concentration of synthetic dye molecules for instance ghodbane et al obtained 111 the energy yield of about 5 76 mmol kwh for acid blue 25 solutions by glow discharge above water however this value was higher than the eosin degradation 0 044 mmol kwh and methylene orange 0 07 mmol kwh and lower than that for removal of rhodamine b 9 77 mmol kwh 98 6 3 effect of output power the effects of discharge power on the energy yield of ntp in water treatment have been evaluated in the literature in the current review two selected studies have examined the changes in output power of the plasma system and its effects on the observed energy yield fig 8 in plasma physics the output power is the amount of energy transferred per unit of time by comparing the diagrams of changes in output power and energy efficiency for both pollutants it can be seen that the energy efficiency decreased with increasing plasma output power to remove cefixime while in glucocorticoids removal the energy yield of plasma reactor was increased with increasing output power previous research has indicated that the energy yield primary increases with the increase of output power until it reaches its peak point and then begins to decline while continuously increasing the plasma discharge time the energy yield decreases with increasing output power to better illustrate these relationships as shown in zhang et al s study 159 the maximum hydroxyl radicals quantity was acquired at 9 2 w energy yield of 2 2 mmol kwh but at the same time the lowest was reported at 3 5 w energy yield of 5 51 mmol kwh suggesting that increased output power would result in a greater number of oh radicals similar conditions were also observed for ozone 159 based on these outcomes it can be further explained that although the higher removal efficiency is obtained with higher output power however it does not necessarily mean increasing energy yield the intervention of the initial concentration of pollutants is another issue in the study of the effects of plasma power on energy yield which was the subject of a study by zhao et al fig 9 they observed that the initial concentration of p nitrophenol of 200mg l and output power of 380 w the energy yield was 2 15mmol kwh in return with an initial concentration of 100mg l and 220 w the energy yield was 0 71 mmol kwh 158 these results show that low input power values with more concentrated contaminant solutions are appropriate for enhancing the energy yield this conclusion is logically explained as follows in lower output power the effective plasma temperature is maintained at normal levels which leads to less energy loss to heat and ultimately increased energy efficiency however the rate of removal decreases because of the lower energetic power the discharge power is another major parameter in the ntp energy yield as reported in previous studies it could be seen that the energy yield decreased as the discharge power increased for instance the energy yield of ntp in ciprofloxacin removal was decreased from 0 021 mmol kwh at 9 8 w to 6 10 3 mmol kwh at 32 6 w after 20 min of plasma discharge 101 the discharge power energy yield analysis has indicated that it was difficult to gather both the high removal efficiency and a better energy yield simultaneously because the increased input power causes increased energy waste like heat 108 6 4 effects of ph and conductivity of the solution the ph and conductivity of the aqueous matrix are important factors that influence ntp degradation in various manners it was reported that the degradation rate of 4 chlorophenol in water with higher conductivity was lower than that of the low conductivity whether catalyst was present in the pulsed discharge plasma process or not 160 an increasing water conductivity along with the plasma discharge has been proved which favors the disproportionation of no2 into no3 and no 113 despite the effects of ph and conductivity of solution are complicated a few recent studies provide indications for the effect of initial ph on energy yield following the number of reactive species generated during the ntp process the pollutant s structural changes and the characteristics of ntp discharge bubbles according to the results of previous studies the maximum energy yield was obtained in acidic ph followed by neutral ph and alkaline ph 111 149 as an illustration jose and philip 149 have indicated an 28 43 mmol kwh of energy yield for chlorobenzene in 6 min and at solution ph 3 while it was only 15 99 mmol kwh at a ph of 12 at lower ph a higher degree of oh radicals are produced and the breakdown of h2o2 consequently is impeded 161 in similarly low ph conditions the liquid bubbles produced during ntp discharge develop into positively charged by adsorbing h ions and as a result they may not merge into larger bubbles accordingly the high number of reactive species produced in ntp bubbles transfer to the solution containing pollutants leading to their rapid breakdown 162 as such the highest energy yield was reported in acidic ph and it was reduced through an increase in the removal rate on the other hand at higher ph the energy yield and removal efficiency reduce which seems to be because of the absorption of oh radical by oh and also the formation of declining species such as electrons in a liquid matrix e 163 6 5 effect of time of discharge one of the most decisive factors in increasing energy yield is plasma discharge time however except for the study of petrović et al 164 this factor was not studied independently in previous studies this study expressed energy yield as the quantities of removed reactive dye g for the used up plasma energy kwh according to the duration of the ntp discharge time the results of petrović et al s study showed that the energy yield decreased at a higher rate from 6 05 to 4 33 mmol kwh in the first 5 min of the plasma process but then the intensity of energy yield decreased 164 the reason for the decrease in the intensity of the declining trend in energy yield over time could be that at the beginning of plasma discharge the kinetic rate of oxidation reactions is very high 165 as the reaction is continued in the ntp reactor the concentration of the target compounds is decreased resulting in diminishing the kinetic and thus downward the trend of energy yield 166 6 6 effect of removal efficiency based on the existing literature what is certain is that there is an inverse relationship between energy yield and the effectiveness of plasma system performance in removing pollutants from aquatic environments regardless of the applied pulse voltage and frequency basically with enhanced removal efficiency the energy yield decreases this was observed ordinarily for the application of the ntp processes for the removal of pollutants from aqueous matrixes 167 depending on circumstances and because of the growth of the removal efficiency the amounts of contaminants that are to be removed are reduced as a result by reducing the output power of the plasma discharge system the energy efficiency will decrease the effect of the type of place where plasma is formed on the energy yield was another point that has been assessed in a few studies while lu et al and jiang et al indicated that the energy yield of 2 4 dichlorophenol removal by glow discharge plasma was about 0 92 mmol kwh 63 168 another study by hama aziz et al 169 demonstrated that the dbd reactor with argon gas has an energy yield of about 19 38 mmol kwh moreover the application of pulsed discharge plasma for 4 chlorophenol degradation with obtained an energy yield of 3 81 mmol kwh at 50 removal efficiency 170 therefore it can be concluded that the plasma formed in the gas liquid zone might be more effective than that of the plasma formed on the liquid interface 7 catalytic ntp energy yield energy consumption is an important factor in assessing the performance and energy yield in ntp applications accordingly it is proposed that ntp devices commonly require coupling with other methods such as catalysis recently a combined process joining ntp and catalysts for improvement of the removal of sops and energy yield has been established 114 137 157 171 173 the recent literature has indicated that this coupling removal technique has reasonable aspects for degrading numerous sops in aqueous environments 114 137 157 171 173 the catalytic materials can improve the performance of the ntp system reducing the time required for degradation and mineralization particularly in presence of catalysts it is possible to achieve a simultaneous degradation and mineralization behavior confirming the low concentration of reaction by products 174 consequently it will be required to establish a proper catalyst to introduce an energy optimized plasma catalytic configuration 114 137 157 171 173 as illustrated in section 2 the energy in the ntp process is mostly transformed into the form of energetic electrons powerful electric fields and uv emissions these effects are regularly followed by the generation of specific reactive molecules such as o3 e 2 07 v and h2o2 e 1 76 v the addition of catalysts notably improves the output of chemical species and their potential in generating oh e 2 80 v has been expected as such many attempts have been made to improve energy yield in ntp by adding catalysts table 3 outlines several case studies of ntp systems for pollutant removal with various catalyst additions as shown in table 3 the energy yield in the catalytic ntp mode was much higher than in the plain ntp process for example ren et al 112 showed that there was an obvious synergy between ntp and coooh in trans ferulic acid degradation and the synergistic strength level obtained 2 76 at a coooh dosage of 0 5 g l at the same time the synergy between coooh and ntp increased the energy yield 10 6 mmol kwh of trans ferulic acid degradation by ntp 3 7 mmol kwh about a 186 rise in the energy yield the effect of catalyst dosage on the energy yield of levofloxacin removal by ntp indicated 106 that the energy yield was increased with increasing catalyst loading for similar catalyst amounts the energy yield was reduced with increasing levofloxacin removal efficiency and plasma time when the catalysts loading was 0 490 g the energy yield was obtained to be 1 5 mmol kwh while the energy yield was reduced to 0 88 mmol kwh at zero catalysts loading according to section 2 the ntp process can generate many powerful oxidizing species which can eliminate high complex pollutants in water through direct or indirect reactions simultaneously uv is also formed during ntp and photocatalysts can be used to make full use of the formed uv and species for the first time in literature in this study a proposition for the calculation of the synergistic effect in the issue of energy yield is provided using the data obtained from previous studies eq 6 was used to quantify the synergistic effect between catalyst and ntp for energy yield enhancement while the new concept of the synergistic effect of some catalysts used in the ntp process was presented in fig 10 6 synergistic effect cat a lytic ntp energy yield ntp energy yield ntp energy yield 100 as shown in fig 10 among the catalysts used in the ntp literature in the present study the tio2 rgo composite and the tio2 fe3o4 composite had maximum 633 3 and minimum effect 31 9 respectively in the ntp degradation process several works have explored ntp systems combined with tio2 based catalysts for example wang et al indicated that the higher energy yield and generation of oxidative species were reached in a pulsed corona discharge system assisted with tio2 176 xin et al 177 observed that the energy yield of ntp on malachite green removal by the ag3po4 tio2 catalyst increased compared to single tio2 nevertheless single tio2 or metallic doped tio2 has restrictions on increased capacity of energy efficiency which have been taken into consideration as the inadequate uv absorption strength and confined recombination ability of the electron hole pairs due to the metallic doping instability 178 therefore graphene oxide go by having high mobility of electrons excessive adsorption surface area high energy converting and superior stability 179 has been loaded on tio2 and was used in combination with ntp zhang et al 150 showed that the dbd energy yield was significantly improved to 0 079 mmol kwh after 18 min of discharge plasma assisted with 0 4 g l tio2 rgo at 18 kv compared with the single dbd 0 99 mmol kwh furthermore results indicated a slight increase in energy yield when the added tio2 rgo in dbd was 0 4 g l this phenomenon can be described by the fact that a high amount of tio2 rgo amplified light scattering and limited uv transmitting which reduced the photocatalytic performance yield as can be seen from table 3 and fig 10 titanium dioxide tio2 has been intensively studied as a catalyst material to remove sops in the catalytic ntp system this photocatalyst has enriched the degradation field with appreciable removal rate but it still lacks some of the crucial characteristics of the semiconductor photocatalysts such as low charge recombination high separation and high redox ability 180 surface properties of photocatalyst materials in the photocatalytic process is another important issue that has a significant impact on the catalytic performance as reported by 181 the addition of silver iodide to the surface of tio2 increased the debromination efficiency of polybrominated diphenyl ethers other studies showed that the efficiency of the photocatalyst can be increased by doping in the following ways bad gap narrowing oxygen vacancies formation of impurity energy levels unique surface area electron trapping etc 182 183 8 conclusions perspectives and outlook different types of ntp systems have been used to deal with pollutants from water indicating a good potential for further application to deal with sops due to the high sop removal effectiveness during the ntp treatment moreover ntp reactors can provide significant advantages which conventional water treatment processes cannot provide including quick interaction with sops compatibility with established treatment processes high energy yield and low capital costs nevertheless the energy yield of the ntp treatment systems is one of the greatest challenges faced in their applications which influences their operating costs and overall performance for the ntp removal of the sops reviewed herein the energy yield was widely diverse in addition to the expected association with the molecular structure noticeable differences among similar works were observed even for the same compound confirming the large influence of the type of ntp design and the experimental conditions gas carrier pollutant initial concentration input energy and water characteristics moreover the evaluation of the energy and performance of ntp systems on the sops degradation has proved that ppd configuration has a functional advantage and better energy efficiency than dbd configuration in removing sops from aquatic environments besides when the ntp system is operated with oxygen gas as the carrier gas it has better performance and higher energy yield than air which is in line with previous works our ntp energy yield aspects analysis indicated that it can be heavily influenced by several factors including applied voltage and pulse frequency initial pollutant concentration output power ph and conductivity of a solution time of plasma discharge catalyst adding and removal efficiency the energy yield demonstrated a dual character either increasing or decreasing with the applied voltage and applied frequency however the energy yield always improves with an increasing initial concentration of pollutants within some limits in the case of the ntp output power the energy yield primary increases with the increase of output power until it reaches its peak point and then begins to decline depending on the predominant oxidant species the energy yield in both acidic and alkaline environments can reach high levels moreover the catalytic ntp energy yield analysis in the present study confirmed that even though ntp degradation of sops can be very effective to increase the energy yield and decrease the reaction time many types of catalysts have been used for the degradation of sops our analysis evidenced that the energy yield was significantly higher for the catalytic ntp process than single ntp however the fundamental studies aiming to enhance the ntp catalytic system have mainly focused on the synergistic effect between the plasma and the catalyst among the catalysts used in the ntp literature the tio2 rgo composite and the tio2 fe3o4 composite had maximum and minimum effect respectively in the ntp degradation process we have to underline here that identifying a suitable catalyst based on the synergistic effect on energy efficiency is still a major challenge finally the available literature has generally considered reaction mechanisms and performance of ntps whereas the energy yield of ntps has been severely less investigated to bring ntp as near as possible to the field more comparative examinations will be required which consider the energy yield of ntp as the key factor to implementation declaration of

not have permission to share data 1 introduction in the past few decades the rapid growth of pharmaceutical industries has caused some serious environmental pollution in aquatic resources especially multitudinous antibiotic containing wastes have been drastically observed in the aquatic systems like groundwater sewage water and surface water and due to their overuse it could impose numerous serious effects on humans and aquatic systems 1 3 among them tetracycline tc hydrochloride is a widely used antibiotic in remedying and preventing animal and human diseases due to its benefits such as low cost bactericidal and antibacterial properties 4 5 unfortunately tc antibiotic is discharged through urine into the natural environment which reveals the poor metabolization of tc antibiotic in human and animal bodies 4 besides tc is a frequently used antibiotic for aquaculture and livestock breeding which is the main aspect of tc antibiotic detected in the natural resources of water 6 simultaneously tc antibiotic wastes are extremely very difficult to be removed completely by using the typical traditional approach like biological degradation filtration electrochemical oxidation activated carbon adsorption and physical absorption 3 5 7 as tc antibiotic is bio refractory highly toxic and a stable compound 8 as a consequence it is very crucial to investigate the removal of tc antibiotic wastes from aquatic systems by the highly reliable sustainable and efficient method fortunately the photocatalytic activity process has been established to be a fascinating and effective alternative technique with respect to conventional methods for the removal of pharmaceutical wastes because of its several merits such as no secondary level pollution nontoxicity abundant solar energy utilization and low cost process 7 9 in this regard numerous semiconductor catalysts such as zno wo3 tio2 v2o5 zns ag3po4 bi2moo6 ag3vo4 metal organic framework and bismuth oxyhalides have been widely used for the elimination of pharmaceutical wastes from the aquatic pollutants 6 7 10 nevertheless wide bandgap photocatalysts such as tio2 and zno can absorb ultraviolet uv light radiation which accounts for only a small fraction 4 of the incoming solar spectrum as compared to the visible light 43 thus great efforts has been devoted to the design of effective visible light driven photocatalysts for the better utilization of the full solar spectrum 9 among various semiconductor catalysts silver tungstate α ag2wo4 has been one of the attractive catalysts for the decomposition of refractory effluents due to its strong photo sensitization and distinctive crystalline properties high crystalline and crystal defects 11 12 dismayingly the performance of photocatalytic degradation of pristine α ag2wo4 was diminished by the insufficient utilization of visible light high recombination of photoinduced charge carriers and poor stability due to the photo corrosion 12 13 therefore it is still significant for researchers to further improve the separation of photoinduced charge carrier efficiency to reduce the electron hole pairs recombination rate and to enhance the catalyst stability in facilitating its practical use in this regard many modification methods like noble metals decoration doping with non metal and metal atoms regulating morphology and constructing heterojunction with other semiconductors were employed to enhance its photocatalytic degradation efficiency 9 11 14 15 consequently combining two or more photocatalysts with a coordinated energy band structure is required to construct a p n and z scheme heterojunction these two mechanisms are previously studied as the most common heterojunction system and are the effective methods to realize this objective 11 15 17 the conventional p n heterojunction construction improves the visible light response and charge carries separation efficiency while it reduces redox ability owing to the increase in the valence band vb potential and decrease in conduction band cb potential of photocatalysts typically in the z scheme heterojunction catalysts the photogenerated electrons e on the cb of the first catalyst pc 1 will migrate to the vb of the other catalyst pc 2 via these e migrating mediators and recombine with the holes h finally the photoinduced e will be gathering on the cb of pc 2 and the photogenerated h will be accumulating on the vb of pc 1 separately compared with the conventional systems the z scheme heterojunction mechanism can have both benefits simultaneously including hastening spatial separation of photoinduced charge carriers and optimizing the redox potential ability of the catalysts 15 17 18 among the above methods coupling α ag2wo4 with other semiconductors or metal free catalysts is done to construct α ag2wo4 based binary ternary nanocomposites which suppresses the recombination of photoinduced charge carriers and also preserves the redox potential thereby enhancing the photocatalytic performance up to now α ag2wo4 based photocatalysts have been prepared with two or more semiconductors such as fe2o3 ag2wo4 ag2wo4 agcl g c3n4 ag2wo4 ag ag2s ag2wo4 and zno ag ag2wo4 agi for improving photocatalytic activity efficiency 12 19 22 the results exhibited that such heterojunction is a favorable prospect for the photodegradation of organic contaminants among various metal chalcogenides x2 vy3 vi x sb bi and as y te s and se bismuth sulfide bi2s3 is an important member of the chalcogenide catalyst it has been largely employed to fabricate visible light active binary ternary composites for the removal of toxic pollutants such as bi2o3 bi2s3 bi2s3 bi2wo6 bi2s3 tio2 rgo bi2s3 sns2 bi2o3 and zno ag bi2s3 23 27 the bi2s3 has attracted great attention due to its appropriate bandgap energy 1 3 1 7 ev high visible light absorption ability λ 800 nm and reasonable incident photon to electron conversion efficiency 23 importantly bi2s3 based composites have been extending the absorption of visible light range to enhance the degradation efficiency of toxic pollutants due to the direct narrow bandgap of bi2s3 which is adapted to cover the whole solar spectrum 28 on the other hand metal free photocatalysts like graphitic carbon nitride bulk g c3n4 are a wide concern in the photocatalytic degradation field because of their good structural stability layered structure easy preparation and nontoxicity 29 the potential band edges of α ag2wo4 evb 2 995 ev ecb 0 005 ev is matched well with those of g c3n4 evb 1 70 ev ecb 1 12 ev

promotes superior photocatalytic performance 31 in consequence by combining the remarkable features of α ag2wo4 bi2s3 and tg c3n4 a fascinating bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composite was expected to

electrochemical workstation using the three electrode system at ambient temperature the platinum pt wire was used as a counter electrode and the saturated silver silver chloride ag agcl electrode served as a reference electrode the working electrode was prepared by coating the active material onto nickel form 1 cm 1 cm before being washed with ethanol by ultrasonication for 1 h the active materials α ag2wo4 tg c3n4 bi2s3 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary were mixed with carbon black and polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf binder ratio 7 2 1 in a mortar with n methyl pyrrolidinone nmp solvent and ground into a fine paste then the resultant slurry was coated onto the surface of nickel form and allowed to dry in an oven at 50 c for 10 h the end loading of active photocatalysts for each working electrode was around 1 5 2 5 mg cm 2 and 0 5 m of sodium sulfate na2so4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte 2 4 photocatalytic evaluation the photocatalytic activity of the prepared photocatalysts was examined through the degradation of tc antibiotic under natural sunlight irradiation typically reaction suspension containing the as prepared catalyst 50 mg and tc antibiotic solution 100 ml 10 mg l were laid in a 250 ml cylinder shaped glass beaker with a ph of 7 before sunlight irradiation the prepared suspension was stirred for 30 min and sonicated for 10 min to achieve the adsorption desorption equilibrium condition during the photocatalytic reaction 4 ml of the reaction solution was collected at a certain time interval followed by centrifugation for 15 min to separate the catalyst the concentration of the residual tc antibiotic solution was examined by its absorbance λmax at 357 nm with an agilent technologies cary series 5000 spectrophotometer the photocatalytic performance of tc antibiotic can be calculated by η c0 ct c0 x 100 where ct and c0 are the concentration of tc antibiotic after and before sunlight irradiation time t the reaction rate constant of the degradation kinetics of tc antibiotic was examined by the pseudo first order kinetics equation ln ct c0 kt where t k ct and c0 is the sunlight irradiation time the first order rate constant the absorption of tc antibiotic for each time intervals under sunlight irradiation and the absorption of tc antibiotic after the equilibrium condition on the as prepared catalysts before the sunlight irradiation the photocatalytic performance of 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite was also studied by photodegradation of diverse toxic pollutants including mb 10 mg l mo 10 mg l and rhb 10 mg l a total 50 mg of as prepared catalyst was dispersed in 100 ml of toxic contaminants and the mixed suspension was exposed to direct sunlight

1 mmol edta 2na 1 mmol agno3 1 mmol and ipa 3 ml were added as scavengers in the tc solution 100 ml 10 mg l and 50 mg of catalyst to capture superoxide radicals o2 holes h electrons e and hydroxyl radicals oh separately the subsequent steps similar to the procedure in the above photocatalytic experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of photocatalysts 3 1 1 structural analysis the xrd analysis was employed to study the phase purity and crystal structure of the as prepared photocatalysts the xrd results of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 and the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composites are revealed in fig 2 a the xrd pattern of the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 hexagonal nanorod exhibits diffraction peaks at 2θ of 10 98 16 75 30 30 31 59 32 97 45 35 54 70 57 10 57 90 and 66 12 respectively which belongs to 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 2 2 3 1 4 0 0 4 0 2 3 6 1 4 6 0 3 3 3 and 2 4 1 diffraction planes of the orthorhombic crystal structure jcpds no 34 0061 fig 2 a 11 the lattice constants of orthorhombic 1d α ag2wo4 were determined as a 10 870 å b 11 980 å and c 5 884 å the pristine 2d tg c3n4 depicts a high intensity diffraction peak at 27 63 which is attributed to the 0 0 2 plane of the hexagonal structure of pristine 2d tg c3n4 jcpds no 87 1526 fig 2 a 32 the pristine 1d bi2s3 nanorods exhibit high crystallized xrd peaks in an orthorhombic structure and the obtained diffraction peaks are in good agreement with the jcpds no 17 0320 fig 2 a 33 the lattice constant of 1d bi2s3 with an orthorhombic structure were found to be a 11 149 å b 11 180 å and c 3 973 å the characteristic diffraction peak of 2d tg c3n4 0 0 2 is not seen in the xrd pattern of the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary nanocomposite due to the lower intensity of the diffraction peak when compared to that of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 hexagonal nanorods fig 2 a moreover the diffraction peaks of 1d bi2s3 are not evident in the xrd patterns of the x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites owing to the weak intense diffraction peak and the addition of a low amount of 1d bi2s3 in these nanocomposites fig 2 a however the xrd pattern of the prepared binary and ternary nanocomposites matched perfectly with the diffraction peaks of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 based on the above results the intensities of the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites were slightly reduced with the addition of 2d tg c3n4 and bi2s3 tg c3n4 respectively these results confirm the successful formation of the binary 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 and ternary x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 nanocomposites besides the impurity related secondary phases are not identified in the xrd patterns of as prepared pristine binary and ternary materials demonstrating the purity of photocatalysts in addition the high intense diffraction peaks reveal the polycrystalline nature of the prepared photocatalysts 3 1 2 optical analysis generally the photocatalytic activity is primarily reliant on the optical absorption ability of the catalysts and the photoinduced electron hole pairs separation capability which are mainly associated with the electronic band structure of catalysts the optical absorption properties and energy bandgap eg of the as prepared catalysts were studied by uv vis drs analysis fig 2 b represents the uv vis drs spectra of the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 and the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites the spectrum of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 exhibits the absorption edge in the visible region at 410 nm however no absorbance was noted in the higher region of visible range due to its wide optical bandgap energy in contrast the pristine 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 show a strong optical absorption capability within the visible region at 463 nm and ir region at 1037 nm respectively fig 2 b it was noted that the optical absorption threshold of the fabricated binary and ternary photocatalysts displayed an obvious redshift to the higher wavelength it has been broadened to the range of about 470 555 nm due to the addition of 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 onto pristine 1d α ag2wo4 fig 2 b the obtained red shift absorption and broadening of the spectrum of 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composites are likely owe to the slow photo induced charge carriers recombination which can accelerate the strong absorption in the visible region from the results as synthesized binary 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 and ternary x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 nanocomposites lead to an improved photocatalytic degradation efficiency under sunlight irradiation besides the color of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 changes from light orange to dark ash with the addition of 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 in the ternary photocatalysts generally a dark color catalyst exhibits the efficient absorption ability in the visible region furthermore the tauc plot method was employed to evaluate the bandgap energy eg of as prepared photocatalysts fig 2 c and s1 the eg is calculated according to the tauc equation αhν a hν eg n 2 where α h a ν n and eg are absorption coefficient planck constant a proportional constant light frequency hz index property of the material n 4 or 1 are the indirect or direct transition semiconductor and bandgap energy ev respectively 32 from the linear portion of the αhv n vs hv the eg value of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 and the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites were obtained to be 3 07 ev 2 52 ev 1 25 ev 2 85 ev and 2 62 ev separately fig 2 c and table s1 the narrower bandgap energy eg of ternary x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 nanocomposites could facilitate the absorption of photons in the visible region than the pristine and binary catalysts contributing to an enhancement in the photocatalytic degradation performance 3 1 3 compositional analysis ft ir spectroscopy was recorded to explore the functional groups and chemical bonds of as prepared photocatalysts the ft ir spectra of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 and the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites were shown in fig 2 d and s2 in the ft ir spectrum of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 the strong peak positioned at 835 cm 1 can be attributed to the asymmetric vibration of o w o bond in distorted wo6 clusters fig 2 d 34 the peak identified at 557 cm 1 of 1d α ag2wo4 corresponds to ag o stretching frequency fig 2 d 35 the lower intense peak at 1647 cm 1 and a weak broaden peak between 3125 and 3570 cm 1 are ascribed to the bending o h and stretching o h vibrations of the adsorbed water molecules respectively fig 2 d 22 the external peak at 921 cm 1 o c o stretching mode in the ft ir spectra of ag2wo4 is produced by the water used in the synthesis process fig 2 d 36 in the spectrum of pristine 2d tg c3n4 the strong distinctive peaks at 1243 cm 1 1327 cm 1 1411 cm 1 1571 cm 1 and 1637 cm 1 correspond to the characteristic stretching vibrations of cn heterocycles c n c n fig 2 d 37 a low intensity peak at 886 cm 1 indicates the deformation of the n h bond whereas a strong peak at 807 cm 1 indicates the breathing mode of the s triazine unit fig 2 d 37 38 additionally the broad peak between 3000 and 3500 cm 1 of 2d tg c3n4 is ascribed to the n h bond and o h stretching vibrations of uncondensed amino groups and physically adsorbed water separately 30 the characteristic peaks at 471 cm 1 and 1057 cm 1 in the ft ir spectrum of pristine 1d bi2s3 are attributed to the stretching vibration of bi s bond owing to the bi2s3 formation fig 2 d 26 39 the prominent broad peak in the region between 3050 and 3600 cm 1 and a weak peak at 1637 cm 1 corresponds to the surface adsorbed water and oh groups respectively fig 2 d 26 the ft ir spectra of as synthesized 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites mainly contain the characteristic peaks of 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 moreover the peak intensity of binary and ternary composites decreased when compared to that of the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 and 2d tg c3n4 catalysts fig 2 d these results confirm that 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 were organized together for the successful formations of binary and ternary nanocomposites the ft ir analysis demonstrates that the surface hydroxyl group is abundant in the fabricated binary and ternary composites which is beneficial to enhance the photocatalytic performance xps analysis was employed to detect the elemental compositions of the as prepared pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 1d bi2s3 and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composite and the interfacial interaction between 1d ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 as displayed in fig 3 as could be seen from fig 3 a the characteristic peaks of ag 3d w 4f o 1s c 1s n 1s and bi 4f s 2p elements separately emerged in the survey spectra of 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 respectively the survey spectrum of the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite illustrates not only ag 3d w 4f o 1s elements which belong to 1d α ag2wo4 but also c n and bi s elements pertaining to 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 respectively fig 3 a these results further confirm the coexistence of 1d ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 in the resultant ternary nanocomposite which is consistent with the results of eds fig s3 the high resolution ag 3d spectrum of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 showed two major characteristic peaks at 367 87 ev and 373 84 ev with spin orbit splitting energy of 5 97 ev corresponding to the ag 3d5 2 and ag 3d3 2 separately fig 3 b 38 the doublet peaks at 34 78 ev and 36 76 ev with the typical spin orbit splitting of 1 98 ev which can be ascribed to w 4f7 2 and w 4f5 2 of w6 separately fig 3 c 20 in the case of o 1 s spectrum of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 fig 3 d the high resolution spectrum was de convoluted into three peaks at around 528 95 ev 530 20 ev and 531 35 ev the lower binding energy be peak is ascribed to o2 the middle be peak is related to the lattice oxygen and the higher be peak is related to the oxygen of adsorbed water molecules of the 1d α ag2wo4 40 41 from fig 3 e the high resolution c 1s spectrum of pristine 2d tg c3n4 could be de convoluted into three peaks at 284 85 ev 286 29 ev and 288 47 ev which are assigned to the sp2 c c bonds of tg c3n4 c 3 n and c n c groups respectively 42 the high resolution n 1 s spectrum fig 3 f can be divided into three peaks at 397 80 ev 398 79 ev and 400 71 ev which correspond to sp2 hybridization of n element in c n c tertiary nitrogen groups of n c 3 and free amino groups of c n h separately suggesting the presence of 2d tg c3n4 43 as shown in fig 3 g the high resolution spectrum of bi 4f exhibits two prominent peaks at 158 02 ev and 163 30 ev attributed to bi 4f7 2 and bi 4f5 2 of bi2s3 separately the obtained spin orbit splitting value is about 5 28 ev between these two peaks which confirms the bi3 oxidation state of 1d bi2s3 28 meanwhile the weak high resolution peaks at 160 47 ev and 161 63 ev with spin orbit doublet splitting of 1 16 ev is located between bi 4f7 2 and bi 4f5 2 could be allocated to s 2p3 2 and s 2p1 2 separately that closely match with the s2 state of pristine 1d bi2s3 27 compared to the be of c 1s and n 1s peaks for pristine 2d tg c3n4 the corresponding binding energy values of c 1s and n 1s for the as prepared 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composite is shifted to lower binding energies fig 3 e f the obtained lower binding energy shift indicates an increase in the electron density in contrast the binding energy of the ag 3d w 4f and o 1s for the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composite was observed to be shifted towards higher binding energy fig 3 b d the obtained higher binding energy shift can be attributed to the strong interaction between the constituents of the ternary heterostructure as a result the electrons transfer from the hexagonal rod like 1d α ag2wo4 to 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets and 1d bi2s3 nanorods discussed in the mechanism section 3 6 2 in theory the atom has a strong interaction among the nucleus and the core electrons meanwhile the outermost electrons promote a shielding effect to the core electrons the concentration of outermost electrons was decreased due to the removal of electrons thereby reducing the shielding effect therefore an increase in the core electrons binding energy values owing to the penetration effect is observed which promotes the shift towards higher binding energy of the corresponding xps peaks 44 in this case it is concluded that the lower and higher binding energy shifts are ascribed to the decrease in the electron concentration of the hexagonal rod like 1d α ag2wo4 and increased electron concentration of 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets and 1d bi2s3 nanorods because of the strong interaction between the 1d ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 based on the interfacial charge transfer there is an exhibit of enhanced photocatalytic degradation performance 3 1 4 morphological analysis hr sem analysis was examined to survey the feature for morphology and structural dimensionality of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 and the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites as presented in fig 4 as delineated in fig 4 a b the hr sem images of pristine α ag2wo4 display a hexagonal rod like one dimensional 1d structure and the pristine bi2s3 exhibits a nanorod like 1d structure with smooth surfaces as depicted in fig 4 c tg c3n4 is comprised of several irregulars and aggregated sheet like structures with rough surfaces as expected in fig 4 d it is observed that abundant 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets were immobilized on 1d α ag2wo4 surface suggesting the random distribution of 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets on the surface of 1d α ag2wo4 to form the tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 2d 1d binary composite structure moreover it can be seen that the 1d bi2s3 nanorods and 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets were firmly attached and mingled on the surface of 1d α ag2wo4 and the morphology of 1d α ag2wo4 catalyst was slightly deformed in the primary hexagonal rod like structure fig 4 e notably the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 1d 2d 1d ternary nanocomposite presented a strong coupling between the 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 photocatalyst more interestingly it was observed that the sizes of 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets in 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite became smaller than that of pristine 2d tg c3n4 this result reveals that 1d α ag2wo4 could effectively inhibit their agglomeration furthermore the area of recombination at the contact point was formed between 2d tg c3n4 1d bi2s3 and 1d α ag2wo4 which was favorable to construct more junctions in bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites this result confirms that the constructed ternary system was beneficial to enhance the photoinduced charge carriers separation and transfer speed the eds analysis was conducted to study the elemental distributions and compositions of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 and the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites fig s3 in the ternary nanocomposite eds spectrum bi s c n ag w and o elements were present which further demonstrated that the fabricated bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites had no other impurities the atomic ratio of ag to w c to n and bi to s were approximately the same as the ratios in the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 compound moreover the ratio of 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 to 1d α ag2wo4 exhibits higher than the theoretical value the reason maybe as follows the eds analysis typically examined that the surface element content of photocatalysts as well as 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 was mainly deposited on the surface of the nanocomposite the elemental mapping of the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites was recorded by hr sem and the obtained results are illustrated in fig 4 f m the detection of the ag o w bi s n and c elements demonstrate the presence of dimensionally coupled 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 catalysts to construct the heterojunction of the ternary nanocomposite tem and hr tem analyses were also used to elucidate the particle size and the interaction between different photocatalysts for pristine binary 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 and ternary 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 nanocomposites as shown in fig 5 from the tem results the pristine α ag2wo4 presented a hexagonal 1d rod like structure with a length in the range of 0 24 μm 1 91 μm and width in the range of 100 nm 420 nm fig 5 a b fig 5 e f displays the bi2s3 nanorods with transparent 1d nanostructure with a smooth surface which are around 80 nm 1 08 μm in length and a width of around 25 nm 110 nm the lattice fringes of 1d α ag2wo4 and 1d bi2s3 catalysts are found to be around 0 288 nm and 0 361 nm respectively which corresponds to a plane 2 3 1 and 1 3 0 of the orthorhombic stage fig 5 c g in the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary nanocomposite an attractive phenomenon was observed the 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets were randomly deposited onto the surface of 1d α ag2wo4 hexagonal nanorods fig 5 i j these results suggest that the hydrothermal process favors the strong surface interfacial contact between the hexagonal nanorod like 1d α ag2wo4 and 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets fig 5 m n depicts the tem images of the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites consisting of hexagonal 1d α ag2wo4 nanorods 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets and nanorod like 1d bi2s3 catalysts further numerous 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets and nanorod like 1d bi2s3 particles were non uniformly covering the surface of the hexagonal rod like α ag2wo4 photocatalyst fig 5 m n the attained tem results of 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite was in good agreement with the hr sem result fig 4 moreover the obtained tem result proposes that the combination of dimensionally coupled ternary nanocomposite 1d 2d 1d exhibits a synergistic effect due to an effective charge carriers transfer process the different kinds of lattice spacing values were observed in the hr tem images of 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composites fig 5 k o the observed lattice fringe spacings of binary catalyst is 0 283 nm and 0 329 nm could be assigned to the 2 3 1 and 0 0 2 lattice plane of 1d α ag2wo4 and 2d tg c3n4 respectively fig 5 k moreover lattice d spacings of ternary catalyst is 0 281 nm 0 320 nm and 0 352 nm corresponds to the 2 3 1 plane of the hexagonal rod like 1d α ag2wo4 0 0 2 plane of 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets and 1 3 0 plane of nanorod like 1d bi2s3 respectively fig 5 o the staggered d spacing also confirms that the dimensionally coupled 2d 1d binary and 1d 2d 1d ternary nanocomposites with strong interface contact have been synthesized successfully and the examined results of lattice planes were reliable with those of xrd results fig 2 a fig 5 d h l p shows the saed pattern of the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 1d bi2s3 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite the obtained bright diffraction spots and diffraction ring distribution of the saed pattern reflect the polycrystalline characteristics of the as prepared photocatalysts and the growth in highly oriented planes the tem hr tem and saed results also confirm that the hexagonal rod like 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets and 1d bi2s3 nanorods form the ternary heterojunction nanocomposites the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composite also facilitated to improve the separation of photogenerated charge carriers to produce the active species and enhance the degradation performance of the photocatalysts under sunlight irradiation 3 1 5 surface area analysis the specific surface area of the catalyst is an important parameter in the photocatalytic degradation for toxic contaminants fig 6 displays the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm and pore size distribution curve insert of fig 6 of the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 1d bi2s3 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite the adsorption desorption isotherm of pristine binary and ternary photocatalysts was type iv with typical h3 hysteresis loops which denotes the characteristics of the open slit shaped capillaries with wide bodies and narrow necks 27 45 fig 6 the obtained hysteresis loop at high partial pressure p p0 range may suggest the formation of macropores and mesopores in the as prepared photocatalysts according to bet analysis the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary photocatalyst exhibits a higher specific surface area of about 135 31 m2 g 1 which is 1 49 1 14 and 1 21 folds much greater than that of the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 90 24 m2 g 1 1d bi2s3 118 55 m2 g 1 and 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 111 21 m2 g 1 binary photocatalysts fig 6 when the 1d bi2s3 15 and 2d tg c3n4 25 content are encapsulated in 1d α ag2wo4 the constructed 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite possess a higher specific surface area than the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 and 1d bi2s3 the pore size distribution was examined from the n2 gas adsorption desorption isotherm using the barrett joyner halenda bjh method the pristine binary and ternary catalysts exhibit the pore size distribution was mostly centered around 2 nm 10 nm range the specific surface area pore radius and pore volume of as synthesized pristine binary and ternary catalysts were listed in table 1 combined with the above results 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite could provide efficient transport pathways to products and reactant molecules which could contribute to the enhancement of their photocatalytic performance of organic containments 3 2 photocatalytic activity analysis 3 2 1 photocatalytic degradation for tc antibiotic tc as a refractory antibiotic was employed to examine the photocatalytic activity of as synthesized pristine 1d α ag2wo4 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 and 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composites under natural sunlight irradiation before sunlight irradiation the adsorption abilities of pristine binary and ternary photocatalysts with different weight ratios of 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 were achieved over 150 min fig 7 a it is observed from fig 7 a the pristine 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 exhibited the strongest adsorption capability of tc antibiotic among the prepared catalysts which may be ascribed to the higher surface area fascinatingly after the addition of 1d α ag2wo4 into 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 catalysts the tc adsorption ability of the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites became lower more interestingly the concentration of tc antibiotic illustrated that no obvious change was observed after 150 min under dark condition this result reveals that the tc solution had successfully achieved the adsorption desorption equilibrium between tc antibiotic and catalysts fig 7 a the obtained absorption ability of the prepared photocatalysts are 9 01 1d α ag2wo4 19 50 1d bi2s3 10 70 2d tg c3n4 8 02 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 7 88 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary fig 7 a and table 2 before the sunlight irradiation the absorption capability for the temporal evolution of the tc antibiotic concentration changes was recorded in the uv vis spectra λmax 357 nm over pristine binary and ternary nanocomposite photocatalysts as presented in fig s4 moreover it was found that the blank experiment of the tc antibiotic concentration showed negligible changes in the absence of catalysts for 120 min this result suggests that tc antibiotic was quite stable and self degradation could be neglected under sunlight irradiation fig 7 c after 120 min of sunlight irradiation only 52 83 29 23 and 75 38 of tc antibiotic were degraded in the presence of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 respectively fig 7 c the obtained poor tc removal efficiency of pristine catalysts was ascribed to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs the photocatalytic degradation fractions of the prepared photocatalysts are 52 83 1d α ag2wo4 29 23 1d bi2s3 75 38 2d tg c3n4 81 50 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 83 11 3 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 85 01 5 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 87 15 7 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 89 67 10 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 and 95 02 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 fig 7 c and table 2 remarkably the fabricated x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites show higher photocatalytic performances than that of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 and 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary catalysts fig 7 c the degradation efficiency of tc antibiotic in x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composites is increased gradually with the increase in the 1d bi2s3 content from 3 to 15 particularly when the weight ratio of 1d bi2s3 increased to 15 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composites owned the highest degradation efficiency of tc antibiotic was about 95 02 after 120 min under sunlight irradiation the removal efficiency of the ternary catalyst was around 1 79 3 25 and 1 26 folds high as pristine 1d α ag2wo4 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 respectively the improvement was primarily attributed to the effective construction of unique bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 1d 2d 1d dual z scheme heterojunction photocatalysts promotion of the photogenerated charge carriers separation efficiency and interface charge transfer rate the ternary composites displayed maximum degradation efficiency demonstrating that the as prepared bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 hybrid photocatalysts could make whole sunlight light utilization to decompose the tc antibiotic from wastewater unlikely it was also observed that the removal efficiency of the bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 hybrid photocatalysts exhibit a gradual enhancing behavior with an increase in the content of bi2s3 the reason may be as follows first when the amount of 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 were quite low the partial contact areas between 1d bi2s3 2d tg c3n4 and 1d α ag2wo4 could not construct sufficiently z scheme hybrids and fast photoinduced charge carriers recombination rate causing inferior tc antibiotic removal efficiency 46 second when the amount of 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 was moderate the adequate amount of 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 catalysts were immobilized on the hexagonal rod like 1d α ag2wo4 surfaces and to construct the synergistic effect between 1d bi2s3 2d tg c3n4 and 1d α ag2wo4 the construction of efficient z scheme hybrids and enhance the photo induced charge carriers migration further resulting in the higher tc antibiotic removal efficiency 15 third when the amount of 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 were relatively high a synergistic effect between 1d bi2s3 2d tg c3n4 and 1d α ag2wo4 would be inhibited owing to the excessive 1d bi2s3 nanorods and 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets that covered the surface of 1d α ag2wo4 nanorods and agglomerated acting as the recombination center of photogenerated electron hole pairs causing the poorer tc antibiotic removal efficiency 15 47 besides the optimal 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite illustrated the maximum photocatalytic activity 95 02 but its degradation efficiency was still not achieved in the complete removal of tc antibiotic thus we may increase the exposure time of sunlight irradiation to further enhance the removal efficiency of tc antibiotic fig s5 depicts the uv vis absorption spectra of pristine binary and ternary photocatalysts which exhibit the temporal evolution of the tc antibiotic concentration changes under sunlight irradiation from fig s5 the intensity of tc antibiotic for the absorption characteristic peak at 357 nm was gradually reduced as the increase of prolonged the sunlight irradiation time this result suggests that the tc antibiotic structure was effectively destroyed by the fabricated bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 1d 2d 1d ternary nanocomposites under sunlight irradiation the attained highest photocatalytic degradation of tc antibiotic by our optimal 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 nanocomposite could be attributed to the introduction of multiple pathways to electrons transfer and efficiently suppressed the photo induced charge carriers recombination in the ternary heterostructure system besides the reaction kinetics of tc antibiotic absorption and degradation of the as prepared photocatalysts were examined by the langmuir hinshelwood equation ln c c0 kt 47 48 fig 7 b d display the linear relationship of ln c c0 vs irradiation time t which represents the reaction kinetics fitting curves of tc antibiotic absorption and degradation under before and after sunlight irradiation over the as prepared photocatalysts the calculated reaction rate constant k and the correlation coefficient r2 of the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 1d bi2s3 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary photocatalysts were listed in table 2 in the dark condition the obtained k value of 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite is around 0 0005 min 1 which is about 1 2 2 6 1 4 and 1 2 folds lower than that of 0 0006 min 1 1d α ag2wo4 0 0013 min 1 1d bi2s3 0 0007 min 1 2d tg c3n4 and 0 0006 min 1 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary fig 7 b hence the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite exhibits the lowest absorption capability after the sunlight irradiation the degradation rate constant k value over the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 1d bi2s3 2d tg c3n4 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary 3 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 5 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 7 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 10 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composites were 0 0057 min 1 0 0031 min 1 0 0114 min 1 0 0128 min 1 0 0136 min 1 0 0146 min 1 0 0159 min 1 0 0172 min 1 and 0 0209 min 1 respectively fig 7 d the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 photocatalyst exhibits the greatest reaction rate constant 0 0209 min 1 which was 3 6 6 7 1 8 and 1 6 times greater than of the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 1d bi2s3 2d tg c3n4 and 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary nanocomposite respectively the obtained result confirms that the addition of 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 catalysts could highly enhance the degradation efficiency of 1d α ag2wo4 finally the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite revealed good photocatalytic efficiency and great potential for the removal of tc antibiotic under sunlight irradiation the photocatalytic performance of bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite was quite comparable with previous literature of the binary ternary composites on the removal of tc antibiotic table 3 leading to enhance the degradation efficiency under natural sunlight irradiation compared with these traditional catalysts the bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 1d 2d 1d ternary photocatalyst has the advantages of being a simple preparation low cost and environmental friendliness moreover the usage of direct sunlight in our present work is a promotion in energy saving 3 2 2 photocatalytic performance for diverse organic pollutants the degradation potential of the as prepared photocatalysts was investigated by the photo decomposing of unselective diverse organic pollutants which is the most significant parameter in the field of photocatalytic degradation the application ability of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary catalysts for the photodegradation of other toxic contaminants were examined to remove mb rhb and mo fig 8 a c e the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite exhibits superior photocatalytic performance for mb rhb and mo degradation under sunlight irradiation with respect to that of the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 and 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary catalysts fig s6 s8 under sunlight irradiation the degradation efficiency of 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite for mb rhb and mo was around 98 94 99 26 and 75 35 at 120 min respectively fig 8 a c e the obtained photocatalytic performance of mb and rhb was consistent with that of tc antibiotic and mo degradation efficiency was relatively low with respect to that of tc antibiotic moreover when compared to as prepared pristine and binary catalysts the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite showed an apparent reaction rate constant of mb 0 0332 min 1 rhb 0 0343 min 1 and mo 0 0084 min 1 degradation in particular it also shows 5 4 49 0 and 3 0 folds superior than that of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 mb 0 0061 min 1 rhb 0 0007 min 1 and mo 0 0028 min 1 under sunlight irradiation fig 8 b d f the calculated photodegradation efficiency η the reaction rate constant k and correlation coefficient r2 of as synthesized pristine binary and ternary photocatalysts were listed in table 4 these results reveal that the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite presented the robustness and universal degradation performance for diverse organic pollutants in the wastewater treatment under sunlight irradiation 3 2 3 effect of influence factors 3 2 3 1 effect of initial tc antibiotic concentration the effects of initial tc antibiotic concentration on the photocatalytic activity of 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 under sunlight irradiation at 120 min were presented in fig 9 a as can be seen the photocatalytic degradation efficiency is influenced negatively by increasing initial tc antibiotic concentration for a given dosage of 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 catalyst and this obtained result is in agreement with the previous report 15 the tc antibiotic degradation efficiencies as well as reaction rate constants at 120 min were 97 13 95 02 87 32 and 75 07 as well as 0 0302 min 1 0 0209 min 1 0 0161 min 1 and 0 0113 min 1 with the different initial tc antibiotic concentrations of 5 mg l 10 mg l 20 mg l and 30 mg l separately fig 9 a b hence to remove the higher concentration of tc antibiotic pollutants in the photocatalytic process the essential criterion is the reaction time moreover these results ascribe to a more profound competition of organic contaminants for the catalyst active sites with a higher concentration of tc antibiotic further enhancing the number of intermediates in the photocatalytic reaction could carry a competitive effect on the photodegradation between tc antibiotic and the intermediate products 3 2 3 2 effect of catalyst dosage the photocatalytic activity was examined by adding 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite into the tc antibiotic solution under sunlight irradiation fig 9 c with the increase of the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 photocatalyst dosage from 10 mg to 50 mg the degradation performance and rate constants of tc antibiotic continuously increased from 62 47 to 95 02 and 0 0083 min 1 to 0 0209 min 1 in 120 min this may be due to more amount of photocatalyst would produce more active sites to react with tc antibiotic hence the generated higher photo induced reactive species enhance the photocatalytic performance of tc antibiotic however with the further increasing photocatalyst dosage 50 mg to 70 mg the photocatalytic performance is found to be slightly enhanced 95 02 to 96 82 and identically close reaction rate constants were observed 0 0209 min 1 and 0 0267 min 1 fig 9 c d this result suggested that further increasing the amount of catalyst is too higher leading to the scattering and shielding effect of light 4 moreover both deposition and aggregation of 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 may decrease the number of accessible active sites which reduces the degradation efficiency of tc antibiotic the benefits of improving the active sites by increasing the photocatalysts dosage were moderately consumed for these causes 3 2 3 3 effect of ph value it is well known that the initial ph of the aqueous solution reveals a crucial impact on photocatalytic removal efficiency which mainly affects the properties of surface charges photocatalyst adsorption capability and generation of reactive species 49 fig 9 e presents the influence of ph for tc antibiotic degradation under sunlight irradiation over 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite after 120 min sunlight irradiation the photocatalytic performance of tc antibiotic was 77 93 92 76 95 02 90 62 and 81 92 and the resultant reaction rate constant was about 0 0121 min 1 0 0185 min 1 0 0209 min 1 0 0202 min 1 and 0 0158 min 1 at ph 3 5 7 9 and 11 separately fig 9 e f in general the photocatalytic efficiency is higher under acid conditions and the degradation performance will decline evidently with the increasing ph value to base conditions in the photocatalytic reaction but the photocatalytic activity of tc antibiotic by 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 shows the lowest efficiency under strongly acidic conditions fig 9 e it revealed a higher photocatalytic influence and reaction rate constant to tc antibiotic at neutral ph ph 5 7 9 which can be ascribed to higher adsorption ability towards tc antibiotic at neutral ph condition under the strong alkaline ph 11 and acidic ph 3 conditions the photocatalyst displayed a lower photocatalytic efficiency and adsorption ability than the neutral ph conditions based on the above investigations the optimal photocatalytic experimental conditions are as follows the initial ph of the aqueous solution is 7 the amount of photocatalyst is 50 mg and the initial concentration of tc antibiotic is 10 mg l moreover we related with the previously reported binary ternary catalyst systems for the photodegradation of tc antibiotic under various light sources table 3 because a direct comparison is very challenging due to the various parameters of photocatalytic reaction as shown in table 3 the results demonstrate that 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite is highly competitive with typical photocatalysts and exhibits tremendous photocatalytic performance in sunlight driven degradation of tc antibiotic 3 2 3 4 effect of water sources considering the practical application the present work further investigated the impact of various kinds of water sources on the photocatalytic activity of tc antibiotic the obtained tc antibiotic degradation of different water matrices is presented in fig 9 g after 120 min sunlight irradiation the removal efficiencies of tc antibiotic degradation achieved 95 02 76 39 and 67 16 and corresponding reaction rate constants were 0 0209 min 1 0 0114 min 1 and 0 0090 min 1 in tc antibiotic obtained di tap and lake water respectively fig 9 g h accordingly the noticed ph value of the water samples such as natural water 7 0 8 0 and tap water 7 5 7 8 was recorded based on the previous results of the ph influence it is concluded that the obtained ph condition of the water sources was not affecting mainly the photocatalytic degradation of tc antibiotic in natural water furthermore natural water matrices at the sampling sites contain anions such as so4 2 cl etc 58 these anions can inhabit the active sites on the photocatalyst surface as the scavengers of oh and generate radical species with lower oxidation powers thus the process could reduce the removal efficiency of tc antibiotic in natural water eqs 1 and 2 58 finally the results confirm that the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite effectively removes tc antibiotic by the photocatalytic process in practical applications 1 cl oh cloh 2 so 4 2 oh so 4 oh 3 3 photoluminescence and photo electrochemical analysis the photoluminescence pl analysis of as synthesized photocatalysts was examined to understand the recombination process of charge carriers generally the pl spectra of catalysts reflect the trapping of electron hole pairs migration and transfer of charge carriers fig 10 a illustrates the room temperature pl spectra of the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite all the prepared photocatalysts show the pl emission range of 370 nm 625 nm the obtained pl behavior of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 shows broadband with maximum intensity emission between 390 and 450 nm that is ascribed to the violet blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum which is possibly caused by charge transfer processes in the octahedral wo6 cluster 59 moreover pl emission spectra of all the photocatalysts exhibit broadband in the visible range demonstrating that the pl emission is a multilevel process involving the contribution of various energy states in the bandgap eg of photocatalysts 34 60 on the other hand there is an increase in the redshift pl emission range from 420 to 600 nm in the binary and ternary nanocomposites with the addition of 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 in the 1d α ag2wo4 catalyst fig 10 a additionally the binary 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 and ternary 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 photocatalysts show that the intensity of pl emission spectra was noticeably decreased when compared to the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 the obtained lower intensity pl spectra definition confirms the significant inhibition of the photo induced charge carriers recombination by the addition of 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 catalysts the recombination rate of binary ternary catalysts was calculated by the following formula 61 3 suppressing pl intensity of pristine 1 d α ag 2 wo 4 pl intensity of binary or ternary catalysts pl intensity of pristine 1 d α ag 2 wo 4 the calculated recombination rate of binary 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 and ternary 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 photocatalysts was around 37 and 69 respectively accordingly the recombination rate of the charge carriers could be significantly reduced in the ternary 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 photocatalysts as compared with the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 the pl result reveals that the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites was highly suppressing the recombination rate of charge carriers in the degradation process which improved the removal efficiency of organic contaminants under sunlight irradiation electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis analysis was also conducted to examine the separation efficiency and the charge transfer resistance of photogenerated charge carriers generally the arc radius in the nyquist plots of eis indicates the reaction rate over the working electrode the small arc radius of the nyquist plot reveals a low resistance electrode which corresponds to the remarkable separation of photoinduced charge carriers and providing enough electrons to the photocatalytic degradation reaction 62 the nyquist plot of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 and the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites were shown in fig 10 b the arc radius of ternary nanocomposite 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 is smaller than that of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 and the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary nanocomposite fig 10 b the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary photocatalyst presented smaller arc radius denotes the higher electrical conductivity the obtained result suggests that the dimensionally 1d 2d 1d coupled catalysts effectively separated the photoinduced charge carriers on the ternary photocatalysts surface which further enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite 3 4 toxicity analysis and proposed degradation pathways the toc analysis was performed to examine the mineralization efficiency of tc antibiotic and organic dyes mb rhb mo in 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary system fig 11 a the toc removal efficiency is around 65 26 77 23 84 04 and 42 49 for tc antibiotic mb rhb and mo dye respectively were achieved with 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite at 120 min under sunlight irradiation fig 11 a the obtained mineralization efficiency was lesser than the removal efficiency of tc antibiotic and organic dyes under the same irradiation period owing to the existence of intermediates 63 the hplc at various time intervals were achieved to examine the photodegradation performance of tc antibiotic and the obtained results are presented in fig 11 b e the maximum peak area of untreated tc antibiotic at a retention time 11 587 min was observed whereas the peak area of tc antibiotic was highly reduced and three new peaks were found at retention times 4 613 5 083 and 9 944 min when the degradation reached 40 min fig 11 c 64 the reaction time prolonged to 80 min the retention time of tc antibiotic slightly shifted to 11 146 min which was attributed to the fact that some peaks are disappeared more than the retention peak time of tc antibiotic fig 11 d when the reaction time reached 120 min the peak area of tc antibiotic with retention time at 11 162 min noticeably reduced as well as many peaks of tc antibiotic was completely vanished suggesting that the rapid decrease in tc antibiotic concentration fig 11 e the obtained hplc results reveal that the tc antibiotic was effectively degraded and mineralized into small molecular compounds within 120 min in 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary system under natural sunlight irradiation further we investigated the biological toxicity in different solution systems of mung bean sprouts cultivation under ambient conditions initially mung bean seeds were planted in a glass petri dish with di water treated tc antibiotic and untreated tc antibiotic solution and the planting mung bean sprouts photograph after five days are displayed in fig 11 f h it can be seen in fig 11 f the di water used in mung bean sprouts is grown successfully as compared to the other two solution systems however the mung beans germination rate in untreated tc antibiotic solution was lower than in the treated tc antibiotic solution fig 11 h this result reveals that the treated tc antibiotic solution biotoxicity level was reduced dramatically moreover the mung bean sprouts grown and germination rate in treated tc antibiotic solution is slightly decreased when compared to di water used mung bean sprouts growth this decreased mung bean growth rate is owing to the residual toxicity of tc antibiotic solution after the photocatalytic degradation process 65 this result suggested that the synthesized bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary photocatalysts have a good ability in the decompose of tc antibiotic under sunlight irradiation as well as efficiently reduce the toxicity level of tc antibiotic to organisms in order to examine the photocatalytic degradation pathways of tc antibiotic over 15 bi2s3 tg c3n3 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites hplc ms was used to analyse the tc antibiotic with different sunlight irradiation times fig s9 several major intermediates were identified after 120 min of reaction and their corresponding three possible degradation pathways of tc antibiotic were proposed in fig 12 initially a higher concentration of tc antibiotic molecules m z 445 16 were adsorbed on the surface of the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n3 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites owing to its high surface area after achieving the adsorption equilibrium the dimensionally coupled photocatalysts were exposed to sunlight to generate active radicals like h o2 and oh instantly after that the produced reactive radicals attack the tc antibiotic molecules for pathway i tch antibiotic molecules m z 445 16 underwent a hydroxylation reaction addition reaction to yield a new intermediate of tc3 m z 508 13 fig 12 subsequently tc6 m z 480 07 can be formed via oxidizing the n ch3 2 of tc3 m z 508 13 producing a ketone 66 as the reaction continued the other two small molecule intermediates of tc9 m z 349 99 and tc12 m z 230 01 were formed via detaching of functional groups 67 fig 12 for pathway ii tch antibiotic molecules m z 445 16 were loss of one n methyl group tc1 followed by the degradation of tc1 m z 429 13 to other intermediate of tc2 m z 414 11 via loss of another n methyl group 68 the generation of tc5 m z 372 11 can be attributed to the deamination of tc2 m z 414 11 or the loss of n methyl group in tc4 m z 404 17 69 fig 12 afterwards the above macromolecular intermediate tc5 m z 372 11 was gradually split into a plurality of small molecule intermediates of tc8 m z 330 07 tc11 m z 304 09 tc14 m z 272 07 and tc16 m z 209 08 70 71 for pathway iii tch antibiotic molecules m z 445 16 was deamidation reaction to produce new intermediate of tc4 m z 404 17 68 tc4 loss of methyl hydroxyl and methylene group leading to the formation of new intermediate tc7 m z 344 11 subsequently the intermediate of tc10 m z 274 08 came from the cleavage of carbon atomic ring in tc7 72 fig 12 at the same time tc10 detached a formyl group to form tc13 m z 246 09 followed by the intermediate of tc13 to break a carbonyl group to yield tc 15 m z 230 09 in the meantime tc15 break the ring and detached a hydroxymethyl to procedure tc17 m z 206 13 73 fig 12 finally the above organic macromolecular intermediates will be mineralized into harmless co2 h2o and other inorganic constituents under the action of active species to complete the degradation of tc antibiotic 3 5 catalyst reusability and stability analysis the consecutive five cycles tests of 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite in the photocatalytic performance for the tc antibiotic were examined to explore the photocatalyst reproducibility and stability these recycle experiments were conducted under the same operating conditions as the photocatalytic activity analysis after each cycle test the photocatalyst was separated from the mixed suspension by filtration washed five times with di water and dried at 60 c for 3 h to be used in the next cycle test the obtained results of the recycle tests were displayed in fig 13 a the data shows that the tc antibiotic degradation efficiency continued the same in each cycle run and was 95 02 93 50 91 25 89 44 and 86 52 respectively the tc antibiotic removal slightly declined with the increasing test cycles and the degradation efficiency was 86 52 after the fifth cycle fig 13 a the recycling result indicates that the fabricated dimensionally coupled 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite had a good photostability and reusable capability in the photocatalytic system the photocatalytic performance reduction could be attributed to the weight loss during the filtration and rinsing process moreover the slight loss of degradation efficiency might be due to some residual by products on the photocatalysts which may block the active photocatalytic site thereby decreasing the photocatalytic performance of toxic pollutants 74 further xrd pattern ft ir and uv vis drs spectra of the fresh and used 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite for tc antibiotic removal are presented in fig 13 b d demonstrating the stability of the photocatalysts as shown in fig 13 b no unambiguous variations in the characteristic diffraction peaks are observed in the used 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite confirming a very stable crystal structure of the as synthesized photocatalysts the ft ir and uv vis drs spectra of fresh and used 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite reveals no noticeable changes in the functional groups and the optical absorption capability of photocatalysts fig 13 c d the obtained xrd ft ir and uv vis drs results of used 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary photocatalyst confirm that the dimensionally coupled 1d 2d 1d ternary composite was highly stable under the experimental conditions the recycling results of 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite revealed good reproducibility and higher stability moreover it is suitable in avoiding secondary pollution while remaining as a good candidate for powerful photocatalytic activity demonstrating great potential for practical application in wastewater management 3 6 photocatalytic degradation mechanism 3 6 1 roles of the dominant radical species in a photocatalytic degradation process the toxicity of the pollutants are decomposed by reactive species like e o2 h and oh a radical quenching experiment was used to examine the predominant reactive species responsible for the tc antibiotic removal over the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites in this quenching experiment typical scavengers including edta 2na ipa agno3 and bq were employed for trapping h oh e and o2 respectively 39 75 77 the obtained quenching results are presented in fig 14 a under sunlight irradiation the photocatalytic degradation of tc antibiotic was slightly decreased with the addition of ipa in the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary photocatalytic system fig 14 a the obtained result implies that oh radical could not be the key active species for the tc antibiotic decomposing over 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite on the other hand the tc antibiotic degradation efficiency was reduced moderately after the addition of bq and agno3 and distinctly restrained in the presence of edta 2na by contrast with no scavenger experiments result fig 14 a however the reactive species of o2 and e were displayed with a noticeable reduction in the degradation efficiency revealing that o2 and e are also participating in the degradation of tc antibiotic degradation process moreover the photocatalytic performance was highly suppressed by the reactive species of h which confirms that h radical play a predominant role during the photodegradation of tc antibiotic mediated by 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 photocatalyst fig 14 a as a result these quenching experiments demonstrated that h o2 e and oh are combined to be responsible for the decomposing of tc antibiotic over the synthesized x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites 3 6 2 possible degradation mechanism furthermore the specific band structure of bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites was propounded to demonstrate the possible photocatalytic degradation mechanism elucidation for the complicated oxidation process and the photodegradation efficiency enhancement in order to understand the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 and the energy band structures were detected to study their redox ability of as prepared photocatalysts to examine the vb and cb edge potentials of the 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 catalysts the vb position was determined from xps fig 14 b and the cb position was estimated by using the following empirical equation ecb evb eg 78 79 where ecb evb and eg are the cb edge potential ev vb edge potential ev and the bandgap energy of photocatalyst ev respectively the bandgap energy eg of 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 were determined to be 3 07 ev 2 52 ev and 1 25 ev from uv vis drs results separately fig 2 c accordingly the calculated evb and ecb of 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 photocatalysts are listed in table s2 based on the experimental and theoretical results the energy band diagram of 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 photocatalysts as well as the two possible photocatalytic mechanisms of bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite were presented in fig 14 c and fig 15 it describes the transformation of photoinduced electron hole pairs in the photocatalytic system i e conventional and direct dual z scheme heterojunction system on one hand in the conventional heterojunction system fig 15 a the photoinduced e would transfer from the cb of 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 to 1d α ag2wo4 instead the photogenerated holes h would migrate in the contrary transfer direction via the vb of photocatalysts accordingly e are gathered on the cb of 1d α ag2wo4 and h are accumulated on the vb of 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 however it could be seen that the cb position of 1d α ag2wo4 0 11 ev was slightly lower than the standard redox potential of o2 o2 0 33 ev 80 81 leading to the inadequate reduction ability of oxygen o2 to generate superoxide radicals o2 fig 15 a the vb positions of 2d tg c3n4 1 70 ev and 1d bi2s3 0 36 ev were higher than the standard redox potential of oh oh 1 99 ev as well as oh h2o 2 27 ev 80 resulting in the incapability oxidation of holes h to generate hydroxyl radical oh fig 15 a this obtained result reveals that the oh and o2 radicals could not be generated during photocatalysis processes under sunlight irradiation the conventional heterojunction result was inconsistent with the results of quenching tests where h o2 and e were confirmed to be the active species in the photocatalytic system in combination with the xps results the photogenerated e transfer from 1d α ag2wo4 to 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 was deduced but the conventional system exhibits e transfer process was inconsistent with the xps results 82 for that reason a more appropriate mechanism is required to describe the results on the other hand a dual z scheme heterojunction system was proposed as shown in fig 15 b during photocatalytic processes the migration of photoinduced electron e in the cb of 1d α ag2wo4 occurred followed by combination with the photogenerated h in the vb of 2d tg c3n4 in the direct z scheme pattern likewise the e on the cb of 1d α ag2wo4 would recombine with the photoinduced h on the vb of 1d bi2s3 leading to the effective separation of electron hole pairs fig 15 b the transfer rate of e is faster than that of h made it possible to occur 18 83 among the above results compared to a single photocatalyst system the constructed bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite exhibits the h in the vb of 1d α ag2wo4 and e in the cb of 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 could present efficient separation under the assumption of direct z scheme heterostructure moreover the recombination of photoinduced e and h was suppressed while the degradation efficiency of tc antibiotic was improved during the photocatalytic processes furthermore the photoexcited electrons were gathered on the cb of 2d tg c3n4 0 82 ev and 1d bi2s3 0 89 ev the obtained photoexcited e transfer process was consistent with the xps results these two photocatalysts cb potential values were highly negative than the standard redox potential of o2 o2 which excited that electrons had enough potential energy to reduce the o2 to o2 fig 15 b additionally the photo generated holes were accumulating on the vb of 1d α ag2wo4 2 96 ev and its vb potential was more positive compared to the standard redox potential of oh h2o and oh oh which produced holes that had capable potential energy of oxidize h2o to oh or directly contribute to the photo oxidation response 84 fig 15 b these all active species could contribute to decompose the organic contaminants which was consistent with the quenching experiment results therefore it is considered that these produced radical species improving a photocatalytic performance in organic contaminants removal and wastewater treatment might be ascribed to the dual z scheme heterojunction the dual z scheme heterojunction mechanism leads to an increase in the photogenerated charge carries separation reducing the recombination of photoexcited charge carriers and stronger reduction and oxidation capability among the above results the dual z scheme heterojunction mechanism illustrated that the bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite exhibits better photocatalytic activity than the conventional heterojunction mechanism the dual z scheme heterojunction photocatalyst charge carries e h migration mechanism is summarized as follows 4 1d α ag 2

c3n4 α ag2wo4 1d 2d 1d ternary nanocomposites were designed and constructed by the hydrothermal method at 150 c for 5 h the microscopy studies confirmed that 1d bi2s3 nanorods and 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets were firmly attached over the surface of hexagonal rod like 1d α ag2wo4 which prolongs the lifetime of the resulting ternary photocatalyst the uv vis drs analysis suggested that the bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite facilitated the utilization of full solar spectrum and enhanced sunlight driven photocatalytic capability the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 photocatalyst demonstrated the highest degradation efficiency η 95 02 for tc antibiotic and its reaction rate constant was 3 6 6 7 1 8 and 1 6 times as much as that of the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 1d bi2s3 2d tg c3n4 and 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary nanocomposite respectively the optimal 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite revealed an excellent degradation efficiency for organic contaminants such as mb η 98 94 rhb η 99 26 and mo η 77 35 different reactive species h o2 e and oh were detected in the trapping experiments the h radical played a predominant role in toxic pollutants decomposition the recycling result reveals that the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 photocatalyst demonstrated a good reusable capability and excellent photostability after five successive cycle tests toc removal efficiency of tc antibiotic reached to 65 26 at 120 min under sunlight irradiation over 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite the possible three degradation pathways were postulated and 17 intermediates were identified based on liquid chromatography mass spectrometry hplc ms analysis a dual z scheme bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 heterojunction highly enhanced in photocatalytic performance for

12644,inefficient utilization of sunlight response low separation of photoinduced charge carriers narrow redox potential and inferior recycling capacity significantly affects the functionalities of catalyst to get access in the practical wastewater treatment a novel dual z scheme bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite was designed and fabricated successfully to improve the absorption range of sunlight the structural optical morphological compositional and nitrogen adsorption desorption properties of as prepared pristine binary and ternary photocatalysts were examined comprehensively the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite demonstrated the highest degradation efficiency for toxic pollutants such as tc antibiotic η 95 02 mb η 98 94 rhb η 99 26 and mo η 77 35 under sunlight irradiation the optimized 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 photocatalyst exhibits the reaction rate constant of tc antibiotic k 0 0209 min 1 was 3 6 6 7 and 1 8 folds higher than that of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 the favorable photocatalytic performance of dual z scheme heterojunction is attributed to a tight contact interface good redox potential capacity higher separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs and inferior charge carriers recombination rate the recycling tests reveal the attractive reusability and photostability of 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 photocatalyst moreover the quenching experiment suggested that the holes h radical play a dominant role in the photocatalytic activity process of toxic contaminants over 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary

degradation pathway of tc antibiotic was also proposed unlabelled image keywords photocatalyst bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 dual z scheme tc antibiotic sunlight irradiation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction in the past few decades the rapid growth of pharmaceutical industries has caused some serious environmental pollution in aquatic resources especially multitudinous antibiotic containing wastes have been drastically observed in the aquatic systems like groundwater sewage water and surface water and due to their overuse it could impose numerous serious effects on humans and aquatic systems 1 3 among them tetracycline tc hydrochloride is a widely used antibiotic in remedying and preventing animal and human diseases due to its benefits such as low cost bactericidal and antibacterial properties 4 5 unfortunately tc antibiotic is discharged through urine into the natural environment which reveals the poor metabolization of tc antibiotic in human and animal bodies 4 besides tc is a frequently used antibiotic for aquaculture and livestock breeding which is the main aspect of tc antibiotic detected in the natural resources of water 6 simultaneously tc antibiotic wastes are extremely very difficult to be removed completely by using the typical traditional approach like biological degradation filtration electrochemical oxidation activated carbon adsorption and physical absorption 3 5 7 as tc antibiotic is bio refractory highly toxic and a stable compound 8 as a consequence it is very crucial to investigate the removal of tc antibiotic wastes from aquatic systems by the highly reliable sustainable and efficient method fortunately the photocatalytic activity process has been established to be a fascinating and effective alternative technique with respect to conventional methods for the removal of pharmaceutical wastes because of its several merits such as no secondary level pollution nontoxicity abundant solar energy utilization and low cost process 7 9 in this regard numerous semiconductor catalysts such as zno wo3 tio2 v2o5 zns ag3po4 bi2moo6 ag3vo4 metal organic framework and bismuth oxyhalides have been widely used for the elimination of pharmaceutical wastes from the aquatic pollutants 6 7 10 nevertheless wide bandgap photocatalysts such as tio2 and zno can absorb ultraviolet uv light radiation which accounts for only a small fraction 4 of the incoming solar spectrum as compared to the visible light 43 thus great efforts has been devoted to the design of effective visible light driven photocatalysts for the better utilization of the full solar spectrum 9 among various semiconductor catalysts silver tungstate α ag2wo4 has been one of the attractive catalysts for the decomposition of refractory effluents due to its strong photo sensitization and distinctive crystalline properties high crystalline and crystal defects 11 12 dismayingly the performance of photocatalytic degradation of pristine α ag2wo4 was diminished by the insufficient utilization of visible light high recombination of photoinduced charge carriers and poor stability due to the photo corrosion 12 13 therefore it is still significant for researchers to further improve the separation of photoinduced charge carrier efficiency to reduce the electron hole pairs recombination rate and to enhance the catalyst stability in facilitating its practical use in this regard many modification methods like noble metals decoration doping with non metal and metal atoms regulating morphology and constructing heterojunction with other semiconductors were employed to enhance its photocatalytic degradation efficiency 9 11 14 15 consequently combining two or more photocatalysts with a coordinated energy band structure is required to construct a p n and z scheme heterojunction these two mechanisms are previously studied as the most common heterojunction system and are the effective methods to realize this objective 11 15 17 the conventional p n heterojunction construction improves the visible light response and charge carries separation efficiency while it reduces redox ability owing to the increase in the valence band vb potential and decrease in conduction band cb potential of photocatalysts typically in the z scheme heterojunction catalysts the photogenerated electrons e on the cb of the first catalyst pc 1 will migrate to the vb of the other catalyst pc 2 via these e migrating mediators and recombine with the holes h finally the photoinduced e will be gathering on the cb of pc 2 and the photogenerated h will be accumulating on the vb of pc 1 separately compared with the conventional systems the z scheme heterojunction mechanism can have both benefits simultaneously including hastening spatial separation of photoinduced charge carriers and optimizing the redox potential ability of the catalysts 15 17 18 among the above methods coupling α ag2wo4 with other semiconductors or metal free catalysts is done to construct α ag2wo4 based binary ternary nanocomposites which suppresses the recombination of photoinduced charge carriers and also preserves the redox potential thereby enhancing the photocatalytic performance up to now α ag2wo4 based photocatalysts have been prepared with two or more semiconductors such as fe2o3 ag2wo4 ag2wo4 agcl g c3n4 ag2wo4 ag ag2s ag2wo4 and zno ag ag2wo4 agi for improving photocatalytic activity efficiency 12 19 22 the results exhibited that such heterojunction is a favorable prospect for the photodegradation of organic contaminants among various metal chalcogenides x2 vy3 vi x sb bi and as y te s and se bismuth sulfide bi2s3 is an important member of the chalcogenide catalyst it has been largely employed to fabricate visible light active binary ternary composites for the removal of toxic pollutants such as bi2o3 bi2s3 bi2s3 bi2wo6 bi2s3 tio2 rgo bi2s3 sns2 bi2o3 and zno ag bi2s3 23 27 the bi2s3 has attracted great attention due to its appropriate bandgap energy 1 3 1 7 ev high visible light absorption ability λ 800 nm and reasonable incident photon to electron conversion efficiency 23 importantly bi2s3 based composites have been extending the absorption of visible light range to enhance the degradation efficiency of toxic pollutants due to the direct narrow bandgap of bi2s3 which is adapted to cover the whole solar spectrum 28 on the other hand metal free photocatalysts like graphitic carbon nitride bulk g c3n4 are a wide concern in the photocatalytic degradation field because of their good structural stability layered structure easy preparation and nontoxicity 29 the potential band edges of α ag2wo4 evb 2 995 ev ecb 0 005 ev is matched well with those of g c3n4 evb 1 70 ev ecb 1 12 ev 11 30 besides two dimensional thin g c3n4 tg c3n4 nanosheets display superior physicochemical properties such as enhanced light harvesting ability high surface area and numerous active sites which promotes superior photocatalytic performance 31 in consequence by combining the remarkable features of α ag2wo4 bi2s3 and tg c3n4 a fascinating bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composite was expected to attain which would show a better photocatalytic performance the present work deals with the design and construction of ternary bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 composite through simple preparation to attain the photocatalytic activity of toxic contaminants under irradiation of sunlight the main objective of this work is i to fabricate a ternary bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 composite with an optimized mass ratio of bi2s3 and tg c3n4 for utilization of light absorption response ii to examine the morphological structural optical and compositional properties of ternary bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 catalysts iii to study the influence of various factors on the degradation properties of bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composite for decomposing the tc antibiotic iv to evaluate the recycling stability and ability of this ternary composite to access practical perspective and v to propose the possible photocatalytic degradation mechanism of bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 catalyst pathway for the removal of tc antibiotic 2

cooling the precipitated catalysts were rinsed several times with di water and ethanol finally the ash colored bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 catalysts were obtained after being allowed for drying at 70 c for 5 h the pristine α ag2wo4 and tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 composite were synthesized via the same procedures and conditions fig 1 step 4 the prepared binary and ternary composites were labeled as x tg c3n4 α

materials α ag2wo4 tg c3n4 bi2s3 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary were mixed with carbon black and polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf binder ratio 7 2 1 in a mortar with n methyl pyrrolidinone nmp solvent and ground into a fine paste then the resultant slurry was coated onto the surface of nickel form and allowed to dry in an oven at 50 c for 10 h the end loading of active photocatalysts for each working electrode was around 1 5 2 5 mg cm 2 and 0 5 m of sodium sulfate na2so4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte 2 4 photocatalytic evaluation the photocatalytic activity of the prepared photocatalysts was examined through the degradation of tc antibiotic under natural sunlight irradiation typically reaction suspension containing the as prepared catalyst 50 mg and tc antibiotic solution 100 ml 10 mg l were laid in a 250 ml cylinder shaped glass beaker with a ph of 7 before sunlight irradiation the prepared suspension was stirred for 30 min and sonicated for 10 min to achieve the adsorption desorption equilibrium condition during the photocatalytic reaction 4 ml of the reaction solution was collected at a certain time interval followed by centrifugation for 15 min to separate the catalyst the concentration of the residual tc antibiotic solution was examined by its absorbance λmax at 357 nm with an agilent technologies cary series 5000 spectrophotometer the photocatalytic performance of tc antibiotic can be calculated by η c0 ct c0 x 100 where ct and c0 are the concentration of tc antibiotic after and before sunlight irradiation time t the reaction rate constant of the degradation kinetics of tc antibiotic was examined by the pseudo first order kinetics equation ln ct c0 kt where t k ct and c0 is the sunlight irradiation time the first order rate constant the absorption of tc antibiotic for each time intervals under sunlight irradiation and the absorption of tc antibiotic after the equilibrium condition on the as prepared catalysts before the sunlight irradiation the photocatalytic performance of 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite was also studied by photodegradation of diverse toxic pollutants including mb 10 mg l mo 10 mg l and rhb 10 mg l a total 50 mg of as prepared catalyst was dispersed in 100 ml of toxic contaminants and the mixed suspension was exposed to direct sunlight irradiation the rest of the experimental procedure was followed as described above the influencing factors tc antibiotic concentration 5 30 mg l initial ph 3 11 and photocatalyst dosage 10 70 mg of tc antibiotic photocatalytic activity were evaluated by one factor at the same time methodology the ph of the tc antibiotic solution was altered with 0 1 m of hcl and naoh the collected water samples such as lake and tap water were pretreated by 0 45 μm pvdf filter before being applied to photocatalytic experiments to reveal the active species contribution in the photocatalytic activity process bq 1 mmol edta 2na 1 mmol agno3 1 mmol and ipa 3 ml were added as scavengers in the tc solution 100 ml 10 mg l and 50 mg of catalyst to capture superoxide radicals o2 holes h electrons e and hydroxyl radicals oh separately the subsequent steps similar to the procedure in the above photocatalytic experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of photocatalysts 3 1 1 structural analysis the xrd analysis was employed to study the phase purity and crystal structure of the as prepared photocatalysts the xrd results of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 and the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composites are revealed in fig 2 a the xrd pattern of the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 hexagonal nanorod exhibits diffraction peaks at 2θ of 10 98 16 75 30 30 31 59 32 97 45 35 54 70 57 10 57 90 and 66 12 respectively which belongs to 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 2 2 3 1 4 0 0 4 0 2 3 6 1 4 6 0 3 3 3 and 2 4 1 diffraction planes of the orthorhombic crystal structure jcpds no 34 0061 fig 2 a 11 the lattice constants of orthorhombic 1d α ag2wo4 were determined as a 10 870 å b 11 980 å and c 5 884 å the pristine 2d tg c3n4 depicts a high intensity diffraction peak at 27 63 which is attributed to the 0 0 2 plane of the hexagonal structure of pristine 2d tg c3n4 jcpds no 87 1526 fig 2 a 32 the pristine 1d bi2s3 nanorods exhibit high crystallized xrd peaks in an orthorhombic structure and the obtained diffraction peaks are in good agreement with the jcpds no 17 0320 fig 2 a 33 the lattice constant of 1d bi2s3 with an orthorhombic structure were found to be a 11 149 å b 11 180 å and c 3 973 å the characteristic diffraction peak of 2d tg c3n4 0 0 2 is not seen in the xrd pattern of the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary nanocomposite due to the lower intensity of the diffraction peak when compared to that of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 hexagonal nanorods fig 2 a moreover the diffraction peaks of 1d bi2s3 are not evident in the xrd patterns of the x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites owing to the weak intense diffraction peak and the addition of a low amount of 1d bi2s3 in these nanocomposites fig 2 a however the xrd pattern of the prepared binary and ternary nanocomposites matched perfectly with the diffraction peaks of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 based on the above results the intensities of the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites were slightly reduced with the addition of 2d tg c3n4 and bi2s3 tg c3n4 respectively these results confirm the successful formation of the binary 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 and ternary x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 nanocomposites besides the impurity related secondary phases are not identified in the xrd patterns of as prepared pristine binary and ternary materials demonstrating the purity of photocatalysts in addition the high intense diffraction peaks reveal the polycrystalline nature of the prepared photocatalysts 3 1 2 optical analysis generally the photocatalytic activity is primarily reliant on the optical absorption ability of the catalysts and the photoinduced electron hole pairs separation capability which are mainly associated with the electronic band structure of catalysts the optical absorption properties and energy bandgap eg of the as prepared catalysts were studied by uv vis drs analysis fig 2 b represents the uv vis drs spectra of the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 and the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites the spectrum of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 exhibits the absorption edge in the visible region at 410 nm however no absorbance was noted in the higher region of visible range due to its wide optical bandgap energy in contrast the pristine 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 show a strong optical absorption capability within the visible region at 463 nm and ir region at 1037 nm respectively fig 2 b it was noted that the optical absorption threshold of the fabricated binary and ternary photocatalysts displayed an obvious redshift to the higher wavelength it has been broadened to the range of about 470 555 nm due to the addition of 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 onto pristine 1d α ag2wo4 fig 2 b the obtained red shift absorption and broadening of the spectrum of 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composites are likely owe to the slow photo induced charge carriers recombination which can accelerate the strong absorption in the visible region from the results as synthesized binary 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 and ternary x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 nanocomposites lead to an improved photocatalytic degradation efficiency under sunlight irradiation besides the color of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 changes from light orange to dark ash with the addition of 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 in the ternary photocatalysts generally a dark color catalyst exhibits the efficient absorption ability in the visible region furthermore the tauc plot method was employed to evaluate the bandgap energy eg of as prepared photocatalysts fig 2 c and s1 the eg is calculated according to the tauc equation αhν a hν eg n 2 where α h a ν n and eg are absorption coefficient planck constant a proportional constant light frequency hz index property of the material n 4 or 1 are the indirect or direct transition semiconductor and bandgap energy ev respectively 32 from the linear portion of the αhv n vs hv the eg value of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 and the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites were obtained to be 3 07 ev 2 52 ev 1 25 ev 2 85 ev and 2 62 ev separately fig 2 c and table s1 the narrower bandgap energy eg of ternary x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 nanocomposites could facilitate the absorption of photons in the visible region than the pristine and binary catalysts contributing to an enhancement in the photocatalytic degradation performance 3 1 3 compositional analysis ft ir spectroscopy was recorded to explore the functional groups and chemical bonds of as prepared photocatalysts the ft ir spectra of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 and the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites were shown in fig 2 d and s2 in the ft ir spectrum of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 the strong peak positioned at 835 cm 1 can be attributed to the asymmetric vibration of o w o bond in distorted wo6 clusters fig 2 d 34 the peak identified at 557 cm 1 of 1d α ag2wo4 corresponds to ag o stretching frequency fig 2 d 35 the lower intense peak at 1647 cm 1 and a weak broaden peak between 3125 and 3570 cm 1 are ascribed to the bending o h and stretching o h vibrations of the adsorbed water molecules respectively fig 2 d 22 the external peak at 921 cm 1 o c o stretching mode in the ft ir spectra of ag2wo4 is produced by the water used in the synthesis process fig 2 d 36 in the spectrum of pristine 2d tg c3n4 the strong distinctive peaks at 1243 cm 1 1327 cm 1 1411 cm 1 1571 cm 1 and 1637 cm 1 correspond to the characteristic stretching vibrations of cn heterocycles c n c n fig 2 d 37 a low intensity peak at 886 cm 1 indicates the deformation of the n h bond whereas a strong peak at 807 cm 1 indicates the breathing mode of the s triazine unit fig 2 d 37 38 additionally the broad peak between 3000 and 3500 cm 1 of 2d tg c3n4 is ascribed to the n h bond and o h stretching vibrations of uncondensed amino groups and physically adsorbed water separately 30 the characteristic peaks at 471 cm 1 and 1057 cm 1 in the ft ir spectrum of pristine 1d bi2s3 are attributed to the stretching vibration of bi s bond owing to the bi2s3 formation fig 2 d 26 39 the prominent broad peak in the region between 3050 and 3600 cm 1 and a weak peak at 1637 cm 1 corresponds to the surface adsorbed water and oh groups respectively fig 2 d 26 the ft ir spectra of as synthesized 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites mainly contain the characteristic peaks of 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 moreover the peak intensity of binary and ternary composites decreased when compared to that of the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 and 2d tg c3n4 catalysts fig 2 d these results confirm that 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 were organized together for the successful formations of binary and ternary nanocomposites the ft ir analysis demonstrates that the surface hydroxyl group is abundant in the fabricated binary and ternary composites which is beneficial to enhance the photocatalytic performance xps analysis was employed to detect the elemental compositions of the as prepared pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 1d bi2s3 and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composite and the interfacial interaction between 1d ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 as displayed in fig 3 as could be seen from fig 3 a the characteristic peaks of ag 3d w 4f o 1s c 1s n 1s and bi 4f s 2p elements separately emerged in the survey spectra of 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 respectively the survey spectrum of the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite illustrates not only ag 3d w 4f o 1s elements which belong to 1d α ag2wo4 but also c n and bi s elements pertaining to 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 respectively fig 3 a these results further confirm the coexistence of 1d ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 in the resultant ternary nanocomposite which is consistent with the results of eds fig s3 the high resolution ag 3d spectrum of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 showed two major characteristic peaks at 367 87 ev and 373 84 ev with spin orbit splitting energy of 5 97 ev corresponding to the ag 3d5 2 and ag 3d3 2 separately fig 3 b 38 the doublet peaks at 34 78 ev and 36 76 ev with the typical spin orbit splitting of 1 98 ev which can be ascribed to w 4f7 2 and w 4f5 2 of w6 separately fig 3 c 20 in the case of o 1 s spectrum of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 fig 3 d the high resolution spectrum was de convoluted into three peaks at around 528 95 ev 530 20 ev and 531 35 ev the lower binding energy be peak is ascribed to o2 the middle be peak is related to the lattice oxygen and the higher be peak is related to the oxygen of adsorbed water molecules of the 1d α ag2wo4 40 41 from fig 3 e the high resolution c 1s spectrum of pristine 2d tg c3n4 could be de convoluted into three peaks at 284 85 ev 286 29 ev and 288 47 ev which are assigned to the sp2 c c bonds of tg c3n4 c 3 n and c n c groups respectively 42 the high resolution n 1 s spectrum fig 3 f can be divided into three peaks at 397 80 ev 398 79 ev and 400 71 ev which correspond to sp2 hybridization of n element in c n c tertiary nitrogen groups of n c 3 and free amino groups of c n h separately suggesting the presence of 2d tg c3n4 43 as shown in fig 3 g the high resolution spectrum of bi 4f exhibits two prominent peaks at 158 02 ev and 163 30 ev attributed to bi 4f7 2 and bi 4f5 2 of bi2s3 separately the obtained spin orbit splitting value is about 5 28 ev between these two peaks which confirms the bi3 oxidation state of 1d bi2s3 28 meanwhile the weak high resolution peaks at 160 47 ev and 161 63 ev with spin orbit doublet splitting of 1 16 ev is located between bi 4f7 2 and bi 4f5 2 could be allocated to s 2p3 2 and s 2p1 2 separately that closely match with the s2 state of pristine 1d bi2s3 27 compared to the be of c 1s and n 1s peaks for pristine 2d tg c3n4 the corresponding binding energy values of c 1s and n 1s for the as prepared 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composite is shifted to lower binding energies fig 3 e f the obtained lower binding energy shift indicates an increase in the electron density in contrast the binding energy of the ag 3d w 4f and o 1s for the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composite was observed to be shifted towards higher binding energy fig 3 b d the obtained higher binding energy shift can be attributed to the strong interaction between the constituents of the ternary heterostructure as a result the electrons transfer from the hexagonal rod like 1d α ag2wo4 to 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets and 1d bi2s3 nanorods discussed in the mechanism section 3 6 2 in theory the atom has a strong interaction among the nucleus and the core electrons meanwhile the outermost electrons promote a shielding effect to the core electrons the concentration of outermost electrons was decreased due to the removal of electrons thereby reducing the shielding effect therefore an increase in the core electrons binding energy values owing to the penetration effect is observed which promotes the shift towards higher binding energy of the corresponding xps peaks 44 in this case it is concluded that the lower and higher binding energy shifts are ascribed to the decrease in the electron concentration of the hexagonal rod like 1d α ag2wo4 and increased electron concentration of 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets and 1d bi2s3 nanorods because of the strong interaction between the 1d ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 based on the interfacial charge transfer there is an exhibit of enhanced photocatalytic degradation performance 3 1 4 morphological analysis hr sem analysis was examined to survey the feature for morphology and structural dimensionality of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 and the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites as presented in fig 4 as delineated in fig 4 a b the hr sem images of pristine α ag2wo4 display a hexagonal rod like one dimensional 1d structure and the pristine bi2s3 exhibits a nanorod like 1d structure with smooth surfaces as depicted in fig 4 c tg c3n4 is comprised of several irregulars and aggregated sheet like structures with rough surfaces as expected in fig 4 d it is observed that abundant 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets were immobilized on 1d α ag2wo4 surface suggesting the random distribution of 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets on the surface of 1d α ag2wo4 to form the tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 2d 1d binary composite structure moreover it can be seen that the 1d bi2s3 nanorods and 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets were firmly attached and mingled on the surface of 1d α ag2wo4 and the morphology of 1d α ag2wo4 catalyst was slightly deformed in the primary hexagonal rod like structure fig 4 e notably the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 1d 2d 1d ternary nanocomposite presented a strong coupling between the 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 photocatalyst more interestingly it was observed that the sizes of 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets in 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite became smaller than that of pristine 2d tg c3n4 this result reveals that 1d α ag2wo4 could effectively inhibit their agglomeration furthermore the area of recombination at the contact point was formed between 2d tg c3n4 1d bi2s3 and 1d α ag2wo4 which was favorable to construct more junctions in bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites this result confirms that the constructed ternary system was beneficial to enhance the photoinduced charge carriers separation and transfer speed the eds analysis was conducted to study the elemental distributions and compositions of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 and the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites fig s3 in the ternary nanocomposite eds spectrum bi s c n ag w and o elements were present which further demonstrated that the fabricated bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites had no other impurities the atomic ratio of ag to w c to n and bi to s were approximately the same as the ratios in the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 compound moreover the ratio of 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 to 1d α ag2wo4 exhibits higher than the theoretical value the reason maybe as follows the eds analysis typically examined that the surface element content of photocatalysts as well as 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 was mainly deposited on the surface of the nanocomposite the elemental mapping of the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites was recorded by hr sem and the obtained results are illustrated in fig 4 f m the detection of the ag o w bi s n and c elements demonstrate the presence of dimensionally coupled 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 catalysts to construct the heterojunction of the ternary nanocomposite tem and hr tem analyses were also used to elucidate the particle size and the interaction between different photocatalysts for pristine binary 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 and ternary 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 nanocomposites as shown in fig 5 from the tem results the pristine α ag2wo4 presented a hexagonal 1d rod like structure with a length in the range of 0 24 μm 1 91 μm and width in the range of 100 nm 420 nm fig 5 a b fig 5 e f displays the bi2s3 nanorods with transparent 1d nanostructure with a smooth surface which are around 80 nm 1 08 μm in length and a width of around 25 nm 110 nm the lattice fringes of 1d α ag2wo4 and 1d bi2s3 catalysts are found to be around 0 288 nm and 0 361 nm respectively which corresponds to a plane 2 3 1 and 1 3 0 of the orthorhombic stage fig 5 c g in the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary nanocomposite an attractive phenomenon was observed the 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets were randomly deposited onto the surface of 1d α ag2wo4 hexagonal nanorods fig 5 i j these results suggest that the hydrothermal process favors the strong surface interfacial contact between the hexagonal nanorod like 1d α ag2wo4 and 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets fig 5 m n depicts the tem images of the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites consisting of hexagonal 1d α ag2wo4 nanorods 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets and nanorod like 1d bi2s3 catalysts further numerous 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets and nanorod like 1d bi2s3 particles were non uniformly covering the surface of the hexagonal rod like α ag2wo4 photocatalyst fig 5 m n the attained tem results of 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite was in good agreement with the hr sem result fig 4 moreover the obtained tem result proposes that the combination of dimensionally coupled ternary nanocomposite 1d 2d 1d exhibits a synergistic effect due to an effective charge carriers transfer process the different kinds of lattice spacing values were observed in the hr tem images of 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composites fig 5 k o the observed lattice fringe spacings of binary catalyst is 0 283 nm and 0 329 nm could be assigned to the 2 3 1 and 0 0 2 lattice plane of 1d α ag2wo4 and 2d tg c3n4 respectively fig 5 k moreover lattice d spacings of ternary catalyst is 0 281 nm 0 320 nm and 0 352 nm corresponds to the 2 3 1 plane of the hexagonal rod like 1d α ag2wo4 0 0 2 plane of 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets and 1 3 0 plane of nanorod like 1d bi2s3 respectively fig 5 o the staggered d spacing also confirms that the dimensionally coupled 2d 1d binary and 1d 2d 1d ternary nanocomposites with strong interface contact have been synthesized successfully and the examined results of lattice planes were reliable with those of xrd results fig 2 a fig 5 d h l p shows the saed pattern of the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 1d bi2s3 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite the obtained bright diffraction spots and diffraction ring distribution of the saed pattern reflect the polycrystalline characteristics of the as prepared photocatalysts and the growth in highly oriented planes the tem hr tem and saed results also confirm that the hexagonal rod like 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets and 1d bi2s3 nanorods form the ternary heterojunction nanocomposites the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composite also facilitated to improve the separation of photogenerated charge carriers to produce the active species and enhance the degradation performance of the photocatalysts under sunlight irradiation 3 1 5 surface area analysis the specific surface area of the catalyst is an important parameter in the photocatalytic degradation for toxic contaminants fig 6 displays the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm and pore size distribution curve insert of fig 6 of the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 1d bi2s3 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite the adsorption desorption isotherm of pristine binary and ternary photocatalysts was type iv with typical h3 hysteresis loops which denotes the characteristics of the open slit shaped capillaries with wide bodies and narrow necks 27 45 fig 6 the obtained hysteresis loop at high partial pressure p p0 range may suggest the formation of macropores and mesopores in the as prepared photocatalysts according to bet analysis the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary photocatalyst exhibits a higher specific surface area of about 135 31 m2 g 1 which is 1 49 1 14 and 1 21 folds much greater than that of the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 90 24 m2 g 1 1d bi2s3 118 55 m2 g 1 and 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 111 21 m2 g 1 binary photocatalysts fig 6 when the 1d bi2s3 15 and 2d tg c3n4 25 content are encapsulated in 1d α ag2wo4 the constructed 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite possess a higher specific surface area than the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 and 1d bi2s3 the pore size distribution was examined from the n2 gas adsorption desorption isotherm using the barrett joyner halenda bjh method the pristine binary and ternary catalysts exhibit the pore size distribution was mostly centered around 2 nm 10 nm range the specific surface area pore radius and pore volume of as synthesized pristine binary and ternary catalysts were listed in table 1 combined with the above results 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite could provide efficient transport pathways to products and reactant molecules which could contribute to the enhancement of their photocatalytic performance of organic containments 3 2 photocatalytic activity analysis 3 2 1 photocatalytic degradation for tc antibiotic tc as a refractory antibiotic was employed to examine the photocatalytic activity of as synthesized pristine 1d α ag2wo4 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 and 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composites under natural sunlight irradiation before sunlight irradiation the adsorption abilities of pristine binary and ternary photocatalysts with different weight ratios of 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 were achieved over 150 min fig 7 a it is observed from fig 7 a the pristine 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 exhibited the strongest adsorption capability of tc antibiotic among the prepared catalysts which may be ascribed to the higher surface area fascinatingly after the addition of 1d α ag2wo4 into 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 catalysts the tc adsorption ability of the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites became lower more interestingly the concentration of tc antibiotic illustrated that no obvious change was observed after 150 min under dark condition this result reveals that the tc solution had successfully achieved the adsorption desorption equilibrium between tc antibiotic and catalysts fig 7 a the obtained absorption ability of the prepared photocatalysts are 9 01 1d α ag2wo4 19 50 1d bi2s3 10 70 2d tg c3n4 8 02 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 7 88 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary fig 7 a and table 2 before the sunlight irradiation the absorption capability for the temporal evolution of the tc antibiotic concentration changes was recorded in the uv vis spectra λmax 357 nm over pristine binary and ternary nanocomposite photocatalysts as presented in fig s4 moreover it was found that the blank experiment of the tc antibiotic concentration showed negligible changes in the absence of catalysts for 120 min this result suggests that tc antibiotic was quite stable and self degradation could be neglected under sunlight irradiation fig 7 c after 120 min of sunlight irradiation only 52 83 29 23 and 75 38 of tc antibiotic were degraded in the presence of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 respectively fig 7 c the obtained poor tc removal efficiency of pristine catalysts was ascribed to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs the photocatalytic degradation fractions of the prepared photocatalysts are 52 83 1d α ag2wo4 29 23 1d bi2s3 75 38 2d tg c3n4 81 50 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 83 11 3 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 85 01 5 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 87 15 7 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 89 67 10 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 and 95 02 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 fig 7 c and table 2 remarkably the fabricated x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites show higher photocatalytic performances than that of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 and 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary catalysts fig 7 c the degradation efficiency of tc antibiotic in x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composites is increased gradually with the increase in the 1d bi2s3 content from 3 to 15 particularly when the weight ratio of 1d bi2s3 increased to 15 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composites owned the highest degradation efficiency of tc antibiotic was about 95 02 after 120 min under sunlight irradiation the removal efficiency of the ternary catalyst was around 1 79 3 25 and 1 26 folds high as pristine 1d α ag2wo4 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 respectively the improvement was primarily attributed to the effective construction of unique bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 1d 2d 1d dual z scheme heterojunction photocatalysts promotion of the photogenerated charge carriers separation efficiency and interface charge transfer rate the ternary composites displayed maximum degradation efficiency demonstrating that the as prepared bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 hybrid photocatalysts could make whole sunlight light utilization to decompose the tc antibiotic from wastewater unlikely it was also observed that the removal efficiency of the bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 hybrid photocatalysts exhibit a gradual enhancing behavior with an increase in the content of bi2s3 the reason may be as follows first when the amount of 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 were quite low the partial contact areas between 1d bi2s3 2d tg c3n4 and 1d α ag2wo4 could not construct sufficiently z scheme hybrids and fast photoinduced charge carriers recombination rate causing inferior tc antibiotic removal efficiency 46 second when the amount of 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 was moderate the adequate amount of 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 catalysts were immobilized on the hexagonal rod like 1d α ag2wo4 surfaces and to construct the synergistic effect between 1d bi2s3 2d tg c3n4 and 1d α ag2wo4 the construction of efficient z scheme hybrids and enhance the photo induced charge carriers migration further resulting in the higher tc antibiotic removal efficiency 15 third when the amount of 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 were relatively high a synergistic effect between 1d bi2s3 2d tg c3n4 and 1d α ag2wo4 would be inhibited owing to the excessive 1d bi2s3 nanorods and 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets that covered the surface of 1d α ag2wo4 nanorods and agglomerated acting as the recombination center of photogenerated electron hole pairs causing the poorer tc antibiotic removal efficiency 15 47 besides the optimal 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite illustrated the maximum photocatalytic activity 95 02 but its degradation efficiency was still not achieved in the complete removal of tc antibiotic thus we may increase the exposure time of sunlight irradiation to further enhance the removal efficiency of tc antibiotic fig s5 depicts the uv vis absorption spectra of pristine binary and ternary photocatalysts which exhibit the temporal evolution of the tc antibiotic concentration changes under sunlight irradiation from fig s5 the intensity of tc antibiotic for the absorption characteristic peak at 357 nm was gradually reduced as the increase of prolonged the sunlight irradiation time this result suggests that the tc antibiotic structure was effectively destroyed by the fabricated bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 1d 2d 1d ternary nanocomposites under sunlight irradiation the attained highest photocatalytic degradation of tc antibiotic by our optimal 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 nanocomposite could be attributed to the introduction of multiple pathways to electrons transfer and efficiently suppressed the photo induced charge carriers recombination in the ternary heterostructure system besides the reaction kinetics of tc antibiotic absorption and degradation of the as prepared photocatalysts were examined by the langmuir hinshelwood equation ln c c0 kt 47 48 fig 7 b d display the linear relationship of ln c c0 vs irradiation time t which represents the reaction kinetics fitting curves of tc antibiotic absorption and degradation under before and after sunlight irradiation over the as prepared photocatalysts the calculated reaction rate constant k and the correlation coefficient r2 of the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 1d bi2s3 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary photocatalysts were listed in table 2 in the dark condition the obtained k value of 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite is around 0 0005 min 1 which is about 1 2 2 6 1 4 and 1 2 folds lower than that of 0 0006 min 1 1d α ag2wo4 0 0013 min 1 1d bi2s3 0 0007 min 1 2d tg c3n4 and 0 0006 min 1 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary fig 7 b hence the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite exhibits the lowest absorption capability after the sunlight irradiation the degradation rate constant k value over the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 1d bi2s3 2d tg c3n4 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary 3 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 5 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 7 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 10 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary composites were 0 0057 min 1 0 0031 min 1 0 0114 min 1 0 0128 min 1 0 0136 min 1 0 0146 min 1 0 0159 min 1 0 0172 min 1 and 0 0209 min 1 respectively fig 7 d the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 photocatalyst exhibits the greatest reaction rate constant 0 0209 min 1 which was 3 6 6 7 1 8 and 1 6 times greater than of the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 1d bi2s3 2d tg c3n4 and 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary nanocomposite respectively the obtained result confirms that the addition of 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 catalysts could highly enhance the degradation efficiency of 1d α ag2wo4 finally the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite revealed good photocatalytic efficiency and great potential for the removal of tc antibiotic under sunlight irradiation the photocatalytic performance of bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite was quite comparable with previous literature of the binary ternary composites on the removal of tc antibiotic table 3 leading to enhance the degradation efficiency under natural sunlight irradiation compared with these traditional catalysts the bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 1d 2d 1d ternary photocatalyst has the advantages of being a simple preparation low cost and environmental friendliness moreover the usage of direct sunlight in our present work is a promotion in energy saving 3 2 2 photocatalytic performance for diverse organic pollutants the degradation potential of the as prepared photocatalysts was investigated by the photo decomposing of unselective diverse organic pollutants which is the most significant parameter in the field of photocatalytic degradation the application ability of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary catalysts for the photodegradation of other toxic contaminants were examined to remove mb rhb and mo fig 8 a c e the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite exhibits superior photocatalytic performance for mb rhb and mo degradation under sunlight irradiation with respect to that of the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 and 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary catalysts fig s6 s8 under sunlight irradiation the degradation efficiency of 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite for mb rhb and mo was around 98 94 99 26 and 75 35 at 120 min respectively fig 8 a c e the obtained photocatalytic performance of mb and rhb was consistent with that of tc antibiotic and mo degradation efficiency was relatively low with respect to that of tc antibiotic moreover when compared to as prepared pristine and binary catalysts the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite showed an apparent reaction rate constant of mb 0 0332 min 1 rhb 0 0343 min 1 and mo 0 0084 min 1 degradation in particular it also shows 5 4 49 0 and 3 0 folds superior than that of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 mb 0 0061 min 1 rhb 0 0007 min 1 and mo 0 0028 min 1 under sunlight irradiation fig 8 b d f the calculated photodegradation efficiency η the reaction rate constant k and correlation coefficient r2 of as synthesized pristine binary and ternary photocatalysts were listed in table 4 these results reveal that the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite presented the robustness and universal degradation performance for diverse organic pollutants in the wastewater treatment under sunlight irradiation 3 2 3 effect of influence factors 3 2 3 1 effect of initial tc antibiotic concentration the effects of initial tc antibiotic concentration on the photocatalytic activity of 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 under sunlight irradiation at 120 min were presented in fig 9 a as can be seen the photocatalytic degradation efficiency is influenced negatively by increasing initial tc antibiotic concentration for a given dosage of 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 catalyst and this obtained result is in agreement with the previous report 15 the tc antibiotic degradation efficiencies as well as reaction rate constants at 120 min were 97 13 95 02 87 32 and 75 07 as well as 0 0302 min 1 0 0209 min 1 0 0161 min 1 and 0 0113 min 1 with the different initial tc antibiotic concentrations of 5 mg l 10 mg l 20 mg l and 30 mg l separately fig 9 a b hence to remove the higher concentration of tc antibiotic pollutants in the photocatalytic process the essential criterion is the reaction time moreover these results ascribe to a more profound competition of organic contaminants for the catalyst active sites with a higher concentration of tc antibiotic further enhancing the number of intermediates in the photocatalytic reaction could carry a competitive effect on the photodegradation between tc antibiotic and the intermediate products 3 2 3 2 effect of catalyst dosage the photocatalytic activity was examined by adding 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite into the tc antibiotic solution under sunlight irradiation fig 9 c with the increase of the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 photocatalyst dosage from 10 mg to 50 mg the degradation performance and rate constants of tc antibiotic continuously increased from 62 47 to 95 02 and 0 0083 min 1 to 0 0209 min 1 in 120 min this may be due to more amount of photocatalyst would produce more active sites to react with tc antibiotic hence the generated higher photo induced reactive species enhance the photocatalytic performance of tc antibiotic however with the further increasing photocatalyst dosage 50 mg to 70 mg the photocatalytic performance is found to be slightly enhanced 95 02 to 96 82 and identically close reaction rate constants were observed 0 0209 min 1 and 0 0267 min 1 fig 9 c d this result suggested that further increasing the amount of catalyst is too higher leading to the scattering and shielding effect of light 4 moreover both deposition and aggregation of 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 may decrease the number of accessible active sites which reduces the degradation efficiency of tc antibiotic the benefits of improving the active sites by increasing the photocatalysts dosage were moderately consumed for these causes 3 2 3 3 effect of ph value it is well known that the initial ph of the aqueous solution reveals a crucial impact on photocatalytic removal efficiency which mainly affects the properties of surface charges photocatalyst adsorption capability and generation of reactive species 49 fig 9 e presents the influence of ph for tc antibiotic degradation under sunlight irradiation over 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite after 120 min sunlight irradiation the photocatalytic performance of tc antibiotic was 77 93 92 76 95 02 90 62 and 81 92 and the resultant reaction rate constant was about 0 0121 min 1 0 0185 min 1 0 0209 min 1 0 0202 min 1 and 0 0158 min 1 at ph 3 5 7 9 and 11 separately fig 9 e f in general the photocatalytic efficiency is higher under acid conditions and the degradation performance will decline evidently with the increasing ph value to base conditions in the photocatalytic reaction but the photocatalytic activity of tc antibiotic by 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 shows the lowest efficiency under strongly acidic conditions fig 9 e it revealed a higher photocatalytic influence and reaction rate constant to tc antibiotic at neutral ph ph 5 7 9 which can be ascribed to higher adsorption ability towards tc antibiotic at neutral ph condition under the strong alkaline ph 11 and acidic ph 3 conditions the photocatalyst displayed a lower photocatalytic efficiency and adsorption ability than the neutral ph conditions based on the above investigations the optimal photocatalytic experimental conditions are as follows the initial ph of the aqueous solution is 7 the amount of photocatalyst is 50 mg and the initial concentration of tc antibiotic is 10 mg l moreover we related with the previously reported binary ternary catalyst systems for the photodegradation of tc antibiotic under various light sources table 3 because a direct comparison is very challenging due to the various parameters of photocatalytic reaction as shown in table 3 the results demonstrate that 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite is highly competitive with typical photocatalysts and exhibits tremendous photocatalytic performance in sunlight driven degradation of tc antibiotic 3 2 3 4 effect of water sources considering the practical application the present work further investigated the impact of various kinds of water sources on the photocatalytic activity of tc antibiotic the obtained tc antibiotic degradation of different water matrices is presented in fig 9 g after 120 min sunlight irradiation the removal efficiencies of tc antibiotic degradation achieved 95 02 76 39 and 67 16 and corresponding reaction rate constants were 0 0209 min 1 0 0114 min 1 and 0 0090 min 1 in tc antibiotic obtained di tap and lake water respectively fig 9 g h accordingly the noticed ph value of the water samples such as natural water 7 0 8 0 and tap water 7 5 7 8 was recorded based on the previous results of the ph influence it is concluded that the obtained ph condition of the water sources was not affecting mainly the photocatalytic degradation of tc antibiotic in natural water furthermore natural water matrices at the sampling sites contain anions such as so4 2 cl etc 58 these anions can inhabit the active sites on the photocatalyst surface as the scavengers of oh and generate radical species with lower oxidation powers thus the process could reduce the removal efficiency of tc antibiotic in natural water eqs 1 and 2 58 finally the results confirm that the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite effectively removes tc antibiotic by the photocatalytic process in practical applications 1 cl oh cloh 2 so 4 2 oh so 4 oh 3 3 photoluminescence and photo electrochemical analysis the photoluminescence pl analysis of as synthesized photocatalysts was examined to understand the recombination process of charge carriers generally the pl spectra of catalysts reflect the trapping of electron hole pairs migration and transfer of charge carriers fig 10 a illustrates the room temperature pl spectra of the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite all the prepared photocatalysts show the pl emission range of 370 nm 625 nm the obtained pl behavior of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 shows broadband with maximum intensity emission between 390 and 450 nm that is ascribed to the violet blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum which is possibly caused by charge transfer processes in the octahedral wo6 cluster 59 moreover pl emission spectra of all the photocatalysts exhibit broadband in the visible range demonstrating that the pl emission is a multilevel process involving the contribution of various energy states in the bandgap eg of photocatalysts 34 60 on the other hand there is an increase in the redshift pl emission range from 420 to 600 nm in the binary and ternary nanocomposites with the addition of 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 in the 1d α ag2wo4 catalyst fig 10 a additionally the binary 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 and ternary 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 photocatalysts show that the intensity of pl emission spectra was noticeably decreased when compared to the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 the obtained lower intensity pl spectra definition confirms the significant inhibition of the photo induced charge carriers recombination by the addition of 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 catalysts the recombination rate of binary ternary catalysts was calculated by the following formula 61 3 suppressing pl intensity of pristine 1 d α ag 2 wo 4 pl intensity of binary or ternary catalysts pl intensity of pristine 1 d α ag 2 wo 4 the calculated recombination rate of binary 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 and ternary 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 photocatalysts was around 37 and 69 respectively accordingly the recombination rate of the charge carriers could be significantly reduced in the ternary 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 photocatalysts as compared with the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 the pl result reveals that the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites was highly suppressing the recombination rate of charge carriers in the degradation process which improved the removal efficiency of organic contaminants under sunlight irradiation electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis analysis was also conducted to examine the separation efficiency and the charge transfer resistance of photogenerated charge carriers generally the arc radius in the nyquist plots of eis indicates the reaction rate over the working electrode the small arc radius of the nyquist plot reveals a low resistance electrode which corresponds to the remarkable separation of photoinduced charge carriers and providing enough electrons to the photocatalytic degradation reaction 62 the nyquist plot of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 and the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary and 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites were shown in fig 10 b the arc radius of ternary nanocomposite 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 is smaller than that of pristine 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 and the 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary nanocomposite fig 10 b the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary photocatalyst presented smaller arc radius denotes the higher electrical conductivity the obtained result suggests that the dimensionally 1d 2d 1d coupled catalysts effectively separated the photoinduced charge carriers on the ternary photocatalysts surface which further enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite 3 4 toxicity analysis and proposed degradation pathways the toc analysis was performed to examine the mineralization efficiency of tc antibiotic and organic dyes mb rhb mo in 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary system fig 11 a the toc removal efficiency is around 65 26 77 23 84 04 and 42 49 for tc antibiotic mb rhb and mo dye respectively were achieved with 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite at 120 min under sunlight irradiation fig 11 a the obtained mineralization efficiency was lesser than the removal efficiency of tc antibiotic and organic dyes under the same irradiation period owing to the existence of intermediates 63 the hplc at various time intervals were achieved to examine the photodegradation performance of tc antibiotic and the obtained results are presented in fig 11 b e the maximum peak area of untreated tc antibiotic at a retention time 11 587 min was observed whereas the peak area of tc antibiotic was highly reduced and three new peaks were found at retention times 4 613 5 083 and 9 944 min when the degradation reached 40 min fig 11 c 64 the reaction time prolonged to 80 min the retention time of tc antibiotic slightly shifted to 11 146 min which was attributed to the fact that some peaks are disappeared more than the retention peak time of tc antibiotic fig 11 d when the reaction time reached 120 min the peak area of tc antibiotic with retention time at 11 162 min noticeably reduced as well as many peaks of tc antibiotic was completely vanished suggesting that the rapid decrease in tc antibiotic concentration fig 11 e the obtained hplc results reveal that the tc antibiotic was effectively degraded and mineralized into small molecular compounds within 120 min in 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary system under natural sunlight irradiation further we investigated the biological toxicity in different solution systems of mung bean sprouts cultivation under ambient conditions initially mung bean seeds were planted in a glass petri dish with di water treated tc antibiotic and untreated tc antibiotic solution and the planting mung bean sprouts photograph after five days are displayed in fig 11 f h it can be seen in fig 11 f the di water used in mung bean sprouts is grown successfully as compared to the other two solution systems however the mung beans germination rate in untreated tc antibiotic solution was lower than in the treated tc antibiotic solution fig 11 h this result reveals that the treated tc antibiotic solution biotoxicity level was reduced dramatically moreover the mung bean sprouts grown and germination rate in treated tc antibiotic solution is slightly decreased when compared to di water used mung bean sprouts growth this decreased mung bean growth rate is owing to the residual toxicity of tc antibiotic solution after the photocatalytic degradation process 65 this result suggested that the synthesized bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary photocatalysts have a good ability in the decompose of tc antibiotic under sunlight irradiation as well as efficiently reduce the toxicity level of tc antibiotic to organisms in order to examine the photocatalytic degradation pathways of tc antibiotic over 15 bi2s3 tg c3n3 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites hplc ms was used to analyse the tc antibiotic with different sunlight irradiation times fig s9 several major intermediates were identified after 120 min of reaction and their corresponding three possible degradation pathways of tc antibiotic were proposed in fig 12 initially a higher concentration of tc antibiotic molecules m z 445 16 were adsorbed on the surface of the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n3 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites owing to its high surface area after achieving the adsorption equilibrium the dimensionally coupled photocatalysts were exposed to sunlight to generate active radicals like h o2 and oh instantly after that the produced reactive radicals attack the tc antibiotic molecules for pathway i tch antibiotic molecules m z 445 16 underwent a hydroxylation reaction addition reaction to yield a new intermediate of tc3 m z 508 13 fig 12 subsequently tc6 m z 480 07 can be formed via oxidizing the n ch3 2 of tc3 m z 508 13 producing a ketone 66 as the reaction continued the other two small molecule intermediates of tc9 m z 349 99 and tc12 m z 230 01 were formed via detaching of functional groups 67 fig 12 for pathway ii tch antibiotic molecules m z 445 16 were loss of one n methyl group tc1 followed by the degradation of tc1 m z 429 13 to other intermediate of tc2 m z 414 11 via loss of another n methyl group 68 the generation of tc5 m z 372 11 can be attributed to the deamination of tc2 m z 414 11 or the loss of n methyl group in tc4 m z 404 17 69 fig 12 afterwards the above macromolecular intermediate tc5 m z 372 11 was gradually split into a plurality of small molecule intermediates of tc8 m z 330 07 tc11 m z 304 09 tc14 m z 272 07 and tc16 m z 209 08 70 71 for pathway iii tch antibiotic molecules m z 445 16 was deamidation reaction to produce new intermediate of tc4 m z 404 17 68 tc4 loss of methyl hydroxyl and methylene group leading to the formation of new intermediate tc7 m z 344 11 subsequently the intermediate of tc10 m z 274 08 came from the cleavage of carbon atomic ring in tc7 72 fig 12 at the same time tc10 detached a formyl group to form tc13 m z 246 09 followed by the intermediate of tc13 to break a carbonyl group to yield tc 15 m z 230 09 in the meantime tc15 break the ring and detached a hydroxymethyl to procedure tc17 m z 206 13 73 fig 12 finally the above organic macromolecular intermediates will be mineralized into harmless co2 h2o and other inorganic constituents under the action of active species to complete the degradation of tc antibiotic 3 5 catalyst reusability and stability analysis the consecutive five cycles tests of 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite in the photocatalytic performance for the tc antibiotic were examined to explore the photocatalyst reproducibility and stability these recycle experiments were conducted under the same operating conditions as the photocatalytic activity analysis after each cycle test the photocatalyst was separated from the mixed suspension by filtration washed five times with di water and dried at 60 c for 3 h to be used in the next cycle test the obtained results of the recycle tests were displayed in fig 13 a the data shows that the tc antibiotic degradation efficiency continued the same in each cycle run and was 95 02 93 50 91 25 89 44 and 86 52 respectively the tc antibiotic removal slightly declined with the increasing test cycles and the degradation efficiency was 86 52 after the fifth cycle fig 13 a the recycling result indicates that the fabricated dimensionally coupled 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite had a good photostability and reusable capability in the photocatalytic system the photocatalytic performance reduction could be attributed to the weight loss during the filtration and rinsing process moreover the slight loss of degradation efficiency might be due to some residual by products on the photocatalysts which may block the active photocatalytic site thereby decreasing the photocatalytic performance of toxic pollutants 74 further xrd pattern ft ir and uv vis drs spectra of the fresh and used 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite for tc antibiotic removal are presented in fig 13 b d demonstrating the stability of the photocatalysts as shown in fig 13 b no unambiguous variations in the characteristic diffraction peaks are observed in the used 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite confirming a very stable crystal structure of the as synthesized photocatalysts the ft ir and uv vis drs spectra of fresh and used 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite reveals no noticeable changes in the functional groups and the optical absorption capability of photocatalysts fig 13 c d the obtained xrd ft ir and uv vis drs results of used 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary photocatalyst confirm that the dimensionally coupled 1d 2d 1d ternary composite was highly stable under the experimental conditions the recycling results of 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite revealed good reproducibility and higher stability moreover it is suitable in avoiding secondary pollution while remaining as a good candidate for powerful photocatalytic activity demonstrating great potential for practical application in wastewater management 3 6 photocatalytic degradation mechanism 3 6 1 roles of the dominant radical species in a photocatalytic degradation process the toxicity of the pollutants are decomposed by reactive species like e o2 h and oh a radical quenching experiment was used to examine the predominant reactive species responsible for the tc antibiotic removal over the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites in this quenching experiment typical scavengers including edta 2na ipa agno3 and bq were employed for trapping h oh e and o2 respectively 39 75 77 the obtained quenching results are presented in fig 14 a under sunlight irradiation the photocatalytic degradation of tc antibiotic was slightly decreased with the addition of ipa in the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary photocatalytic system fig 14 a the obtained result implies that oh radical could not be the key active species for the tc antibiotic decomposing over 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite on the other hand the tc antibiotic degradation efficiency was reduced moderately after the addition of bq and agno3 and distinctly restrained in the presence of edta 2na by contrast with no scavenger experiments result fig 14 a however the reactive species of o2 and e were displayed with a noticeable reduction in the degradation efficiency revealing that o2 and e are also participating in the degradation of tc antibiotic degradation process moreover the photocatalytic performance was highly suppressed by the reactive species of h which confirms that h radical play a predominant role during the photodegradation of tc antibiotic mediated by 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 photocatalyst fig 14 a as a result these quenching experiments demonstrated that h o2 e and oh are combined to be responsible for the decomposing of tc antibiotic over the synthesized x bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites 3 6 2 possible degradation mechanism furthermore the specific band structure of bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposites was propounded to demonstrate the possible photocatalytic degradation mechanism elucidation for the complicated oxidation process and the photodegradation efficiency enhancement in order to understand the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 and the energy band structures were detected to study their redox ability of as prepared photocatalysts to examine the vb and cb edge potentials of the 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 catalysts the vb position was determined from xps fig 14 b and the cb position was estimated by using the following empirical equation ecb evb eg 78 79 where ecb evb and eg are the cb edge potential ev vb edge potential ev and the bandgap energy of photocatalyst ev respectively the bandgap energy eg of 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 were determined to be 3 07 ev 2 52 ev and 1 25 ev from uv vis drs results separately fig 2 c accordingly the calculated evb and ecb of 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 photocatalysts are listed in table s2 based on the experimental and theoretical results the energy band diagram of 1d α ag2wo4 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 photocatalysts as well as the two possible photocatalytic mechanisms of bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite were presented in fig 14 c and fig 15 it describes the transformation of photoinduced electron hole pairs in the photocatalytic system i e conventional and direct dual z scheme heterojunction system on one hand in the conventional heterojunction system fig 15 a the photoinduced e would transfer from the cb of 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 to 1d α ag2wo4 instead the photogenerated holes h would migrate in the contrary transfer direction via the vb of photocatalysts accordingly e are gathered on the cb of 1d α ag2wo4 and h are accumulated on the vb of 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 however it could be seen that the cb position of 1d α ag2wo4 0 11 ev was slightly lower than the standard redox potential of o2 o2 0 33 ev 80 81 leading to the inadequate reduction ability of oxygen o2 to generate superoxide radicals o2 fig 15 a the vb positions of 2d tg c3n4 1 70 ev and 1d bi2s3 0 36 ev were higher than the standard redox potential of oh oh 1 99 ev as well as oh h2o 2 27 ev 80 resulting in the incapability oxidation of holes h to generate hydroxyl radical oh fig 15 a this obtained result reveals that the oh and o2 radicals could not be generated during photocatalysis processes under sunlight irradiation the conventional heterojunction result was inconsistent with the results of quenching tests where h o2 and e were confirmed to be the active species in the photocatalytic system in combination with the xps results the photogenerated e transfer from 1d α ag2wo4 to 2d tg c3n4 and 1d bi2s3 was deduced but the conventional system exhibits e transfer process was inconsistent with the xps results 82 for that reason a more appropriate mechanism is required to describe the results on the other hand a dual z scheme heterojunction system was proposed as shown in fig 15 b during photocatalytic processes the migration of photoinduced electron e in the cb of 1d α ag2wo4 occurred followed by combination with the photogenerated h in the vb of 2d tg c3n4 in the direct z scheme pattern likewise the e on the cb of 1d α ag2wo4 would recombine with the photoinduced h on the vb of 1d bi2s3 leading to the effective separation of electron hole pairs fig 15 b the transfer rate of e is faster than that of h made it possible to occur 18 83 among the above results compared to a single photocatalyst system the constructed bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite exhibits the h in the vb of 1d α ag2wo4 and e in the cb of 1d bi2s3 and 2d tg c3n4 could present efficient separation under the assumption of direct z scheme heterostructure moreover the recombination of photoinduced e and h was suppressed while the degradation efficiency of tc antibiotic was improved during the photocatalytic processes furthermore the photoexcited electrons were gathered on the cb of 2d tg c3n4 0 82 ev and 1d bi2s3 0 89 ev the obtained photoexcited e transfer process was consistent with the xps results these two photocatalysts cb potential values were highly negative than the standard redox potential of o2 o2 which excited that electrons had enough potential energy to reduce the o2 to o2 fig 15 b additionally the photo generated holes were accumulating on the vb of 1d α ag2wo4 2 96 ev and its vb potential was more positive compared to the standard redox potential of oh h2o and oh oh which produced holes that had capable potential energy of oxidize h2o to oh or directly contribute to the photo oxidation response 84 fig 15 b these all active species could contribute to decompose the organic contaminants which was consistent with the quenching experiment results therefore it is considered that these produced radical species improving a photocatalytic performance in organic contaminants removal and wastewater treatment might be ascribed to the dual z scheme heterojunction the dual z scheme heterojunction mechanism leads to an increase in the photogenerated charge carries separation reducing the recombination of photoexcited charge carriers and stronger reduction and oxidation capability among the above results the dual z scheme heterojunction mechanism illustrated that the bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite exhibits better photocatalytic activity than the conventional heterojunction mechanism the dual z scheme heterojunction photocatalyst charge carries e h migration mechanism is summarized as follows 4 1d α ag 2

c3n4 α ag2wo4 1d 2d 1d ternary nanocomposites were designed and constructed by the hydrothermal method at 150 c for 5 h the microscopy studies confirmed that 1d bi2s3 nanorods and 2d tg c3n4 nanosheets were firmly attached over the surface of hexagonal rod like 1d α ag2wo4 which prolongs the lifetime of the resulting ternary photocatalyst the uv vis drs analysis suggested that the bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite facilitated the utilization of full solar spectrum and enhanced sunlight driven photocatalytic capability the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 photocatalyst demonstrated the highest degradation efficiency η 95 02 for tc antibiotic and its reaction rate constant was 3 6 6 7 1 8 and 1 6 times as much as that of the pristine 1d α ag2wo4 1d bi2s3 2d tg c3n4 and 25 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 binary nanocomposite respectively the optimal 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite revealed an excellent degradation efficiency for organic contaminants such as mb η 98 94 rhb η 99 26 and mo η 77 35 different reactive species h o2 e and oh were detected in the trapping experiments the h radical played a predominant role in toxic pollutants decomposition the recycling result reveals that the 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 photocatalyst demonstrated a good reusable capability and excellent photostability after five successive cycle tests toc removal efficiency of tc antibiotic reached to 65 26 at 120 min under sunlight irradiation over 15 bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 ternary nanocomposite the possible three degradation pathways were postulated and 17 intermediates were identified based on liquid chromatography mass spectrometry hplc ms analysis a dual z scheme bi2s3 tg c3n4 α ag2wo4 heterojunction highly enhanced in photocatalytic performance for organic pollutants due to the improved sunlight response separation of electron hole pairs and redox capacity as a result of this work the potential application of the as synthesized bi2s3 tg c3n4 α
