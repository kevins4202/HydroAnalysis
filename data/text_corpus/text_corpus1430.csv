7150,the prevailing opinion on the temporal origin of water in a hillslope stormflow hydrograph is that the pre event water represents a dominant fraction such conclusion is usually based on hydrograph separation techniques using stable water isotopes or other conservative tracers in conjunction with a mass balance approach in this study a two dimensional dual continuum model was used to study preferential flow of water and transport of oxygen 18 o 18 in a vertical cross section of a hillslope located in a temperate spruce forest the effects of hydrodynamic mixing and the spatiotemporal variability of isotopic signatures on estimated pre event event water fractions in the hillslope discharge were studied by means of numerical simulation experiments pre event and event water contributions to hillslope stormflow were evaluated using a two component mass balance approach combined with the 2d flow and transport simulations involving real as well as synthetic o 18 signatures long term simulations of o 18 transport in the hillslope segment were compared with the observed o 18 content in soil water and in the hillslope effluent the results of the long term simulations indicated significant mixing of pre event and event water occurring near the subsurface trench and in the soil above the soil bedrock interface where the transfer of o 18 from the soil matrix to the preferential pathways takes place despite the dominant role of preferential flow in the generation of hillslope stormflow the pre event water formed 52 84 of total subsurface stormflow the mass balance approach failed in partitioning the hillslope discharge into the pre event event water components for two thirds of the selected rainfall runoff episodes due to similar natural isotopic signatures of pre event and event water the analysis showed that spatially and temporally variable exchange of o 18 between the soil matrix and preferential pathways exerted a primary control on the estimates of the temporal origin of water in the hillslope runoff it was demonstrated that the degree of hydrodynamic mixing in the flow domain played an important role in the interpretation of the isotope based hydrograph separation keywords hillslope hydrology hydrograph separation rainfall runoff relationship stormflow dual permeability model pre event water contribution mass balance approach 1 introduction runoff processes in headwater catchments occurring either on the land surface or in the subsurface are of vital importance for understanding streamflow generation and fluxes of nutrients the formation of streamflow in headwater catchments is not yet fully understood since many combinations of soil topography vegetation and geological conditions induce different mechanisms of runoff the same holds for the delivery mechanisms of pre event water to streamflow the results of separation techniques based on the mass balance approach point to a significant contribution of pre event water to catchment runoff as documented in a majority of studies performed worldwide see reviews on this subject from buttle 1994 and klaus and mcdonnell 2013 several different physical processes and mechanisms have been recognized to cause rapid mobilization of pre event water for instance lateral preferential flow translatory flow groundwater ridging and heterogeneous matrix flow e g buttle 1994 weiler and mcdonnell 2004 weiler et al 2005 catchment or hillslope hydrograph separation into two temporal components pre event old and event new water contributions using environmental tracers is a very popular technique owing to its simplicity nevertheless hydrometric and isotope field data have to be available in a detail temporal resolution to perform the isotope based hydrograph separation in addition certain fundamental assumptions have to be met the most crucial assumptions are e g buttle 1994 i significantly different isotopic content of the pre event and event water ii spatially and temporally constant isotopic composition of the pre event water and iii spatially and temporally constant isotopic composition of the event water if the pre event and event isotopic contents are not constant in space and time under assumptions ii and iii their variability should be accounted for in the mass balance approach in principal the inclusion of the temporal and spatial variability of isotopic signatures in the mass balance calculations requires some form of weighting averaging mcdonnell et al 1990 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 the above mentioned restrictions often limit the applicability of hydrograph separation using isotope data therefore van der hoven et al 2002 questioned validity of most hydrograph separations reported in the literature which did not consider the spatial and temporal variability in the individual compartments of subsurface reservoirs the incorporation of the spatial variability of the isotope content becomes difficult in cases of larger catchments and or catchments containing many different spatial structural units the existence of soil macropores often observed in mountainous hillslopes further invalidates the above stated assumptions as distinct isotopic composition between the preferential pathways and the soil matrix may develop to analyze the water and isotope transfer between macropores and the surrounding soil matrix van der hoven et al 2002 used a model based on the mobile immobile concept the analysis showed the sensitivity of the spatial distribution of pre storm o 18 on the estimates of pre event water contribution bazemore et al 1994 and genereux 1998 extended the original hydrograph separation procedure by including uncertainty in the estimates of pre event water fraction the uncertainty confidence intervals estimated in these analyses were found unrealistically high for groundwater and event water contributions to streamflow at the experimental site under the study the tomsovka hillslope site the isotope based hydrograph separation using observed isotopic signatures of pre event and event water during a single rainfall runoff episode was attempted by sanda et al 2009 however a systematic evaluation of the pre event water contribution to both hillslope and catchment runoff was difficult due to an underrepresentation of the isotopic data in space and time at the catchment scale the subsurface isotopic content prior to a rainfall event is usually derived from groundwater boreholes kelln et al 2007 penna et al 2015 votrubova et al 2017 and streamflow signals onda et al 2006 blume et al 2008 at the hillslope scale pre event isotopic signatures are often monitored using suction cups hangen et al 2001 sanda et al 2009 zero tension lysimeters mcguire et al 2002 williams et al 2009 and soil core samples garvelmann et al 2012 the choice of sampling method was found to influence the interpretation of the pre event isotopic signal in soil water klaus and mcdonnell 2013 reflecting different isotope composition of soil water present in the soil matrix and in the preferential pathways substantially variable vertical distributions of natural stable isotopes in hillslope soil profiles were reported e g thomas et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 mueller et al 2014 pre event isotopic signatures inferred from a limited number of point measurements have often been used in mass balance calculations to what extent a limited number of point measurements represents a given spatial unit hillslope riparian zone or catchment in respect to isotopic composition remains an open issue the variability of rainfall isotope content during a storm can also be significant rodhe 1987 and needs to be accounted for in the mass balance calculation mcdonnell et al 1990 furthermore the difference between the pre event and event water isotopic signatures has to be large enough to allow distinguishing between the respective components of runoff the drawbacks related to a simplistic use of isotopes in runoff separation studies can be avoided by applying more advanced modeling approaches such approaches may be also helpful in analyzing the assumptions of the isotope based hydrograph separation techniques and in assessing the accuracy of pre event event water fraction estimates the spatial variability of o 18 content in rainfall over the catchment area during an individual rainfall runoff event can be significant e g mcguire et al 2005 yet it is often assumed negligible for small headwater catchments e g swistock et al 1989 kendall et al 2001 kennedy et al 2012 fischer et al 2017 analyzed the effects of spatial and temporal variations of the rainfall isotopic composition in an instrumented catchment in switzerland the spatial variability of o 18 content in rainwater affected the runoff separation to a larger extent than did the different weighting methods accounting for temporal o 18 variations in rainfall this finding is in agreement with the study of lyon et al 2009 who found very contrasting results of the isotope based hydrograph separation using o 18 content in rainfall sampled from two different locations within the catchment the spatial variability of o 18 content in rainwater is however of less importance for relatively short hillslopes 50 m a canopy interception was reported to influence the isotopic composition of throughfall brodersen et al 2000 allen et al 2015 sprenger et al 2016 processes occurring on canopy may thus change the rainfall isotopic composition at much smaller scale even relevant for short hillslope segments stormflow as one of the most important runoff mechanisms in headwater catchments usually develops as saturated flow above the soil bedrock interface during prominent rainfall runoff events the onset of stormflow is commonly accelerated by the presence of macropores and biopores in a soil profile potentially forming a network of interconnected preferential pathways nieber and sidle 2010 leaney et al 1993 showed high contribution of event water 80 90 to hillslope subsurface runoff which was explained by rapid flow through a macropore system other studies e g burns et al 2001 mcglynn et al 2004 weiler and mcdonnell 2007 demonstrated that event water in hillslope and catchment runoff is a small fraction of the total even in cases where preferential flow is a significant factor of discharge generation kienzler and naef 2008 found a strong dependence of the pre event water fraction on the mechanism initiating flow in preferential flowpaths physically based models may help to analyze experimental observations at hillslope and catchment scales and to extrapolate our hypotheses about transport mechanisms beyond existing measurements such modeling framework was previously used in analyses focused on dynamics of subsurface flow e g dusek and vogel 2016 ala aho et al 2017 the importance of including both water flow data and tracer transport information into a conceptual model to adequately describe flowpaths in soils has been recognized e g by uhlenbrook et al 2004 coppola et al 2009 and köhne et al 2009 the model analysis with additional information on solute transport led to a more robust description of subsurface runoff processes at the hillslope scale vogel et al 2010 in respect to the isotope transport in soils detailed data vs model comparisons remain limited in the literature with the exception of a few studies e g stumpp et al 2009 rothfuss et al 2012 dusek et al 2017 the fundamental driving forces of water flow in soils are gravity and pressure gradients beside advection the transport of environmental tracers in soils is a subject of additional processes such as molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion known together as hydrodynamic dispersion homogeneous soils with a macroscopically uniform flow field are often characterized by a relatively small value of dispersivity the mechanical dispersion of a tracer is therefore less significant in structured and heterogeneous porous systems dispersivity values are expected to increase gelhar et al 1992 these aspects need to be taken into account when interpreting the pre event water contribution to event driven hillslope discharge predicted by an isotope based hydrograph separation technique neglecting tracer dispersion in the interpretation of isotope based hydrograph separations was disputed in the numerical analyses performed by jones et al 2006 and park et al 2011 these studies suggested that the paradox of the rapid mobilization of old water kirchner 2003 can be explained by hydrodynamic dispersion and mixing between pre event and event water the analyses of jones et al 2006 and park et al 2011 consistently showed enhanced pre event water contribution to streamflow when hydrodynamic dispersion mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion was included surprisingly the scenario based on advective and diffusive flux with neglected mechanical dispersion showed similar pre event fraction as the scenario based on highly dispersive flux jones et al 2006 the conclusions of jones et al 2006 were questioned by renaud et al 2007 who insisted that the debated hydrograph separation technique is a proper method to identify the temporal origin of water in runoff the discrepancy could be probably explained by the fact that jones et al 2006 and park et al 2011 evaluated the relative significance of the factors affecting pre event water contributions in simplified spatial configurations and did not cover the real conditions of natural rainfall runoff events the objective of this study is to analyze subsurface flow and transport processes controlling the composition of hillslope discharge in terms of pre event and event water in particular we examine the rapid hydrological response of a hillslope in which subsurface stormflow is delivered by a system of preferential pathways the temporal origin of water in the hillslope discharge and spatial patterns of pre event and event water mixing were studied by means of numerical experiments a two dimensional dual continuum model was used to describe the transport of natural stable isotope o 18 in the hillslope segment during three growing seasons the inherent assumptions of the isotope based hydrograph separation technique were examined by conducting simulations of selected rainfall runoff episodes involving synthetic isotopic signatures more specifically the effects of i hydrodynamic mixing ii the spatial variation of the isotope content in pre event water and iii the temporal distribution of the isotope content in event water were analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and data the experimental hillslope site tomsovka is located in the headwater catchment uhlirska jizera mountains north bohemia czech republic total area of the catchment is 1 78 km2 average altitude is 820 m above sea level mean annual precipitation is 1380 mm and mean annual temperature is 4 7 c the studied hillslope is covered by young spruce forest picea abies with an herbaceous understory the soil surface as well as the soil bedrock interface are approximately planar and parallel the average slope is about 14 the soil is a sandy loam classified as cryptopodzol it is relatively shallow about 70 cm deep the internal structure of the soil is well developed the soil profile consists of three layers with different hydraulic properties table 1 the soil layers are underlain by a transition zone of weathered granite bedrock 5 10 m thick sanda and cislerova 2009 the transition zone then changes into a compact porphyritic biotite granite bedrock the interface between the third soil layer and the transition zone at the depth of about 70 cm is further on referred to as soil bedrock interface the soil hydraulic parameters characterizing each soil layer were derived from laboratory measurements in which undisturbed 100 cm3 soil samples and 1000 cm3 soil cores were used to determine the soil water retention parameters and the saturated hydraulic conductivity respectively sanda and cislerova 2009 the parameters derived from the laboratory measurements were adjusted based on the variations of soil water content and soil water pressure observed in situ dohnal et al 2006a b the resulting hydraulic parameters are listed in table 1 in addition the saturated hydraulic conductivity at the soil bedrock interface was determined by a disk infiltrometer sanda and cislerova 2009 reported significant preferential flow effects at the tomsovka site affecting the hillslope hydraulic response to rainfall preferential flow was attributed to highly conductive pathways along tree roots as well as to the soil structure and the spatial variability of local soil hydraulic properties overland flow is rarely observed at tomsovka due to highly permeable topsoil layer over the period of interest growing seasons 2007 2008 and 2009 hydrological and micrometeorological conditions were monitored with 10 min temporal resolution subsurface hillslope discharge was measured at an 8 m long experimental trench fig 1 a the trench consisted of two individual sections labeled as a and b each 4 m long shallow subsurface hillslope discharge was collected separately in each section at the depth of 75 cm the discharge rates q a and q b were measured by tipping buckets during growing seasons from may to november although the geographic watershed divide is located approximately 130 m above the experimental trench the trench was found to drain a much shorter hillslope length 25 50 m dusek et al 2012a this could be explained by a discontinuity of the underlying bedrock observed by vertical electrical sounding survey sanda and cislerova 2009 for the conversion of the observed volumetric hillslope discharge to specific stormflow per unit contribution area the contributing length of 25 m was assumed for the modeling purposes the hillslope micro catchments corresponding to trench sections a and b were assumed to have approximately the same geometric and material properties hillslope length depth to bedrock soil stratification soil hydraulic properties etc the differences in the measured discharge hydrographs q a vs q b were attributed to the spatial variability of preferential pathways especially in terms of their lateral connectivity the o 18 content at the tomsovka site was measured in i precipitation collected from the rain gauge ii subsurface hillslope discharge collected from the two sections of the experimental trench and iii soil water extracted from two depths by suction cups the o 18 o 16 ratio in water was expressed as δ18o given in parts per thousand the delta values represent relative deviations of measured o 18 o 16 ratios from the isotopic composition of the vienna standard mean ocean water o 18 contents were measured by a laser spectroscope lgr liquid water isotope analyzer los gatos research inc ca penna et al 2010 the manufacturer declared precision of δ18o measurements is 0 2 rainwater samples were collected at daily intervals provided that the amount of rainfall since the previous sampling had exceeded 5 mm in 2007 or 1 mm in 2008 and 2009 as each sample corresponded to cumulative rainfall for the period between two samplings the measured o 18 content represented the average value for this period the o 18 content in hillslope discharge was measured in samples collected at 6 h intervals 3 h intervals in 2009 provided that at least 8 5 l of water had been accumulated since the previous sampling the o 18 content was determined for combined discharge from both trench sections i e separate o 18 contents for trench sections a and b were not available the o 18 values measured during intensive stormflow episodes represent nearly instantaneous δ18o values in case that discharge rates became lower mixing of the effluent water occurred and the respective δ18o values therefore represent time averaged values resident δ18o values were measured by suction cups installed at the depths of 30 and 60 cm located 3 m upslope from the trench sampling was conducted at monthly intervals more detailed information on suction cups sampling of soil water was given by vogel et al 2010 and dusek et al 2017 2 2 flow and transport model soil water flow and isotope transport in the hillslope segment was simulated by a dual continuum model gerke and van genuchten 1993a vogel et al 2000a the dual set of governing equations eqs 1 2 4 and 5 was solved numerically using the computer program s2d vogel et al 2000a based on the fully implicit galerkin finite element method according to the dual continuum model the flow domain consists of two hydraulically interacting pore domains the soil matrix domain subscript m and the preferential flow domain subscript f flow of water in the dual continuum system is described by a set of two dimensional richards equations 1 c f h f t k f h f k f z s f γ w w f 2 c m h m t k m h m k m z s m γ w w m where for each of the two flow domains h denotes the pressure head m k the hydraulic conductivity tensor m s 1 c the specific soil water capacity m 1 w f is the relative volumetric fraction of the preferential flow domain with w m 1 w f s is the sink term representing the local intensity of root water uptake s 1 z is the vertical coordinate m taken to be positive upward t is time s and γw is the water transfer term describing the interdomain exchange of water s 1 the set of equations is solved for pressure head h t x z where x is the horizontal coordinate the transfer term γw is assumed to be proportional to the local pressure head difference between the preferential flow and the soil matrix domains gerke and van genuchten 1993b it is expressed as 3 γ w α ws k ar h f h m where αws is the water transfer coefficient at saturation m 1 s 1 and k ar is the relative unsaturated conductivity of the domain interface values of k ar range from 0 to 1 depending on the soil matrix and preferential flow domain conductivities evaluated for the upstream soil water pressure gerke et al 2013 the transport of o 18 in the dual continuum system is described by two coupled advection dispersion equations e g vogel et al 2000a 4 θ f c f t θ f d f c f q f c f s f c f γ s w f 5 θ m c m t θ m d m c m q m c m s m c m γ s w m where c is the δ18o concentration in soil water θ is the volumetric soil water content m3 m 3 q is the vector of soil water flux m s 1 d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor m2 s 1 and γs is the solute transfer term describing interdomain solute mass transfer s 1 the set of equations is solved for solute concentration c t x z the values of θ q and d evaluated using the solution of richards equations are independent of c the mass transfer term γs is defined as local mass flux directed from one flow domain to the other gerke and van genuchten 1993b it is expressed as 6 γ s γ w c i α ss θ ar c f c m where αss is the solute transfer coefficient at saturation s 1 and θar is the effective degree of saturation at the domain interface the first term on the right hand side represents the advective interdomain exchange driven by the soil water pressure difference for this term c i c f is assumed when water flows from the preferential flow domain to the soil matrix for the opposite flow direction c i c m the second term accounts for the diffusive exchange due to the concentration gradient the rate of diffusive exchange is controlled by the values of αss and θar in our model the coefficient θar is assumed to be equal to the relative saturation of the preferential flow domain ray et al 2004 hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor d is a second rank tensor composed of molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion the components of the tensor d are evaluated according to bear 1972 as 7 d ij d 0 τ δ ij λ t q θ δ ij λ l λ t θ q q i q j where d 0 is the molecular diffusion coefficient m2 s 1 λl and λt are the longitudinal and transversal dispersivity m respectively q is the magnitude of the water flux vector δij is the kronecker delta function δij 1 for the diagonal components and δij 0 for the off diagonal components the dimensionless tortuosity factor τ is evaluated as τ θ7 3 θs 2 millington and quirk 1961 the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities λl and λt characterize the process of mechanical dispersion small values of dispersivity induce weak dispersive flux such condition is assumed in a relatively homogeneous porous system with a nearly uniform flow field in general the estimation of dispersivity values remains difficult especially under field conditions longitudinal dispersivity is usually assumed in the range of 1 10 to 1 20 of the transport problem spatial scale and transverse dispersivity as a fraction of longitudinal dispersivity gelhar et al 1992 2 3 mass balance approach for hydrograph separation to distinguish pre event and event water in shallow subsurface runoff a two component mass balance approach was applied e g buttle 1998 this approach is based on a simple set of equations expressing mass balances of water and a conservative tracer respectively 8 q t q p t q e t 9 c t q t c p q p t c e q e t or equivalently 10 f p t f e t 1 11 f e t c t c p c e c p where q is the total discharge from a hillslope segment m3 s 1 q p and q e are the contributions from pre event and event water respectively c is the tracer concentration in the hillslope discharge c p and c e are the tracer concentrations in pre event and event water respectively f e q e q and f p q p q are the dimensionless event and pre event water fractions respectively since the stable water isotopes are assumed to behave as conservative tracers the isotope concentrations change only by mixing if c p and c e are known constant or with a known variability and q t and c t are measured q p and q e can be calculated by combining eqs 8 and 9 2 4 temporal variability of o 18 in rainfall mcdonnell et al 1990 described several weighting techniques to account for the temporal variability of isotopic composition in rainfall the incremental weighting mean technique proposed by mcdonnell et al 1990 represents an improvement of standard weighting mean technique nevertheless mcdonnell et al 1990 noted that this technique is not entirely correct as different rainfall pulses during the event lead to variable response in streamflow according to the incremental weighting mean technique the value of c e is evaluated as 12 c e t j i 1 j p i δ 18 o i i 1 j p i where p i is the precipitation amount m and δ18oi is the isotope value observed at the ith sample during the event 3 numerical simulations the two dimensional dual continuum model s2d was used to simulate flow of water and transport of o 18 in the hillslope segment during three consecutive growing seasons 2007 2009 in addition nine significant rainfall episodes observed at tomsovka over the period from may 2007 to november 2009 were selected for further numerical experiments fig 2 what follows is a brief recapitulation of the geometric material initial and boundary conditions that were used to carry out the numerical simulations details about the application of the 2d dual continuum model at tomsovka were presented in our previous studies dusek and vogel 2014 2016 where the model predictions of hillslope discharge and soil water status were compared with experimental data 3 1 hillslope geometry soil properties initial and boundary conditions soil plant atmosphere interactions determining the hydrological response of the hillslope segment to the rainfall episodes involved rainfall evaporation plant transpiration and plant root water uptake the rainfall intensities were organized in one hour series the daily potential evapotranspiration was calculated using penman monteith equation monteith 1981 based on micrometeorological data observed directly at the hillslope site the root water uptake represented by the sink term s in eqs 1 and 2 was described according to feddes et al 1978 given the humid character of the experimental hillslope site the actual evapotranspiration calculated by the 2d model was equal to the potential rate the simulations were performed for a 30 m long and 3 m deep 2d vertical cross section of the hillslope fig 1b assuming the same geometry as in our previous studies dusek and vogel 2014 2016 the flow domain spanned 25 m above and 5 m below the experimental trench to correctly account for the fluxes in the vicinity of the trench the hillslope length contributing to discharge was thus 25 m a constant slope of 14 was considered the 2d flow domain was discretized into 283 113 triangular elements identical boundary conditions were used for both flow domains the preferential flow and soil matrix domains the upslope face of the experimental trench was modeled as a seepage face with the effective height of 55 cm permitting water to discharge under saturated conditions only i e for local pressure head values of h 0 at the bottom boundary at the depth of 3 m free drainage condition was imposed allowing water to leave the 2d domain at the rate equal to unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at the vertical upslope and downslope sides of the computational domain no flow and seepage face boundary conditions were prescribed respectively the soil hydraulic characteristics of the soil and bedrock matrices as well as of the preferential flow domain were parameterized using the modified van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 vogel and cislerova 1988 vogel et al 2000b the values of soil hydraulic parameters and interdomain transfer coefficients were taken from our previous studies vogel et al 2010 dusek and vogel 2014 2016 the parameters of the soil matrix and preferential flow domains are listed in table 1 the domain specific properties θrm θrf θsm θsf k sm and k sf given in table 1 are related to those of the bulk soil by the respective volumetric domain fractions gerke and van genuchten 1993a for instance bulk related value of the saturated water content of the dual continuum system is evaluated as θs θsm w m θsf w f the volumetric fraction of the preferential flow domain w f was set to 7 at the soil surface and 5 at the depth of 75 cm with a linear variation between the two endpoints the values of αws and αss eqs 3 and 6 were also estimated to decrease linearly between the soil surface and the lower boundary 1 and 0 01 cm 1 d 1 for αws and 0 001 and 0 0001 d 1 for αss which corresponded to the decreasing trend of saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix domain the anisotropy ratio in respect to principal directions x and z for the hydraulic conductivity tensor of the preferential flow domain was set equal to k x x k z z 10 where x is directed along the slope and z is perpendicular to x see fig 1b indicating the increased conductivity of the laterally continuous network of preferential pathways along the local hillslope gradient the increased lateral conductivity was assumed to represent the preferential flow domain formed by pathways along tree roots and biopores as well as lateral soil structural features for o 18 transport modeling the δ18o values were treated as solute concentrations denoted as c in eqs 4 and 5 the initial o 18 content at the beginning of each of the simulated growing seasons was derived from observed resident δ18o values determined in soil water extracted by suction cups assuming linear interpolation in the vertical direction a flux concentration third type boundary condition was used at the soil surface prescribing measured δ18o in precipitation zero concentration gradient was used at the upslope face of the experimental trench and the bottom boundary which allowed the isotope to leave the simulated domain freely with the discharging water at the vertical upslope and downslope sides of the computational domain zero flux and zero concentration gradient boundary conditions were prescribed respectively the value of longitudinal dispersivity was set to 20 cm dusek et al 2012b while transverse dispersivity was fixed at 5 cm the values of dispersivities were modified in numerical experiments evaluating hydrodynamic mixing the molecular diffusion coefficient of o 18 interpreted as self diffusion coefficient of water was set equal to 2 cm2 d 1 singleton et al 2004 in the simulations the transport of stable isotope o 18 was subject to advection hydrodynamic dispersion and root water uptake only we assumed that no fractionation of the oxygen isotope occurred when soil water was taken up by plant roots for transpiration allison et al 1984 during growing seasons the soil surface is fully covered with dense vegetation layer and infiltration is rapid thus we could assume that transpiration dominates over direct soil evaporation and the o 18 enrichment of soil water due to soil surface evaporation could also be neglected dispersion took place in both the soil matrix domain and the preferential flow domain the o 18 isotope could also migrate between the two domains according to the local soil water pressure and concentration differences 3 2 long term simulations the long term simulations of subsurface flow at tomsovka were compared quantitatively with experimental data hillslope discharge and soil water pressure in our previous study dusek and vogel 2014 the transport of o 18 at tomsovka was studied by vogel et al 2010 dohnal et al 2012 and dusek et al 2012b 2017 however they used a simplified one dimensional approach to model both vertical and lateral flow and transport in this approach two and three dimensional flow and transport patterns were neglected in the present analysis a two dimensional approach is used to study the spatial distribution of pre event event water within the hillslope segment as well as the spatial distribution of fluxes and mixing transfer processes while considering more realistic hydraulic conditions above the soil bedrock interface the q t and c t values obtained from the long term simulations based on natural isotopic signatures were used to estimate the pre event water contribution to the hillslope discharge by means of the isotopic mass balance method however the obtained isotopic contrast between the pre event and event water was not sufficient to allow for a meaningful hillslope hydrograph separation for two thirds of the selected rainfall runoff episodes as a result additional numerical experiments involving synthetic isotopic signatures were conducted 3 3 episodal simulations the rainfall runoff episodes selected for further numerical experiments fig 2 were characterized by continuous hillslope discharge lasting more than 2 days three runoff episodes 2 3 and 8 had a relatively small measured discharge volume 0 9 m3 i e 9 mm runoff height while the remaining six episodes i e 1 4 5 6 7 and 9 were characterized by at least 2 9 m3 29 mm of runoff volume fig 2 the largest runoff volume was observed during episode 9 when trench sections a and b showed hillslope discharge of 13 0 m3 130 mm and 19 8 m3 198 mm respectively the following numerical experiments were carried out for the selected rainfall runoff episodes i simulations involving different degrees of hydrodynamic mixing in the hillslope segment in these simulations contrasting synthetic o 18 signatures were used for both pre event and event water signatures ii simulations involving a spatially variable isotopic composition of soil water at the beginning of the individual rainfall runoff episodes the respective 2d distributions of δ18o were taken from the long term simulations in these simulations a contrasting synthetic o 18 content in rainfall was applied instead of the observed o 18 signature iii simulations involving the observed temporal distributions of o 18 content in rainfall in these simulations contrasting synthetic o 18 contents in pre event water were applied instead of the pre event water o 18 distributions predicted by the long term simulations all simulations were based on real rainfall runoff episodes i e with actual rainfall intensities the model was used as a tool to study mixing and movement of event and pre event water under real atmospheric conditions the contrasting synthetic values of δ18o in rainfall were set equal to 3 in all respective simulations the synthetic δ18o values in pre event water were assumed to be equal to 18 to make an arbitrary yet still reasonable contrast to the event water note that the particular δ18o values chosen to represent the synthetic o 18 signatures have no impact on the estimation of the pre event water contribution to the hillslope discharge as long as a sufficient contrast between pre event and event water is established allowing the application of the isotopic mass balance method in the numerical simulations designed to study the effect of hydrodynamic mixing three different scenarios were considered i weak mixing combining weak mechanical dispersion with molecular diffusion ii medium mixing with mechanical dispersion λl and λt equal 20 cm and 5 cm respectively and molecular diffusion and iii enhanced mixing involving enhanced mechanical dispersion λl and λt equal 100 cm and 25 cm respectively and molecular diffusion the values of both dispersivities were set to 1 mm for weak mixing scenario these values effectively eliminate mechanical dispersion while maintaining numerical stability of solution of the governing equations note that for all three scenarios advective flux was the fundamental transport process 3 4 estimation of pre event water contribution to hillslope discharge the pre event water contribution to the hillslope discharge was estimated using the mass balance approach eqs 8 and 9 for all rainfall runoff episodes the q t and c t values necessary for the evaluation of the isotopic mass balance in the hillslope discharge were taken from the individual episodal simulations the pre event water contribution was evaluated in of the hillslope discharge volume for each rainfall runoff episode in the case of the numerical experiments involving spatially variable pre event o 18 content in soil water a single average value was substituted for c p to represent the pre event conditions in the mass balance calculations this value was determined by averaging the pre event o 18 content in both flow domains and by combining the resulting values into a single composite value the value of c e was set equal to the synthetic o 18 content in rainfall 3 in the case of the numerical experiments involving the observed isotopic composition of rainfall the incremental weighting mean technique eq 12 was used in the mass balance calculations to determine the value of c e fig 3 the value of c p was set equal to the synthetic o 18 content 18 4 results 4 1 seasonal stormflow dynamics and isotope transport the observed and simulated variations of subsurface stormflow during the three growing seasons are presented in fig 2 the peak discharges were mostly underpredicted by the model the root mean square error rmse comparing observed and predicted stormflow was 16 3 l h 1 and 22 0 l h 1 for trench sections a and b respectively the respective nash sutcliffe model efficiency values were 0 562 and 0 689 nevertheless the differences in measured hillslope discharge between runoff from trench sections a and b was greater rmse of 24 5 l h 1 than the differences between model predictions and data preferential pathways supplied the dominant part of total hillslope discharge 98 6 while the soil matrix contribution to stormflow was found negligible dusek and vogel 2014 the results of the long term o 18 transport simulations are presented in figs 4 and 5 the observed variations of δ18o in stormflow are compared with the model predictions in fig 4 the sampling procedure applied to the hillslope effluent in the trench did not allow distinguishing between the contributions from the soil matrix and the preferential pathways nevertheless our previous analyses indicated that the hillslope discharge was generated by preferential pathways vogel et al 2010 dusek et al 2012b dusek and vogel 2014 2016 this is confirmed in the present study where the simulated variations of δ18o in hillslope discharge from the preferential flow domain were similar to those observed in stormflow the value of rmse for δ18o in stormflow for the preferential flow domain was 0 574 suggesting high coherency with the observation the simulated δ18o in discharge from the soil matrix showed only limited direct response to event forcing an improved data model agreement could be possibly obtained for different combinations of longitudinal and transversal dispersivities in contrast to the dynamic fluctuations of δ18o in stormflow the observed δ18o values in soil pore water reflect seasonal long term variations fig 5 the simulated δ18o values in the soil matrix are in a good agreement with those measured with the suction cups the values of rmse for δ18o in pore water at the depths of 30 cm and 60 cm are 0 701 and 0 345 respectively the individual components of the hillslope water balance determined for the selected rainfall runoff episodes are presented in table 2 the results show a nonlinear character of the hillslope response for different combinations of initial saturation and atmospheric forcing associated with the temporal distribution of rainfall and evapotranspiration depending on the initial hillslope storage characterizing the antecedent moisture conditions in the hillslope prior to rainfall the change of the hillslope water storage was either positive or negative leakage to bedrock defined as deep percolation groundwater recharge through the soil bedrock interface constitutes an important sink of the hillslope water balance this is due to the semipermeable weathered bedrock underlying the shallow hillslope soil nevertheless leakage to bedrock remained smaller than stormflow for all episodes except for episode 2 where it was of a similar magnitude a significant contribution to the leakage originated from near saturated conditions which prevailed above the soil bedrock interface near the trench dusek and vogel 2016 the q t and c t values obtained from the long term simulations were used to estimate the pre event water contribution to the hillslope discharge the partitioning of stormflow into pre event and event water was not possible for six episodes 1 3 4 6 7 and 8 out of nine because of the similarity of pre event c p and event c e isotopic signatures during these episodes leading to unrealistic values of pre event and event fractions cf eq 10 4 2 hillslope hydrograph separation the results of the simulations involving contrasting synthetic isotopic signatures in both rainwater δ18o 3 and pre event water δ18o 18 made it possible to estimate the pre event water contributions for the individual rainfall runoff episodes in table 3 under the medium hydrodynamic mixing scenario the estimates of the pre event water contribution to hillslope discharge in of total runoff volume for selected rainfall runoff episodes are listed the estimates of the pre event water contribution in mm of runoff height to hillslope discharge are given in table 2 in fig 6 a the hydrograph separation performed for rainfall runoff episode 1 is shown for this multiple peak episode the pre event water contribution equaled 65 of the total stormflow sustaining the hillslope discharge during both rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph fig 6b shows the individual contributions of the three rainfall pulses of episode 1 4 3 the effect of hydrodynamic mixing the results of the episodic simulations designed to study the effect of hydrodynamic mixing on the pre event water contribution to the hillslope discharge are summarized in table 3 the degree of hydrodynamic mixing was controlled by molecular diffusion mechanical dispersion and the temporal distribution of rainfall intensities and durations during rainfall runoff episodes the rainfall runoff episodes with a large amount of stored water prior to the rainfall and multiple rainfall pulses showed a complex pattern of soil water and o 18 fluxes resulting in significant differences between the different hydrodynamic mixing scenarios table 3 the pre event water contribution to hillslope discharge for the three different scenarios of hydrodynamic mixing during rainfall runoff episode 1 is shown in fig 7 the scenario based on enhanced hydrodynamic mixing showed greater contribution of pre event water compared to weak and medium mixing scenarios table 3 this clearly indicates that the estimates of pre event water contribution to total runoff cannot be associated with advective flow only in fig 8 the spatial distributions of event water fractions in the soil matrix and preferential flow domains for scenarios assuming weak and enhanced hydrodynamic mixing are shown the figure indicates significantly different distributions of event water in the hillslope segment for these two contrasting scenarios due to reduced mixing sharp interfaces between water bodies with the varying value of event fractions developed in both pore domains for the weak mixing scenario fig 8a a mixture of pre event and event water was predicted for the enhanced mixing scenario fig 8b the weak mixing scenario showed low amounts of pre event water in the preferential flow domain most of the pre event water was stored in the soil matrix above the soil bedrock interface no distinct event water body is apparent under the enhanced mixing scenario 4 4 the effect of the pre event o 18 distribution in the hillslope segment the spatial distributions of the pre event δ18o in the soil matrix domain derived from the long term simulations for all selected rainfall runoff episodes are shown in fig 9 the distributions suggest that the dispersive fluxes of o 18 in the soil profile were predominantly vertical the differences in o 18 distributions among the episodes were more pronounced than the differences in the lateral direction along the hillslope segment the variability of o 18 content in the vertical direction was significant it was greater in the preferential flow domain than in the soil matrix domain due to the lateral flow component along the soil bedrock interface not shown as expected the δ18o values in the soil matrix domain were different from those in the preferential flow domain the effect of the pre event o 18 distribution on the pre event water contribution to the hillslope discharge is quantified in table 3 the pre event water contributions obtained under the assumption of spatially variable pre event o 18 content are compared to those obtained with constant synthetic pre event o 18 content the pre event water contribution resulting from variable o 18 signatures ranged from 53 to 85 among the episodes the differences in the estimates of pre event water contributions between scenarios based on constant and spatially variable o 18 content were from 0 5 to 5 4 4 5 the effect of temporal variations of o 18 content in rainfall there was a significant temporal variability of δ18o during most of the selected episodes fig 3 the observed variation range of δ18o was greater than 2 during a given episode the variations of δ18o among the selected episodes were also significant the highest difference was 7 in table 3 the estimates of the pre event water contribution to the hillslope discharge based on the observed temporal variations of rainfall o 18 content in the episode simulations and incremental weighting technique in the mass balance calculations are presented these contributions can be compared with those obtained from the scenarios based on medium hydrodynamic mixing involving constant synthetic o 18 contents in rainfall the results ranging from 1 2 to 0 7 indicate little difference 5 discussion 5 1 the mixing mechanisms it is important to note that two different concepts of mixing relevant to hillslope runoff were considered in this study i mixing between water in the soil matrix and in the preferential pathways and ii mixing between pre event and event water to illustrate these mixing mechanisms the transfer of o 18 between the soil matrix and preferential flow domain and the event pre event water fraction distributions are shown in fig 10 the 2d distribution of the soil water transfer rates revealed that water flow above the soil bedrock interface and in the topsoil 0 20 cm depth was directed from the soil matrix to the preferential flow domain dusek and vogel 2014 although the diffusive o 18 transfer was predominantly directed in the opposite way the overall interdomain transfer of o 18 was consistent with the water flow fig 10a due to the overriding effect of the advective transfer as expected an intense exchange of o 18 took place above the soil bedrock interface and in the topsoil during rainfall runoff episodes with significant stormflow response quickly draining preferential pathways with mixture of pre event and event water higher fraction of pre event water formed the total hillslope discharge mixing of pre event and event water occurred mostly above the soil bedrock interface fig 10c and was associated with the interdomain transfer of o 18 fig 10a intensive mixing took place near the trench where hydraulically active zone developed this zone was characterized by shorter residence times of o 18 compared to upslope locations 5 2 the source of pre event water the volume of pre event water estimated from the simulations involving contrasting synthetic isotopic signatures in both rainwater and pre event water was found to be a significant component of the water balance table 2 despite the dominant role played by preferential flow in the generation of hillslope stormflow the pre event water formed 52 84 of total subsurface stormflow see table 3 under medium hydrodynamic mixing the contribution of pre event water to the hillslope discharge was closely related to the degree of soil saturation at the beginning of the event as expected drier soil conditions prior to an event led to a smaller contribution of pre event water to hillslope discharge this is in agreement with recent studies e g cras et al 2007 james and roulet 2009 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 the numerical experiments involving distinctive synthetic isotopic signatures of the individual rainfall pulses during rainfall runoff episode 1 allowed distinguishing between different rainfall pulse contributions to the hillslope discharge fig 6b in addition to the pre event water contribution of 65 to the total volume of hillslope discharge the rainfall pulses i ii and iii generated the event water contributions of 19 6 and 10 respectively the results of this separation suggest different activation and participation of event water originating from the three rainfall sub events in overall runoff process the individual contribution of each rainfall sub event pulses i iii to discharge was affected by storm characteristics pre event water volume and its spatial distribution in the hillslope segment the hydrograph separation further indicated that only 14 of rainwater discharged as event water contribution and 86 of rainwater remained in the hillslope segment at the end of this episode it is further stressed that the preferential pathways in our case occupy a small proportion of the bulk soil 5 7 hence the storage of water in the preferential flow domain is insignificant compared to the soil matrix for instance the initial water storage in the preferential flow domain prior to episode 1 was as small as 0 2 mm however the pre event contribution to stormflow delivered by the preferential pathways was equal to 43 mm table 2 this points out to the soil matrix origin of the pre event water mcdonnell 1990 proposed a conceptual model of runoff generation at the maimai catchment with two contrasting features i rapid delivery runoff mechanism through soil macropores cracks and soil pipes and ii contribution of the pre event water dominating 85 streamflow during the runoff events at his hillslope unit tensiometric measurements suggested nonequlibrium in pressure heads initiated by water flow through vertical cracks and lateral soil pipes as opposed to uniform water flow in the soil matrix the event water was delivered towards the soil bedrock interface by vertical preferential flow where the new water was proposed to back up into the soil matrix then the event water was mixed with a much larger volume of pre event water stored in the soil matrix flow in lateral soil pipes at the base of the soil profile once activated upon saturation contributed to stormflow stormflow involved well mixed water composed mostly of pre event water mcdonnell 1990 concluded that the shift of the event water signatures to that of the pre event water is a key process in understanding of runoff generation in the following study mcdonnell et al 1998 further increased complexity of the hillslope system by pointing to a control of bedrock topography on soil water residence times mobility and mixing of pre event and event water the dominant contribution of pre event water in hillslope runoff released through preferential pathways was noted in several studies e g mcdonnell 1990 kienzler and naef 2008 klaus et al 2013 the findings of these studies were based on extensive measurement campaigns in the present study we used the two dimensional dual continuum model to explicitly quantify the exchange of pre event water stored in the soil matrix with the preferential pathways during the runoff events thus elucidating the mechanisms of rapid pre event water delivery in macroporous hillslope in agreement with the study of mcdonnell 1990 spatially and temporally variable exchange of water between the preferential pathways and the soil matrix was found to be a critical process in the hillslope runoff formation in our case though the exchange of water was directed from the soil matrix to preferential pathways near the soil bedrock interface resembling soil drainage rather than the back up mechanism of mcdonnell 1990 5 3 failure of mass balance approach when using natural o 18 signatures in this study the estimation of pre event water fraction was not possible for two thirds of the selected rainfall runoff episodes due to similar isotopic signatures of pre event and event water likewise temporal variations of o 18 in rainfall observed in the study of fischer et al 2017 precluded the separation of old and new water in five out of ten analyzed runoff events in general the hydrograph separation could be alternatively facilitated by using multiple tracers or developing other experimental approaches 5 4 diffusive and dispersive fluxes as mentioned above the estimates of lateral and transversal dispersivities under field transient conditions are difficult to obtain vanderborght and vereecken 2007 showed that considerably larger dispersivities were observed for saturated than for unsaturated flow conditions larger values of dispersivities are also associated with soils of well developed structure vervoort et al 1999 in general the estimation of dispersivity values can be based on inverse modeling of long term transport of natural isotope or a field tracer experiment however such procedure would require an excessive computing time using a two dimensional model in our case the simulation results of seasonal isotope dynamics suggested that the weak mixing scenario was based on unrealistically low dispersivities the dispersivity values of the medium mixing scenario are assumed to represent more realistic transport conditions note that the change of dispersivity affects the o 18 transport but not the soil water movement itself diffusive fluxes play major role under the conditions of slow water flow characterized by a low value of peclet number bear 1972 the impact of molecular diffusion increases with the time spent by a water molecule in the flow system however under high flow conditions molecular diffusion becomes less important as mechanical dispersion dominates such conditions prevail during rainfall runoff episodes and especially in the preferential pathways where the lateral water fluxes above the soil bedrock interface are much higher than in the soil matrix dusek and vogel 2014 jones et al 2006 and park et al 2011 identified molecular diffusion as a significant process affecting the pre event water contribution to streamflow although it represents a minimal level of mixing between pre event and event water park et al 2011 jones et al 2006 considered a scenario with zero hydrodynamic dispersion under which both mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion were effectively eliminated this scenario was put in doubt by renaud et al 2007 suggesting that diffusion of o 18 is linked to the actual motion of water molecules themselves the scenario with zero hydrodynamic dispersion of jones et al 2006 resulted in unrealistically small predictions of pre event water contribution to streamflow by adding molecular diffusion the estimate of pre event water contribution increased dramatically jones et al 2006 this is not in agreement with the simulation results presented in this study where advection was found to be the most important process with respect to the delivery of pre event water to the hillslope discharge mechanical dispersion increased the pre event water contribution by a few percent up to 10 table3 for some episodes the estimated pre event water contributions did not differ substantially for chosen degrees of mechanical dispersion weak medium and enhanced mixing scenarios implying a limited impact of dispersivity on the contribution of pre event water to the hillslope discharge 5 5 spatial variability of pre event o 18 content in the soil profile in general the role of spatial variability of pre event o 18 content tends to be more important for hydrological conditions with a greater pre event water contribution this was partly confirmed by the results obtained in the present analysis as indicated by the differences between estimated pre event water contributions of episodes 2 7 and 8 table3 column 4 vs column 5 the results further suggest a pronounced effect of the differences between domain specific pre event o 18 distributions on the pre event water contribution to the hillslope discharge fig 11 as the dominant proportion of the hillslope discharge was delivered by the preferential flow domain the pre event distribution of o 18 in this flow domain was an important factor the rainfall runoff episodes characterized by a larger difference between o 18 values in the preferential flow domain and the soil matrix domain are associated with greater estimates of the pre event water contributions to the hillslope discharge episodes 3 and 8 in fig 11 the average o 18 content in the preferential flow domain was higher than in the soil matrix domain for most episodes the water transfer was directed from the soil matrix to quickly draining preferential flow domain the diffusive exchange of o 18 between the flow domains remained in the opposite direction nevertheless the overall interdomain exchange of o 18 was directed from the soil matrix to the preferential flow domain fig 10a larger isotopic gradient between the domains led to smaller o 18 exchange acting against the advective component of o 18 transfer as a result δ18o in the preferential flow domain was affected by o 18 from the soil matrix to a lesser extent thus the estimated pre event water contribution was greater for conditions with larger difference of o 18 content between the flow domains in conclusion the advective exchange of o 18 between the soil matrix domain and the preferential flow domain as well as the gradient of δ18o between the domains was crucial for the estimation of the pre event water contribution to the hillslope discharge this finding further highlights the role of the antecedent storm events in respect to o 18 distribution in the soil matrix and preferential pathways as noted by van der hoven et al 2002 5 6 temporal variability of o 18 content in rainfall as confirmed by the negligible differences between estimated pre event water contributions table 3 column 4 vs column 6 the incremental weighting technique for the mass balance calculation seems appropriate for assessing the temporal origin of water in hillslope discharge even for hillslopes where preferential flow is a dominant discharge component such as the tomsovka site for hillslopes with the pronounced contribution of event water and temporal isotopic variability in rainfall the type of the weighting technique used in the hydrograph separation is expected to have a greater impact on the estimate of pre event event water fractions smaller pre event water contributions to hillslope discharge were predicted when variable o 18 content in rainfall was considered table 3 compared to scenarios based on the constant o 18 content only two episodes resulted in higher pre event water contribution estimates episodes 4 and 7 the onset of these two episodes was characterized by a combination of isotopically heavier rainwater and high rainfall intensities the spatial distribution of soil water prior to an episode and the temporal rainfall distribution are factors that have a potential to change the quantification of pre event event water partitioning nevertheless the verification of this hypothesis may require further analysis based on a wider variety of rainfall patterns and hydrological conditions 6 summary and conclusions although the assumptions of tracer based hydrograph separation technique rarely meet real field conditions this technique is widely used to construct conceptual models of runoff processes in this study the assumptions of the isotope based hydrograph separation method were assessed quantitatively by means of numerical modeling of subsurface flow and transport in a hillslope segment long term natural isotope transport as well as nine synthetic isotope transport episodes derived from the observed rainfall runoff episodes were analyzed using a two dimensional dual continuum model pre event water contributions to the hillslope discharge were estimated through the two component isotopic mass balance method despite the dominant role of preferential flow in subsurface hillslope runoff the pre event water contribution was estimated to represent 52 84 of total subsurface stormflow storm characteristics and initial hillslope storage antecedent moisture conditions were found to affect significantly the pre event event water contribution to the hillslope discharge highly transient advective fluxes occurring during the rainfall runoff episodes were shown to facilitate the transfer of pre event water to hillslope discharge the results of isotope transport modeling suggested significant mixing within the hillslope segment within each of the two flow domains as well as between the domains soil matrix and preferential pathways diffusive and dispersive fluxes were important for the episodes characterized by a high initial hillslope storage and multiple peak rainfall intensities the spatially and temporally variable exchange of o 18 between the soil matrix and preferential pathways exerted a primary control on the temporal origin of water in the hillslope runoff the modeling approach applied revealed significant hydrodynamic mixing caused by both mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion the simulation scenarios involving enhanced mechanical dispersion resulted in the increased estimate of the pre event water contribution to hillslope discharge up to 10 compared to the scenarios with reduced dispersive mass flux enhanced hydrodynamic mixing of pre event and event water in the subsurface complicated the interpretation of the isotope based hydrograph separation for the simulations involving spatially variable pre event o 18 content the isotope mass transfer between the soil matrix and the preferential pathways as well as the gradient of δ18o between the two flow domains were found to be crucial for the estimates of the pre event event water fractions in the hillslope discharge the modeling results also highlight the role of the initial hillslope storage and its spatial distribution as well as the o 18 partitioning between the soil matrix and preferential pathways prior to the rainfall event the incremental weighting technique was an appropriate method to account for the temporal variability of the o 18 content in rainfall the spatial and temporal variations of the isotopic signatures of pre event and event water were found to have minor effects on the temporal origin of water in the hillslope discharge as estimated by the isotopic mass balance method nevertheless the similarity of the pre event and event isotopic contents precluded the partitioning of the hillslope discharge into pre event and event water components for two thirds of the selected rainfall runoff episodes when natural isotopic signatures instead of contrasting synthetic signatures were used in the mass balance calculations acknowledgments this study was

7150,the prevailing opinion on the temporal origin of water in a hillslope stormflow hydrograph is that the pre event water represents a dominant fraction such conclusion is usually based on hydrograph separation techniques using stable water isotopes or other conservative tracers in conjunction with a mass balance approach in this study a two dimensional dual continuum model was used to study preferential flow of water and transport of oxygen 18 o 18 in a vertical cross section of a hillslope located in a temperate spruce forest the effects of hydrodynamic mixing and the spatiotemporal variability of isotopic signatures on estimated pre event event water fractions in the hillslope discharge were studied by means of numerical simulation experiments pre event and event water contributions to hillslope stormflow were evaluated using a two component mass balance approach combined with the 2d flow and transport simulations involving real as well as synthetic o 18 signatures long term simulations of o 18 transport in the hillslope segment were compared with the observed o 18 content in soil water and in the hillslope effluent the results of the long term simulations indicated significant mixing of pre event and event water occurring near the subsurface trench and in the soil above the soil bedrock interface where the transfer of o 18 from the soil matrix to the preferential pathways takes place despite the dominant role of preferential flow in the generation of hillslope stormflow the pre event water formed 52 84 of total subsurface stormflow the mass balance approach failed in partitioning the hillslope discharge into the pre event event water components for two thirds of the selected rainfall runoff episodes due to similar natural isotopic signatures of pre event and event water the analysis showed that spatially and temporally variable exchange of o 18 between the soil matrix and preferential pathways exerted a primary control on the estimates of the temporal origin of water in the hillslope runoff it was demonstrated that the degree of hydrodynamic mixing in the flow domain played an important role in the interpretation of the isotope based hydrograph separation keywords hillslope hydrology hydrograph separation rainfall runoff relationship stormflow dual permeability model pre event water contribution mass balance approach 1 introduction runoff processes in headwater catchments occurring either on the land surface or in the subsurface are of vital importance for understanding streamflow generation and fluxes of nutrients the formation of streamflow in headwater catchments is not yet fully understood since many combinations of soil topography vegetation and geological conditions induce different mechanisms of runoff the same holds for the delivery mechanisms of pre event water to streamflow the results of separation techniques based on the mass balance approach point to a significant contribution of pre event water to catchment runoff as documented in a majority of studies performed worldwide see reviews on this subject from buttle 1994 and klaus and mcdonnell 2013 several different physical processes and mechanisms have been recognized to cause rapid mobilization of pre event water for instance lateral preferential flow translatory flow groundwater ridging and heterogeneous matrix flow e g buttle 1994 weiler and mcdonnell 2004 weiler et al 2005 catchment or hillslope hydrograph separation into two temporal components pre event old and event new water contributions using environmental tracers is a very popular technique owing to its simplicity nevertheless hydrometric and isotope field data have to be available in a detail temporal resolution to perform the isotope based hydrograph separation in addition certain fundamental assumptions have to be met the most crucial assumptions are e g buttle 1994 i significantly different isotopic content of the pre event and event water ii spatially and temporally constant isotopic composition of the pre event water and iii spatially and temporally constant isotopic composition of the event water if the pre event and event isotopic contents are not constant in space and time under assumptions ii and iii their variability should be accounted for in the mass balance approach in principal the inclusion of the temporal and spatial variability of isotopic signatures in the mass balance calculations requires some form of weighting averaging mcdonnell et al 1990 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 the above mentioned restrictions often limit the applicability of hydrograph separation using isotope data therefore van der hoven et al 2002 questioned validity of most hydrograph separations reported in the literature which did not consider the spatial and temporal variability in the individual compartments of subsurface reservoirs the incorporation of the spatial variability of the isotope content becomes difficult in cases of larger catchments and or catchments containing many different spatial structural units the existence of soil macropores often observed in mountainous hillslopes further invalidates the above stated assumptions as distinct isotopic composition between the preferential pathways and the soil matrix may develop to analyze the water and isotope transfer between macropores and the surrounding soil matrix van der hoven et al 2002 used a model based on the mobile immobile concept the analysis showed the sensitivity of the spatial distribution of pre storm o 18 on the estimates of pre event water contribution bazemore et al 1994 and genereux 1998 extended the original hydrograph separation procedure by including uncertainty in the estimates of pre event water fraction the uncertainty confidence intervals estimated in these analyses were found unrealistically high for groundwater and event water contributions to streamflow at the experimental site under the study the tomsovka hillslope site the isotope based hydrograph separation using observed isotopic signatures of pre event and event water during a single rainfall runoff episode was attempted by sanda et al 2009 however a systematic evaluation of the pre event water contribution to both hillslope and catchment runoff was difficult due to an underrepresentation of the isotopic data in space and time at the catchment scale the subsurface isotopic content prior to a rainfall event is usually derived from groundwater boreholes kelln et al 2007 penna et al 2015 votrubova et al 2017 and streamflow signals onda et al 2006 blume et al 2008 at the hillslope scale pre event isotopic signatures are often monitored using suction cups hangen et al 2001 sanda et al 2009 zero tension lysimeters mcguire et al 2002 williams et al 2009 and soil core samples garvelmann et al 2012 the choice of sampling method was found to influence the interpretation of the pre event isotopic signal in soil water klaus and mcdonnell 2013 reflecting different isotope composition of soil water present in the soil matrix and in the preferential pathways substantially variable vertical distributions of natural stable isotopes in hillslope soil profiles were reported e g thomas et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 mueller et al 2014 pre event isotopic signatures inferred from a limited number of point measurements have often been used in mass balance calculations to what extent a limited number of point measurements represents a given spatial unit hillslope riparian zone or catchment in respect to isotopic composition remains an open issue the variability of rainfall isotope content during a storm can also be significant rodhe 1987 and needs to be accounted for in the mass balance calculation mcdonnell et al 1990 furthermore the difference between the pre event and event water isotopic signatures has to be large enough to allow distinguishing between the respective components of runoff the drawbacks related to a simplistic use of isotopes in runoff separation studies can be avoided by applying more advanced modeling approaches such approaches may be also helpful in analyzing the assumptions of the isotope based hydrograph separation techniques and in assessing the accuracy of pre event event water fraction estimates the spatial variability of o 18 content in rainfall over the catchment area during an individual rainfall runoff event can be significant e g mcguire et al 2005 yet it is often assumed negligible for small headwater catchments e g swistock et al 1989 kendall et al 2001 kennedy et al 2012 fischer et al 2017 analyzed the effects of spatial and temporal variations of the rainfall isotopic composition in an instrumented catchment in switzerland the spatial variability of o 18 content in rainwater affected the runoff separation to a larger extent than did the different weighting methods accounting for temporal o 18 variations in rainfall this finding is in agreement with the study of lyon et al 2009 who found very contrasting results of the isotope based hydrograph separation using o 18 content in rainfall sampled from two different locations within the catchment the spatial variability of o 18 content in rainwater is however of less importance for relatively short hillslopes 50 m a canopy interception was reported to influence the isotopic composition of throughfall brodersen et al 2000 allen et al 2015 sprenger et al 2016 processes occurring on canopy may thus change the rainfall isotopic composition at much smaller scale even relevant for short hillslope segments stormflow as one of the most important runoff mechanisms in headwater catchments usually develops as saturated flow above the soil bedrock interface during prominent rainfall runoff events the onset of stormflow is commonly accelerated by the presence of macropores and biopores in a soil profile potentially forming a network of interconnected preferential pathways nieber and sidle 2010 leaney et al 1993 showed high contribution of event water 80 90 to hillslope subsurface runoff which was explained by rapid flow through a macropore system other studies e g burns et al 2001 mcglynn et al 2004 weiler and mcdonnell 2007 demonstrated that event water in hillslope and catchment runoff is a small fraction of the total even in cases where preferential flow is a significant factor of discharge generation kienzler and naef 2008 found a strong dependence of the pre event water fraction on the mechanism initiating flow in preferential flowpaths physically based models may help to analyze experimental observations at hillslope and catchment scales and to extrapolate our hypotheses about transport mechanisms beyond existing measurements such modeling framework was previously used in analyses focused on dynamics of subsurface flow e g dusek and vogel 2016 ala aho et al 2017 the importance of including both water flow data and tracer transport information into a conceptual model to adequately describe flowpaths in soils has been recognized e g by uhlenbrook et al 2004 coppola et al 2009 and köhne et al 2009 the model analysis with additional information on solute transport led to a more robust description of subsurface runoff processes at the hillslope scale vogel et al 2010 in respect to the isotope transport in soils detailed data vs model comparisons remain limited in the literature with the exception of a few studies e g stumpp et al 2009 rothfuss et al 2012 dusek et al 2017 the fundamental driving forces of water flow in soils are gravity and pressure gradients beside advection the transport of environmental tracers in soils is a subject of additional processes such as molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion known together as hydrodynamic dispersion homogeneous soils with a macroscopically uniform flow field are often characterized by a relatively small value of dispersivity the mechanical dispersion of a tracer is therefore less significant in structured and heterogeneous porous systems dispersivity values are expected to increase gelhar et al 1992 these aspects need to be taken into account when interpreting the pre event water contribution to event driven hillslope discharge predicted by an isotope based hydrograph separation technique neglecting tracer dispersion in the interpretation of isotope based hydrograph separations was disputed in the numerical analyses performed by jones et al 2006 and park et al 2011 these studies suggested that the paradox of the rapid mobilization of old water kirchner 2003 can be explained by hydrodynamic dispersion and mixing between pre event and event water the analyses of jones et al 2006 and park et al 2011 consistently showed enhanced pre event water contribution to streamflow when hydrodynamic dispersion mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion was included surprisingly the scenario based on advective and diffusive flux with neglected mechanical dispersion showed similar pre event fraction as the scenario based on highly dispersive flux jones et al 2006 the conclusions of jones et al 2006 were questioned by renaud et al 2007 who insisted that the debated hydrograph separation technique is a proper method to identify the temporal origin of water in runoff the discrepancy could be probably explained by the fact that jones et al 2006 and park et al 2011 evaluated the relative significance of the factors affecting pre event water contributions in simplified spatial configurations and did not cover the real conditions of natural rainfall runoff events the objective of this study is to analyze subsurface flow and transport processes controlling the composition of hillslope discharge in terms of pre event and event water in particular we examine the rapid hydrological response of a hillslope in which subsurface stormflow is delivered by a system of preferential pathways the temporal origin of water in the hillslope discharge and spatial patterns of pre event and event water mixing were studied by means of numerical experiments a two dimensional dual continuum model was used to describe the transport of natural stable isotope o 18 in the hillslope segment during three growing seasons the inherent assumptions of the isotope based hydrograph separation technique were examined by conducting simulations of selected rainfall runoff episodes involving synthetic isotopic signatures more specifically the effects of i hydrodynamic mixing ii the spatial variation of the isotope content in pre event water and iii the temporal distribution of the isotope content in event water were analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and data the experimental hillslope site tomsovka is located in the headwater catchment uhlirska jizera mountains north bohemia czech republic total area of the catchment is 1 78 km2 average altitude is 820 m above sea level mean annual precipitation is 1380 mm and mean annual temperature is 4 7 c the studied hillslope is covered by young spruce forest picea abies with an herbaceous understory the soil surface as well as the soil bedrock interface are approximately planar and parallel the average slope is about 14 the soil is a sandy loam classified as cryptopodzol it is relatively shallow about 70 cm deep the internal structure of the soil is well developed the soil profile consists of three layers with different hydraulic properties table 1 the soil layers are underlain by a transition zone of weathered granite bedrock 5 10 m thick sanda and cislerova 2009 the transition zone then changes into a compact porphyritic biotite granite bedrock the interface between the third soil layer and the transition zone at the depth of about 70 cm is further on referred to as soil bedrock interface the soil hydraulic parameters characterizing each soil layer were derived from laboratory measurements in which undisturbed 100 cm3 soil samples and 1000 cm3 soil cores were used to determine the soil water retention parameters and the saturated hydraulic conductivity respectively sanda and cislerova 2009 the parameters derived from the laboratory measurements were adjusted based on the variations of soil water content and soil water pressure observed in situ dohnal et al 2006a b the resulting hydraulic parameters are listed in table 1 in addition the saturated hydraulic conductivity at the soil bedrock interface was determined by a disk infiltrometer sanda and cislerova 2009 reported significant preferential flow effects at the tomsovka site affecting the hillslope hydraulic response to rainfall preferential flow was attributed to highly conductive pathways along tree roots as well as to the soil structure and the spatial variability of local soil hydraulic properties overland flow is rarely observed at tomsovka due to highly permeable topsoil layer over the period of interest growing seasons 2007 2008 and 2009 hydrological and micrometeorological conditions were monitored with 10 min temporal resolution subsurface hillslope discharge was measured at an 8 m long experimental trench fig 1 a the trench consisted of two individual sections labeled as a and b each 4 m long shallow subsurface hillslope discharge was collected separately in each section at the depth of 75 cm the discharge rates q a and q b were measured by tipping buckets during growing seasons from may to november although the geographic watershed divide is located approximately 130 m above the experimental trench the trench was found to drain a much shorter hillslope length 25 50 m dusek et al 2012a this could be explained by a discontinuity of the underlying bedrock observed by vertical electrical sounding survey sanda and cislerova 2009 for the conversion of the observed volumetric hillslope discharge to specific stormflow per unit contribution area the contributing length of 25 m was assumed for the modeling purposes the hillslope micro catchments corresponding to trench sections a and b were assumed to have approximately the same geometric and material properties hillslope length depth to bedrock soil stratification soil hydraulic properties etc the differences in the measured discharge hydrographs q a vs q b were attributed to the spatial variability of preferential pathways especially in terms of their lateral connectivity the o 18 content at the tomsovka site was measured in i precipitation collected from the rain gauge ii subsurface hillslope discharge collected from the two sections of the experimental trench and iii soil water extracted from two depths by suction cups the o 18 o 16 ratio in water was expressed as δ18o given in parts per thousand the delta values represent relative deviations of measured o 18 o 16 ratios from the isotopic composition of the vienna standard mean ocean water o 18 contents were measured by a laser spectroscope lgr liquid water isotope analyzer los gatos research inc ca penna et al 2010 the manufacturer declared precision of δ18o measurements is 0 2 rainwater samples were collected at daily intervals provided that the amount of rainfall since the previous sampling had exceeded 5 mm in 2007 or 1 mm in 2008 and 2009 as each sample corresponded to cumulative rainfall for the period between two samplings the measured o 18 content represented the average value for this period the o 18 content in hillslope discharge was measured in samples collected at 6 h intervals 3 h intervals in 2009 provided that at least 8 5 l of water had been accumulated since the previous sampling the o 18 content was determined for combined discharge from both trench sections i e separate o 18 contents for trench sections a and b were not available the o 18 values measured during intensive stormflow episodes represent nearly instantaneous δ18o values in case that discharge rates became lower mixing of the effluent water occurred and the respective δ18o values therefore represent time averaged values resident δ18o values were measured by suction cups installed at the depths of 30 and 60 cm located 3 m upslope from the trench sampling was conducted at monthly intervals more detailed information on suction cups sampling of soil water was given by vogel et al 2010 and dusek et al 2017 2 2 flow and transport model soil water flow and isotope transport in the hillslope segment was simulated by a dual continuum model gerke and van genuchten 1993a vogel et al 2000a the dual set of governing equations eqs 1 2 4 and 5 was solved numerically using the computer program s2d vogel et al 2000a based on the fully implicit galerkin finite element method according to the dual continuum model the flow domain consists of two hydraulically interacting pore domains the soil matrix domain subscript m and the preferential flow domain subscript f flow of water in the dual continuum system is described by a set of two dimensional richards equations 1 c f h f t k f h f k f z s f γ w w f 2 c m h m t k m h m k m z s m γ w w m where for each of the two flow domains h denotes the pressure head m k the hydraulic conductivity tensor m s 1 c the specific soil

coordinate m taken to be positive upward t is time s and γw is the water transfer term describing the interdomain exchange of water s 1 the set of equations is solved for pressure head h t x z where x is the horizontal coordinate the transfer term γw is assumed to be proportional to the local pressure head difference between the preferential flow and the soil matrix domains gerke and van genuchten 1993b it is expressed as 3 γ w α ws k ar h f h m where αws is the water transfer coefficient at saturation m 1 s 1 and k ar is the relative unsaturated conductivity of the domain interface values of k ar range from 0 to 1 depending on the soil matrix and preferential flow domain conductivities evaluated for the upstream soil water pressure gerke et al 2013 the transport of o 18 in the dual continuum system is described by two coupled advection dispersion equations e g vogel et al 2000a 4 θ f c f t θ f d f c f q f c f s f c f γ s w f 5 θ m c m t θ m d m c m q m c m s m c m γ s w m where c is the δ18o concentration in soil water θ is the volumetric soil water content m3 m 3 q is the vector of soil water flux m s 1 d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor m2 s 1 and γs is the solute transfer term describing interdomain solute mass transfer s 1 the set of equations is solved for solute concentration c t x z the values of θ q and d evaluated using the solution of richards equations are independent of c the mass transfer term γs is defined as local mass flux directed from one flow domain to the other gerke and van genuchten 1993b it is expressed as 6 γ s γ w c i α ss θ ar c f c m where αss is the solute transfer coefficient at saturation s 1 and θar is the effective degree of saturation at the domain interface the first term on the right hand side represents the advective interdomain exchange driven by the soil water pressure difference for this term c i c f is assumed when water flows from the preferential flow domain to the soil matrix for the opposite flow direction c i c m the second term accounts for the diffusive exchange due to the concentration gradient the rate of diffusive exchange is controlled by the values of αss and θar in our model the coefficient θar is assumed to be equal to the relative saturation of the preferential flow domain ray et al 2004 hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor d is a second rank tensor composed of molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion the components of the tensor d are evaluated according to bear 1972 as 7 d ij d 0 τ δ ij λ t q θ δ ij λ l λ t θ q q i q j where d 0 is the molecular diffusion coefficient m2 s 1 λl and λt are the longitudinal and transversal dispersivity m respectively q is the magnitude of the water flux vector δij is the kronecker delta function δij 1 for the diagonal components and δij 0 for the off diagonal components the dimensionless tortuosity factor τ is evaluated as τ θ7 3 θs 2 millington and quirk 1961 the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities λl and λt characterize the process of mechanical dispersion small values of dispersivity induce weak dispersive flux such condition is assumed in a relatively homogeneous porous system with a nearly uniform flow field in general the estimation of dispersivity values remains difficult especially under field conditions longitudinal dispersivity is usually assumed in the range of 1 10 to 1 20 of the transport problem spatial scale and transverse dispersivity as a fraction of longitudinal dispersivity gelhar et al 1992 2 3 mass balance approach for hydrograph separation to distinguish pre event and event water in shallow subsurface runoff a two component mass balance approach was applied e g buttle 1998 this approach is based on a simple set of equations expressing mass balances of water and a conservative tracer respectively 8 q t q p t q e t 9 c t q t c p q p t c e q e t or equivalently 10 f p t f e t 1 11 f e t c t c p c e c p where q is the total discharge from a hillslope segment m3 s 1 q p and q e are the contributions from pre event and event water respectively c is the tracer concentration in the hillslope discharge c p and c e are the tracer concentrations in pre event and event water respectively f e q e q and f p q p q are the dimensionless event and pre event water fractions respectively since the stable water isotopes are assumed to behave as conservative tracers the isotope concentrations change only by mixing if c p and c e are known constant or with a known variability and q t and c t are measured q p and q e can be calculated by combining eqs 8 and 9 2 4 temporal variability of o 18 in rainfall mcdonnell et al 1990 described several weighting techniques to account for the temporal variability of isotopic composition in rainfall the incremental weighting mean technique proposed by mcdonnell et al 1990 represents an improvement of standard weighting mean technique nevertheless mcdonnell et al 1990 noted that this technique is not entirely correct as different rainfall pulses during the event lead to variable response in streamflow according to the incremental weighting mean technique the value of c e is evaluated as 12 c e t j i 1 j p i δ 18 o i i 1 j p i where p i is the precipitation amount m and δ18oi is the isotope value observed at the ith sample during the event 3 numerical simulations the two dimensional dual continuum model s2d was used to simulate flow of water and transport of o 18 in the hillslope segment during three consecutive growing seasons 2007 2009 in addition nine significant rainfall episodes observed at tomsovka over the period from may 2007 to november 2009 were selected for further numerical experiments fig 2 what follows is a brief recapitulation of the geometric material initial and boundary conditions that were used to carry out the numerical simulations details about the application of the 2d dual continuum model at tomsovka were presented in our previous studies dusek and vogel 2014 2016 where the model predictions of hillslope discharge and soil water status were compared with experimental data 3 1 hillslope geometry soil properties initial and boundary conditions soil plant atmosphere interactions determining the hydrological response of the hillslope segment to the rainfall episodes involved rainfall evaporation plant transpiration and plant root water uptake the rainfall intensities were organized in one hour series the daily potential evapotranspiration was calculated using penman monteith equation monteith 1981 based on micrometeorological data observed directly at the hillslope site the root water uptake represented by the sink term s in eqs 1 and 2 was described according to feddes et al 1978 given the humid character of the experimental hillslope site the actual evapotranspiration calculated by the 2d model was equal to the potential rate the simulations were performed for a 30 m long and 3 m deep 2d vertical cross section of the hillslope fig 1b assuming the same geometry as in our previous studies dusek and vogel 2014 2016 the flow domain spanned 25 m above and 5 m below the experimental trench to correctly account for the fluxes in the vicinity of the trench the hillslope length contributing to discharge was thus 25 m a constant slope of 14 was considered the 2d flow domain was discretized into 283 113 triangular elements identical boundary conditions were used for both flow domains the preferential flow and soil matrix domains the upslope face of the experimental trench was modeled as a seepage face with the effective height of 55 cm permitting water to discharge under saturated conditions only i e for local pressure head values of h 0 at the bottom boundary at the depth of 3 m free drainage condition was imposed allowing water to leave the 2d domain at the rate equal to unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at the vertical upslope and downslope sides of the computational domain no flow and seepage face boundary conditions were prescribed respectively the soil hydraulic characteristics of the soil and bedrock matrices as well as of the preferential flow domain were parameterized using the modified van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 vogel and cislerova 1988 vogel et al 2000b the values of soil hydraulic parameters and interdomain transfer coefficients were taken from our previous studies vogel et al 2010 dusek and vogel 2014 2016 the parameters of the soil matrix and preferential flow domains are listed in table 1 the domain specific properties θrm θrf θsm θsf k sm and k sf given in table 1 are related to those of the bulk soil by the respective volumetric domain fractions gerke and van genuchten 1993a for instance bulk related value of the saturated water content of the dual continuum system is evaluated as θs θsm w m θsf w f the volumetric fraction of the preferential flow domain w f was set to 7 at the soil surface and 5 at the depth of 75 cm with a linear variation between the two endpoints the values of αws and αss eqs 3 and 6 were also estimated to decrease linearly between the soil surface and the lower boundary 1 and 0 01 cm 1 d 1 for αws and 0 001 and 0 0001 d 1 for αss which corresponded to the decreasing trend of saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix domain the anisotropy ratio in respect to principal directions x and z for the hydraulic conductivity tensor of the preferential flow domain was set equal to k x x k z z 10 where x is directed along the slope and z is perpendicular to x see fig 1b indicating the increased conductivity of the laterally continuous network of preferential pathways along the local hillslope gradient the increased lateral conductivity was assumed to represent the preferential flow domain formed by pathways along tree roots and biopores as well as lateral soil structural features for o 18 transport modeling the δ18o values were treated as solute concentrations denoted as c in eqs 4 and 5 the initial o 18 content at the beginning of each of the simulated growing seasons was derived from observed resident δ18o values determined in soil water extracted by suction cups assuming linear interpolation in the vertical direction a flux concentration third type boundary condition was used at the soil surface prescribing measured δ18o in precipitation zero concentration gradient was used at the upslope face of the experimental trench and the bottom boundary which allowed the isotope to leave the simulated domain freely with the discharging water at the vertical upslope and downslope sides of the computational domain zero flux and zero concentration gradient boundary conditions were prescribed respectively the value of longitudinal dispersivity was set to 20 cm dusek et al 2012b while transverse dispersivity was fixed at 5 cm the values of dispersivities were modified in numerical experiments evaluating hydrodynamic mixing the molecular diffusion coefficient of o 18 interpreted as self diffusion coefficient of water was set equal to 2 cm2 d 1 singleton et al 2004 in the simulations the transport of stable isotope o 18 was subject to advection hydrodynamic dispersion and root water uptake only we assumed that no fractionation of the oxygen isotope occurred when soil water was taken up by plant roots for transpiration allison et al 1984 during growing seasons the soil surface is fully covered with dense vegetation layer and infiltration is rapid thus we could assume that transpiration dominates over direct soil evaporation and the o 18 enrichment of soil water due to soil surface evaporation could also be neglected dispersion took place in both the soil matrix domain and the preferential flow domain the o 18 isotope could also migrate between the two domains according to the local soil water pressure and concentration differences 3 2 long term simulations the long term simulations of subsurface flow at tomsovka were compared quantitatively with experimental data hillslope discharge and soil water pressure in our previous study dusek and vogel 2014 the transport of o 18 at tomsovka was studied by vogel et al 2010 dohnal et al 2012 and dusek et al 2012b 2017 however they used a simplified one dimensional approach to model both vertical and lateral flow and transport in this approach two and three dimensional flow and transport patterns were neglected in the present analysis a two dimensional approach is used to study the spatial distribution of pre event event water within the hillslope segment as well as the spatial distribution of fluxes and mixing transfer processes while considering more realistic hydraulic conditions above the soil bedrock interface the q t and c t values obtained from the long term simulations based on natural isotopic signatures were used to estimate the pre event water contribution to the hillslope discharge by means of the isotopic mass balance method however the obtained isotopic contrast between the pre event and event water was not sufficient to allow for a meaningful hillslope hydrograph separation for two thirds of the selected rainfall runoff episodes as a result additional numerical experiments involving synthetic isotopic signatures were conducted 3 3 episodal simulations the rainfall runoff episodes selected for further numerical experiments fig 2 were characterized by continuous hillslope discharge lasting more than 2 days three runoff episodes 2 3 and 8 had a relatively small measured discharge volume 0 9 m3 i e 9 mm runoff height while the remaining six episodes i e 1 4 5 6 7 and 9 were characterized by at least 2 9 m3 29 mm of runoff volume fig 2 the largest runoff volume was observed during episode 9 when trench sections a and b showed hillslope discharge of 13 0 m3 130 mm and 19 8 m3 198 mm respectively the following numerical experiments were carried out for the selected rainfall runoff episodes i simulations involving different degrees of hydrodynamic mixing in the hillslope segment in these simulations contrasting synthetic o 18 signatures were used for both pre event and event water signatures ii simulations involving a spatially variable isotopic composition of soil water at the beginning of the individual rainfall runoff episodes the respective 2d distributions of δ18o were taken from the long term simulations in these simulations a contrasting synthetic o 18 content in rainfall was applied instead of the observed o 18 signature iii simulations involving the observed temporal distributions of o 18 content in rainfall in these simulations contrasting synthetic o 18 contents in pre event water were applied instead of the pre event water o 18 distributions predicted by the long term simulations all simulations were based on real rainfall runoff episodes i e with actual rainfall intensities the model was used as a tool to study mixing and movement of event and pre event water under real atmospheric conditions the contrasting synthetic values of δ18o in rainfall were set equal to 3 in all respective simulations the synthetic δ18o values in pre event water were assumed to be equal to 18 to make an arbitrary yet still reasonable contrast to the event water note that the particular δ18o values chosen to represent the synthetic o 18 signatures have no impact on the estimation of the pre event water contribution to the hillslope discharge as long as a sufficient contrast between pre event and event water is established allowing the application of the isotopic mass balance method in the numerical simulations designed to study the effect of hydrodynamic mixing three different scenarios were considered i weak mixing combining weak mechanical dispersion with molecular diffusion ii medium mixing with mechanical dispersion λl and λt equal 20 cm and 5 cm respectively and molecular diffusion and iii enhanced mixing involving enhanced mechanical dispersion λl and λt equal 100 cm and 25 cm respectively and molecular diffusion the values of both dispersivities were set to 1 mm for weak mixing scenario these values effectively eliminate mechanical dispersion while maintaining numerical stability of solution of the governing equations note that for all three scenarios advective flux was the fundamental transport process 3 4 estimation of pre event water contribution to hillslope discharge the pre event water contribution to the hillslope discharge was estimated using the mass balance approach eqs 8 and 9 for all rainfall runoff episodes the q t and c t values necessary for the evaluation of the isotopic mass balance in the hillslope discharge were taken from the individual episodal simulations the pre event water contribution was evaluated in of the hillslope discharge volume for each rainfall runoff episode in the case of the numerical experiments involving spatially variable pre event o 18 content in soil water a single average value was substituted for c p to represent the pre event conditions in the mass balance calculations this value was determined by averaging the pre event o 18 content in both flow domains and by combining the resulting values into a single composite value the value of c e was set equal to the synthetic o 18 content in rainfall 3 in the case of the numerical experiments involving the observed isotopic composition of rainfall the incremental weighting mean technique eq 12 was used in the mass balance calculations to determine the value of c e fig 3 the value of c p was set equal to the synthetic o 18 content 18 4 results 4 1 seasonal stormflow dynamics and isotope transport the observed and simulated variations of subsurface stormflow during the three growing seasons are presented in fig 2 the peak discharges were mostly underpredicted by the model the root mean square error rmse comparing observed and predicted stormflow was 16 3 l h 1 and 22 0 l h 1 for trench sections a and b respectively the respective nash sutcliffe model efficiency values were 0 562 and 0 689 nevertheless the differences in measured hillslope discharge between runoff from trench sections a and b was greater rmse of 24 5 l h 1 than the differences between model predictions and data preferential pathways supplied the dominant part of total hillslope discharge 98 6 while the soil matrix contribution to stormflow was found negligible dusek and vogel 2014 the results of the long term o 18 transport simulations are presented in figs 4 and 5 the observed variations of δ18o in stormflow are compared with the model predictions in fig 4 the sampling procedure applied to the hillslope effluent in the trench did not allow distinguishing between the contributions from the soil matrix and the preferential pathways nevertheless our previous analyses indicated that the hillslope discharge was generated by preferential pathways vogel et al 2010 dusek et al 2012b dusek and vogel 2014 2016 this is confirmed in the present study where the simulated variations of δ18o in hillslope discharge from the preferential flow domain were similar to those observed in stormflow the value of rmse for δ18o in stormflow for the preferential flow domain was 0 574 suggesting high coherency with the observation the simulated δ18o in discharge from the soil matrix showed only limited direct response to event forcing an improved data model agreement could be possibly obtained for different combinations of longitudinal and transversal dispersivities in contrast to the dynamic fluctuations of δ18o in stormflow the observed δ18o values in soil pore water reflect seasonal long term variations fig 5 the simulated δ18o values in the soil matrix are in a good agreement with those measured with the suction cups the values of rmse for δ18o in pore water at the depths of 30 cm and 60 cm are 0 701 and 0 345 respectively the individual components of the hillslope water balance determined for the selected rainfall runoff episodes are presented in table 2 the results show a nonlinear character of the hillslope response for different combinations of initial saturation and atmospheric forcing associated with the temporal distribution of rainfall and evapotranspiration depending on the initial hillslope storage characterizing the antecedent moisture conditions in the hillslope prior to rainfall the change of the hillslope water storage was either positive or negative leakage to bedrock defined as deep percolation groundwater recharge through the soil bedrock interface constitutes an important sink of the hillslope water balance this is due to the semipermeable weathered bedrock underlying the shallow hillslope soil nevertheless leakage to bedrock remained smaller than stormflow for all episodes except for episode 2 where it was of a similar magnitude a significant contribution to the leakage originated from near saturated conditions which prevailed above the soil bedrock interface near the trench dusek and vogel 2016 the q t and c t values obtained from the long term simulations were used to estimate the pre event water contribution to the hillslope discharge the partitioning of stormflow into pre event and event water was not possible for six episodes 1 3 4 6 7 and 8 out of nine because of the similarity of pre event c p and event c e isotopic signatures during these episodes leading to unrealistic values of pre event and event fractions cf eq 10 4 2 hillslope hydrograph separation the results of the simulations involving contrasting synthetic isotopic signatures in both rainwater δ18o 3 and pre event water δ18o 18 made it possible to estimate the pre event water contributions for the individual rainfall runoff episodes in table 3 under the medium hydrodynamic mixing scenario the estimates of the pre event water contribution to hillslope discharge in of total runoff volume for selected rainfall runoff episodes are listed the estimates of the pre event water contribution in mm of runoff height to hillslope discharge are given in table 2 in fig 6 a the hydrograph separation performed for rainfall runoff episode 1 is shown for this multiple peak episode the pre event water contribution equaled 65 of the total stormflow sustaining the hillslope discharge during both rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph fig 6b shows the individual contributions of the three rainfall pulses of episode 1 4 3 the effect of hydrodynamic mixing the results of the episodic simulations designed to study the effect of hydrodynamic mixing on the pre event water contribution to the hillslope discharge are summarized in table 3 the degree of hydrodynamic mixing was controlled by molecular diffusion mechanical dispersion and the temporal distribution of rainfall intensities and durations during rainfall runoff episodes the rainfall runoff episodes with a large amount of stored water prior to the rainfall and multiple rainfall pulses showed a complex pattern of soil water and o 18 fluxes resulting in significant differences between the different hydrodynamic mixing scenarios table 3 the pre event water contribution to hillslope discharge for the three different scenarios of hydrodynamic mixing during rainfall runoff episode 1 is shown in fig 7 the scenario based on enhanced hydrodynamic mixing showed greater contribution of pre event water compared to weak and medium mixing scenarios table 3 this clearly indicates that the estimates of pre event water contribution to total runoff cannot be associated with advective flow only in fig 8 the spatial distributions of event water fractions in the soil matrix and preferential flow domains for scenarios assuming weak and enhanced hydrodynamic mixing are shown the figure indicates significantly different distributions of event water in the hillslope segment for these two contrasting scenarios due to reduced mixing sharp interfaces between water bodies with the varying value of event fractions developed in both pore domains for the weak mixing scenario fig 8a a mixture of pre event and event water was predicted for the enhanced mixing scenario fig 8b the weak mixing scenario showed low amounts of pre event water in the preferential flow domain most of the pre event water was stored in the soil matrix above the soil bedrock interface no distinct event water body is apparent under the enhanced mixing scenario 4 4 the effect of the pre event o 18 distribution in the hillslope segment the spatial distributions of the pre event δ18o in the soil matrix domain derived from the long term simulations for all selected rainfall runoff episodes are shown in fig 9 the distributions suggest that the dispersive fluxes of o 18 in the soil profile were predominantly vertical the differences in o 18 distributions among the episodes were more pronounced than the differences in the lateral direction along the hillslope segment the variability of o 18 content in the vertical direction was significant it was greater in the preferential flow domain than in the soil matrix domain due to the lateral flow component along the soil bedrock interface not shown as expected the δ18o values in the soil matrix domain were different from those in the preferential flow domain the effect of the pre event o 18 distribution on the pre event water contribution to the hillslope discharge is quantified in table 3 the pre event water contributions obtained under the assumption of spatially variable pre event o 18 content are compared to those obtained with constant synthetic pre event o 18 content the pre event water contribution resulting from variable o 18 signatures ranged from 53 to 85 among the episodes the differences in the estimates of pre event water contributions between scenarios based on constant and spatially variable o 18 content were from 0 5 to 5 4 4 5 the effect of temporal variations of o 18 content in rainfall there was a significant temporal variability of δ18o during most of the selected episodes fig 3 the observed variation range of δ18o was greater than 2 during a given episode the variations of δ18o among the selected episodes were also significant the highest difference was 7 in table 3 the estimates of the pre event water contribution to the hillslope discharge based on the observed temporal variations of rainfall o 18 content in the episode simulations and incremental weighting technique in the mass balance calculations are presented these contributions can be compared with those obtained from the scenarios based on medium hydrodynamic mixing involving constant synthetic o 18 contents in rainfall the results ranging from 1 2 to 0 7 indicate little difference 5 discussion 5 1 the mixing mechanisms it is important to note that two different concepts of mixing relevant to hillslope runoff were considered in this study i mixing between water in the soil matrix and in the preferential pathways and ii mixing between pre event and event water to illustrate these mixing mechanisms the transfer of o 18 between the soil matrix and preferential flow domain and the event pre event water fraction distributions are shown in fig 10 the 2d distribution of the soil water transfer rates revealed that water flow above the soil bedrock interface and in the topsoil 0 20 cm depth was directed from the soil matrix to the preferential flow domain dusek and vogel 2014 although the diffusive o 18 transfer was predominantly directed in the opposite way the overall interdomain transfer of o 18 was consistent with the water flow fig 10a due to the overriding effect of the advective transfer as expected an intense exchange of o 18 took place above the soil bedrock interface and in the topsoil during rainfall runoff episodes with significant stormflow response quickly draining preferential pathways with mixture of pre event and event water higher fraction of pre event water formed the total hillslope discharge mixing of pre event and event water occurred mostly above the soil bedrock interface fig 10c and was associated with the interdomain transfer of o 18 fig 10a intensive mixing took place near the trench where hydraulically active zone developed this zone was characterized by shorter residence times of o 18 compared to upslope locations 5 2 the source of pre event water the volume of pre event water estimated from the simulations involving contrasting synthetic isotopic signatures in both rainwater and pre event water was found to be a significant component of the water balance table 2 despite the dominant role played by preferential flow in the generation of hillslope stormflow the pre event water formed 52 84 of total subsurface stormflow see table 3 under medium hydrodynamic mixing the contribution of pre event water to the hillslope discharge was closely related to the degree of soil saturation at the beginning of the event as expected drier soil conditions prior to an event led to a smaller contribution of pre event water to hillslope discharge this is in agreement with recent studies e g cras et al 2007 james and roulet 2009 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 the numerical experiments involving distinctive synthetic isotopic signatures of the individual rainfall pulses during rainfall runoff episode 1 allowed distinguishing between different rainfall pulse contributions to the hillslope discharge fig 6b in addition to the pre event water contribution of 65 to the total volume of hillslope discharge the rainfall pulses i ii and iii generated the event water contributions of 19 6 and 10 respectively the results of this separation suggest different activation and participation of event water originating from the three rainfall sub events in overall runoff process the individual contribution of each rainfall sub event pulses i iii to discharge was affected by storm characteristics pre event water volume and its spatial distribution in the hillslope segment the hydrograph separation further indicated that only 14 of rainwater discharged as event water contribution and 86 of rainwater remained in the hillslope segment at the end of this episode it is further stressed that the preferential pathways in our case occupy a small proportion of the bulk soil 5 7 hence the storage of water in the preferential flow domain is insignificant compared to the soil matrix for instance the initial water storage in the preferential flow domain prior to episode 1 was as small as 0 2 mm however the pre event contribution to stormflow delivered by the preferential pathways was equal to 43 mm table 2 this points out to the soil matrix origin of the pre event water mcdonnell 1990 proposed a conceptual model of runoff generation at the maimai catchment with two contrasting features i rapid delivery runoff mechanism through soil macropores cracks and soil pipes and ii contribution of the pre event water dominating 85 streamflow during the runoff events at his hillslope unit tensiometric measurements suggested nonequlibrium in pressure heads initiated by water flow through vertical cracks and lateral soil pipes as opposed to uniform water flow in the soil matrix the event water was delivered towards the soil bedrock interface by vertical preferential flow where the new water was proposed to back up into the soil matrix then the event water was mixed with a much larger volume of pre event water stored in the soil matrix flow in lateral soil pipes at the base of the soil profile once activated upon saturation contributed to stormflow stormflow involved well mixed water composed mostly of pre event water mcdonnell 1990 concluded that the shift of the event water signatures to that of the pre event water is a key process in understanding of runoff generation in the following study mcdonnell et al 1998 further increased complexity of the hillslope system by pointing to a control of bedrock topography on soil water residence times mobility and mixing of pre event and event water the dominant contribution of pre event water in hillslope runoff released through preferential pathways was noted in several studies e g mcdonnell 1990 kienzler and naef 2008 klaus et al 2013 the findings of these studies were based on extensive measurement campaigns in the present study we used the two dimensional dual continuum model to explicitly quantify the exchange of pre event water stored in the soil matrix with the preferential pathways during the runoff events thus elucidating the mechanisms of rapid pre event water delivery in macroporous hillslope in agreement with the study of mcdonnell 1990 spatially and temporally variable exchange of water between the preferential pathways and the soil matrix was found to be a critical process in the hillslope runoff formation in our case though the exchange of water was directed from the soil matrix to preferential pathways near the soil bedrock interface resembling soil drainage rather than the back up mechanism of mcdonnell 1990 5 3 failure of mass balance approach when using natural o 18 signatures in this study the estimation of pre event water fraction was not possible for two thirds of the selected rainfall runoff episodes due to similar isotopic signatures of pre event and event water likewise temporal variations of o 18 in rainfall observed in the study of fischer et al 2017 precluded the separation of old and new water in five out of ten analyzed runoff events in general the hydrograph separation could be alternatively facilitated by using multiple tracers or developing other experimental approaches 5 4 diffusive and dispersive fluxes as mentioned above the estimates of lateral and transversal dispersivities under field transient conditions are difficult to obtain vanderborght and vereecken 2007 showed that considerably larger dispersivities were observed for saturated than for unsaturated flow conditions larger values of dispersivities are also associated with soils of well developed structure vervoort et al 1999 in general the estimation of dispersivity values can be based on inverse modeling of long term transport of natural isotope or a field tracer experiment however such procedure would require an excessive computing time using a two dimensional model in our case the simulation results of seasonal isotope dynamics suggested that the weak mixing scenario was based on unrealistically low dispersivities the dispersivity values of the medium mixing scenario are assumed to represent more realistic transport conditions note that the change of dispersivity affects the o 18 transport but not the soil water movement itself diffusive fluxes play major role under the conditions of slow water flow characterized by a low value of peclet number bear 1972 the impact of molecular diffusion increases with the time spent by a water molecule in the flow system however under high flow conditions molecular diffusion becomes less important as mechanical dispersion dominates such conditions prevail during rainfall runoff episodes and especially in the preferential pathways where the lateral water fluxes above the soil bedrock interface are much higher than in the soil matrix dusek and vogel 2014 jones et al 2006 and park et al 2011 identified molecular diffusion as a significant process affecting the pre event water contribution to streamflow although it represents a minimal level of mixing between pre event and event water park et al 2011 jones et al 2006 considered a scenario with zero hydrodynamic dispersion under which both mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion were effectively eliminated this scenario was put in doubt by renaud et al 2007 suggesting that diffusion of o 18 is linked to the actual motion of water molecules themselves the scenario with zero hydrodynamic dispersion of jones et al 2006 resulted in unrealistically small predictions of pre event water contribution to streamflow by adding molecular diffusion the estimate of pre event water contribution increased dramatically jones et al 2006 this is not in agreement with the simulation results presented in this study where advection was found to be the most important process with respect to the delivery of pre event water to the hillslope discharge mechanical dispersion increased the pre event water contribution by a few percent up to 10 table3 for some episodes the estimated pre event water contributions did not differ substantially for chosen degrees of mechanical dispersion weak medium and enhanced mixing scenarios implying a limited impact of dispersivity on the contribution of pre event water to the hillslope discharge 5 5 spatial variability of pre event o 18 content in the soil profile in general the role of spatial variability of pre event o 18 content tends to be more important for hydrological conditions with a greater pre event water contribution this was partly confirmed by the results obtained in the present analysis as indicated by the differences between estimated pre event water contributions of episodes 2 7 and 8 table3 column 4 vs column 5 the results further suggest a pronounced effect of the differences between domain specific pre event o 18 distributions on the pre event water contribution to the hillslope discharge fig 11 as the dominant proportion of the hillslope discharge was delivered by the preferential flow domain the pre event distribution of o 18 in this flow domain was an important factor the rainfall runoff episodes characterized by a larger difference between o 18 values in the preferential flow domain and the soil matrix domain are associated with greater estimates of the pre event water contributions to the hillslope discharge episodes 3 and 8 in fig 11 the average o 18 content in the preferential flow domain was higher than in the soil matrix domain for most episodes the water transfer was directed from the soil matrix to quickly draining preferential flow domain the diffusive exchange of o 18 between the flow domains remained in the opposite direction nevertheless the overall interdomain exchange of o 18 was directed from the soil matrix to the preferential flow domain fig 10a larger isotopic gradient between the domains led to smaller o 18 exchange acting against the advective component of o 18 transfer as a result δ18o in the preferential flow domain was affected by o 18 from the soil matrix to a lesser extent thus the estimated pre event water contribution was greater for conditions with larger difference of o 18 content between the flow domains in conclusion the advective exchange of o 18 between the soil matrix domain and the preferential flow domain as well as the gradient of δ18o between the domains was crucial for the estimation of the pre event water contribution to the hillslope discharge this finding further highlights the role of the antecedent storm events in respect to o 18 distribution in the soil matrix and preferential pathways as noted by van der hoven et al 2002 5 6 temporal variability of o 18 content in rainfall as confirmed by the negligible differences between estimated pre event water contributions table 3 column 4 vs column 6 the incremental weighting technique for the mass balance calculation seems appropriate for assessing the temporal origin of water in hillslope discharge even for hillslopes where preferential flow is a dominant discharge component such as the tomsovka site for hillslopes with the pronounced contribution of event water and temporal isotopic variability in rainfall the type of the weighting technique used in the hydrograph separation is expected to have a greater impact on the estimate of pre event event water fractions smaller pre event water contributions to hillslope discharge were predicted when variable o 18 content in rainfall was considered table 3 compared to scenarios based on the constant o 18 content only two episodes resulted in higher pre event water contribution estimates episodes 4 and 7 the onset of these two episodes was characterized by a combination of isotopically heavier rainwater and high rainfall intensities the spatial distribution of soil water prior to an episode and the temporal rainfall distribution are factors that have a potential to change the quantification of pre event event water partitioning nevertheless the verification of this hypothesis may require further analysis based on a wider variety of rainfall patterns and hydrological conditions 6 summary and conclusions although the assumptions of tracer based hydrograph separation technique rarely meet real field conditions this technique is widely used to construct conceptual models of runoff processes in this study the assumptions of the isotope based hydrograph separation method were assessed quantitatively by means of numerical modeling of subsurface flow and transport in a hillslope segment long term natural isotope transport as well as nine synthetic isotope transport episodes derived from the observed rainfall runoff episodes were analyzed using a two dimensional dual continuum model pre event water contributions to the hillslope discharge were estimated through the two component isotopic mass balance method despite the dominant role of preferential flow in subsurface hillslope runoff the pre event water contribution was estimated to represent 52 84 of total subsurface stormflow storm characteristics and initial hillslope storage antecedent moisture conditions were found to affect significantly the pre event event water contribution to the hillslope discharge highly transient advective fluxes occurring during the rainfall runoff episodes were shown to facilitate the transfer of pre event water to hillslope discharge the results of isotope transport modeling suggested significant mixing within the hillslope segment within each of the two flow domains as well as between the domains soil matrix and preferential pathways diffusive and dispersive fluxes were important for the episodes characterized by a high initial hillslope storage and multiple peak rainfall intensities the spatially and temporally variable exchange of o 18 between the soil matrix and preferential pathways exerted a primary control on the temporal origin of water in the hillslope runoff the modeling approach applied revealed significant hydrodynamic mixing caused by both mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion the simulation scenarios involving enhanced mechanical dispersion resulted in the increased estimate of the pre event water contribution to hillslope discharge up to 10 compared to the scenarios with reduced dispersive mass flux enhanced hydrodynamic mixing of pre event and event water in the subsurface complicated the interpretation of the isotope based hydrograph separation for the simulations involving spatially variable pre event o 18 content the isotope mass transfer between the soil matrix and the preferential pathways as well as the gradient of δ18o between the two flow domains were found to be crucial for the estimates of the pre event event water fractions in the hillslope discharge the modeling results also highlight the role of the initial hillslope storage and its spatial distribution as well as the o 18 partitioning between the soil matrix and preferential pathways prior to the rainfall event the incremental weighting technique was an appropriate method to account for the temporal variability of the o 18 content in rainfall the spatial and temporal variations of the isotopic signatures of pre event and event water were found to have minor effects on the temporal origin of water in the hillslope discharge as estimated by the isotopic mass balance method nevertheless the similarity of the pre event and event isotopic contents precluded the partitioning of the hillslope discharge into pre event and event water components for two thirds of the selected rainfall runoff episodes when natural isotopic signatures instead of contrasting synthetic signatures were used in the mass balance calculations acknowledgments this study was

7151,watershed management in rainfed agricultural areas of arid and semi arid regions aims at alleviating agricultural drought by employing water conservation measures water conservation measures serve as mechanisms for recharging groundwater and also for surface storage while the benefits derived from these structures is widely accepted there is increasing concern regarding their sustainability and efficiency the application of water conservation measures in upstream reaches contributes to reduced inflows to downstream reaches and structures currently watershed management is planned by considering elementary information about the hydrological regime and its associated impacts on the upstream reaches of the watershed this approach may lead to inefficient water conservation structures and there is also a significant probability that the structure may be under designed or over designed therefore careful planning that considers the hydrological changes that the conservation structure may bring in the watershed and the associated benefits compromise for both upstream and downstream is essential for developing a successful watershed management plan a simulation optimization framework for optimal sizing of the water conservation structure considering the dual objectives of improving the benefits in the upstream reaches while maintaining flows in the downstream reaches is proposed in this study the proposed method is demonstrated for optimal sizing of water conservation structures check dams in this study for an experimental watershed in kondepi mandal andhra pradesh india the results indicate that the check dams of sizes obtained from both traditional method and simulation optimization method increase moisture availability in the watershed however for check dam sizes obtained from the simulation optimization framework there is an increase in the flow to downstream reaches compared to the check dam sizes obtained from the traditional methods the increase in downstream flows obtained by optimizing the check dam heights is at the expense of increased moisture stress days in the non growing period thus not affecting the crop growth or productivity the results from this study indicate that the proposed simulation optimization framework can be of assistance in sizing of check dams for sustainable and effective watershed management keywords watershed management water conservation check dams simulation optimization 1 introduction rainfed agricultural areas in arid and semi arid regions experience severe agricultural drought due to the erratic nature of rainfall watershed management which helps improve land productivity by maximizing the water availability for rainfed agriculture is practiced in many countries to mitigate the impact of erratic rainfall garg et al 2012 mbilinyi et al 2007 rockstrom 2000 syme et al 2015 the primary aim of any watershed management program in rainfed regions is to enhance the ecosystem and land productivity through soil and water conservation practices adham et al 2016a 2016b guyassa et al 2017 kadam et al 2012 reddy et al 2017 in general various structural and non structural measures such as contour bunds water harvesting structures like farm ponds and check dams field bunds afforestation vegetative cover etc are adopted for soil and water conservation raju et al 2008 syme et al 2015 wani and garg 2009 however the practices adopted for implementation depend on the hydrologic biophysical and socio economic conditions of the watershed adham et al 2016a reddy et al 2017 among the measures water harvesting structures like check dams and farm ponds are preferred by local stakeholders and implementing agencies for their noticeable impacts and also for limited land area requirement compared to other techniques reddy et al 2017 syme et al 2015 these water harvesting structures serve as mechanisms for recharging groundwater and also for surface storage it is also to be noted that water harvesting structures like check dams slow down the water and sediments along the streams thus controlling soil erosion along with water conservation guyassa et al 2017 nyssen et al 2010 2008 while there has been an increased application of water harvesting structures their sustainability and efficiency is debated in many studies adham et al 2016a reddy et al 2017 syme et al 2015 various impact assessment studies of water harvesting structures have been carried out in the past batchelor et al 2003 calder et al 2008 datta 2015 garg et al 2012 but most of them focused on the socio economic impacts and largely ignored the hydrological and biophysical impacts for instance many studies across the world underscored the impacts of water harvesting structures in terms of increased crop productivity garg et al 2012 increased agricultural income and better livelihood of the stakeholder calder et al 2008 datta 2015 raising the groundwater level expansion and emergence of crop areas and prolonging the cropping periods garg et al 2012 guyassa et al 2017 etc consequently there is a growing concern regarding the negative externalities caused by these structures on the downstream reaches where the available water gets reduced some studies have attributed declined contribution of water in the surface water bodies located in the downstream to watershed development in its upstream reaches batchelor et al 2003 bouma et al 2016 2011 calder et al 2008 pavelic et al 2015 although the objective of watershed management is to alleviate the water scarcity water harvesting structures may be aggravating the same in the downstream areas which may prove detrimental to the land productivity as well as water availability of these areas watershed management planning generally is done considering elementary information about the hydrological regime and the associated impacts on the upstream areas of the watershed raju et al 2008 sahayog 2006 syme et al 2012 a plausible reason for ignoring the detailed hydrological benefits while planning is the difference in the spatial scale between the management program and the regular watershed the watershed management programs are planned on an administrative boundary that need not be clearly bounded by ridge lines therefore simulating the hydrology of the implementation scale becomes challenging most of the existing hydrological models work on the principle of water balance in a hydrological sub basin or response unit and therefore it is challenging to modify their functionalities to simulate the processes on an administrative catchment with trans boundary flow conditions therefore the general practice in india is to arrive at a suitable size for the conservation structures by applying expert knowledge or a rule of thumb reddy and syme 2015 sahayog 2006 the current recommendation according to the watershed works manual prepared for the ministry of rural development in india is to size the structure by considering 40 of the annual rainfall as surface runoff and the storage volume of the structure check dam as the product of runoff and catchment area of the structure location sahayog 2006 this approach may lead to inefficient water conservation structures and there is also a significant probability that the structure may be under designed or over designed if the check dam is under designed it would not serve the purpose of mitigating water stress conditions during crop growth while an over designed structure would significantly reduce downstream flows therefore careful planning that considers the hydrological changes that the conservation structure may bring in the watershed and the associated benefits compromise for both upstream and downstream is essential for developing successful water conservation structures recently vema et al 2017 introduced a hydrological model that can simulate the hydrology in an administrative catchment this model can provide information about the stream flow at any location in the watershed and therefore one can estimate the storage volume in a proposed conservation structure therefore this model can be used for sizing the water conservation structure as the hydrological impacts and benefits of a water conservation structure can be simulated consequently optimal size of the water conservation structures can be obtained by linking this model with an optimizer that searches for a compromise solution between the positive and negative impact of the structure this study proposes a simulation optimization framework for optimal sizing of water conservation structures considering the dual conflicting objectives of increasing the in situ soil moisture upstream of the structure and increasing the flow to the downstream reaches the hydrological model by vema et al 2017 is used as the simulator and amalgam vrugt and robinson 2007 is used as the optimizer in this study the proposed method is demonstrated for check dams for an experimental watershed in kondepi mandal andhra pradesh india 2 methodology 2 1 description of the simulation optimization framework check dams can be defined as the barriers constructed across a channel to act as an impediment for soil and water the held up water by the check dams is either used directly irrigation or domestic or by recharging the groundwater the water stored in the check dams is at the expense of the flow to the downstream it is essential to maintain a certain amount of flow to the downstream reaches and structures for a sustainable watershed management program therefore optimization of the size of check dams is required not only to store enough water to mitigate the water stress during the critical periods of crop growth but also to have sufficient flow to downstream reaches the first step toward the sizing of the structure requires estimation of flow at the selected location to quantify the available volume for storage simulation of rainfall runoff process by using a hydrological model over a sufficiently long period would give the average storage volume at the check dam location and an estimate of the downstream flows a schematic diagram of the proposed simulation optimization framework is presented in fig 1 the stream flow and the soil moisture simulated by the hydrological model are provided as input to the optimizer which iteratively searches for the size of the check dam that maximizes the two objectives specific details of the hydrological model optimizer and the objective function for optimization are discussed in the following sections 2 2 description of the hydrological model as mentioned earlier the hydrological processes in the administrative catchment are simulated using the hydrological model developed by vema et al 2017 the model is based on simple water balance eq 1 and grid based spatial discretization is adopted to account for variability and interaction between different land parcels the hydrological processes in the model are simulated using widely tested and accepted methods and algorithms the model simulates water balance components such as surface runoff percolation lateral flow groundwater flow and evaporation at every grid cell and the flow is routed from upstream cells to the outlet the basic water balance computation is done as 1 s w t s w o i 1 t r i q i e i p e r c i g w i where swo is the initial soil water content at the start of day i and swt is the final soil water content t is time in days ri is precipitation on day i qi is surface runoff on day i ei is evapotranspiration on day i perci is percolation on day i gwi is return flow on day i i is the time step in days the unit of all variables is mm unlike traditional ridge line watersheds administrative catchments will have a cross boundary flow at the boundary of the administrative watershed and estimation of the same is the major feature of this model the model uses a linear function concept based on the hypothesis that the flow coming from outside the boundary to administrative area was proportional to the flow generated in the boundary grid cell the following equation eq 2 is used for estimating the cross boundary flow by the model 2 f i q i δ f a w where fi is incoming flow to the i th boundary grid qi is runoff generated in the i th boundary grid δfa is difference in flow accumulated at the grid considering the master watershed and the administrative watershed and w is a parameter which accounts for upstream processes and upstream catchment characteristics vema et al 2017 provides the details of the model and its computational procedure readers are referred to the same for details 2 3 description of optimization algorithm the current problem of designing an optimum size for the check dams is a multi objective problem where the in situ moisture needs to be increased for land productivity while simultaneously maintaining sufficient flow to the downstream this multi objective optimization requires adoption of an efficient optimization algorithm to solve the problem effectively a multi algorithm genetically adaptive method amalgam vrugt and robinson 2007 was used in this study amalgam makes use of multiple optimization algorithms running in parallel and simultaneously sharing information amalgam uses four widely used optimization algorithms namely the non dominated sorted genetic algorithm ii nsga ii particle swarm optimization adaptive metropolis search and differential evolution since the information from all the 4 algorithms is used to arrive at the solution this approach is expected to give comparatively better results than the single algorithm methods amalgam has found several applications in water resources engineering varying from parameter estimation to reservoir operation maier et al 2014 singh 2012 in view of the benefits associated with amalgam and its ability to perform well for multi objective optimization problems this method was chosen as the optimization algorithm for the present study details about the amalgam can be seen in vrugt and robinson 2007 2 4 formulation of the multi objective optimization problem the first step in optimization is the problem formulation which includes selection and definition of decision variables formulation of objective functions and constraints the decision variable in this study is the size height of check dams which influences the amount of water to be stored at the check dam location the constraints for this problem usually followed are the minimum and the maximum heights of the check dam in this study 0 5 m and 1 5 m respectively are considered as the limits of the check dam height for optimization these limits were selected according to the guidelines suggested in the watershed works manual sahayog 2006 and the local practice the primary objective of the water conservation structures is to provide supplemental irrigation to mitigate the impacts of extensive dry spells design of the structure based on only this objective might result in no flow to the downstream of the structure by capturing most of the flow at the structure location itself therefore two conflicting objective functions were considered maximizing the check dam storage indicating minimum moisture stress and maximizing the downstream flows the first objective is to reduce the number of moisture stress days per year which is given by the following equation 3 o f 1 minimize t 1 t j 1 n i 1 i d i j t n i n where of1 is the first objective function t is the time step days t is the last day of the simulation day j is number of check dams within the watershed i is the number of grid cells getting supplemental irrigation i is the total number of grid cells each check dam provides supplemental irrigation d is the dry day indicator 1 if dry 0 otherwise and n is the total number of years in the simulation period in this study a dry day or moisture stress day occurs if the soil moisture content in the soil profile is less than 50 of the total available water taw the second objective is to maintain sufficient downstream flow after the check dam or maximize the flows to downstream of the watershed the objective function can be defined as maximizing the downstream flows however for amalgam the objective functions need to be defined as minimizing functions the possible ways of converting a maximizing function to minimizing function is either by factoring the of with 1 or subtracting the of with a constant value which is greater than the of in this study we have adopted the later approach where the objective function is formulated to minimize the difference between the stream flow estimated at the watershed outlet with and without check dams in place this objective ensures minimum reduction in flow downstream when the structure is constructed the formulation of equation in this manner provides direct information about the reduction in the downstream flow due to the structure as compared to the virgin conditions the model is initially setup and simulated as a virgin watershed i e without any water harvesting structures and the flow at the watershed outlet is noted this flow which is a constant for optimization is used as a reference value against which other simulations are compared since the maximum flow that can be obtained is in virgin conditions the flow from the virgin watershed would always be greater than the flow obtained from the developed watershed the watershed is simulated by considering all the check dams in place and the outlet flow is noted the second objective function can be mathematically expressed as 4 o f 2 m i n i m i z e v 1 v 2 where of2 is the objective function 2 v1 is the volume of the flow obtained at the end of simulation period at the watershed outlet for the watershed in the virgin condition m3 v2 is the volume of the flow obtained at the end of simulation period at the watershed outlet when check dams are placed in the watershed m3 2 5 description of the study area and data the developed simulation optimization framework is applied to one of the micro watersheds mw1 of the kondepi watershed near kondepi mandal prakasam district andhra pradesh india the location map of the watershed is presented in fig 2 the kondepi watershed is an area of approximately 4000 ha around the kondepi village in which the integrated watershed management program iwmp is implemented by the department of rural development andhra pradesh please note that the kondepi watershed is not a traditional watershed but is a term used by the iwmp officials to refer to the area around the kondepi village the northern side of the kondepi watershed is bounded by an intermittent river which has dried up in the eastern side of the kondepi village a tank exists which was previously traditionally used for irrigation of the agricultural farms around the village however the tank has dried up as a result of variability of rainfall frequent occurrences of drought and over exploitation of the groundwater using tube well technology introduced during the green revolution period the reduction in water availability in the tank caused crop failures and other agro ecological issues subsequently resulting in migration of farmers from the village later the agricultural activity contracted to the tank bed along the streams during the rainy season therefore in order to arrest the agro ecological deterioration of the area and improve the water availability the government of india introduced iwmp in kondepi watershed the watershed is sub divided into 8 micro watersheds based on the panchayat boundaries within the kondepi watershed for better implementation of watershed management programs a panchayat is a local administrative unit a group of hamlets villages form a panchayat which is the smallest administrative unit a group of panchayats form a mandal and a group of mandals form a district the watershed has a total geographical area of 4157 ha and a net cropped area of about 1100 ha the watershed lies between latitude 15 23 n and 15 25 n and longitudes 79 48 e and 79 53 e and falls under the sub tropical climate with average annual rainfall of about 690 mm elevation of the watershed ranges from 18 8 m to 71 3 m the agricultural practices are rainfed in this watershed except 20 ha which is cropped using drip irrigation with water drawn from groundwater primary crops grown in the watershed include tobacco nicotiana tabcum red gram cajanus cajan bengal gram cicer arietinum groundnut arachis hypogaea and rice oryza sativa the watershed is plagued with agro ecological problems such as soil erosion poor crop productivity land degradation etc and these issues are further enhanced by spatio temporal variability of the rainfall various water conservation measures such as farm ponds check dams percolation tanks infiltration trenches and rock filled dams are being implemented under the iwmp in this watershed these water conservation measures are essential in the watershed to maintain soil moisture levels during the crop growing period july to january as the majority of rainfall is received between mid july to mid october in the form of high intensity short duration storms the weather parameters precipitation minimum and maximum temperature are obtained from the gridded imd dataset pai et al 2015 precipitation data corresponding to the nearest grid point to kondepi watershed is extracted from the imd 0 25 x0 25 gridded dataset and the temperature data is extracted corresponding to the nearest grid point from the 0 5 x0 5 dataset the soil and land use maps used in this study are obtained from the department of rural development andhra pradesh the soil in the watershed is classified into 10 different classes based on the percentage of sand silt and clay and the majority of the area is classified as silty clay and silty clay loam table 1 the physical properties of the soil are derived using pedo transfer functions saxton and rawls 2006 soundharajan and sudheer 2009 from the textural classification land use data from the global dataset of waterbase was used to complement the land use information from department of rural development the dem of 30 m resolution was obtained from shuttle radar topography mission srtm database and slope map was derived using this dem the details of the topographic features of the watershed are presented in fig 3 2 6 effectiveness of simulation optimization framework in the study area the hydrological model is setup for the mw1 micro watershed of the kondepi watershed for a period of 7 years from 1999 to 2005 the first 2 years of the simulation is considered as the warm up period during the period of analysis the watershed received a maximum rainfall of 900 mm in the year 2004 and minimum rainfall during 2002 the performance evaluation of the proposed simulation optimization framework was done considering three different numerical exercise scenarios as detailed below scenario 1 watershed is simulated as a virgin basin i e watershed is simulated without any check dams to assess the base conditions of the watershed without any water conservation measures scenario 2 the catchment is simulated by considering the existing check dams in the watershed the considered check dam sizes are the existing check dam sizes which are estimated using the traditional thumb rule methods scenario 3 the catchment is simulated by considering the check dams with sizes obtained from the simulation optimization framework the impacts of the check dam sizes are analyzed and compared against the simulations obtained from scenario 1 and 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 scenario 1 virgin conditions without check dams or other water harvesting structures it is observed from the simulations that the watershed experiences moisture stress conditions for more than 170 days per year fig 4 a one of the important factors for agricultural productivity during the crop growing period is availability of soil moisture the crop growing period and cropping starting date varies for different crops the major crops grown in the study area include groundnut and redgram with a cropping period of 120 and 180 days respectively the usual cropping date is between july to mid august depending on the cumulative rainfall received therefore for consistency july to january is considered as the cropping period in this study during this period on average the watershed experienced 10 days per month of moisture stress conditions these moisture stress conditions for such long durations during the critical cropping period may impede crop growth and productivity the cumulative volume of water obtained at the watershed outlet for the simulation period is 18 37 million m3 3 2 scenario 2 existing check dams in this scenario the micro watershed mw1 is simulated by considering the 7 existing check dams constructed under iwmp programme these check dams were designed in the traditional manner and all the check dams had a height of 1 5 m which is the recommended maximum limit for the check dam height by the iwmp programme generally each check dam provides supplemental irrigation to about an area 3 5 ha the grid resolution of the model setup is the same as the resolution of the dem i e 30 m therefore 6x6 grid cells 36 total with an area of 3 24 ha around the location of the check dam received supplementary irrigation the irrigation to the grids was triggered when the moisture content of the soil profile fell below the 50 of the total available water difference between the soil moisture at field capacity and the soil moisture at wilting point if sufficient water is available in the check dam storage irrigation replenished the soil moisture to field capacity the spatial variation of the moisture stress days is presented in fig 4 b the supplemental irrigation greatly improves in situ moisture availability the number of moisture stress days of the grid cells with supplemental irrigation is significantly reduced the average number of moisture stress days in these cells is as low as 69 days per year in the simulation period compared to 190 days a year in scenario 1 in addition the number of moisture stress days for the irrigated grids during the crop growing period is only 2 days per month which is much lower than the 10 days per month in the scenario 1 conditions this increase in the in situ moisture and reduction of the moisture stress days is achieved by conserving the water in the check dams which in turn reduced the flows to downstream reaches the volume collected at watershed outlet at the end of the simulation period in this scenario is 17 82 million m3 the reduction in volume of flow compared to scenario 1 is 0 55 million m3 while this reduction in volume appears to be small compared to the total volume collected it is to be noted that this reduction in volume is from a small micro watershed of 1555 ha having only 7 check dams it is proposed to construct more check dams in future in the watershed multiple micro watersheds having similar treatments in the upstream reaches of the river basin will have a significant reduction in volume to the downstream reaches of the river basin it is also to be noted that during the initial days of monsoon and also during low rainfall events no flow conditions may prevail in the immediate downstream of the check dams till the storage in check dams are filled it is to be noted that during dry spells the water stored in the check dam is used to irrigate the adjacent areas which make the soil moisture of these cells increase when a rainfall event occurs after the irrigation the generated runoff is found to be increased and was effectively simulated by the hydrological model 3 3 scenario 3 optimal check dam heights in this scenario the watershed was simulated for the check dam heights obtained from the simulation optimization framework the sizes of the check dams were optimized for increasing the in situ moisture and increasing the flow to downstream of the watershed the two objectives are conflicting in nature high releases to downstream is achieved when the check dam sizes are minimum and maximum in situ moisture is achieved when the check dams height is maximum to arrive at a solution 1000 iterative simulations fixed after various trials were performed with the amalgam optimizer the pareto optimal front presented in fig 5 shows the conflicting nature of the objective functions the x and y axis in fig 5 represent the objective functions 1 and 2 respectively for ease of understanding the y axis is represented as the ratio of volume held in check dams for optimal sizes and the volume held for traditional check dams this normalized value of the of2 is termed as fraction of change in volume at outlet the value 1 of the fraction of change in volume at outlet corresponds to both maximum check dam sizes and minimum releases to the downstream reaches the modeler or user can pick up any point on the pareto optimal front corresponding to a tradeoff between moisture stress days and reduction in the downstream discharge a point with a low number of moisture stress days corresponds to high reduction in volume of flow to downstream reaches while a point with a high number of moisture stress days corresponds to release of a higher volume of flow to the downstream areas for instance three possible solutions are marked on the pareto optimal fronts in fig 6 the corresponding check dam sizes and the average number of stress days experienced by the grid cells corresponding to each check dam is presented in table 2 the point 1 has a low average number of moisture stress days and smallest releases to the downstream reaches of the watershed outlet the maximum check dam size i e 1 5 m is obtained for this solution the total number of moisture stress days is 88 and this solution retains the maximum volume in the check dams and releases minimum flow to the downstream the point 2 has a high number of moisture stress days 144 days and maximum releases to the downstream reaches 50 more releases to the downstream reaches as compared against the releases observed when traditional check dams are in place therefore the check dam sizes corresponding to the point 2 solution does not serve the primary purpose of storing water for supplemental irrigation the point 3 is the intermediate solution corresponding to the medium number of moisture stress days 109 days and medium releases to the downstream reaches this compromise solution is considered to be an appropriate solution in this study the solution has a reduction in volume of 0 39 million m3 to the downstream resulting in 30 more releases to the downstream compared to the traditional check dam sizes although there is an increase in average number of moisture stress days in year from 88 to 109 compared to traditional check dam sizes the number of moisture stress days during the growing season 2 5 days per month for optimized check dam sizes is similar in scenario 2 and 3 as can be seen from figs 7 and 4 c it is very clear from the fig 7 that there is no significant change in number of moisture stress days during the crop growing period however the number of moisture stress days during the non growing season does increase the volume collected at the watershed outlet for the simulation period is 17 98 million m3 which is more than that obtained from the scenario 2 conditions according to the results the sizing of the structure using simulation optimization framework increased the downstream flow the excess volume at the watershed outlet is obtained at the expense of the water provided during the non growing period the increased volume may supply more water to the downstream structures though 0 15 million m3 seems to be a small volume it is to be noted that this volume is saved from a small watershed with only 7 water harvesting structures if this methodology is applied to the large number of small watersheds in a river basin total volume increase to the downstream reaches and structures may be significant 3 4 dry and wet spell length analysis one of the important factors affecting crop productivity is the length of dry and wet spells and their occurrences in the growing period the whole simulation period had 4 growing periods and corresponding rainfalls for these periods is presented in table 3 during these periods the maximum wet spell lengths for the areas with supplemental irrigation of different check dams are shown in the fig 8 from the figure it is evident that there is a significant increase in the maximum wet spell length for the check dams however maximum wet spell lengths varied across the periods due to the temporal variability in the rainfalls with lowest values observed during the 2002 2003 growing period similar results were obtained for the maximum dry spell lengths for the different growing periods the timing of the wet and the dry spell length during the crop growing period is also crucial for the crop growth and crop productivity as a dry spell during the critical cropping period would significantly reduce the crop productivity the wet and dry spells for the period 2002 2003 for cd2 cd3 cd5 and cd6 are depicted in fig 9 the check dam heights of these dams was reduced by the optimization table 2 resulting in reduced maximum wet spell length in all four for the period 2002 2003 however from the fig 9 it can be observed that the temporal distribution of the wet and dry spell lengths is similar for both traditional and optimal check dam sizes the decrease in the wet spell length is observed only during the harvesting time in late january which may not affect the crop growth and productivity the decrease in the wet spell length results from reducing the size of check dams and thus increasing the flows to the downstream reaches 3 5 simulation uncertainty and its impact on consequent decisions the preceding discussions indicate the effectiveness of the water harvesting structures such as check dams in mitigating the water stress during the critical period of the crop growth implementation of the proposed simulation optimization framework could support sustainable participatory watershed management the decisions in the participatory watershed management are taken on two aspects 1 site selection for the water harvesting structure and 2 design of the water harvesting structure participatory watershed management involves the local farmers iwmp officials as well as other government agencies farmers involvement is generally during the site selection for the water harvesting structure once the site for a structure is identified the design is performed by the engineers concerned using the guidelines provided to them currently the water availability is given little attention during the design of the structure however with the increasing water scarcity in the rainfed regions of india the recent focus of watershed management is on more crop per drop of water therefore the proposed framework would assist the iwmp officials in designing the structure with consideration of the available water at the site along with benefits to both upstream and downstream stakeholders however the major question concern for the implementing agencies to adopt the proposed framework could be the reliability accuracy of the suggestions which have a certain level of uncertainty as they are purely based on simulations and optimization the reliability accuracy of the results and decisions are affected by the accuracy of the information data used for simulation and optimization the model parameters and the model structure the analysis presented earlier is based on a single simulation of the hydrological model and therefore warrants evaluation of the reliability of the suggestions while all the sources of uncertainty are important the impact of model parameter uncertainty on the simulations and consequent decisions are investigated in this study consequently an uncertainty analysis was performed by adopting monte carlo ensemble approach the model parameter sets were sampled from the suggested parameter ranges and several model realizations were generated using the sampled parameter sets 1000 simulations in this study the variability of the simulations across the monte carlo ensemble was analyzed to understand the uncertainty of the simulations to highlight the parameter uncertainty 5 representative simulations resulting from 5 different parameter sets from the ensemble were considered and were used independently to identify the optimal check dam sizes using the proposed simulation optimization framework the corresponding pareto optimal fronts and the variability in the check dam heights for the 5 simulations are presented in fig 10 and table 4 respectively note that the check dam heights in table 4 are obtained for the optimal solution corresponding to the one providing 30 increase in flow to downstream the optimal check dam sizes obtained in this exercise showed variability for 4 check dams cd2 cd3 cd4 and cd7 while the remaining 3 the check dams cd1 cd5 and cd6 sizes were similar in all the 5 selected simulations it is noted that the optimal check dam heights obtained from the 5 model realizations were more economical lower heights as compared to the traditional check dam sizes it is also noted that none of these solutions indicated a significant dry spell during the growing period results are not presented herein for brevity therefore it seems that the check dam sizes suggested through the proposed approach can be adopted though lowering the heights of the existing check dams may not be feasible due to various socio economic reasons the proposed framework may find applications in future watershed management plans especially since the study area and its surroundings are facing more and more water shortage nonetheless more rigorous uncertainty analysis may be required to arrive at concrete recommendations 4 summary and conclusions water conservation as a part of the watershed management significantly improves the water availability for agriculture in the rainfed areas however the water conservation in the upstream reaches of a watershed has an impact on the downstream flows in this study a simulation optimization framework is developed for the optimal sizing of the check dams by considering the objectives of increasing the moisture availability in the watershed and minimizing the reduction of flows to the downstream reaches the results indicate that the check dams of sizes obtained from both traditional method and simulation optimization method increase moisture availability in the watershed however for check dam sizes obtained from the simulation optimization framework there is an increase in the flow to downstream reaches compared to the check dam sizes obtained from the traditional methods the increase in downstream flows obtained by optimizing the check dam heights is at the expense of increased moisture stress days in the non growing period thus not affecting the crop growth or productivity further analysis of wet and dry spell lengths revealed that the optimal check dam sizes performance is comparable to the traditional check dam sizes in addition an analysis of the model parametric uncertainty and its impact on decisions is performed to assess the reliability of the decisions although the model parametric uncertainty introduced variability in check dam sizes its impact on the derived benefits from the water harvesting structures is found to be small detailed uncertainty studies considering other sources of uncertainty may be required to reinforce the reliability of the decisions the results from this study indicated that the proposed simulation optimization framework can be of assistance in sizing of check dams for sustainable and effective watershed management acknowledgement the authors would like to show their appreciation and thank the associate editor and the anonymous reviewers for their critical observations constructive comments and creative suggestions which helped us substantially improve the quality of presentation

7151,watershed management in rainfed agricultural areas of arid and semi arid regions aims at alleviating agricultural drought by employing water conservation measures water conservation measures serve as mechanisms for recharging groundwater and also for surface storage while the benefits derived from these structures is widely accepted there is increasing concern regarding their sustainability and efficiency the application of water conservation measures in upstream reaches contributes to reduced inflows to downstream reaches and structures currently watershed management is planned by considering elementary information about the hydrological regime and its associated impacts on the upstream reaches of the watershed this approach may lead to inefficient water conservation structures and there is also a significant probability that the structure may be under designed or over designed therefore careful planning that considers the hydrological changes that the conservation structure may bring in the watershed and the associated benefits compromise for both upstream and downstream is essential for developing a successful watershed management plan a simulation optimization framework for optimal sizing of the water conservation structure considering the dual objectives of improving the benefits in the upstream reaches while maintaining flows in the downstream reaches is proposed in this study the proposed method is demonstrated for optimal sizing of water conservation structures check dams in this study for an experimental watershed in kondepi mandal andhra pradesh india the results indicate that the check dams of sizes obtained from both traditional method and simulation optimization method increase moisture availability in the watershed however for check dam sizes obtained from the simulation optimization framework there is an increase in the flow to downstream reaches compared to the check dam sizes obtained from the traditional methods the increase in downstream flows obtained by optimizing the check dam heights is at the expense of increased moisture stress days in the non growing period thus not affecting the crop growth or productivity the results from this study indicate that the proposed simulation optimization framework can be of assistance in sizing of check dams for sustainable and effective watershed management keywords watershed management water conservation check dams simulation optimization 1 introduction rainfed agricultural areas in arid and semi arid regions experience severe agricultural drought due to the erratic nature of rainfall watershed management which helps improve land productivity by maximizing the water availability for rainfed agriculture is practiced in many countries to mitigate the impact of erratic rainfall garg et al 2012 mbilinyi et al 2007 rockstrom 2000 syme et al 2015 the primary aim of any watershed management program in rainfed regions is to enhance the ecosystem and land productivity through soil and water conservation practices adham et al 2016a 2016b guyassa et al 2017 kadam et al 2012 reddy et al 2017 in general various structural and non structural measures such as contour bunds water harvesting structures like farm ponds and check dams field bunds afforestation vegetative cover etc are adopted for soil and water conservation raju et al 2008 syme et al 2015 wani and garg 2009 however the practices adopted for implementation depend on the hydrologic biophysical and socio economic conditions of the watershed adham et al 2016a reddy et al 2017 among the measures water harvesting structures like check dams and farm ponds are preferred by local stakeholders and implementing agencies for their noticeable impacts and also for limited land area requirement compared to other techniques reddy et al 2017 syme et al 2015 these water harvesting structures serve as mechanisms for recharging groundwater and also for surface storage it is also to be noted that water harvesting structures like check dams slow down the water and sediments along the streams thus controlling soil erosion along with water conservation guyassa et al 2017 nyssen et al 2010 2008 while there has been an increased application of water harvesting structures their sustainability and efficiency is debated in many studies adham et al 2016a reddy et al 2017 syme et al 2015 various impact assessment studies of water harvesting structures have been carried out in the past batchelor et al 2003 calder et al 2008 datta 2015 garg et al 2012 but most of them focused on the socio economic impacts and largely ignored the hydrological and biophysical impacts for instance many studies across the world underscored the impacts of water harvesting structures in terms of increased crop productivity garg et al 2012 increased agricultural income and better livelihood of the stakeholder calder et al 2008 datta 2015 raising the groundwater level expansion and emergence of crop areas and prolonging the cropping periods garg et al 2012 guyassa et al 2017 etc consequently there is a growing concern regarding the negative externalities caused by these structures on the downstream reaches where the available water gets reduced some studies have attributed declined contribution of water in the surface water bodies located in the downstream to watershed development in its upstream reaches batchelor et al 2003 bouma et al 2016 2011 calder et al 2008 pavelic et al 2015 although the objective of watershed management is to alleviate the water scarcity water harvesting structures may be aggravating the same in the downstream areas which may prove detrimental to the land productivity as well as water availability of these areas watershed management planning generally is done considering elementary information about the hydrological regime and the associated impacts on the upstream areas of the watershed raju et al 2008 sahayog 2006 syme et al 2012 a plausible reason for ignoring the detailed hydrological benefits while planning is the difference in the spatial scale between the management program and the regular watershed the watershed management programs are planned on an administrative boundary that need not be clearly bounded by ridge lines therefore simulating the hydrology of the implementation scale becomes challenging most of the existing hydrological models work on the principle of water balance in a hydrological sub basin or response unit and therefore it is challenging to modify their functionalities to simulate the processes on an administrative catchment with trans boundary flow conditions therefore the general practice in india is to arrive at a suitable size for the conservation structures by applying expert knowledge or a rule of thumb reddy and syme 2015 sahayog 2006 the current recommendation according to the watershed works manual prepared for the ministry of rural development in india is to size the structure by considering 40 of the annual rainfall as surface runoff and the storage volume of the structure check dam as the product of runoff and catchment area of the structure location sahayog 2006 this approach may lead to inefficient water conservation structures and there is also a significant probability that the structure may be under designed or over designed if the check dam is under designed it would not serve the purpose of mitigating water stress conditions during crop growth while an over designed structure would significantly reduce downstream flows therefore careful planning that considers the hydrological changes that the conservation structure may bring in the watershed and the associated benefits compromise for both upstream and downstream is essential for developing successful water conservation structures recently vema et al 2017 introduced a hydrological model that can simulate the hydrology in an administrative catchment this model can provide information about the stream flow at any location in the watershed and therefore one can estimate the storage volume in a proposed conservation structure therefore this model can be used for sizing the water conservation structure as the hydrological impacts and benefits of a water conservation structure can be simulated consequently optimal size of the water conservation structures can be obtained by linking this model with an optimizer that searches for a compromise solution between the positive and negative impact of the structure this study proposes a simulation optimization framework for optimal sizing of water conservation structures considering the dual conflicting objectives of increasing the in situ soil moisture upstream of the structure and increasing the flow to the downstream reaches the hydrological model by vema et al 2017 is used as the simulator and amalgam vrugt and robinson 2007 is used as the optimizer in this study the proposed method is demonstrated for check dams for an experimental watershed in kondepi mandal andhra pradesh india 2 methodology 2 1 description of the simulation optimization framework check dams can be defined as the barriers constructed across a channel to act as an impediment for soil and water the held up water by the check dams is either used directly irrigation or domestic or by recharging the groundwater the water stored in the check dams is at the expense of the flow to the downstream it is essential to maintain a certain amount of flow to the downstream reaches and structures for a sustainable watershed management program therefore optimization of the size of check dams is required not only to store enough water to mitigate the water stress during the critical periods of crop growth but also to have sufficient flow to downstream reaches the first step toward the sizing of the structure requires estimation of flow at the selected location to quantify the available volume for storage simulation of rainfall runoff process by using a hydrological model over a sufficiently long period would give the average storage volume at the check dam location and an estimate of the downstream flows a schematic diagram of the proposed simulation optimization framework is presented in fig 1 the stream flow and the soil moisture simulated by the hydrological model are provided as input to the optimizer which iteratively searches for the size of the check dam that maximizes the two objectives specific details of the hydrological model optimizer and the objective function for optimization are discussed in the following sections 2 2 description of the hydrological model as mentioned earlier the hydrological processes in the administrative catchment are simulated using the hydrological model developed by vema et al 2017 the model is based on simple water balance eq 1 and grid based spatial discretization is adopted to account for variability and interaction between different land parcels the hydrological processes in the model are simulated using widely tested and accepted methods and algorithms the model simulates water balance components such as surface runoff percolation lateral flow groundwater flow and evaporation at every grid cell and the flow is routed from upstream cells to the outlet the basic water balance computation is done as 1 s w t s w o i 1 t r i q i e i p e r c i g w i where swo is the initial soil water content at the start of day i and swt is the final soil water content t is time in days ri is precipitation on day i qi is surface runoff on day i ei is evapotranspiration on day i perci is percolation on day i gwi is return flow on day i i is the time step in days the unit of all variables is mm unlike traditional ridge line watersheds administrative catchments will have a cross boundary flow at the boundary of the administrative watershed and estimation of the same is the major feature of this model the model uses a linear function concept based on the hypothesis that the flow coming from outside the boundary to administrative area was proportional to the flow generated in the boundary grid cell the following equation eq 2 is used for estimating the cross boundary flow by the model 2 f i q i δ f a w where fi is incoming flow to the i th boundary grid qi is runoff generated in the i th boundary grid δfa is difference in flow accumulated at the grid considering the master watershed and the administrative watershed and w is a parameter which accounts for upstream processes and upstream catchment characteristics vema et al 2017 provides the details of the model and its computational procedure readers are referred to the same for details 2 3 description of optimization algorithm the current problem of designing an optimum size for the check dams is a multi objective problem where the in situ moisture needs to be increased for land productivity while simultaneously maintaining sufficient flow to the downstream this multi objective optimization requires adoption of an efficient optimization algorithm to solve the problem effectively a multi algorithm genetically adaptive method amalgam vrugt and robinson 2007 was used in this study amalgam makes use of multiple optimization algorithms running in parallel and simultaneously sharing information amalgam uses four widely used optimization algorithms namely the non dominated sorted genetic algorithm ii nsga ii particle swarm optimization adaptive metropolis search and differential evolution since the information from all the 4 algorithms is used to arrive at the solution this approach is expected to give comparatively better results than the single algorithm methods amalgam has found several applications in water resources engineering varying from parameter estimation to reservoir operation maier et al 2014 singh 2012 in view of the benefits associated with amalgam and its ability to perform well for multi objective optimization problems this method was chosen as the optimization algorithm for the present study details about the amalgam can be seen in vrugt and robinson 2007 2 4 formulation of the multi objective optimization problem the first step in optimization is the problem formulation which includes selection and definition of decision variables formulation of objective functions and constraints the decision variable in this study is the size height of check dams which influences the amount of water to be stored at the check dam location the constraints for this problem usually followed are the minimum and the maximum heights of the check dam in this study 0 5 m and 1 5 m respectively are considered as the limits of the check dam height for optimization these limits were selected according to the guidelines suggested in the watershed works manual sahayog 2006 and the local practice the primary objective of the water conservation structures is to provide supplemental irrigation to mitigate the impacts of extensive dry spells design of the structure based on only this objective might result in no flow to the downstream of the structure by capturing most of the flow at the structure location itself therefore two conflicting objective functions were considered maximizing the check dam storage indicating minimum moisture stress and maximizing the downstream flows the first objective is to reduce the number of moisture stress days per year which is given by the following equation 3 o f 1 minimize t 1 t j 1 n i 1 i d i j t n i n where of1 is the first objective function t is the time step days t is the last day of the simulation day j is number of check dams within the watershed i is the number of grid cells getting supplemental irrigation i is the total number of grid cells each check dam provides supplemental irrigation d is the dry day indicator 1 if dry 0 otherwise and n is the total number of years in the simulation period in this study a dry day or moisture stress day occurs if the soil moisture content in the soil profile is less than 50 of the total available water taw the second objective is to maintain sufficient downstream flow after the check dam or maximize the flows to downstream of the watershed the objective function can be defined as maximizing the downstream flows however for amalgam the objective functions need to be defined as minimizing functions the possible ways of converting a maximizing function to minimizing function is either by factoring the of with 1 or subtracting the of with a constant value which is greater than the of in this study we have adopted the later approach where the objective function is formulated to minimize the difference between the stream flow estimated at the watershed outlet with and without check dams in place this objective ensures minimum reduction in flow downstream when the structure is constructed the formulation of equation in this manner provides direct information about the reduction in the downstream flow due to the structure as compared to the virgin conditions the model is initially setup and simulated as a virgin watershed i e without any water harvesting structures and the flow at the watershed outlet is noted this flow which is a constant for optimization is used as a reference value against which other simulations are compared since the maximum flow that can be obtained is in virgin conditions the flow from the virgin watershed would always be greater than the flow obtained from the developed watershed the watershed is simulated by considering all the check dams in place and the outlet flow is noted the second objective function can be mathematically expressed as 4 o f 2 m i n i m i z e v 1 v 2 where of2 is the objective function 2 v1 is the volume of the flow obtained at the end of simulation period at the watershed outlet for the watershed in the virgin condition m3 v2 is the volume of the flow obtained at the end of simulation period at the watershed outlet when check dams are placed in the watershed m3 2 5 description of the study area and data the developed simulation optimization framework is applied to one of the micro watersheds mw1 of the kondepi watershed near kondepi mandal prakasam district andhra pradesh india the location map of the watershed is presented in fig 2 the kondepi watershed is an area of approximately 4000 ha around the kondepi village in which the integrated watershed management program iwmp is implemented by the department of rural development andhra pradesh please note that the kondepi watershed is not a traditional watershed but is a term used by the iwmp officials to refer to the area around the kondepi village the northern side of the kondepi watershed is bounded by an intermittent river which has dried up in the eastern side of the kondepi village a tank exists which was previously traditionally used for irrigation of the agricultural farms around the village however the tank has dried up as a result of variability of rainfall frequent occurrences of drought and over exploitation of the groundwater using tube well technology introduced during the green revolution period the reduction in water availability in the tank caused crop failures and other agro ecological issues subsequently resulting in migration of farmers from the village later the agricultural activity contracted to the tank bed along the streams during the rainy season therefore in order to arrest the agro ecological deterioration of the area and improve the water availability the government of india introduced iwmp in kondepi watershed the watershed is sub divided into 8 micro watersheds based on the panchayat boundaries within the kondepi watershed for better implementation of watershed management programs a panchayat is a local administrative unit a group of hamlets villages form a panchayat which is the smallest administrative unit a group of panchayats form a mandal and a group of mandals form a district the watershed has a total geographical area of 4157 ha and a net cropped area of about 1100 ha the watershed lies between latitude 15 23 n and 15 25 n and longitudes 79 48 e and 79 53 e and falls under the sub tropical climate with average annual rainfall of about 690 mm elevation of the watershed ranges from 18 8 m to 71 3 m the agricultural practices are rainfed in this watershed except 20 ha which is cropped using drip irrigation with water drawn from groundwater primary crops grown in the watershed include tobacco nicotiana tabcum red gram cajanus cajan bengal gram cicer arietinum groundnut arachis hypogaea and rice oryza sativa the watershed is plagued with agro ecological problems such as soil erosion poor crop productivity land degradation etc and these issues are further enhanced by spatio temporal variability of the rainfall various water conservation measures such as farm ponds check dams percolation tanks infiltration trenches and rock filled dams are being implemented under the iwmp in this watershed these water conservation measures are essential in the watershed to maintain soil moisture levels during the crop growing period july to january as the majority of rainfall is received between mid july to mid october in the form of high intensity short duration storms the weather parameters precipitation minimum and maximum temperature are obtained from the gridded imd dataset pai et al 2015 precipitation data corresponding to the nearest grid point to kondepi watershed is extracted from the imd 0 25 x0 25 gridded dataset and the temperature data is extracted corresponding to the nearest grid point from the 0 5 x0 5 dataset the soil and land use maps used in this study are obtained from the department of rural development andhra pradesh the soil in the watershed is classified into 10 different classes based on the percentage of sand silt and clay and the majority of the area is classified as silty clay and silty clay loam table 1 the physical properties of the soil are derived using pedo transfer functions saxton and rawls 2006 soundharajan and sudheer 2009 from the textural classification land use data from the global dataset of waterbase was used to complement the land use information from department of rural development the dem of 30 m resolution was obtained from shuttle radar topography mission srtm database and slope map was derived using this dem the details of the topographic features of the watershed are presented in fig 3 2 6 effectiveness of simulation optimization framework in the study area the hydrological model is setup for the mw1 micro watershed of the kondepi watershed for a period of 7 years from 1999 to 2005 the first 2 years of the simulation is considered as the warm up period during the period of analysis the watershed received a maximum rainfall of 900 mm in the year 2004 and minimum rainfall during 2002 the performance evaluation of the proposed simulation optimization framework was done considering three different numerical exercise scenarios as detailed below scenario 1 watershed is simulated as a virgin basin i e watershed is simulated without any check dams to assess the base conditions of the watershed without any water conservation measures scenario 2 the catchment is simulated by considering the existing check dams in the watershed the considered check dam sizes are the existing check dam sizes which are estimated using the traditional thumb rule methods scenario 3 the catchment is simulated by considering the check dams with sizes obtained from the simulation optimization framework the impacts of the check dam sizes are analyzed and compared against the simulations obtained from scenario 1 and 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 scenario 1 virgin conditions without check dams or other water harvesting structures it is observed from the simulations that the watershed experiences moisture stress conditions for more than 170 days per year fig 4 a one of the important factors for agricultural productivity during the crop growing period is availability of soil moisture the crop growing period and cropping starting date varies for different crops the major crops grown in the study area include groundnut and redgram with a cropping period of 120 and 180 days respectively the usual cropping date is between july to mid august depending on the cumulative rainfall received therefore for consistency july to january is considered as the cropping period in this study during this period on average the watershed experienced 10 days per month of moisture stress conditions these moisture stress conditions for such long durations during the critical cropping period may impede crop growth and productivity the cumulative volume of water obtained at the watershed outlet for the simulation period is 18 37 million m3 3 2 scenario 2 existing check dams in this scenario the micro watershed mw1 is simulated by considering the 7 existing check dams constructed under iwmp programme these check dams were designed in the traditional manner and all the check dams had a height of 1 5 m which is the recommended maximum limit for the check dam height by the iwmp programme generally each check dam provides supplemental irrigation to about an area 3 5 ha the grid resolution of the model setup is the same as the resolution of the dem i e 30 m therefore 6x6 grid cells 36 total with an area of 3 24 ha around the location of the check dam received supplementary irrigation the irrigation to the grids was triggered when the moisture content of the soil profile fell below the 50 of the total available water difference between the soil moisture at field capacity and the soil moisture at wilting point if sufficient water is available in the check dam storage irrigation replenished the soil moisture to field capacity the spatial variation of the moisture stress days is presented in fig 4 b the supplemental irrigation greatly improves in situ moisture availability the number of moisture stress days of the grid cells with supplemental irrigation is significantly reduced the average number of moisture stress days in these cells is as low as 69 days per year in the simulation period compared to 190 days a year in scenario 1 in addition the number of moisture stress days for the irrigated grids during the crop growing period is only 2 days per month which is much lower than the 10 days per month in the scenario 1 conditions this increase in the in situ moisture and reduction of the moisture stress days is achieved by conserving the water in the check dams which in turn reduced the flows to downstream reaches the volume collected at watershed outlet at the end of the simulation period in this scenario is 17 82 million m3 the reduction in volume of flow compared to scenario 1 is 0 55 million m3 while this reduction in volume appears to be small compared to the total volume collected it is to be noted that this reduction in volume is from a small micro watershed of 1555 ha having only 7 check dams it is proposed to construct more check dams in future in the watershed multiple micro watersheds having similar treatments in the upstream reaches of the river basin will have a significant reduction in volume to the downstream reaches of the river basin it is also to be noted that during the initial days of monsoon and also during low rainfall events no flow conditions may prevail in the immediate downstream of the check dams till the storage in check dams are filled it is to be noted that during dry spells the water stored in the check dam is used to irrigate the adjacent areas which make the soil moisture of these cells increase when a rainfall event occurs after the irrigation the generated runoff is found to be increased and was effectively simulated by the hydrological model 3 3 scenario 3 optimal check dam heights in this scenario the watershed was simulated for the check dam heights obtained from the simulation optimization framework the sizes of the check dams were optimized for increasing the in situ moisture and increasing the flow to downstream of the watershed the two objectives are conflicting in nature high releases to downstream is achieved when the check dam sizes are minimum and maximum in situ moisture is achieved when the check dams height is maximum to arrive at a solution 1000 iterative simulations fixed after various trials were performed with the amalgam optimizer the pareto optimal front presented in fig 5 shows the conflicting nature of the objective functions the x and y axis in fig 5 represent the objective functions 1 and 2 respectively for ease of understanding the y axis is represented as the ratio of volume held in check dams for optimal sizes and the volume held for traditional check dams this normalized value of the of2 is termed as fraction of change in volume at outlet the value 1 of the fraction of change in volume at outlet corresponds to both maximum check dam sizes and minimum releases to the downstream reaches the modeler or user can pick up any point on the pareto optimal front corresponding to a tradeoff between moisture stress days and reduction in the downstream discharge a point with a low number of moisture stress days corresponds to high reduction in volume of flow to downstream reaches while a point with a high number of moisture stress days corresponds to release of a higher volume of flow to the downstream areas for instance three possible solutions are marked on the pareto optimal fronts in fig 6 the corresponding check dam sizes and the average number of stress days experienced by the grid cells corresponding to each check dam is presented in table 2 the point 1 has a low average number of moisture stress days and smallest releases to the downstream reaches of the watershed outlet the maximum check dam size i e 1 5 m is obtained for this solution the total number of moisture stress days is 88 and this solution retains the maximum volume in the check dams and releases minimum flow to the downstream the point 2 has a high number of moisture stress days 144 days and maximum releases to the downstream reaches 50 more releases to the downstream reaches as compared against the releases observed when traditional check dams are in place therefore the check dam sizes corresponding to the point 2 solution does not serve the primary purpose of storing water for supplemental irrigation the point 3 is the intermediate solution corresponding to the medium number of moisture stress days 109 days and medium releases to the downstream reaches this compromise solution is considered to be an appropriate solution in this study the solution has a reduction in volume of 0 39 million m3 to the downstream resulting in 30 more releases to the downstream compared to the traditional check dam sizes although there is an increase in average number of moisture stress days in year from 88 to 109 compared to traditional check dam sizes the number of moisture stress days during the growing season 2 5 days per month for optimized check dam sizes is similar in scenario 2 and 3 as can be seen from figs 7 and 4 c it is very clear from the fig 7 that there is no significant change in number of moisture stress days during the crop growing period however the number of moisture stress days during the non growing season does increase the volume collected at the watershed outlet for the simulation period is 17 98 million m3 which is more than that obtained from the scenario 2 conditions according to the results the sizing of the structure using simulation optimization framework increased the downstream flow the excess volume at the watershed outlet is obtained at the expense of the water provided during the non growing period the increased volume may supply more water to the downstream structures though 0 15 million m3 seems to be a small volume it is to be noted that this volume is saved from a small watershed with only 7 water harvesting structures if this methodology is applied to the large number of small watersheds in a river basin total volume increase to the downstream reaches and structures may be significant 3 4 dry and wet spell length analysis one of the important factors affecting crop productivity is the length of dry and wet spells and their occurrences in the growing period the whole simulation period had 4 growing periods and corresponding rainfalls for these periods is presented in table 3 during these periods the maximum wet spell lengths for the areas with supplemental irrigation of different check dams are shown in the fig 8 from the figure it is evident that there is a significant increase in the maximum wet spell length for the check dams however maximum wet spell lengths varied across the periods due to the temporal variability in the rainfalls with lowest values observed during the 2002 2003 growing period similar results were obtained for the maximum dry spell lengths for the different growing periods the timing of the wet and the dry spell length during the crop growing period is also crucial for the crop growth and crop productivity as a dry spell during the critical cropping period would significantly reduce the crop productivity the wet and dry spells for the period 2002 2003 for cd2 cd3 cd5 and cd6 are depicted in fig 9 the check dam heights of these dams was reduced by the optimization table 2 resulting in reduced maximum wet spell length in all four for the period 2002 2003 however from the fig 9 it can be observed that the temporal distribution of the wet and dry spell lengths is similar for both traditional and optimal check dam sizes the decrease in the wet spell length is observed only during the harvesting time in late january which may not affect the crop growth and productivity the decrease in the wet spell length results from reducing the size of check dams and thus increasing the flows to the downstream reaches 3 5 simulation uncertainty and its impact on consequent decisions the preceding discussions indicate the effectiveness of the water harvesting structures such as check dams in mitigating the water stress during the critical period of the crop growth implementation of the proposed simulation optimization framework could support sustainable participatory watershed management the decisions in the participatory watershed management are taken on two aspects 1 site selection for the water harvesting structure and 2 design of the water harvesting structure participatory watershed management involves the local farmers iwmp officials as well as other government agencies farmers involvement is generally during the site selection for the water harvesting structure once the site for a structure is identified the design is performed by the engineers concerned using the guidelines provided to them currently the water availability is given little attention during the design of the structure however with the increasing water scarcity in the rainfed regions of india the recent focus of watershed management is on more crop per drop of water therefore the proposed framework would assist the iwmp officials in designing the structure with consideration of the available water at the site along with benefits to both upstream and downstream stakeholders however the major question concern for the implementing agencies to adopt the proposed framework could be the reliability accuracy of the suggestions which have a certain level of uncertainty as they are purely based on simulations and optimization the reliability accuracy of the results and decisions are affected by the accuracy of the information data used for simulation and optimization the model parameters and the model structure the analysis presented earlier is based on a single simulation of the hydrological model and therefore warrants evaluation of the reliability of the suggestions while all the sources of uncertainty are important the impact of model parameter uncertainty on the simulations and consequent decisions are investigated in this study consequently an uncertainty analysis was performed by adopting monte carlo ensemble approach the model parameter sets were sampled from the suggested parameter ranges and several model realizations were generated using the sampled parameter sets 1000 simulations in this study the variability of the simulations across the monte carlo ensemble was analyzed to understand the uncertainty of the simulations to highlight the parameter uncertainty 5 representative simulations resulting from 5 different parameter sets from the ensemble were considered and were used independently to identify the optimal check dam sizes using the proposed simulation optimization framework the corresponding pareto optimal fronts and the variability in the check dam heights for the 5 simulations are presented in fig 10 and table 4 respectively note that the check dam heights in table 4 are obtained for the optimal solution corresponding to the one providing 30 increase in flow to downstream the optimal check dam sizes obtained in this exercise showed variability for 4 check dams cd2 cd3 cd4 and cd7 while the remaining 3 the check dams cd1 cd5 and cd6 sizes were similar in all the 5 selected simulations it is noted that the optimal check dam heights obtained from the 5 model realizations were more economical lower heights as compared to the traditional check dam sizes it is also noted that none of these solutions indicated a significant dry spell during the growing period results are not presented herein for brevity therefore it seems that the check dam sizes suggested through the proposed approach can be adopted though lowering the heights of the existing check dams may not be feasible due to various socio economic reasons the proposed framework may find applications in future watershed management plans especially since the study area and its surroundings are facing more and more water shortage nonetheless more rigorous uncertainty analysis may be required to arrive at concrete recommendations 4 summary and conclusions water conservation as a part of the watershed management significantly improves the water availability for agriculture in the rainfed areas however the water conservation in the upstream reaches of a watershed has an impact on the downstream flows in this study a simulation optimization framework is developed for the optimal sizing of the check dams by considering the objectives of increasing the moisture availability in the watershed and minimizing the reduction of flows to the downstream reaches the results indicate that the check dams of sizes obtained from both traditional method and simulation optimization method increase moisture availability in the watershed however for check dam sizes obtained from the simulation optimization framework there is an increase in the flow to downstream reaches compared to the check dam sizes obtained from the traditional methods the increase in downstream flows obtained by optimizing the check dam heights is at the expense of increased moisture stress days in the non growing period thus not affecting the crop growth or productivity further analysis of wet and dry spell lengths revealed that the optimal check dam sizes performance is comparable to the traditional check dam sizes in addition an analysis of the model parametric uncertainty and its impact on decisions is performed to assess the reliability of the decisions although the model parametric uncertainty introduced variability in check dam sizes its impact on the derived benefits from the water harvesting structures is found to be small detailed uncertainty studies considering other sources of uncertainty may be required to reinforce the reliability of the decisions the results from this study indicated that the proposed simulation optimization framework can be of assistance in sizing of check dams for sustainable and effective watershed management acknowledgement the authors would like to show their appreciation and thank the associate editor and the anonymous reviewers for their critical observations constructive comments and creative suggestions which helped us substantially improve the quality of presentation

7152,measuremental and methodological problems arising from the presence of ice cover on waterways have seriously hindered the progress in predicting timely and accurate streamflow which is a prerequisite for the effective management of ice covered waterways e g streams rivers channels and canals among various methods in the attempt to address this issue the most attractive is the physically based method which does not require abundant and often unobtainable data this paper develops a physically based k factor method in the form of a generalized manning equation for discharge estimations in ice covered channels the main advantage of this method is that it enables the prediction of streamflow in ice affected seasons by a k factor adjustment of the stage discharge relationship developed in the open water seasons the results of parameter estimation show that the k factor is only related to the boundary resistance ratio which is parameterized by two exponents of the two power law for describing the vertical streamwise velocity profile experimental measurements collected from the literature were used to test the applicability of the proposed formula and to compare its relative accuracy with the sabaneev and larsen formulae the comparative results indicate that the proposed method is more accurate in estimating streamflow of ice covered channels than

introduction in cold regions timely and reliable estimates of streamflow throughout the year especially in the ice affected season are essential for supporting the appropriate management of ice infested waterways e g streams rivers channels and canals this includes the control of ice related floods ambtman and hicks 2012 design and operation of water transfer canals altunin et al 1981 guo et al 2017 assessment of river water quality healy and hicks 2004 and aquatic habitat maintenance lind et al 2014 during ice free periods discharge estimates are usually made by continuously monitoring water levels at gauging stations and then converting these data to discharge using established stage discharge rating curves morse and hicks 2005 chokmani et al 2008 however when channels are covered with ice in winter flow under ice is retarded by an additional boundary which halves hydraulic radius increases flow resistance and thence reduces channel conveyance capacity davar and elhadi 1981 chokmani et al 2008 ghareh aghaji zare et al 2016 consequently the rating curve derived for the open water periods is not applicable during ice affected periods teal et al 1994 chen et al 2016 moreover because of spatial and temporal variations in ice roughness it may be impossible to establish a unique rating curve for the ice affected season morse and hicks 2005 the determination of ice affected streamflow entails direct measurements using the velocity area method teal et al 1994 attar and li 2012 or alternative methods such as the one point method two point method and complete profile method walker 1991 operationally direct measurements are labor intensive and place hydrometric agencies at personal risk healy and hicks 2004 the development of an analytical method capable of simply and accurately estimating discharge during the ice affected period is urgently needed since the 1920s numerous studies have been devoted to ice affected discharge assessment of ice covered channels notable work has been periodically reviewed by uzuner 1975 walker 1991 chokmani et al 2008 and ghareh aghaji zare et al 2016 the methods reviewed could be mainly classified into hydrologic hydraulic statistical and artificial intelligence the hydrologic method including the hydrographic method summarized by walker 1991 such as base flow recession k factor determination interpolated discharge and backwater shift is generally unsuitable for timely estimates of winter discharge because of its irreproducibility excessive time consumption and relatively low precision of predictions hamilton et al 2000 chokmani et al 2008 the statistical method uses for example conductance correlation and multiple regression to establish an empirical relationship for discharge prediction walker 1991 the artificial intelligence technique such as artificial neural networks is an alternative predictor for winter discharge using historical data chokmani et al 2008 the statistical and artificial intelligence methods are data driven procedures that require abundant historical meteorological and hydrometric data hence these two methods are difficult to apply to discharge predictions for ungauged streams and rivers and for designs of planed channels and canals the limitations of poor in situ databases on method selection and the requirements of reliable discharge estimates for river management result in the widespread use of the hydraulic method in estimating winter discharge under ice affected conditions of the hydraulic methods available for calculating winter discharge the manning equation has advantages because it does not require flow velocities which are difficult to obtain during ice affected periods ice covered channels are typically composite channels with varying degrees of roughness along their wetted perimeters sukhodolov et al 1999 pioneering work on ice covered channel hydraulics was thus mainly centered on the derivation of the composite roughness coefficient that incorporates the frictional effect of fixed boundaries nezhikhovskiy 1964 larsen 1973 uzuner 1975 various formulae have been suggested for estimating the composite roughness for ice covered channels with parabolic sections larsen 1969 uzuner 1975 ghareh aghaji zare et al 2016 but few have considered the rectangular or trapezoidal sections that are widely used in the design of water delivery channels chow 1959 moreover if using these existing methods we need to develop separate stage discharge relationships for ice free and ice affected periods in cold region rivers given the easiness in collecting data during ice free periods there is a potential alternative method to streamflow estimation during ice affected periods by using the well established stage discharge relationships developed during ice free periods the objective of this paper was therefore to develop a physically based formula for estimating the discharge capacity during ice free and ice affected periods the paper is organized as follows a new analytical predictor is derived for streamflow estimation in ice covered channels in section 2 section 3 discusses the methods for estimating the parameters in the proposed formula in section 4 1 field observations and laboratory measurements are documented to verify performance of the proposed formula section 4 2 compares the relative accuracy with two other frequently used formulae discusses the delimitations of the two layer flow and pinpoints the scope of applicability of the proposed formula finally the main conclusions are presented in section 5 2 theoretical analysis although the presence of ice cover alters the structure of the underlying flow quasi uniform conditions also prevail in cold region waterways during winter beltaos 2011 therefore the flow velocity may be related to the resistance coefficient using a conventional friction formula e g the manning equation chow 1959 yen 1992 1 v 0 1 n 0 r 0 2 3 s 0 1 2 where v is the sectional average velocity r is the hydraulic radius n is the manning resistance coefficient s is the energy slope and the subscript 0 refers to the hydraulic parameters of the entire cross section obviously an accurate estimate of the manning coefficient of the entire flow section is crucial for applying the manning equation to streamflow estimation under ice covered conditions as a composite channel the composite manning coefficient in ice covered channels is conventionally a weighted sum of the local resistance coefficient uzuner 1975 in computation it entails dividing the cross section into several hydraulically homogeneous subsections as follows 2 1 partitioning of ice covered channels ice covered hydraulics is still based on the two flow layer concept even though two sets of length and velocity scales generated from the two fixed boundaries bed and ice cover interact with each other in the central region beltaos 2001 2011 in previous studies of ice covered channels flow section was usually divided into two independent layers by the isoline of the maximum velocity the bed dominated layer and the ice dominated layer as shown in fig 1 teal et al 1994 sukhodolov et al 1999 attar and li 2012 flow depths in the two flow layers are denoted by y 1 and y 2 respectively then flow depth ratio of the two layers is defined as 2 r y y 2 y 1 h y 1 y 1 in which ry is the flow depth ratio of the two flow layers for the traditional two layer hypothesis and h is the total flow depth in accordance with the einstein s 1942 hydraulic radius separation theory the delineation between the two layers should be the plane of zero shear stress however there is an ongoing debate over whether the plane of maximum velocity i e zero velocity gradient corresponds to that of zero shear stress while some have stated that the maximum velocity coincides with a zero shear stress krishnappan 1984 numerous researchers approved that these two planes do not coincide apart from symmetric flow hanjalic and launder 1972 tatinclaux and göğüs 1983 tsai and ettema 1994 parthasarathy and muste 1994 chen et al 2015 hence we side with the majority and agree that the isoline of zero velocity gradients does not coincide with that of zero shear stress and so introduce the modified two layer hypothesis in which the division curve is replaced by the zero shear stress curve chen et al 2015 based on this a cross section of a rectangular or trapezoidal ice covered channel may be divided into three subsections bed ice and side wall as shown in fig 2 chen et al 2016 herein the flow depth ratio for the modified two layer hypothesis is defined as 3 r h h 2 h 1 h h 1 h 1 in which rh is the flow depth ratio of the two flow layers and h 1 and h 2 are the flow depths in the bed affected and ice affected layer respectively the elevation of zero shear stress h 1 is mainly related to the roughnesses of two fixed boundary chen et al 2015 in the modified two layer hypothesis flow resistance is parameterized by two exponents m 1 and m 2 in the so called two power law in the preferred description of the vertical streamwise velocity profile tsai 1991 tsai and ettema 1994 4 u η z h 1 m 1 1 z h 1 m 2 in which η is a constant for a given flow rate and z is distance from the bed setting u z 0 gives the normalized elevation of maximum velocity y 1 h as 5 y 1 h m 2 m 1 m 2 1 1 r m in which rm m 1 m 2 represents the boundary resistance ratio the elevation of zero shear stress h 1 is determined by 6 h 1 ξ h where ξ is a proportionality coefficient determined by a group of nine equations chen et al 2015 which leads to eq 6 is somewhat awkward to apply because the plane of zero shear stress h 1 is nearer the smooth fixed boundary than the plane of maximum mean velocity y 1 hanjalic and launder 1972 we assumed that there is a certain relationship between the elevations of the two planes fig 3 depicts the ratios of elevation of zero shear stress h 1 calculated from eq 6 and the maximum mean velocity y 1 obtained from eq 5 plotted against rm the relative height h 1 y 1 tends to be constant for the same value of rm however as rm increases h 1 y 1 decreases and is very strongly correlated with the fitted curve correlation coefficient r 2 0 9920 7 h 1 y 1 α e β r m where α 1 72 and β 0 55 are regression coefficients in the range of 1 5 m 1 2 8 5 which covers all the estimated values from more than 2300 vertical velocity profiles collected at 13 streamflow gauging stations teal et al 1994 the observed results of parthasarathy and muste 1994 and tsai and ettema 1994 are also plotted in fig 3 to check the performance of the regression curve combining eqs 5 and 7 the flow depth ratio rh in eq 3 may be determined by 8 r h 1 r m α e β r m 1 2 2 derivation of composite roughness coefficient 2 2 1 general formula for composite roughness coefficient channel sections with different roughnesses along the wetter perimeter are divided into n hydraulically homogeneous subsections the divided subsections are sequentially labelled by arabic number i i 1 2 n which serves as the subscript to denote the hydraulic parameters of the i th arbitrary subsection following the principle of flow continuity total flow discharge equals to the sum of the discharges of the subsections i e 9 a 0 v 0 i 1 n a i v i in which a is the cross sectional area by applying the manning equation in each subsection and the entire flow section eq 9 can be rewritten as lotter 1933 10 1 n 0 i 1 n 1 n i p i p 0 r i 5 3 r 0 5 3 in which p is the wetted perimeter normally the wetted perimeter of each subsection does not include the internal water lines dividing the subsections into computing hydraulic radii yen 2002 if these internal lines have zero shear stress then considering the momentum balance in each subsection yields 11 τ i p i ρ ga i s 0 or 12 r i τ i ρ gs 0 in which ρ is the mass density of water g is the gravitational acceleration and τ is the boundary shear stress substituting eq 12 into eq 10 yields 13 n 0 p 0 ρ gr 0 s 0 5 3 i 1 n 1 n i p i τ i 5 3 in which p 0 s 0 and pi are easily obtained by direct measurement the unknown parameter τi can be determined analytically by numerous available methods khodashenas et al 2008 2 2 2 application to rectangular ice covered channels in this paper a steady quasi uniform flow in an ice covered channel of rectangular or trapezoidal cross section is considered for rectangular ice covered channels n 3 as sketched in fig 2a eq 13 can be rewritten as 14 1 n 0 1 n 1 r 1 h r 1 r 0 2 3 1 n 2 r 2 h r 2 r 0 2 3 2 1 n 3 r 3 b r 3 r 0 2 3 in which b is the channel width and the subscripts 1 2 and 3 are used to denote parameters for bed ice and side wall subsections respectively when applying eq 14 for composite roughness calculation it is crucial to determine the division curves of zero shear stress for calculating the hydraulic radius of each subsection the functional relationship for these division curves in regular channels can be determined by conformal mapping procedures these procedures have been successfully applied in rectangular open channels guo and julien 2005 trapezoidal open channels kabiri samani et al 2013 and rectangular ice covered channels chen et al 2015 based on the determination of the division curves the mean boundary shear stress in a rectangular ice covered channel can be analytically determined from the momentum balance in each subsection chen et al 2016 as follows 15 τ 1 ρ ghs 0 r 1 h 4 π h 1 h tan 1 exp π h 1 b π 4 h 1 2 bh exp h 1 b 16 τ 2 ρ ghs 0 r 2 h 4 π h 2 h tan 1 exp π h 2 b π 4 h 2 2 bh exp h 2 b 17 τ 3 ρ ghs 0 r 3 h b 2 h 1 r 1 h r 2 h in which eq 12 has been used because natural rivers in cold regions during the winter are usually wide channels substituting b for wide channels into eqs 15 17 one has r 1 h 1 r 2 h 2 and r 3 0 with these approximations eq 14 becomes 18 n 0 1 2 2 3 1 r h 5 3 1 r n r h 5 3 n 1 in which rn n 1 n 2 is the ratio of the manning coefficients 2 2 3 application to trapezoidal ice covered channels similarly for trapezoidal ice covered channels as sketched in fig 2b n 3 by employing the guo and julien s method the mean boundary shear stress in eq 13 is determined by 19 τ 1 ρ ghs 0 r 1 h h 1 h exp ψ 1 h 1 b 1 λ 1 h 1 2 b 1 h exp λ 2 ψ 1 h 1 b 1 20 τ 2 ρ ghs 0 r 2 h h 2 h exp ψ 2 h 2 b 2 λ 1 h 2 2 b 2 h exp λ 2 ψ 2 h 2 b 2 21 τ 3 ρ ghs 0 b 1 2 h 1 s 2 sh b 1 1 r 1 h r 2 h in which b 1 is the bed width b 2 is width of the underside of ice cover s cot θ is channel sidewall lateral slope with θ being the angle of sidewall with horizontal direction ψ 1 and ψ 2 are constants related to θ λ 1 and λ 2 are correction factors kabiri samani et al 2013 applying b 1 for wide channels in eqs 19 21 results in 22 r 1 h 1 r 2 h 2 r 3 sh 2 1 s 2 because p 1 p 0 1 2 p 2 p 0 1 2 and p 3 p 0 0 when b 1 for wide channels substituting eq 22 into eq 13 one can obtain the same relationship as eq 18 2 3 new predictor for streamflow estimation substituting eq 18 into eq 1 yields 23 v 0 2 2 3 1 r n r h 5 3 1 r h 5 3 1 n 1 r 0 2 3 s 0 1 2 24 r 0 bh 2 b 2 h 1 2 δ 1 δ h in which δ b h is the aspect ratio substituting δ for wide channels into eq 24 one has r 0 h 2 that is hydraulic radius of the entire cross section is approximately equal to one half of the total flow depth with the second approximation eq 23 may be amended as 25 v 0 k 1 n 1 h 2 3 s 0 1 2 26 k 1 r n r h 5 3 1 r h 5 3 in which k is the physically based coefficient k factor this relationship indicates that the discharge capacity in ice affected seasons is proportional to that in open water seasons specially when rh 0 open channel flows eq 26 gives k 1 and then eq 25 becomes the conventional manning equation which confirms the assumption that open water flows are regarded as a special case of asymmetric flows with the top boundary roughness n 2 0 parthasarathy and muste 1994 chen et al 2015 furthermore eq 25 may be considered as a general expression of the manning equation that is appropriate for estimating discharge under open water and ice affected conditions the k factor adjustment coefficient allows us to estimate discharge in ice affected seasons with the well established rating curves for open water seasons 3 estimation of parameters the manning coefficients n 1 and n 2 can be related to the exponents m 1 and m2 in the two power law chen et al 2016 by 27 n 1 κ r 1 1 6 m 1 g n 2 κ r 2 1 6 m 2 g where κ is the von karman constant for wide channels rn can be obtained from 28 r n n 1 n 2 1 r m r h 1 6 as shown in eqs 8 and 28 rn rm and rh are interrelated with each other when one of these three ratios is known the other two ratios can be determined from the two relationships note that in a measured section there does not exist prior knowledge of the elevation of zero shear stress that can be used to determine rh in advance we therefore proposed three methods in two categories to estimate the parameters in eq 26 3 1 rm oriented parameter estimation methods 1 resistance coefficient method method i when the hydraulic roughness heights k 1 and k 2 are known the darcy weisbach resistance coefficients f 1 and f 2 can be solved iteratively for an assumed v 0 using the coupled equations of parthasarathy and muste 1994 as follows 29 8 f 1 1 2 1 κ log f 1 8 1 2 r e 1 0 3 k 1 h f 1 8 1 2 r e 5 5 1 κ log 1 μ 1 μ 3 2 1 μ 30 8 f 2 1 2 1 κ log f 2 8 1 2 r e 1 0 3 k 2 h f 2 8 1 2 r e 5 5 1 κ log 1 μ μ 1 μ 3 2 μ 1 2 1 μ in which f 1 and f 2 are the darcy weisbach resistance coefficients μ f 1 f 2 is the resistance ratio and re v0h υ is the reynolds number where υ is the dynamic viscosity as the exponents m 1 and m 2 can be related to the darcy weisbach resistance coefficients tsai and ettema 1994 using 31 m 1 κ 8 f 1 1 2 m 2 κ 8 f 2 1 2 rm can be determined by 32 r m f 2 f 1 1 2 2 velocity distribution analysis method ii substituting eq 5 into eq 2 gives 33 r m r y hence when the vertical streamwise velocity profile is available y 1 where the streamwise velocity is at a maximum can be identified then one can obtain ry from eq 2 and convert it into rm with eq 33 once rm was determined by either of the two methods rh can be calculated from eq 8 and rn can be obtained from eq 28 3 2 rn oriented parameter estimation method the bed roughness n 1 assessed from open water data is normally used as an approximation beltaos 2011 li 2012 the ice cover roughness n 2 can be estimated by several methods such as empirical modeling shen and yapa 1986 and velocity distribution analysis calkins et al 1982 li 2012 when the values of the manning coefficients n 1 and n 2 are known rh may be determined iteratively from eqs 8 and 28 method iii 4 results and discussions 4 1 verification of the proposed formula 4 1 1 computational procedure in practical applications the flow section of interest in lined channels or in natural rivers with relatively flat beds may be generalized into a rectangular or trapezoidal section with ice thickness and slush thickness laterally averaged the geometrical parameters such as h and b for a rectangular section or b 1 b 2 and h for a trapezoidal section and the hydraulic parameter s 0 are easily obtained by direct measurement the remaining parameters can be estimated with one of the three proposed methods method i ii and iii according to data availability however the computational procedure varies depending on which parameter estimation method is used taking method i as an example the computational procedure for estimating streamflow in an ice covered channel for a given total flow depth h channel slope s 0 and hydraulic roughness heights k 1 and k 2 runs as follows 1 determine f 1 and f 1 for an assumed v 0 0 from eqs 29 and 30 using the newton raphson algorithm 2 use eq 32 to compute r m k calculate r h k from eq 8 and then determine r n k from eq 28 where the superscript k denotes the number of iterations 3 determine the manning coefficient n 1 for the bed subsection first calculate flow depth h 1 k using eq 3 then if δ larger than the threshold value δ for classifying ice covered channels into narrow and wide channels r 1 k h 1 k otherwise use eq 15 to compute r 1 k finally determine n 1 k from eqs 27 and 31 4 use eq 26 to determine k k and then obtain v 0 k from eq 25 if δ δ otherwise use eq 1 and eq 13 to determine v 0 k 5 if v 0 k v 0 k 1 ε v stop the iteration where ε v is the acceptable iteration accuracy for the bulk velocity v 0 otherwise update the bulk velocity in eqs 29 and 30 by v 0 k and repeat steps 2 to 4 the iteration continues until the iteration accuracy is acceptable the flow chart of the proposed formula with model parameters being estimated by method i together with method ii and method iii for stage discharge prediction in ice covered channels is shown in fig 4 4 1 2 data collection the applicability of the proposed formula was validated by available experimental data for under ice channels including laboratory measurements from small scale laboratory flumes by engmann 1977 parthasarathy and muste 1994 smith and ettema 1997 and wei and huang 2002 and field observations in large scale natural rivers by tatinclaux and göğüs 1983 and attar and li 2012 a summary of the geometrical parameters and hydraulic conditions is listed in table 1 4 1 3 model verifications the proposed formulae eq 13 and eq 25 were selected to compute discharge because of the large differences in the flow rates between natural rivers and laboratory flumes we converted the measured flow discharge to bulk velocity to facilitate mapping the average relative error e was employed to evaluate the performances of the two formulae which is defined by 34 e 1 m j 1 m v 0 e j v 0 m j v 0 m j in which m is the number of the test runs v 0m j is the measured velocity and v 0e j is estimated velocity a comparison of the bulk velocity measured results subscript m with results estimated from the selected formulae subscript e shown in fig 5 gives an e of 10 94 m 40 this indicates that the proposed formula accurately predicts the discharge conveyance of ice covered channels in fig 5 it can be seen that for channels with a large aspect ratio δ e g natural rivers 24 δ 121 the calculation accuracy of the simplified formula given by eq 25 is approximately equal to that of the original formula eq 13 while the formula results in larger relative errors for channels with a relatively smaller aspect ratio δ e g 2 δ 3 for the experimental runs of wei and huang 2002 marked by the red circle in fig 5b this discrepancy indicates that the scope of the application of eq 25 needs to be clearly defined 4 2 discussions 4 2 1 comparisons with the conventional formulae two conventional methods the sabaneev formula and larsen formula were used to compare the relative accuracy of the proposed method the former is expressed as uzuner 1975 35 n 0 s n 1 2 n 2 2 2 1 2 in which n 0s is the sabaneev s composite manning coefficient while replacing rh with ry in eq 18 it becomes the well known larsen formula larsen 1973 as 36 n 0 l 1 2 2 3 1 r y 5 3 1 r n r y 5 3 n 1 in which n 0l is the larsen s composite manning coefficient the two formulae are based on the traditional two layer hypothesis substituting eq 33 into eqs 35 and 36 gives 37 k s 1 1 r m 7 4 2 3 38 k l 1 r m 1 2 1 r m 5 3 in which k s k l are the k factors of the sabaneev and larsen formulae respectively these relationships demonstrate that the two k factors similar to the k factor in eq 26 are only related to the ratio rm therefore we plotted the three k factors against rm with a marked inflexion point at rm 1 fig 5 when rm less than1 these k factors are approximately equal which indicates that the sabaneev and larsen formulae may be adopted to simplify the computational procedure when the channel bed is rougher than the ice cover however when rm greater than1 the difference among the three k factors increases as rm increases flow discharge would be overestimated with the larsen formula and sabaneev formula if the flow resistance of under ice cover was larger than that of the channel bottom comparisons of the experimental observations with the theoretical results predicted by eqs 26 37 and 38 as shown in fig 6 demonstrated that eq 26 gives better predictions than the conventional formulae based on traditional two layer hypothesis this superiority is especially obvious for high grade asymmetric channels e g the three runs of tatinclaux and göğüs 1983 where rm is greater than 2 0 as natural rivers during ice covered periods are usually highly asymmetric the proposed eq 26 is recommended for use under ice covered conditions 4 2 2 delimitations of the two layer flow prior knowledge of the delimitation of flow section is required when applying the proposed eq 18 and the larsen s eq 36 for the larsen formula the flow section is divided into two layers at the plane of maximum velocity y 1 while for eq 18 the two layers are divided at the plane of zero shear stress h 1 for asymmetric channels the elevations of y 1 and h 1 do not coincide parthasarathy and muste 1994 the flow depth ratios ry in eq 2 and rh in eq 3 are essentially the weighting coefficients for adding local resistance factors into the composite roughness the rougher fixed boundary reflects its impact on the flow resistance by dominating greater flow depths than y 1 the most typical example of this is open channel flows a special case of asymmetric channel flows where the bed dominated region is not just an area below the plane of the maximum velocity but below the plane of zero shear stress i e free surface the variations in the difference in the locations of y 1 and h 1 with rm have been shown in fig 3 clearly such differences cannot be ignored especially for high grade asymmetric channels in the present paper the elevation of maximum velocity y 1 is obtained analytically from the two power law however in the derivations of the larsen s formula it was determined by applying the piecewise function of the logarithmic law uzuner 1975 the applicability of the two laws in describing the vertical distribution of streamwise velocity has been discussed by many researchers including chee and haggag 1984 teal et al 1994 and li 2012 they concluded that the two power law has the advantage of being able to describe a continuous distribution using a single expression while the piecewise function of the logarithmic law leads to a discontinuity at the point of maximum velocity because of its intrinsic natural properties moreover experimental and field observations have shown that the two power law produces better agreement with measured data teal et al 1994 healy and hicks 2004 attar and li 2012 additionally the two power law allows the position of the maximum velocity to be easily derived and was thus used in the study 4 2 3 scope of application the proposed formula eq 25 was based on the equality of the wetted perimeter i e wide channels hence it is necessary to define what is meant by a wide channel under ice covered conditions conventionally in hydraulic computation the hydraulic radius of wide channels can be approximately equal to flow depth beltaos 2011 the relative error arising from this simplification is evaluated by 39 e q q 0 h q 0 r q 0 r 100 in which eq is the relative error q 0 h is the flow discharge calculated by replacing the hydraulic radius with flow depth and q 0 r is flow discharge calculated by using the actual hydraulic radius for open channels with uniform roughness i e n 1 n 3 the relative error eq is related to the hydraulic radius and may be rewritten as 40 e q 1 n 1 a 0 h 2 3 s 0 1 2 1 n 2 a 0 r 0 2 3 s 0 1 2 1 δ 2 δ 2 3 1 in which the aspect ratio δ b h has been used this relationship demonstrates that eq is only related to the aspect ratio δ for open channel flows which makes it easier to distinguish wide channels from narrow channels if we find out which value of the aspect ratio gives an acceptable error yu and lim 2003 suggested that open channels with a large aspect ratio δ typically greater than 10 would be termed wide this means that the acceptable error for rectangular open channels is eq 12 9 when δ 10 is inserted into eq 40 for ice covered channels the derivation of the proposed eq 25 indicates that the relative error eq is not only related to the aspect ratio δ but also has a non linear relationship with k we therefore plotted the relative error between the calculated results using the simplified formula eq 25 q 0 h and the original formula eq 13 q 0 r against the aspect ratio δ and k in fig 7 depending on the relative roughness of the underside of the ice cover and channel bed the following three cases are considered in the present paper a n 1 n 2 rn 0 58 was selected as a representative b n 1 n 2 symmetric channel and c n 1 n 2 rn 1 75 was selected for analysis as shown in fig 7 the relative error eq varies with the factor k and the aspect ratio δ as k increases eq increases but it decreases with the increase of δ clearly the influence of δ is more significant while under ice covered conditions the influence of k may be ignored when δ is greater than 5 furthermore if the aspect ratio of the ice covered channel is greater than 5 one half of the recommended value for open channel flow the hydraulic radius may be approximated to flow depth with the acceptable error eq 13 this is reasonable because ice cover formation results in the hydraulic radius being almost half of that in open channels 5 conclusions a physically based coefficient was derived for estimating streamflow in ice covered channels in this paper the main advantage of this method is that under ice streamflow can be easily estimated by a dimensionless k factor adjustment of the well established stage discharge relationship for open water seasons the analytical results agreed well with both the laboratory measurements and field observations indicating that the proposed formula can be effectively applied for stage discharge prediction in ice covered channels the detailed conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the results of our study shown that the parameters in the k factor are associated with relative roughness of the two fixed boundaries bed and ice cover and are interrelated with each other this means that the k factor is a univariate function of one of these parameters such as the ratio of the two power law s two exponents rm used in this paper based on this three methods for estimating these parameters were proposed to facilitate the application of the proposed formula 2 when compared with the frequently used formulae based on the traditional two layer hypothesis such as the larsen and sabaneev formulae the proposed formula had the best overall performance the comparative results showed that the k factors of the three formulae do not differ significantly over the range of rm less than 1 it indicates that when bed is rougher than the ice cover larsen and sabaneev formulae can be used for simplification however the differences were significant when the underside of the ice cover is rougher than the channel bed i e rm is greater than 1 the proposed formula is therefore recommended to achieve more accurate predictions 3 the simplified formula eq 25 is appropriate for wide channels otherwise the influence of the sidewalls should be considered using its original formula acknowledgments financial support

7152,measuremental and methodological problems arising from the presence of ice cover on waterways have seriously hindered the progress in predicting timely and accurate streamflow which is a prerequisite for the effective management of ice covered waterways e g streams rivers channels and canals among various methods in the attempt to address this issue the most attractive is the physically based method which does not require abundant and often unobtainable data this paper develops a physically based k factor method in the form of a generalized manning equation for discharge estimations in ice covered channels the main advantage of this method is that it enables the prediction of streamflow in ice affected seasons by a k factor adjustment of the stage discharge relationship developed in the open water seasons the results of parameter estimation show that the k factor is only related to the boundary resistance ratio which is parameterized by two exponents of the two power law for describing the vertical streamwise velocity profile experimental measurements collected from the literature were used to test the applicability of the proposed formula and to compare its relative accuracy with the sabaneev and larsen formulae the comparative results indicate that the proposed method is more accurate in estimating streamflow of ice covered channels than

introduction in cold regions timely and reliable estimates of streamflow throughout the year especially in the ice affected season are essential for supporting the appropriate management of ice infested waterways e g streams rivers channels and canals this includes the control of ice related floods ambtman and hicks 2012 design and operation of water transfer canals altunin et al 1981 guo et al 2017 assessment of river water quality healy and hicks 2004 and aquatic habitat maintenance lind et al 2014 during ice free periods discharge estimates are usually made by continuously monitoring water levels at gauging stations and then converting these data to discharge using established stage discharge rating curves morse and hicks 2005 chokmani et al 2008 however when channels are covered with ice in winter flow under ice is retarded by an additional boundary which halves hydraulic radius increases flow resistance and thence reduces channel conveyance capacity davar and elhadi 1981 chokmani et al 2008 ghareh aghaji zare et al 2016 consequently the rating curve derived for the open water periods is not applicable during ice affected periods teal et al 1994 chen et al 2016 moreover because of spatial and temporal variations in ice roughness it may be impossible to establish a unique rating curve for the ice affected season morse and hicks 2005 the determination of ice affected streamflow entails direct measurements using the velocity area method teal et al 1994 attar and li 2012 or alternative methods such as the one point method two point method and complete profile method walker 1991 operationally direct measurements are labor intensive and place hydrometric agencies at personal risk healy and hicks 2004 the development of an analytical method capable of simply and accurately estimating discharge during the ice affected period is urgently needed since the 1920s numerous studies have been devoted to ice affected discharge assessment of ice covered channels notable work has been periodically reviewed by uzuner 1975 walker 1991 chokmani et al 2008 and ghareh aghaji zare et al 2016 the methods reviewed could be mainly classified into hydrologic hydraulic statistical and artificial intelligence the hydrologic method including the hydrographic method summarized by walker 1991 such as base flow recession k factor determination interpolated discharge and backwater shift is generally unsuitable for timely estimates of winter discharge because of its irreproducibility excessive time consumption and relatively low precision of predictions hamilton et al 2000 chokmani et al 2008 the statistical method uses for example conductance correlation and multiple regression to establish an empirical relationship for discharge prediction walker 1991 the artificial intelligence technique such as artificial neural networks is an alternative predictor for winter discharge using historical data chokmani et al 2008 the statistical and artificial intelligence methods are data driven procedures that require abundant historical meteorological and hydrometric data hence these two methods are difficult to apply to discharge predictions for ungauged streams and rivers and for designs of planed channels and canals the limitations of poor in situ databases on method selection and the requirements of reliable discharge estimates for river management result in the widespread use of the hydraulic method in estimating winter discharge under ice affected conditions of the hydraulic methods available for calculating winter discharge the manning equation has advantages because it does not require flow velocities which are difficult to obtain during ice affected periods ice covered channels are typically composite channels with varying degrees of roughness along their wetted perimeters sukhodolov et al 1999 pioneering work on ice covered channel hydraulics was thus mainly centered on the derivation of the composite roughness coefficient that incorporates the frictional effect of fixed boundaries nezhikhovskiy 1964 larsen 1973 uzuner 1975 various formulae have been suggested for estimating the composite roughness for ice covered channels with parabolic sections larsen 1969 uzuner 1975 ghareh aghaji zare et al 2016 but few have considered the rectangular or trapezoidal sections that are widely used in the design of water delivery channels chow 1959 moreover if using these existing methods we need to develop separate stage discharge relationships for ice free and ice affected periods in cold region rivers given the easiness in collecting data during ice free periods there is a potential alternative method to streamflow estimation during ice affected periods by using the well established stage discharge relationships developed during ice free periods the objective of this paper was therefore to develop a physically based formula for estimating the discharge capacity during ice free and ice affected periods the paper is organized as follows a new analytical predictor is derived for streamflow estimation in ice covered channels in section 2 section 3 discusses the methods for estimating the parameters in the proposed formula in section 4 1 field observations and laboratory measurements are documented to verify performance of the proposed formula section 4 2 compares the relative accuracy with two other frequently used formulae discusses the delimitations of the two layer flow and pinpoints the scope of applicability of the proposed formula finally the main conclusions are presented in section 5 2 theoretical analysis although the presence of ice cover alters the structure of the underlying flow quasi uniform conditions also prevail in cold region waterways during winter beltaos 2011 therefore the flow velocity may be related to the resistance coefficient using a conventional friction formula e g the manning equation chow 1959 yen 1992 1 v 0 1 n 0 r 0 2 3 s 0 1 2 where v is the sectional average velocity r is the hydraulic radius n is the manning resistance coefficient s is the energy slope and the subscript 0 refers to the hydraulic parameters of the entire cross section obviously an accurate estimate of the manning coefficient of the entire flow section is crucial for applying the manning equation to streamflow estimation under ice covered conditions as a composite channel the composite manning coefficient in ice covered channels is conventionally a weighted sum of the local resistance coefficient uzuner 1975 in computation it entails dividing the cross section into several hydraulically homogeneous subsections as follows 2 1 partitioning of ice covered channels ice covered hydraulics is still based on the two flow layer concept even though two sets of length and velocity scales generated from the two fixed boundaries bed and ice cover interact with each other in the central region beltaos 2001 2011 in previous studies of ice covered channels flow section was usually divided into two independent layers by the isoline of the maximum velocity the bed dominated layer and the ice dominated layer as shown in fig 1 teal et al 1994 sukhodolov et al 1999 attar and li 2012 flow depths in the two flow layers are denoted by y 1 and y 2 respectively then flow depth ratio of the two layers is defined as 2 r y y 2 y 1 h y 1 y 1 in which ry is the flow depth ratio of the two flow layers for the traditional two layer hypothesis and h is the total flow depth in accordance with the einstein s 1942 hydraulic radius separation theory the delineation between the two layers should be the plane of zero shear stress however there is an ongoing debate over whether the plane of maximum velocity i e zero velocity gradient corresponds to that of zero shear stress while some have stated that the maximum velocity coincides with a zero shear stress krishnappan 1984 numerous researchers approved that these two planes do not coincide apart from symmetric flow hanjalic and launder 1972 tatinclaux and göğüs 1983 tsai and ettema 1994 parthasarathy and muste 1994 chen et al 2015 hence we side with the majority and agree that the isoline of zero velocity gradients does not coincide with that of zero shear stress and so introduce the modified two layer hypothesis in which the division curve is replaced by the zero shear stress curve chen et al 2015 based on this a cross section of a rectangular or trapezoidal ice covered channel may be divided into three subsections bed ice and side wall as shown in fig 2 chen et al 2016 herein the flow depth ratio for the modified two layer hypothesis is defined as 3 r h h 2 h 1 h h 1 h 1 in which rh is the flow depth ratio of the two flow layers and h 1 and h 2 are the flow depths in the bed affected and ice affected layer respectively the elevation of zero shear stress h 1 is mainly related to the roughnesses of two fixed boundary chen et al 2015 in the modified two layer hypothesis flow resistance is parameterized by two exponents m 1 and m 2 in the so called two power law in the preferred description of the vertical streamwise velocity profile tsai 1991 tsai and ettema 1994 4 u η z h 1 m 1 1 z h 1 m 2 in which η is a constant for a given flow rate and z is distance from the bed setting u z 0 gives the normalized elevation of maximum velocity y 1 h as 5 y 1 h m 2 m 1 m 2 1 1 r m in which rm m 1 m 2 represents the boundary resistance ratio the elevation of zero shear stress h 1 is determined by 6 h 1 ξ h where ξ is a proportionality coefficient determined by a group of nine equations chen et al 2015 which leads to eq 6 is somewhat awkward to apply because the plane of zero shear stress h 1 is nearer the smooth fixed boundary than the plane of maximum mean velocity y 1 hanjalic and launder 1972 we assumed that there is a certain relationship between the elevations of the two planes fig 3 depicts the ratios of elevation of zero shear stress h 1 calculated from eq 6 and the maximum mean velocity y 1 obtained from eq 5 plotted against rm the relative height h 1 y 1 tends to be constant for the same value of rm however as rm increases h 1 y 1 decreases and is very strongly correlated with the fitted curve correlation coefficient r 2 0 9920 7 h 1 y 1 α e β r m where α 1 72 and β 0 55 are regression coefficients in the range of 1 5 m 1 2 8 5 which covers all the estimated values from more than 2300 vertical velocity profiles collected at 13 streamflow gauging stations teal et al 1994 the observed results of parthasarathy and muste 1994 and tsai and ettema 1994 are also plotted in fig 3 to check the performance of the regression curve combining eqs 5 and 7 the flow depth ratio rh in eq 3 may be determined by 8 r h 1 r m α e β r m 1 2 2 derivation of composite roughness coefficient 2 2 1 general formula for composite roughness coefficient channel sections with different roughnesses along the wetter perimeter are divided into n hydraulically homogeneous subsections the divided subsections are sequentially labelled by arabic number i i 1 2 n which serves as the subscript to denote the hydraulic parameters of the i th arbitrary subsection following the principle of flow continuity total flow discharge equals to the sum of the discharges of the subsections i e 9 a 0 v 0 i 1 n a i v i in which a is the cross sectional area by applying the manning equation in each subsection and the entire flow section eq 9 can be rewritten as lotter 1933 10 1 n 0 i 1 n 1 n i p i p 0 r i 5 3 r 0 5 3 in which p is the wetted perimeter normally the wetted perimeter of each subsection does not include the internal water lines dividing the subsections into computing hydraulic radii yen 2002 if these internal lines have zero shear stress then considering the momentum balance in each subsection yields 11 τ i p i ρ ga i s 0 or 12 r i τ i ρ gs 0 in which ρ is the mass density of water g is the gravitational acceleration and τ is the boundary shear stress substituting eq 12 into eq 10 yields 13 n 0 p 0 ρ gr 0 s 0 5 3 i 1 n 1 n i p i τ i 5 3 in which p 0 s 0 and pi are easily obtained by direct measurement the unknown parameter τi can be determined analytically by numerous available methods khodashenas et al 2008 2 2 2 application to rectangular ice covered channels in this paper a steady quasi uniform flow in an ice covered channel of rectangular or trapezoidal cross section is considered for rectangular ice covered channels n 3 as sketched in fig 2a eq 13 can be rewritten as 14 1 n 0 1 n 1 r 1 h r 1 r 0 2 3 1 n 2 r 2 h r 2 r 0 2 3 2 1 n 3 r 3 b r 3 r 0 2 3 in which b is the channel width and the subscripts 1 2 and 3 are used to denote parameters for bed ice and side wall subsections respectively when applying eq 14 for composite roughness calculation it is crucial to determine the division curves of zero shear stress for calculating the hydraulic radius of each subsection the functional relationship for these division curves in regular channels can be determined by conformal mapping procedures these procedures have been successfully applied in rectangular open channels guo and julien 2005 trapezoidal open channels kabiri samani et al 2013 and rectangular ice covered channels chen et al 2015 based on the determination of the division curves the mean boundary shear stress in a rectangular ice covered channel can be analytically determined from the momentum balance in each subsection chen et al 2016 as follows 15 τ 1 ρ ghs 0 r 1 h 4 π h 1 h tan 1 exp π h 1 b π 4 h 1 2 bh exp h 1 b 16 τ 2 ρ ghs 0 r 2 h 4 π h 2 h tan 1 exp π h 2 b π 4 h 2 2 bh exp h 2 b 17 τ 3 ρ ghs 0 r 3 h b 2 h 1 r 1 h r 2 h in which eq 12 has been used because natural rivers in cold regions during the winter are usually wide channels substituting b for wide channels into eqs 15 17 one has r 1 h 1 r 2 h 2 and r 3 0 with these approximations eq 14 becomes 18 n 0 1 2 2 3 1 r h 5 3 1 r n r h 5 3 n 1 in which rn n 1 n 2 is the ratio of the manning coefficients 2 2 3 application to trapezoidal ice covered channels similarly for trapezoidal ice covered channels as sketched in fig 2b n 3 by employing the guo and julien s method the mean boundary shear stress in eq 13 is determined by 19 τ 1 ρ ghs 0 r 1 h h 1 h exp ψ 1 h 1 b 1 λ 1 h 1 2 b 1 h exp λ 2 ψ 1 h 1 b 1 20 τ 2 ρ ghs 0 r 2 h h 2 h exp ψ 2 h 2 b 2 λ 1 h 2 2 b 2 h exp λ 2 ψ 2 h 2 b 2 21 τ 3 ρ ghs 0 b 1 2 h 1 s 2 sh b 1 1 r 1 h r 2 h in which b 1 is the bed width b 2 is width of the underside of ice cover s cot θ is channel sidewall lateral slope with θ being the angle of sidewall with horizontal direction ψ 1 and ψ 2 are constants related to θ λ 1 and λ 2 are correction factors kabiri samani et al 2013 applying b 1 for wide channels in eqs 19 21 results in 22 r 1 h 1 r 2 h 2 r 3 sh 2 1 s 2 because p 1 p 0 1 2 p 2 p 0 1 2 and p 3 p 0 0 when b 1 for wide channels substituting eq 22 into eq 13 one can obtain the same relationship as eq 18 2 3 new predictor for streamflow estimation substituting eq 18 into eq 1 yields 23 v 0 2 2 3 1 r n r h 5 3 1 r h 5 3 1 n 1 r 0 2 3 s 0 1 2 24 r 0 bh 2 b 2 h 1 2 δ 1 δ h in which δ b h is the aspect ratio substituting δ for wide channels into eq 24 one has r 0 h 2 that is hydraulic radius of the entire cross section is approximately equal to one half of the total flow depth with the second approximation eq 23 may be amended as 25 v 0 k 1 n 1 h 2 3 s 0 1 2 26 k 1 r n r h 5 3 1 r h 5 3 in which k is the physically based coefficient k factor this relationship indicates that the discharge capacity in ice affected seasons is proportional to that in open water seasons specially when rh 0 open channel flows eq 26 gives k 1 and then eq 25 becomes the conventional manning equation which confirms the assumption that open water flows are regarded as a special case of asymmetric flows with the top boundary roughness n 2 0 parthasarathy and muste 1994 chen et al 2015 furthermore eq 25 may be considered as a general expression of the manning equation that is appropriate for estimating discharge under open water and ice affected conditions the k factor adjustment coefficient allows us to estimate discharge in ice affected seasons with the well established rating curves for open water seasons 3 estimation of parameters the manning coefficients n 1 and n 2 can be related to the exponents m 1 and m2 in the two power law chen et al 2016 by 27 n 1 κ r 1 1 6 m 1 g n 2 κ r 2 1 6 m 2 g where κ is the von karman constant for wide channels rn can be obtained from 28 r n n 1 n 2 1 r m r h 1 6 as shown in eqs 8 and 28 rn rm and rh are interrelated with each other when one of these three ratios is known the other two ratios can be determined from the two relationships note that in a measured section there does not exist prior knowledge of the elevation of zero shear stress that can be used to determine rh in advance we therefore proposed three methods in two categories to estimate the parameters in eq 26 3 1 rm oriented parameter estimation methods 1 resistance coefficient method method i when the hydraulic roughness heights k 1 and k 2 are known the darcy weisbach resistance coefficients f 1 and f 2 can be solved iteratively for an assumed v 0 using the coupled equations of parthasarathy and muste 1994 as follows 29 8 f 1 1 2 1 κ log f 1 8 1 2 r e 1 0 3 k 1 h f 1 8 1 2 r e 5 5 1 κ log 1 μ 1 μ 3 2 1 μ 30 8 f 2 1 2 1 κ log f 2 8 1 2 r e 1 0 3 k 2 h f 2 8 1 2 r e 5 5 1 κ log 1 μ μ 1 μ 3 2 μ 1 2 1 μ in which f 1 and f 2 are the darcy weisbach resistance coefficients μ f 1 f 2 is the resistance ratio and re v0h υ is the reynolds number where υ is the dynamic viscosity as the exponents m 1 and m 2 can be related to the darcy weisbach resistance coefficients tsai and ettema 1994 using 31 m 1 κ 8 f 1 1 2 m 2 κ 8 f 2 1 2 rm can be determined by 32 r m f 2 f 1 1 2 2 velocity distribution analysis method ii substituting eq 5 into eq 2 gives 33 r m r y hence when the vertical streamwise velocity profile is available y 1 where the streamwise velocity is at a maximum can be identified then one can obtain ry from eq 2 and convert it into rm with eq 33 once rm was determined by either of the two methods rh can be calculated from eq 8 and rn can be obtained from eq 28 3 2 rn oriented parameter estimation method the bed roughness n 1 assessed from open water data is normally used as an approximation beltaos 2011 li 2012 the ice cover roughness n 2 can be estimated by several methods such as empirical modeling shen and yapa 1986 and velocity distribution analysis calkins et al 1982 li 2012 when the values of the manning coefficients n 1 and n 2 are known rh may be determined iteratively from eqs 8 and 28 method iii 4 results and discussions 4 1 verification of the proposed formula 4 1 1 computational procedure in practical applications the flow section of interest in lined channels or in natural rivers with relatively flat beds may be generalized into a rectangular or trapezoidal section with ice thickness and slush thickness laterally averaged the geometrical parameters such as h and b for a rectangular section or b 1 b 2 and h for a trapezoidal section and the hydraulic parameter s 0 are easily obtained by direct measurement the remaining parameters can be estimated with one of the three proposed methods method i ii and iii according to data availability however the computational procedure varies depending on which parameter estimation method is used taking method i as an example the computational procedure for estimating streamflow in an ice covered channel for a given total flow depth h channel slope s 0 and hydraulic roughness heights k 1 and k 2 runs as follows 1 determine f 1 and f 1 for an assumed v 0 0 from eqs 29 and 30 using the newton raphson algorithm 2 use eq 32 to compute r m k calculate r h k from eq 8 and then determine r n k from eq 28 where the superscript k denotes the number of iterations 3 determine the manning coefficient n 1 for the bed subsection first calculate flow depth h 1 k using eq 3 then if δ larger than the threshold value δ for classifying ice covered channels into narrow and wide channels r 1 k h 1 k otherwise use eq 15 to compute r 1 k finally determine n 1 k from eqs 27 and 31 4 use eq 26 to determine k k and then obtain v 0 k from eq 25 if δ δ otherwise use eq 1 and eq 13 to determine v 0 k 5 if v 0 k v 0 k 1 ε v stop the iteration where ε v is the acceptable iteration accuracy for the bulk velocity v 0 otherwise update the bulk velocity in eqs 29 and 30 by v 0 k and repeat steps 2 to 4 the iteration continues until the iteration accuracy is acceptable the flow chart of the proposed formula with model parameters being estimated by method i together with method ii and method iii for stage discharge prediction in ice covered channels is shown in fig 4 4 1 2 data collection the applicability of the proposed formula was validated by available experimental data for under ice channels including laboratory measurements from small scale laboratory flumes by engmann 1977 parthasarathy and muste 1994 smith and ettema 1997 and wei and huang 2002 and field observations in large scale natural rivers by tatinclaux and göğüs 1983 and attar and li 2012 a summary of the geometrical parameters and hydraulic conditions is listed in table 1 4 1 3 model verifications the proposed formulae eq 13 and eq 25 were selected to compute discharge because of the large differences in the flow rates between natural rivers and laboratory flumes we converted the measured flow discharge to bulk velocity to facilitate mapping the average relative error e was employed to evaluate the performances of the two formulae which is defined by 34 e 1 m j 1 m v 0 e j v 0 m j v 0 m j in which m is the number of the test runs v 0m j is the measured velocity and v 0e j is estimated velocity a comparison of the bulk velocity measured results subscript m with results estimated from the selected formulae subscript e shown in fig 5 gives an e of 10 94 m 40 this indicates that the proposed formula accurately predicts the discharge conveyance of ice covered channels in fig 5 it can be seen that for channels with a large aspect ratio δ e g natural rivers 24 δ 121 the calculation accuracy of the simplified formula given by eq 25 is approximately equal to that of the original formula eq 13 while the formula results in larger relative errors for channels with a relatively smaller aspect ratio δ e g 2 δ 3 for the experimental runs of wei and huang 2002 marked by the red circle in fig 5b this discrepancy indicates that the scope of the application of eq 25 needs to be clearly defined 4 2 discussions 4 2 1 comparisons with the conventional formulae two conventional methods the sabaneev formula and larsen formula were used to compare the relative accuracy of the proposed method the former is expressed as uzuner 1975 35 n 0 s n 1 2 n 2 2 2 1 2 in which n 0s is the sabaneev s composite manning coefficient while replacing rh with ry in eq 18 it becomes the well known larsen formula larsen 1973 as 36 n 0 l 1 2 2 3 1 r y 5 3 1 r n r y 5 3 n 1 in which n 0l is the larsen s composite manning coefficient the two formulae are based on the traditional two layer hypothesis substituting eq 33 into eqs 35 and 36 gives 37 k s 1 1 r m 7 4 2 3 38 k l 1 r m 1 2 1 r m 5 3 in which k s k l are the k factors of the sabaneev and larsen formulae respectively these relationships demonstrate that the two k factors similar to the k factor in eq 26 are only related to the ratio rm therefore we plotted the three k factors against rm with a marked inflexion point at rm 1 fig 5 when rm less than1 these k factors are approximately equal which indicates that the sabaneev and larsen formulae may be adopted to simplify the computational procedure when the channel bed is rougher than the ice cover however when rm greater than1 the difference among the three k factors increases as rm increases flow discharge would be overestimated with the larsen formula and sabaneev formula if the flow resistance of under ice cover was larger than that of the channel bottom comparisons of the experimental observations with the theoretical results predicted by eqs 26 37 and 38 as shown in fig 6 demonstrated that eq 26 gives better predictions than the conventional formulae based on traditional two layer hypothesis this superiority is especially obvious for high grade asymmetric channels e g the three runs of tatinclaux and göğüs 1983 where rm is greater than 2 0 as natural rivers during ice covered periods are usually highly asymmetric the proposed eq 26 is recommended for use under ice covered conditions 4 2 2 delimitations of the two layer flow prior knowledge of the delimitation of flow section is required when applying the proposed eq 18 and the larsen s eq 36 for the larsen formula the flow section is divided into two layers at the plane of maximum velocity y 1 while for eq 18 the two layers are divided at the plane of zero shear stress h 1 for asymmetric channels the elevations of y 1 and h 1 do not coincide parthasarathy and muste 1994 the flow depth ratios ry in eq 2 and rh in eq 3 are essentially the weighting coefficients for adding local resistance factors into the composite roughness the rougher fixed boundary reflects its impact on the flow resistance by dominating greater flow depths than y 1 the most typical example of this is open channel flows a special case of asymmetric channel flows where the bed dominated region is not just an area below the plane of the maximum velocity but below the plane of zero shear stress i e free surface the variations in the difference in the locations of y 1 and h 1 with rm have been shown in fig 3 clearly such differences cannot be ignored especially for high grade asymmetric channels in the present paper the elevation of maximum velocity y 1 is obtained analytically from the two power law however in the derivations of the larsen s formula it was determined by applying the piecewise function of the logarithmic law uzuner 1975 the applicability of the two laws in describing the vertical distribution of streamwise velocity has been discussed by many researchers including chee and haggag 1984 teal et al 1994 and li 2012 they concluded that the two power law has the advantage of being able to describe a continuous distribution using a single expression while the piecewise function of the logarithmic law leads to a discontinuity at the point of maximum velocity because of its intrinsic natural properties moreover experimental and field observations have shown that the two power law produces better agreement with measured data teal et al 1994 healy and hicks 2004 attar and li 2012 additionally the two power law allows the position of the maximum velocity to be easily derived and was thus used in the study 4 2 3 scope of application the proposed formula eq 25 was based on the equality of the wetted perimeter i e wide channels hence it is necessary to define what is meant by a wide channel under ice covered conditions conventionally in hydraulic computation the hydraulic radius of wide channels can be approximately equal to flow depth beltaos 2011 the relative error arising from this simplification is evaluated by 39 e q q 0 h q 0 r q 0 r 100 in which eq is the relative error q 0 h is the flow discharge calculated by replacing the hydraulic radius with flow depth and q 0 r is flow discharge calculated by using the actual hydraulic radius for open channels with uniform roughness i e n 1 n 3 the relative error eq is related to the hydraulic radius and may be rewritten as 40 e q 1 n 1 a 0 h 2 3 s 0 1 2 1 n 2 a 0 r 0 2 3 s 0 1 2 1 δ 2 δ 2 3 1 in which the aspect ratio δ b h has been used this relationship demonstrates that eq is only related to the aspect ratio δ for open channel flows which makes it easier to distinguish wide channels from narrow channels if we find out which value of the aspect ratio gives an acceptable error yu and lim 2003 suggested that open channels with a large aspect ratio δ typically greater than 10 would be termed wide this means that the acceptable error for rectangular open channels is eq 12 9 when δ 10 is inserted into eq 40 for ice covered channels the derivation of the proposed eq 25 indicates that the relative error eq is not only related to the aspect ratio δ but also has a non linear relationship with k we therefore plotted the relative error between the calculated results using the simplified formula eq 25 q 0 h and the original formula eq 13 q 0 r against the aspect ratio δ and k in fig 7 depending on the relative roughness of the underside of the ice cover and channel bed the following three cases are considered in the present paper a n 1 n 2 rn 0 58 was selected as a representative b n 1 n 2 symmetric channel and c n 1 n 2 rn 1 75 was selected for analysis as shown in fig 7 the relative error eq varies with the factor k and the aspect ratio δ as k increases eq increases but it decreases with the increase of δ clearly the influence of δ is more significant while under ice covered conditions the influence of k may be ignored when δ is greater than 5 furthermore if the aspect ratio of the ice covered channel is greater than 5 one half of the recommended value for open channel flow the hydraulic radius may be approximated to flow depth with the acceptable error eq 13 this is reasonable because ice cover formation results in the hydraulic radius being almost half of that in open channels 5 conclusions a physically based coefficient was derived for estimating streamflow in ice covered channels in this paper the main advantage of this method is that under ice streamflow can be easily estimated by a dimensionless k factor adjustment of the well established stage discharge relationship for open water seasons the analytical results agreed well with both the laboratory measurements and field observations indicating that the proposed formula can be effectively applied for stage discharge prediction in ice covered channels the detailed conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the results of our study shown that the parameters in the k factor are associated with relative roughness of the two fixed boundaries bed and ice cover and are interrelated with each other this means that the k factor is a univariate function of one of these parameters such as the ratio of the two power law s two exponents rm used in this paper based on this three methods for estimating these parameters were proposed to facilitate the application of the proposed formula 2 when compared with the frequently used formulae based on the traditional two layer hypothesis such as the larsen and sabaneev formulae the proposed formula had the best overall performance the comparative results showed that the k factors of the three formulae do not differ significantly over the range of rm less than 1 it indicates that when bed is rougher than the ice cover larsen and sabaneev formulae can be used for simplification however the differences were significant when the underside of the ice cover is rougher than the channel bed i e rm is greater than 1 the proposed formula is therefore recommended to achieve more accurate predictions 3 the simplified formula eq 25 is appropriate for wide channels otherwise the influence of the sidewalls should be considered using its original formula acknowledgments financial support

7153,an integrated hydrological model that couples a low dimensional 2 d subsurface model to 1 d river flow and 2 d overland flow is presented and applied to a real world system the 2 d subsurface equation stems from a careful integration a 3 d richards equation along a local direction normal to the bottom of the aquifer a normally integrated model nim is first compared with the integrated model cathy catchment hydrology in regard to a synthetic test case with complex geometry heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field of the subsurface compartment and various interactions between the surface and the subsurface this exercise reveals the gain in computation time associated with the use of a low dimensional model by a factor of 6 nim is then applied to simulate the hydrodynamics of an actual restored hydrosystem namely rohrschollen island of the upper rhine river with the aim of assessing the ability to address highly transient hydrological conditions and the efficiency of the restoration strategy the calibration and validation steps associated with this exercise show that the coupled model describes the hydraulic head evolution and water mass balance induced by artificial injections of surface water in a channel dug for the purpose of reconnecting the rhine to an old and clogged channel the low dimensional coupled model of this study is simpler than the state of the art integrated models employing the solution of the 3 d richards equation it is however suited to investigate fine scale problems in relation to water resource management and hydraulic developments with reasonable computational costs and a physically based approach to model flow processes keywords low dimensional model integrated hydrological modeling overland flow restoration rohrschollen island upper rhine river 1 introduction physically based hydrological models are now accepted as effective tools to investigate various issues related to the water cycle e g fatichi et al 2016 and citations herein in the broad family of hydrological models the so called integrated models are specific as they account for the interactions between surface and subsurface flow and transport processes in a physically relevant way it is now acknowledged that including these interactions in hydrological models is mandatory to properly describe the water cycle and its tightly coupled components paniconi and putti 2015 integrated models have been applied at various scales to bring new insights to the processes that control the hydrological geomorphological or ecohydrological responses of natural systems e g sulis et al 2011 ran et al 2012 kim et al 2013 partington et al 2013 niu et al 2014a niu et al 2014b the current trend in the development of integrated models is to extend their scope beyond the dynamics of water fluxes for example in handling the interactions with the atmosphere through the coupling with land surface models e g maxwell et al 2007 shi et al 2013 sulis et al 2017 or dealing with geochemical processes e g bao et al 2017 most of the integrated hydrological models of the literature rely on the solution of the three dimensional richards equation to describe the subsurface flow processes maxwell et al 2014 the highly non linear nature of this equation raises serious issues regarding its applicability for large scale systems employing relatively coarse resolutions compared with the scale at which elementary processes occur the question of the appropriate level of complexity that needs to be incorporated in a model is still open e g mirus et al 2011a hopp et al 2016 weill et al 2017 in practice solving a three dimensional richards equation requires refined meshing especially along the vertical direction to properly catch the physics of infiltration and avoid spurious oscillations hopp et al 2016 integrated hydrological models that rely on the richards equation are often computationally demanding which may limit their use for various applications highly parallel computing methods are being implemented to overcome this difficulty e g kollet et al 2010 vivoni et al 2011 maxwell et al 2015 but the required calculation power to run parallel codes can be difficult to access for many practitioners alternative approaches have been developed to lessen the computational cost while preserving the physically based nature of the developed model one possible option is to reduce the dimensionality of the problem the first low dimensional hydrological models were built using the dupuit forchheimer assumption and the boussinesq equation e g boussinesq 1877 brutsaert 1994 to describe saturated flow these models were unable to account for the three dimensionality of natural systems and were thus hardly applicable to real world situations troch et al 2003 further developments were undertaken to overcome the difficulty thus resulting in various low dimensional approaches that tried to combine applicability simplicity and physical relevance e g sloan 2000 curtu et al 2014 in this framework of simplified hydrogeological models the most advanced approach used to date was initially proposed by troch et al 2003 which solved the hillslope storage boussinesq hsb equation the major advantage of this hsb is that it allows for the description of the three dimensional shape of a hillslope or a catchment while relying upon a single one dimensional simple equation the hsb model was further developed by hilberts et al 2007 who coupled the hsb equation with a one dimensional richards equation for a better depiction of the vertical flow processes in the vadose zone other approaches are available today to account for the vadose zone in the low dimensional subsurface flow model pan et al 2015 whose normally integrated model nim is further enhanced in this study proposed describing both saturated and unsaturated zone flow processes using a richards equation integrated along a direction perpendicular to the bedrock a similar approach that integrates the hsb equation along a direction perpendicular to the bedrock was also proposed by kong et al 2016 few low dimensional subsurface models have been coupled to surface flow models and applied to real world systems although this could be an interesting alternative to classical integrated models as mentioned by troch et al 2013 matonse and kroll 2009 applied an hsb based model to improve low flow predictions in a small headwater catchment broda et al 2012 coupled the hsb model to a deep aquifer model to report on the interactions between deep and subsurface aquifers hazenberg et al 2015 2016 also associated the hsb equation for saturated flow with a 1 d vertical richards equation for unsaturated flow and with a diffusive wave surface flow model their aim was to merge the resulting approach into a land surface model applications to synthetic test cases and to an actual hillslope experiment show that this kind of approach can properly simulate complex hydrological responses the model proposed hereafter and amending previous developments by some of the authors of the present contribution pan et al 2015 weill et al 2017 also couples a low dimensional subsurface model with two types of surface flow regarding the lack of applications of such models to real world systems it is still to be shown that integrated low dimensional models can accurately reproduce catchment scale flow processes and surface subsurface interactions the aim of this contribution is to present the further developments that have amended and have enhanced the model nim proposed by pan et al 2015 and to employ the resulting tool in an application to an actual restored hydrosystem with highly transient and reactive behavior the main improvement lies in the addition of a 2 d surface flow model solving a diffusive wave equation to account for 2 d flow processes that may occur at the topographic surface i e exfiltration along saturated areas or hortonian runoff the 2 d overland flow model is coupled with the existing low dimensional subsurface model and the 1 d river flow model the numerical implementation was also completely upgraded regarding meshing discretization techniques coupling strategies and solvers to improve the overall efficiency of the model the resulting new coupled model nim is then run and is compared with the integrated model cathy camporese et al 2010 on a synthetic test case the latter comprises a complex geometry of the watershed a heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field in the subsurface and infiltration exfiltration processes to check on the proper implementation of the overland flow model and of the coupling then the coupled model is applied to rohrschollen island located on the upper rhine river this island is monitored to study the effects of hydraulic and geomorphological restoration on its hydrodynamics morphodynamics and ecological functioning the main goal of this application is to show that an integrated model based on a low dimensional approach of the subsurface can be relevant to capture complex hydrological responses in the case of rohrschollen island the gain in the number of unknowns computation nodes associated with the low dimensional subsurface model allows for refined horizontal resolution which in turn properly describes the topography and its effect on the generation of streamflow processes 2 the hydrological model nim normally integrated model 2 1 the physical and mathematical formulation of flow compartments the description focuses on the governing equations for the three components of the model which include 1 d river flow 2 d overland flow and 2 d subsurface flow the coupling strategy and numerical approaches used to solve the resulting system of equations are also discussed additionally note that more details and various numerical tests of the nim model can be found in pan et al 2015 and weill et al 2017 surface flow models in our modeling approach surface flow is supported by two different mesh geometries concentrated surface flow is handled by a 1 d river model that describes runoff in a ramified stream network composed of connected 1 d bonds while overland flow on hillslopes is handled by a 2 d model using a 2 d triangular mesh that mimics the topography of the surface the two models are coupled to account for the possible interactions between flows in the stream network and on the hillslopes the 2 d overland flow model is derived from the full 2 d saint venant equations e g panday and huyakorn 2004 1 h s t u x h s x u y h s y q 2 u x h s t u x 2 h s x u x u y h s y g h s s f x h s z s x 0 3 u y h s t u x u y h s x u y 2 h s y g h s s f y h s z s y 0 where h s l is the water depth at the surface z s l is the soil surface elevation u s and u y lt 1 are the velocity components along the x and y directions respectively q lt 1 is a source term including the exchanges with the 1 d river flow compartment and with the subsurface g lt 2 is the scalar component of the gravity acceleration and s f x and s f y are the frictional slopes of the topography along the x and y directions respectively following the approach that di giammarco et al 1996 proposed and relying upon the diffusive wave approximation and manning s equation the governing equation for 2 d overland flow can be rewritten as 4 h s z s t x t s x x h s z s y t s y y h s z s q where t s x h s 5 3 n man x 2 β h s z s t s y h s 5 3 n man y 2 β h s z s β h s z s h s z s x 2 1 n man x 4 h s z s y 2 1 n man y 4 1 4 where n man x and n man y l 1 3t are the manning coefficients in the x and y directions respectively regarding 1 d river flow the modeling approach relies on a one dimensional version of eqs 1 2 and 3 and the diffusive wave approximation with these assumptions the momentum equation of the saint venant equations reduces to r h r z r s f r where r is the gradient operator in the direction of the stream flow h r l is the water depth in the river z r l is the bottom elevation of the riverbed and s f r is the frictional slope of the riverbed in the direction of flow for details see pan et al 2015 introducing the above relation into manning s formula the mean velocity in the river u r lt 1 can be written as 5 u r r h 2 3 n man r r h r z r 1 2 r h r z r where n man r l 1 3t is the manning coefficient for the river and r h l is the hydraulic radius calculated from the water depth h and the geometric properties of the river introducing eq 5 into a one dimensional version of the mass balance eq 1 finally leads to the governing eq 6 which is used to describe flow in a 1 d river network 6 l h r h r t x t r h r x h r z l h r q t r h l l h r h r r h 2 3 2 n man x h r z 1 2 where l l is the width of the water surface in the river and l l is the width at the bottom of the riverbed low dimensional 2 d subsurface flow model the low dimensional subsurface flow model results from the integration of the 3 d richards equation along the direction z normal to the slope of the bedrock of the aquifer the integration bounds are the bedrock elevation z b and the soil surface elevation z s the resulting equation can be written as 7 z b z s θ t s s s w θ h t d z z b z s k θ h d z z b z s q w d z where θ is the water content s w is the water saturation ss l 1 is the specific storage capacity of the medium k lt 1 is the tensor of hydraulic conductivity h l is the hydraulic head or the capillary head and q w t 1 is a source term that accounts for the interactions with both the 1 d river network and the 2 d overland flow models notably the standard eulerian coordinate system x y z which usually defines the horizontal and vertical directions is used for convenience here in 7 and hereafter in 8 as the coordinate system with directions normal to bedrock z and in the bedrock plane x y this reference is local as the slope of the bedrock may vary and is defined for each 2 d computational element composing the domain the nonlinear relationships between saturation water content and hydraulic conductivity are described using the van genuchten models van genuchten 1980 eq 7 can be transformed assuming that flow is mainly parallel to the bedrock and introducing the water table depth z w as an integration bound in addition it can be assumed that variation in time of the water content θ is null in the saturated zone and that the term associated with the specific storage capacity s s in the vadose zone is usually negligible compared with the variation of the water content over time finally eq 7 becomes 8 θ t s h h t x y t θ x y h q w where θ h z w z s θ z d z s h s sat h and t h θ k sat h z w z s k θ z d z k sat and s sat are averages along the integration direction z of the saturated hydraulic conductivity tensor and the specific storage capacity in the saturated zone respectively in practice the equivalent parameters θ h s h and t h θ are computed numerically assuming that the pressure distribution along the direction normal to the bedrock is hydrostatic notably eq 8 has a form similar to the saturated flow equation obtained using the classical dupuit assumption with the exception that the equivalent parameters θ h s h and t h θ account for both the saturated zone and the vadose zone properties as mentioned previously more details and various numerical applications can be found in pan et al 2015 and weill et al 2017 2 2 coupling strategies the coupling between the three components of the model is performed using a first order approach the low dimensional subsurface model and the 2 d overland flow model share the same unstructured triangular mesh the 1 d mesh is superimposed onto the 2 d mesh so that each 1 d element is also an edge of a 2 d triangle see fig 1 we present below the formulations employed to simulate the exchanges of water fluxes between the three compartments of the hydrological model the exchange flux per unit of length between the 1 d river and the 2 d overland flow models denoted as q ex 1 d 2 d l2t 1 is described by the flow equation of a wide rectangular weir as implemented by panday and huyakorn 2004 with exchanges occurring in both directions from the river to overland and from overland to the river these exchanges are depicted by the following 9 q e x 1 d 2 d freeflowing c d 4 3 2 g h u z bank 3 2 10 q e x 1 d 2 d submerged c d 4 3 2 g h u h d h u z bank where eq 9 goes with free flowing conditions and eq 10 is employed for a submerged weir c d is a weir discharge coefficient h u l is the water head of the upstream compartment h d l is the water head of the downstream compartment z b ank l is the elevation of the river bank and g is the scalar component of the gravity acceleration lt 2 the bidirectional exchange flux per unit length between the 1 d river flow and the low dimensional groundwater compartment denoted as q ex 1 d s s l2t 1 is modeled according to the formulation proposed by gunduz and aral 2005 as 11 q ex 1 d s s w r k sed h r z r h m r if h z r m r 12 q ex 1 d s s w r k sed h r z r z r m r m r if h z r m r where w r l is the wetted perimeter of the river k sed lt 1 is the hydraulic conductivity of sediments at the bottom of the riverbed and m r l is the thickness of sediments at the bottom of the riverbed a thresholding function not displayed in 11 and 12 for the sake of simplicity ensures that when h r tends to zero while h r z r h the flux q ex 1 d s s also tends to be zero the bidirectional exchange flux per unit area between the 2 d overland flow and the subsurface denoted as q ex 2 d s s lt 1 is modeled using a first order exchange coefficient associated with a formalism similar to that implemented in both the hgs hydrogeosphere model therrien et al 2005 and the integrated hydrological model inhm vanderkwaak and loague 2001 13 q ex 2 d s s k int z s h s h l e f s 14 f s min h s h ob 2 1 h s h ob 1 where k int lt 1 is the vertical hydraulic conductivity at the interface between the surface and subsurface compartments l e is a user defined coupling length i e an empirical thickness of the interface between surface and subsurface compartments f s is a scaling function accounting for the saturated unsaturated character of the interface between the surface and subsurface and h ob is the total obstruction height accounting for small irregularities of the topography 2 3 numerical solution in a former version of the subsurface model the discretization of 8 employed a mixed hybrid finite element mhfe scheme pan et al 2015 weill et al 2017 in the revised form the mhfe scheme has been replaced by a crouzeix raviart finite element crfe scheme crouzeix and raviart 1973 which has been shown to be equivalent to the mhfe marini 1985 vohralík and wohlmuth 2013 nevertheless the formalism of the crfe method is much simpler to implement for the sake of consistency and simplicity a crfe scheme also discretizes eq 4 of the 2 d overland flow for its part 1 d river flow is handled via a classical finite volume scheme as it is much simpler to implement and ensures mass conservation and redistribution of fluxes at the nodes of the 1 d bond network the equations associated with the three compartments of the model are solved using a fully implicit approach in the sense that the discrete equations of the three compartments and the coupling relationships are put together into a single discrete system solving the three state variables h s surface h r river and h subsurface simultaneously nonlinearity is now handled by the newton raphson linearization scheme instead of the picard scheme of the previous version a general optimization of the code and the quadratic convergence of the newton raphson linearization lehmann and ackerer 1998 paniconi and putti 1994 compared with the linear convergence of the picard scheme greatly improved the performance of the enhanced model in terms of calculation times e g the calcu1ation time was decreased by a factor of 25 for a 1 d river flow over approximately 500 linear bonds of a ramified network with classical values of hydrodynamic parameters some discrepancies may appear when solving the surface flow equations as the variables h s and h r which are water thicknesses above a substratum should never be negative which is not ensured by simply solving the diffusion eqs 4 and 6 wet dry transitions at the interfaces of 1 d river and 2 d surface flows must be treated carefully to prevent the model from computing unphysical negative water depths and to avoid subsequent instability issues this phenomenon is common to every overland flow model and several techniques have been developed to eliminate it bates and hervouet 1999 defina 2000 costabile et al 2012 medeiros and hagen 2013 unfortunately these techniques are usually developed for a specific numerical scheme and cannot be easily transposed onto another scheme defina 2000 for the 1 d river flow model a backward scheme circumvents the occurrence of negative h r see pan et al 2015 for details for the 2 d overland flow model water depth values h s are checked node by node in the triangular mesh if a negative value is computed at one node the positive water depths of the neighboring nodes are decreased and the removed quantity is lumped on the negative node to render its value equal to zero the procedure is carried out while preserving the water mass balance at the scale of the cell as detailed in khan 2010 mass removed at positive nodes is compensated by mass added to the negative node if the three nodes of a current cell are assigned negative values or if the average value over the three nodes is negative readjustment of water levels is performed by setting the three nodes of the current cell to zero and diminishing the water level removing mass of positive nodes in other cells within a prescribed narrow zone water mass balance is preserved at the scale of this zone 3 application to a synthetic test case because 2 d overland flow was added to a previous version of the hydrological model and because the new three compartment version 1 d river 2 d overland 2 d subsurface was completely revisited regarding its numerical content see above it makes sense to check the calculations these and the overall efficiency of our approach are compared with outputs from the integrated model cathy catchment hydrology camporese et al 2010 regarding a complex synthetic test case although several synthetic test cases of watershed dynamics are available in the literature mirus et al 2011b liggett et al 2012 maxwell et al 2014 the test in this study was purposely designed to tackle a complex problem with a convergent geometry prone to large variations of fluid velocities and a heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field a comparison of computational times between nim and cathy is also presented in the following it is worth noting that a fair comparison of the kind is not straightforward to the point that even studies comparing integrated hydrological models do not mention calculation times e g maxwell et al 2014 kollet et al 2017 many factors strongly impact calculation times such as the coupling algorithm the discretization scheme the time integration method the solver of discrete equations the time step strategy etc and are usually not similar between the different integrated models nim and cathy are based on different conceptualizations of the subsurface with nim using the low dimensional approach described previously as cathy solves a 3 d richards equation nevertheless both models rely upon a diffusive wave approximation to depict the surface flow processes noting that numerical implementations differ the other important differences between nim and cathy are found in the following 1 the coupling strategy since nim uses a fully implicit coupling see above as the coupling is sequential and separates the calculation of each compartment in cathy 2 the linearization scheme since nim uses a newton raphson algorithm while cathy uses a picard algorithm and 3 the numerical scheme since nim uses crouzet raviard finite elements while cathy uses standard galerkin finite elements the coupling scheme strongly favors cathy because multiple time steps can be employed for solving flow in the surface compartments when a single time step is enough for solving accurately the subsurface in association with a fully implicit coupling nim uses the same time steps for both surface and subsurface compartments which multiplies the number of calculations in the subsurface compared with cathy therefore the cpu times needed for simulation periods involving the subsurface only are distinguished from times for periods involving both the surface and subsurface note that the time step strategies initial time step maximum time step and the factors used to increase decrease the time step have been optimized in each model for the purpose of a fair comparison of calculation times the convergent geometry of the test case considered is shown in fig 2 right side the surface domain consists of two triangular hillslopes connected to a 140 m long and 6 m wide channel the slopes in the x and y directions respectively are 0 05 and 0 02 the manning roughness coefficient is set to 0 15 over the whole surface domain the subsurface domain geometry is bounded by the surface of the slopes and a flat horizontal bottom 20 m below the outlet the channel mouth of the domain all the lateral boundaries of the subsurface domain are of no flow type the initial water table in the subsurface is horizontal and is located 1 m below the level of the outlet a uniform rainfall of 2 10 7 m s 1 over an initial dry surface and soil is imposed all over the surface domain for 40 days the saturated hydraulic conductivity field presented in fig 2 left side was generated using an anisotropic spherical covariance with a correlation length of 60 m in the horizontal directions and of 15 m in the vertical direction the resulting statistical distribution of the decimal logarithm of conductivity values is gaussian with a mean of 4 56 and spans the range 6 25 2 95 the heterogeneous conductivity field was first generated into a parallelepiped frame and then mapped onto the computational meshes used for both nim and cathy the van genuchten parameters α and n associated with the relationships between saturation water content and hydraulic conductivity are set to 1 m 1 and 2 respectively the results presented hereafter with nim are obtained with a coupling length set to 0 0175 m and an exchange coefficient equal to the saturated hydraulic conductivity interpolated for the first layer used in cathy the exchange coefficient is thus highly variable in space the surface computational mesh for cathy was generated using a 2 m 2 m square element mesh each square element was then split into two triangular elements to compose the surface and subsurface mesh in nim the subsurface domain was discretized along the vertical direction in cathy using 45 layers of increasing thickness starting with thin layers 1 to 5 cm thickness at the surface to properly describe the infiltration process notably the number of space steps used to compute the normal to bedrock integrated equivalent parameters in nim see eq 8 was also set to 45 enabling a similar initial representation of heterogeneity between nim and cathy fig 3 compares nim and cathy for the evolutions over time of the following 1 the discharge at the outlet of the domain only overland flow because the lower boundary condition of the convergent geometry is of no flow type in the subsurface 2 the water table elevations at three points inside the domain and 3 cumulative exfiltration infiltration fluxes regarding discharge at the outlet the two models produce similar results for the recession curve while the rising portions show slight mismatches especially at the initiation time of overland flow and the time to peak here the time to reach a steady state flow regime in the channel the evolution over time of water table elevations also illustrates the faster dynamics of nim with earlier increases of heads in response to rainfall compared with cathy even though water table elevations and outlet discharge respond quicker in nim the time needed to reach a steady state regime is slightly longer with nim than with cathy these differences are mainly the consequence of the 2 d subsurface compartment of nim that does not explicitly simulates the vertical component velocity of infiltration and thus may underestimate the storage of rainfall water close to the surface in nim rainfall instantaneously impacts water table elevations because of a water budget influencing heads and calculated in a single element for both the saturated and the vadose zones while rainfall can be partly stored in the vadose zone with cathy in general exfiltration from the subsurface may occur earlier with nim while some water may be stored above the water table with an explicit simulation of the vadose zone as in cathy this storage results in greater water fluxes when the infiltration front reaches the water table the recharge is slightly delayed but with slightly higher amplitude in cathy producing sharper increases of water table elevations but very similar values of discharges at the outlet fig 3 regarding infiltration and exfiltration fluxes both models calculate very similar evolutions over time with a trend for nim to slightly overestimate the flux values as discussed above and illustrated in fig 3 nim is inclined to produce greater exfiltration fluxes as the result of excess of water rapidly reaching the saturated subsurface compartment fig 4 shows the areal extension of saturated areas simulated with nim and cathy after 17 days and 34 days i e during the transient and then steady state flow regimes in the system these extensions are very similar but with slightly smaller surface areas developed by nim compared with cathy notably the delineation of saturated areas at the surface is also influenced by the heterogeneity of the subsurface hydraulic conductivity as nim handles local averages along directions normal to bedrock instead of a complete depiction along these directions it is not surprising that slight differences between cathy and nim exist regarding saturated areas all discrepancies observed between nim and cathy for this complex test case of heterogeneous convergent flow fall easily in margins of errors associated with differences observed between the hydrological models grounded in a 3 d richards equation for their subsurface compartment see e g maxwell et al 2014 kollet et al 2017 considering computation times the gain in cpu using nim is very important when only simulating the subsurface compartment i e a decrease by a factor of 70 a less pronounced factor of 6 applies when coupled surface subsurface flows occur as already mentioned these factors are problem dependent and are deeply influenced by the numerical techniques employed for solving the flow scenarios the performances of nim appear interesting if many runs of the model are required as for example when solving inverse problems or performing data assimilation exercises 4 application to a recently restored fluvial hydrosystem 4 1 rohrschollen island rohrschollen is an artificial island of the upper rhine river located 8 km south of strasbourg fig 5 historically three successive engineering works the first started at the beginning of the 19th century were conducted mainly to prevent massive floods along the upper rhine river eschbach et al 2017 2018 today the hydraulic structures control the current geometry and hydraulic behavior of the island and its hydrographic network a dam has been built at the southern end of the island to divert most of the incoming flow from the river into the rhine canal that borders the western bank of the island the canal feeds a hydropower plant downstream north of rohrschollen when the total discharge of the rhine exceeds 1550 m3 s 1 the excess is diverted in the old rhine that borders the eastern bank of the island the old rhine also being controlled by an agricultural dam on the downstream part of rohrschollen island the canalization of the rhine causes the disconnection of the main anastomosed channel in the island called the bauerngrundwasser bgw fig 5 from the upstream rhine river moreover the groundwater dynamics in the island are rather limited as heads are mainly controlled by the water levels in both the western rhine canal hydropower plant and the eastern old rhine affected by the agricultural dam backwater effect the combination of disconnection and weak groundwater dynamics heavily impacts the ecohydrological functioning of the island that was regularly flooded before the engineering works see eschbach et al 2017 for details a european life project a european scientific program in support of environmental nature conservation and climate actions was funded in 2012 to restore the hydromorphological and ecological processes of rohrschollen island a floodgate and a 900 m long artificial channel were built to inject rhine river water into the island in case of river flooding see fig 5 the aims are to significantly increase discharge into the surface waterbodies of the island recover bedload transport and active morphodynamics in channels and improve surface subsurface water exchanges stimulating the renewal of aquatic and riverine ecosystems a discharge between 2 and 80 m3 s 1 according to the total discharge of the rhine river can be injected into the floodgate and the new artificial channel that flushes through the bgw all producing highly transient hydrological responses at the scale of the whole island this specific transient hydraulic behavior associated with rapid exfiltration infiltration processes is hardly locatable on a flat topographic surface which is why the rohrschollen island environment was chosen to assess the worth of nim in the refined modeling of real world systems the life project includes monitoring operations to investigate the effects of the restoration regarding various components of the island of particular interest for our study is the dense network of piezometers fig 5 which were installed along the new artificial channel and the bgw channel at 10 transects with one measurement on each bank of the draining system the temporal resolution of head monitoring in the 20 wells ranges from 5 to 15 min a few head measurements are also available on the western and eastern parts of the island the city of strasbourg is partly in charge of this monitoring green squares on fig 5 because the island is also classified as a nature reserve the french national electricity company edf also monitors the water level close to the right bank of the rhine canal which is on the western bank of the island blue squares on fig 5 all heads and water levels other than the 10 transects are measured twice per month 4 2 modeling scenario the topography of rohrschollen island has been obtained from an airborne lidar survey performed in 2015 the coupled model used to simulate rohrschollen island is a version that only comprises 2 d overland and 2 d low dimensional subsurface compartments with the aim of using the refined topography from the lidar survey to delineate routed flow in surface channels as overland flow in low elevation subareas the whole system is meshed using a 10 m resolution grid inside a 120 m wide area surrounding the new channel and the bgw while the rest of the area employs a 20 m resolution grid the 10 m resolution is smaller than the width of the new channel and the bgw allowing us to properly represent these routed surface flows via 2 d elements two periods of time were simulated the first serving as a calibration period for which several parameters are adjusted and the second period serves as forecast simulation and validation against available data the first period ranges from december 9th 2014 to december 15th 2014 and covers a two peak injection test initially designed to assess the stability of the banks of the upstream part of the new channel the second period ranges from may 15th 2015 to may 21st 2015 and covers a three peak injection test also designed to check on the new channel stability the evolutions of the injection flowrates over time for both periods are reported in fig 6 in this very transient fluvial hydrosystem bounded by the rhine canal and the old rhine the boundary conditions of the system were set as prescribed heads inherited from piezometric measurements collected by the city of strasbourg and edf on the eastern and western boundaries of the island these prescribed head boundary conditions were updated over time following the transient features observed in the data the southern and northern parts were considered no flow boundaries due to the presence of the diversion dam to the south and because of a lack of data to the north as well as the assumption that most fluxes exit the island via the mouth of the bgw the initial conditions were set while running the model with a 2 m3 s 1 source term upstream of the new channel and the boundary conditions described previously until a steady state flow regime was obtained the 2 m3 s 1 injection flowrate is usually imposed under normal conditions when the rhine river discharge is lower than 1550 m3 s as the structure of the island is fairly well known the main flow parameters were preconditioned and mapped using field measurements and geomorphological considerations it must also be stressed that we are not interested in a pinpoint calibration of the model but want to show its relevance in mimicking highly transient and reactive hydrological systems therefore automatic inversion of model parameters by facing model outputs against data was not carried out though this option could be envisioned in future works the morpho sedimentary characteristics of the island were investigated using historical maps and a sedimentological survey bars of coarse sediments gravels pebbles were mapped and the subsurface model was parametrized using their extensions and the sediments grain size eschbach et al 2017 an initial estimate of the saturated conductivity field distribution was built using geomorphological information and knowing that the deep subsurface is mainly composed of gravel corridors around the new channel the bgw and a network of paleo channels visible in the floodplain that can be identified using the digital elevation model were defined and parametrized separately the exchange coefficients between surface and subsurface i e k int and l e of eq 13 were also predetermined using information derived from sedimentological studies succeeding this first parametrization and a first run of the model a manual calibration was carried out to reduce the root mean square error rmse and increase the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 for all the piezometric measurements locations both the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the exchange coefficient between surface and subsurface were slightly modified while trying to preserve the initial preconditioning on parameter values and on spatial patterns previously derived from the sedimentary study the final set of parameters for saturated hydraulic conductivities and exchange coefficients i e the most sensitive parameters of the model are mapped in fig 7 4 3 results fig 8 reports on simulated head values compared with measured ones for all locations and sampling times used in the steps of the model calibration the overall fit between model and data is acceptable with a root mean square error rmse of 0 17 m for heads and a kling gupta efficiency kge coefficient of 0 93 however the calibrated model tends to slightly overestimate hydraulic heads most of the simulated values are above the line in fig 8 marking the ideal value of 1 for the ratio of the simulated value to the observed value this is confirmed by the distribution in fig 9 showing that errors on heads as simulation minus observation are well centered on 0 but slightly skewed towards positive values fig 10 displays the temporal evolution of heads at four locations on the island these locations correspond to measurement points on the left and right banks of the bgw with either the best or the worst rmse at each location the model captures the dynamics of heads properly often with two successive peaks over time as the response to the upstream two peak injection in the inlet channel the amplitude and time phasing of the head peaks are particularly well reproduced with no more than a 10 cm difference between simulation and observation for peak eight reaching 1 5 m relaxation periods in which heads come back to a stable value are harder to simulate but the complete response of the model does not fully depart from observations the late time steady state simulated head values often overestimate observations because the low dimensional subsurface model is slower and retains more water during recession periods see weill et al 2017 this behavior directly impacts and explains the results in figs 8 and 10 it is worth noting that the t6 right head curve fig 10 does not show a two peak evolution as the observation well is located at the northern end of the island far from the injection effects of injections in the inlet canal to the south fig 5 are attenuated as a consequence of hydraulic diffusion throughout the system and only the major injection of 80 m3 s 1 fig 6 is visible on heads to the north it is also interesting to note that simulated head curves at early times show a constant plateau associated with the initial and boundary conditions on the eastern and the western banks of the island as already mentioned these boundary conditions prescribe transient heads set at the observed values in wells close to the banks unfortunately the sampling time step of two weeks is not short enough to capture all the transient effects at the boundaries that propagate onto the island therefore the constant simulated head plateaus at early times do not match the slightly convex head curves of observations figs 11 and 12 map snapshots over the island of heads in the subsurface and water depth in channels at four times in the calibration period i e initial condition first injection peak second injection peak and after four days end of recession it can be observed how the injection in the inlet channel and the surface subsurface interactions impact the subsurface head fields at the beginning of the injection most of the injected water infiltrates through the bed of the channel as the latter is still unclogged by fine grained sediments a water dome thus appears along the inlet channel as a result of the massive infiltration later the dome grows in extension when the injected discharge reaches 80 m3 s 1 after four days the head field comes back to a pattern close to that of the initial state with slightly higher head values showing that the system still bears slightly more water than under usual flow conditions in terms of water depths in channels the initial water depth shows that with 2 m3 s 1 injected upstream the new channel and the bgw are under water as well as some paleo channels in the floodplain once a higher discharge is injected upstream wetlands and swamps appear with up to one meter water depth with 80 m3 s 1 injected at the inlet most of the southern upstream part of the island is under water and water depths in the bgw may reach 3 m for the subsurface heads after four days water depths in channels and swamps go back to their initial values showing that the whole system is very reactive with characteristic times similar in both the surface and subsurface compartments regarding the forecast simulation step validation of the modeling exercise figs 13 and 14 image the comparison between simulated and measured subsurface heads for all the measurement locations and sampling times and the associated distribution of errors as expected the fit between simulation and observation of the calibration is better than that of the forecast compare figs 8 and 13 and figs 9 and 14 with that said the forecast simulation shows reasonable performance with an rmse of 0 24 m and a kge coefficient of 0 75 the trend towards overestimation of heads see above is amplified as shown in fig 14 with a distribution of errors adding a small second peak of simulated values exceeding observations of more than 0 5 m fig 15 displays the temporal evolution of the subsurface heads at the same 4 locations as that presented for the calibration step the model does not reproduce the head histories as well this feature could be related to the fact that the injection composed of 3 successive peaks of discharge in the system during the forecast period is more complicated than during the calibration period nonetheless the overall trends the amplitudes and time phasing of subsurface head peaks are fairly well captured in general subsurface heads and water depths in channels simulated with the coupled model illustrate that the injections designed to restore hydroecological processes on rohrschollen island are effective especially along the new channel and the bgw as they strongly enhance surface subsurface interactions and rapidly impact water storage in both the surface and subsurface domains these stimulations of the water dynamics of the island are expected to influence biogeochemical cycles and finally restore an ecological functioning close to that established before the canalization works that modified drastically the fluvial hydrosystem the coupled model that we employ appears to be a suitable tool to model small to mid scale hydrological systems even if their structure and their dynamics are complex showing high heterogeneity and very transient responses to forcing constraints 5 conclusions most integrated hydrological models of the literature rely on numerically solving the 3 d richards equation to describe flow processes in the subsurface the resolution of this equation often implies the use of a fine vertical discretization needed to properly capture the vadose zone flow processes the multiplication of layers in the modeled domain produces large meshes and numerical systems that are difficult to handle and solve without important computational resources although high performance computational methods are being implemented into richards based integrated models to reduce the computational cost application to an actual complex system can still be plagued by important computational times especially when model inversion is envisioned in a stochastic framework duplicating solutions for the purpose of identifying model output and model parameter uncertainties low dimensional integrated hydrological models in the sense of models that couple surface and subsurface processes but use parsimonious approaches through reduced dimensionality can become relevant alternatives even though the concept of parsimony is appealing few integrated hydrological models of that kind have been developed and tested on their ability to mimic actual complex hydrosystems in applying a low dimensional coupled model including 2 d overland and 2 d subsurface flow to the fluvial hydrosystem of rohrschollen island we show that a reduction of dimensionality does not go with spurious simulations even though the modeled system is heterogeneous and very reactive regarding its hydrodynamic behavior in general the features of flow are well captured in their space and time variations and for all the compartments of the hydrosystem it is worth noting that other applications were carried out with the low dimensional model on geometries including steep slope bedrocks e g the strengbach catchment in pan et al 2015 the results show that the low dimensional model correctly describes complex hydrological processes in the case of non flat bedrocks beneath watersheds it is also of importance to mention that integrated hydrological models are often involved in mass transport problems to cope with water quality issues transport with nim has not yet been addressed the low dimensional model employed in this study has been calculated on a classical laptop using sequential programming and it returns the complete simulation of the rohrschollen system in approximately 8 h of calculation knowing that the system is very transient especially for its surface compartment and requiring time steps on the order of the minute the calculation time appears reasonable for modeling the functioning of the actual system over a period of a week in this specific case the low dimensional model reveals tools suited to forecast the influence of forcing constraints conducive to the hydroecological restoration of a relative small fluvial hydrosystem there exist other applications dedicated to small to mid scale watersheds that do not require very short time steps over long periods of time there is no reason for the low dimensional model to fail in simulating the hydraulic behavior of these systems as practitioners or institutions in charge of water management who in general do not have access to high performance computing may need handy tools integrated hydrological models with reduced dimensionality become a serious option for practical applications in this study neither hydrometeorological conditioning nor mass transfer in watersheds was addressed in the case of rohrschollen island and for the simulation period discussed it is likely that accounting for hydrometeorological forcing would not have changed the results the hydrological context is fully under the control of water levels in the river and flooding associated with water injections in the main channel of the island that being said it is well known that meteorological forcing especially on small watersheds can be at the origin of most of the dynamics of water fluxes as the low dimensional integrated model proposed does not denature the physics of flow in its time behavior and spatial structure coupling with a land surface model might reveal an interesting evolution regarding mass transfers the low dimensionality is also a synonym for the loss of precision in fluid velocity fields that convey conservative and reactive solutes this is especially the case for the subsurface compartment where the two dimensional simplification neglects the vertical components of flow to formulate relevant mass transfer problems further investigations should delineate in which hydrodynamic conditions and for which variables characterizing the mass transfer e g local concentrations and various spatial or temporal moments of the solute plume the reduction of dimensionality does not prohibit success acknowledgements the monitoring of rohrschollen

7153,an integrated hydrological model that couples a low dimensional 2 d subsurface model to 1 d river flow and 2 d overland flow is presented and applied to a real world system the 2 d subsurface equation stems from a careful integration a 3 d richards equation along a local direction normal to the bottom of the aquifer a normally integrated model nim is first compared with the integrated model cathy catchment hydrology in regard to a synthetic test case with complex geometry heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field of the subsurface compartment and various interactions between the surface and the subsurface this exercise reveals the gain in computation time associated with the use of a low dimensional model by a factor of 6 nim is then applied to simulate the hydrodynamics of an actual restored hydrosystem namely rohrschollen island of the upper rhine river with the aim of assessing the ability to address highly transient hydrological conditions and the efficiency of the restoration strategy the calibration and validation steps associated with this exercise show that the coupled model describes the hydraulic head evolution and water mass balance induced by artificial injections of surface water in a channel dug for the purpose of reconnecting the rhine to an old and clogged channel the low dimensional coupled model of this study is simpler than the state of the art integrated models employing the solution of the 3 d richards equation it is however suited to investigate fine scale problems in relation to water resource management and hydraulic developments with reasonable computational costs and a physically based approach to model flow processes keywords low dimensional model integrated hydrological modeling overland flow restoration rohrschollen island upper rhine river 1 introduction physically based hydrological models are now accepted as effective tools to investigate various issues related to the water cycle e g fatichi et al 2016 and citations herein in the broad family of hydrological models the so called integrated models are specific as they account for the interactions between surface and subsurface flow and transport processes in a physically relevant way it is now acknowledged that including these interactions in hydrological models is mandatory to properly describe the water cycle and its tightly coupled components paniconi and putti 2015 integrated models have been applied at various scales to bring new insights to the processes that control the hydrological geomorphological or ecohydrological responses of natural systems e g sulis et al 2011 ran et al 2012 kim et al 2013 partington et al 2013 niu et al 2014a niu et al 2014b the current trend in the development of integrated models is to extend their scope beyond the dynamics of water fluxes for example in handling the interactions with the atmosphere through the coupling with land surface models e g maxwell et al 2007 shi et al 2013 sulis et al 2017 or dealing with geochemical processes e g bao et al 2017 most of the integrated hydrological models of the literature rely on the solution of the three dimensional richards equation to describe the subsurface flow processes maxwell et al 2014 the highly non linear nature of this equation raises serious issues regarding its applicability for large scale systems employing relatively coarse resolutions compared with the scale at which elementary processes occur the question of the appropriate level of complexity that needs to be incorporated in a model is still open e g mirus et al 2011a hopp et al 2016 weill et al 2017 in practice solving a three dimensional richards equation requires refined meshing especially along the vertical direction to properly catch the physics of infiltration and avoid spurious oscillations hopp et al 2016 integrated hydrological models that rely on the richards equation are often computationally demanding which may limit their use for various applications highly parallel computing methods are being implemented to overcome this difficulty e g kollet et al 2010 vivoni et al 2011 maxwell et al 2015 but the required calculation power to run parallel codes can be difficult to access for many practitioners alternative approaches have been developed to lessen the computational cost while preserving the physically based nature of the developed model one possible option is to reduce the dimensionality of the problem the first low dimensional hydrological models were built using the dupuit forchheimer assumption and the boussinesq equation e g boussinesq 1877 brutsaert 1994 to describe saturated flow these models were unable to account for the three dimensionality of natural systems and were thus hardly applicable to real world situations troch et al 2003 further developments were undertaken to overcome the difficulty thus resulting in various low dimensional approaches that tried to combine applicability simplicity and physical relevance e g sloan 2000 curtu et al 2014 in this framework of simplified hydrogeological models the most advanced approach used to date was initially proposed by troch et al 2003 which solved the hillslope storage boussinesq hsb equation the major advantage of this hsb is that it allows for the description of the three dimensional shape of a hillslope or a catchment while relying upon a single one dimensional simple equation the hsb model was further developed by hilberts et al 2007 who coupled the hsb equation with a one dimensional richards equation for a better depiction of the vertical flow processes in the vadose zone other approaches are available today to account for the vadose zone in the low dimensional subsurface flow model pan et al 2015 whose normally integrated model nim is further enhanced in this study proposed describing both saturated and unsaturated zone flow processes using a richards equation integrated along a direction perpendicular to the bedrock a similar approach that integrates the hsb equation along a direction perpendicular to the bedrock was also proposed by kong et al 2016 few low dimensional subsurface models have been coupled to surface flow models and applied to real world systems although this could be an interesting alternative to classical integrated models as mentioned by troch et al 2013 matonse and kroll 2009 applied an hsb based model to improve low flow predictions in a small headwater catchment broda et al 2012 coupled the hsb model to a deep aquifer model to report on the interactions between deep and subsurface aquifers hazenberg et al 2015 2016 also associated the hsb equation for saturated flow with a 1 d vertical richards equation for unsaturated flow and with a diffusive wave surface flow model their aim was to merge the resulting approach into a land surface model applications to synthetic test cases and to an actual hillslope experiment show that this kind of approach can properly simulate complex hydrological responses the model proposed hereafter and amending previous developments by some of the authors of the present contribution pan et al 2015 weill et al 2017 also couples a low dimensional subsurface model with two types of surface flow regarding the lack of applications of such models to real world systems it is still to be shown that integrated low dimensional models can accurately reproduce catchment scale flow processes and surface subsurface interactions the aim of this contribution is to present the further developments that have amended and have enhanced the model nim proposed by pan et al 2015 and to employ the resulting tool in an application to an actual restored hydrosystem with highly transient and reactive behavior the main improvement lies in the addition of a 2 d surface flow model solving a diffusive wave equation to account for 2 d flow processes that may occur at the topographic surface i e exfiltration along saturated areas or hortonian runoff the 2 d overland flow model is coupled with the existing low dimensional subsurface model and the 1 d river flow model the numerical implementation was also completely upgraded regarding meshing discretization techniques coupling strategies and solvers to improve the overall efficiency of the model the resulting new coupled model nim is then run and is compared with the integrated model cathy camporese et al 2010 on a synthetic test case the latter comprises a complex geometry of the watershed a heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field in the subsurface and infiltration exfiltration processes to check on the proper implementation of the overland flow model and of the coupling then the coupled model is applied to rohrschollen island located on the upper rhine river this island is monitored to study the effects of hydraulic and geomorphological restoration on its hydrodynamics morphodynamics and ecological functioning the main goal of this application is to show that an integrated model based on a low dimensional approach of the subsurface can be relevant to capture complex hydrological responses in the case of rohrschollen island the gain in the number of unknowns computation nodes associated with the low dimensional subsurface model allows for refined horizontal resolution which in turn properly describes the topography and its effect on the generation of streamflow processes 2 the hydrological model nim normally integrated model 2 1 the physical and mathematical formulation of flow compartments the description focuses on the governing equations for the three components of the model which include 1 d river flow 2 d overland flow and 2 d subsurface flow the coupling strategy and numerical approaches used to solve the resulting system of equations are also discussed additionally note that more details and various numerical tests of the nim model can be found in pan et al 2015 and weill et al 2017 surface flow models in our modeling approach surface flow is supported by two different mesh geometries concentrated surface flow is handled by a 1 d river model that describes runoff in a ramified stream network composed of connected 1 d bonds while overland flow on hillslopes is handled by a 2 d model using a 2 d triangular mesh that mimics the topography of the surface the two models are coupled to account for the possible interactions between flows in the stream network and on the hillslopes the 2 d overland flow model is derived from the full 2 d saint venant equations e g panday and huyakorn 2004 1 h

compartment and with the subsurface g lt 2 is the scalar component of the gravity acceleration and s f x and s f y are the frictional slopes of the topography along the x and y directions respectively following the approach that di giammarco et al 1996 proposed and relying upon the diffusive wave approximation and manning s equation the governing equation for 2 d overland flow can be rewritten as 4

and n man y l 1 3t are the manning coefficients in the x and y directions respectively regarding 1 d river flow the modeling approach relies on a one dimensional version of eqs 1 2 and 3 and the diffusive wave approximation with these assumptions the momentum equation of the saint venant equations reduces to r h r z r s f r where r is the gradient operator in the direction of the stream flow h r l is the water depth in the river z r l is the bottom elevation of the riverbed and s f r is the frictional slope of the riverbed in the direction of flow for details see pan et al 2015 introducing the above relation into manning s formula the mean velocity in the river u r lt 1 can be written as 5 u r r h 2 3 n man r r h r z r 1 2 r h r z r where n man r l 1 3t is the manning coefficient for the river and r h l is the hydraulic radius calculated from the water depth h and the geometric properties of the river introducing eq 5 into a one dimensional version of the mass

is the width of the water surface in the river and l l is the width at the bottom of the riverbed low dimensional 2 d subsurface flow model the low dimensional subsurface flow model results from the integration of the 3 d richards equation along the direction z normal to the slope of the bedrock of the aquifer the integration bounds are the bedrock elevation z b and the soil surface elevation z s the resulting equation can be written as 7 z b z s θ t s s s w θ h t d z z b z s k θ h d z z b z s q w d z where θ is the water content s w is the water saturation ss l 1 is the specific storage

river network and the 2 d overland flow models notably the standard eulerian coordinate system x y z which usually defines the horizontal and vertical directions is used for convenience here in 7 and hereafter in 8 as the coordinate system with directions normal to bedrock z and in the bedrock plane x y this reference is local as the slope of the bedrock may vary and is defined for each 2 d computational element composing the domain the nonlinear relationships between saturation water content and hydraulic conductivity are described using the van genuchten models van genuchten 1980 eq 7 can be transformed assuming that flow is mainly parallel to the bedrock and introducing the water table depth z w as an integration bound in addition it can be assumed that variation in time of the water content θ is null in the saturated zone and that the term associated with the specific storage capacity s s in the vadose zone is usually negligible compared with the variation of the water content over time finally eq 7 becomes 8 θ t s h h t x y t θ x y h q w where θ h z w z s θ z d z s h s sat h and t h θ k sat h z w z s k θ z d z k sat and s sat are averages along the integration direction z of the saturated hydraulic conductivity tensor and the specific storage capacity in the saturated zone respectively in practice the equivalent parameters θ h s h and t h θ are computed numerically assuming that the pressure distribution along the direction normal to the bedrock is hydrostatic notably eq 8 has a form similar to the saturated flow equation obtained using the classical dupuit assumption with the exception that the equivalent parameters θ h s h and t h θ account for both the saturated zone and the vadose zone properties as mentioned previously more details and various numerical applications can be found in pan et al 2015 and weill et al 2017 2 2 coupling strategies the coupling between the three components of the model is performed using a first order approach the low dimensional subsurface model and the 2 d overland flow model share the same unstructured triangular mesh the 1 d mesh is superimposed onto the 2 d mesh so that each 1 d element is also an edge of a 2 d triangle see fig 1 we present below the formulations employed to simulate the exchanges of water fluxes between the three compartments of the hydrological model the exchange flux per unit of length between the 1 d river and the 2 d overland flow models denoted as q ex 1 d 2 d l2t 1 is described by the flow equation of a wide rectangular weir as implemented by panday and huyakorn 2004 with exchanges occurring in both directions from the river to overland and from overland to the river these exchanges are depicted by the following 9 q e x 1 d 2 d freeflowing c d 4 3 2

u l is the water head of the upstream compartment h d l is the water head of the downstream compartment z b ank l is the elevation of the river bank and g is the scalar component of the gravity acceleration lt 2 the bidirectional exchange flux per unit length between the 1 d river flow and the low dimensional groundwater compartment denoted as q ex 1 d s s l2t 1 is modeled according to the formulation proposed by gunduz and aral 2005 as 11 q ex 1 d s s w r k sed h r z r h m r if h z r m r 12 q ex 1 d s s w r k sed h r z r z r m r m r if h z r m r where w r l is the wetted perimeter of the river k sed lt 1 is the hydraulic conductivity of sediments at the bottom of the riverbed and m r l is the thickness of sediments at the bottom of the riverbed a thresholding function not displayed in 11 and 12 for the sake of simplicity ensures that when h r tends to zero while h r z r h the flux q ex 1 d s s also tends to be zero the bidirectional exchange flux per unit area between the 2 d overland flow and the subsurface denoted as q ex 2 d s s lt 1 is modeled using a first order exchange coefficient associated with a formalism similar to that implemented in both the hgs hydrogeosphere model therrien et al 2005 and the integrated hydrological model inhm vanderkwaak and loague 2001 13 q ex 2 d s s k int z s h s h l e f s 14 f s min h s h ob 2 1 h s h ob 1 where k int lt 1 is the vertical hydraulic conductivity at the interface between the surface and subsurface compartments l e is a user defined coupling length i e an empirical thickness of the interface between surface and subsurface compartments f s is a scaling function accounting for the saturated unsaturated character of the interface between the surface and subsurface and h ob is the total obstruction height accounting for small irregularities of the topography 2 3 numerical solution in a former version of the subsurface model the discretization of 8 employed a mixed hybrid finite element mhfe scheme pan et al 2015 weill et al 2017 in the revised form the mhfe scheme has been replaced by a crouzeix raviart finite element crfe scheme crouzeix and raviart 1973 which has been shown to be equivalent to the mhfe marini 1985 vohralík and wohlmuth 2013 nevertheless the formalism of the crfe method is much simpler to implement for the sake of consistency and simplicity a crfe scheme also discretizes eq 4 of the 2 d overland flow for its part 1 d river flow is handled via a classical finite volume scheme as it is much simpler to implement and ensures mass conservation and redistribution of fluxes at the nodes of the 1 d bond network the equations associated with the three compartments of the model are solved using a fully implicit approach in the sense that the discrete equations of the three compartments and the coupling relationships are put together into a single discrete system solving the three state variables h s surface h r river and h subsurface simultaneously nonlinearity is now handled by the newton raphson linearization scheme instead of the picard scheme of the previous version a general optimization of the code and the quadratic convergence of the newton raphson linearization lehmann and ackerer 1998 paniconi and putti 1994 compared with the linear convergence of the picard scheme greatly improved the performance of the enhanced model in terms of calculation times e g the calcu1ation time was decreased by a factor of 25 for a 1 d river flow over approximately 500 linear bonds of a ramified network with classical values of hydrodynamic parameters some discrepancies may appear when solving the surface flow equations as the variables h s and h r which are water thicknesses above a substratum should never be negative which is not ensured by simply solving the diffusion eqs 4 and 6 wet dry transitions at the interfaces of 1 d river and 2 d surface flows must be treated carefully to prevent the model from computing unphysical negative water depths and to avoid subsequent instability issues this phenomenon is common to every overland flow model and several techniques have been developed to eliminate it bates and hervouet 1999 defina 2000 costabile et al 2012 medeiros and hagen 2013 unfortunately these techniques are usually developed for a specific numerical scheme and cannot be easily transposed onto another scheme defina 2000 for the 1 d river flow model a backward scheme circumvents the occurrence of negative h r see pan et al 2015 for details for the 2 d overland flow model water depth values h s are checked node by node in the triangular mesh if a negative value is computed at one node the positive water depths of the neighboring nodes are decreased and the removed quantity is lumped on the negative node to render its value equal to zero the procedure is carried out while preserving the water mass balance at the scale of the cell as detailed in khan 2010 mass removed at positive nodes is compensated by mass added to the negative node if the three nodes of a current cell are assigned negative values or if the average value over the three nodes is negative readjustment of water levels is performed by setting the three nodes of the current cell to zero and diminishing the water level removing mass of positive nodes in other cells within a prescribed narrow zone water mass balance is preserved at the scale of this zone 3 application to a synthetic test case because 2 d overland flow was added to a previous version of the hydrological model and because the new three compartment version 1 d river 2 d overland 2 d subsurface was completely revisited regarding its numerical content see above it makes sense to check the calculations these and the overall efficiency of our approach are compared with outputs from the integrated model cathy catchment hydrology camporese et al 2010 regarding a complex synthetic test case although several synthetic test cases of watershed dynamics are available in the literature mirus et al 2011b liggett et al 2012 maxwell et al 2014 the test in this study was purposely designed to tackle a complex problem with a convergent geometry prone to large variations of fluid velocities and a heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field a comparison of computational times between nim and cathy is also presented in the following it is worth noting that a fair comparison of the kind is not straightforward to the point that even studies comparing integrated hydrological models do not mention calculation times e g maxwell et al 2014 kollet et al 2017 many factors strongly impact calculation times such as the coupling algorithm the discretization scheme the time integration method the solver of discrete equations the time step strategy etc and are usually not similar between the different integrated models nim and cathy are based on different conceptualizations of the subsurface with nim using the low dimensional approach described previously as cathy solves a 3 d richards equation nevertheless both models rely upon a diffusive wave approximation to depict the surface flow processes noting that numerical implementations differ the other important differences between nim and cathy are found in the following 1 the coupling strategy since nim uses a fully implicit coupling see above as the coupling is sequential and separates the calculation of each compartment in cathy 2 the linearization scheme since nim uses a newton raphson algorithm while cathy uses a picard algorithm and 3 the numerical scheme since nim uses crouzet raviard finite elements while cathy uses standard galerkin finite elements the coupling scheme strongly favors cathy because multiple time steps can be employed for solving flow in the surface compartments when a single time step is enough for solving accurately the subsurface in association with a fully implicit coupling nim uses the same time steps for both surface and subsurface compartments which multiplies the number of calculations in the subsurface compared with cathy therefore the cpu times needed for simulation periods involving the subsurface only are distinguished from times for periods involving both the surface and subsurface note that the time step strategies initial time step maximum time step and the factors used to increase decrease the time step have been optimized in each model for the purpose of a fair comparison of calculation times the convergent geometry of the test case considered is shown in fig 2 right side the surface domain consists of two triangular hillslopes connected to a 140 m long and 6 m wide channel the slopes in the x and y directions respectively are 0 05 and 0 02 the manning roughness coefficient is set to 0 15 over the whole surface domain the subsurface domain geometry is bounded by the surface of the slopes and a flat horizontal bottom 20 m below the outlet the channel mouth of the domain all the lateral boundaries of the subsurface domain are of no flow type the initial water table in the subsurface is horizontal and is located 1 m below the level of the outlet a uniform rainfall of 2 10 7 m s 1 over an initial dry surface and soil is imposed all over the surface domain for 40 days the saturated hydraulic conductivity field presented in fig 2 left side was generated using an anisotropic spherical covariance with a correlation length of 60 m in the horizontal directions and of 15 m in the vertical direction the resulting statistical distribution of the decimal logarithm of conductivity values is gaussian with a mean of 4 56 and spans the range 6 25 2 95 the heterogeneous conductivity field was first generated into a parallelepiped frame and then mapped onto the computational meshes used for both nim and cathy the van genuchten parameters α and n associated with the relationships between saturation water content and hydraulic conductivity are set to 1 m 1 and 2 respectively the results presented hereafter with nim are obtained with a coupling length set to 0 0175 m and an exchange coefficient equal to the saturated hydraulic conductivity interpolated for the first layer used in cathy the exchange coefficient is thus highly variable in space the surface computational mesh for cathy was generated using a 2 m 2 m square element mesh each square element was then split into two triangular elements to compose the surface and subsurface mesh in nim the subsurface domain was discretized along the vertical direction in cathy using 45 layers of increasing thickness starting with thin layers 1 to 5 cm thickness at the surface to properly describe the infiltration process notably the number of space steps used to compute the normal to bedrock integrated equivalent parameters in nim see eq 8 was also set to 45 enabling a similar initial representation of heterogeneity between nim and cathy fig 3 compares nim and cathy for the evolutions over time of the following 1 the discharge at the outlet of the domain only overland flow because the lower boundary condition of the convergent geometry is of no flow type in the subsurface 2 the water table elevations at three points inside the domain and 3 cumulative exfiltration infiltration fluxes regarding discharge at the outlet the two models produce similar results for the recession curve while the rising portions show slight mismatches especially at the initiation time of overland flow and the time to peak here the time to reach a steady state flow regime in the channel the evolution over time of water table elevations also illustrates the faster dynamics of nim with earlier increases of heads in response to rainfall compared with cathy even though water table elevations and outlet discharge respond quicker in nim the time needed to reach a steady state regime is slightly longer with nim than with cathy these differences are mainly the consequence of the 2 d subsurface compartment of nim that does not explicitly simulates the vertical component velocity of infiltration and thus may underestimate the storage of rainfall water close to the surface in nim rainfall instantaneously impacts water table elevations because of a water budget influencing heads and calculated in a single element for both the saturated and the vadose zones while rainfall can be partly stored in the vadose zone with cathy in general exfiltration from the subsurface may occur earlier with nim while some water may be stored above the water table with an explicit simulation of the vadose zone as in cathy this storage results in greater water fluxes when the infiltration front reaches the water table the recharge is slightly delayed but with slightly higher amplitude in cathy producing sharper increases of water table elevations but very similar values of discharges at the outlet fig 3 regarding infiltration and exfiltration fluxes both models calculate very similar evolutions over time with a trend for nim to slightly overestimate the flux values as discussed above and illustrated in fig 3 nim is inclined to produce greater exfiltration fluxes as the result of excess of water rapidly reaching the saturated subsurface compartment fig 4 shows the areal extension of saturated areas simulated with nim and cathy after 17 days and 34 days i e during the transient and then steady state flow regimes in the system these extensions are very similar but with slightly smaller surface areas developed by nim compared with cathy notably the delineation of saturated areas at the surface is also influenced by the heterogeneity of the subsurface hydraulic conductivity as nim handles local averages along directions normal to bedrock instead of a complete depiction along these directions it is not surprising that slight differences between cathy and nim exist regarding saturated areas all discrepancies observed between nim and cathy for this complex test case of heterogeneous convergent flow fall easily in margins of errors associated with differences observed between the hydrological models grounded in a 3 d richards equation for their subsurface compartment see e g maxwell et al 2014 kollet et al 2017 considering computation times the gain in cpu using nim is very important when only simulating the subsurface compartment i e a decrease by a factor of 70 a less pronounced factor of 6 applies when coupled surface subsurface flows occur as already mentioned these factors are problem dependent and are deeply influenced by the numerical techniques employed for solving the flow scenarios the performances of nim appear interesting if many runs of the model are required as for example when solving inverse problems or performing data assimilation exercises 4 application to a recently restored fluvial hydrosystem 4 1 rohrschollen island rohrschollen is an artificial island of the upper rhine river located 8 km south of strasbourg fig 5 historically three successive engineering works the first started at the beginning of the 19th century were conducted mainly to prevent massive floods along the upper rhine river eschbach et al 2017 2018 today the hydraulic structures control the current geometry and hydraulic behavior of the island and its hydrographic network a dam has been built at the southern end of the island to divert most of the incoming flow from the river into the rhine canal that borders the western bank of the island the canal feeds a hydropower plant downstream north of rohrschollen when the total discharge of the rhine exceeds 1550 m3 s 1 the excess is diverted in the old rhine that borders the eastern bank of the island the old rhine also being controlled by an agricultural dam on the downstream part of rohrschollen island the canalization of the rhine causes the disconnection of the main anastomosed channel in the island called the bauerngrundwasser bgw fig 5 from the upstream rhine river moreover the groundwater dynamics in the island are rather limited as heads are mainly controlled by the water levels in both the western rhine canal hydropower plant and the eastern old rhine affected by the agricultural dam backwater effect the combination of disconnection and weak groundwater dynamics heavily impacts the ecohydrological functioning of the island that was regularly flooded before the engineering works see eschbach et al 2017 for details a european life project a european scientific program in support of environmental nature conservation and climate actions was funded in 2012 to restore the hydromorphological and ecological processes of rohrschollen island a floodgate and a 900 m long artificial channel were built to inject rhine river water into the island in case of river flooding see fig 5 the aims are to significantly increase discharge into the surface waterbodies of the island recover bedload transport and active morphodynamics in channels and improve surface subsurface water exchanges stimulating the renewal of aquatic and riverine ecosystems a discharge between 2 and 80 m3 s 1 according to the total discharge of the rhine river can be injected into the floodgate and the new artificial channel that flushes through the bgw all producing highly transient hydrological responses at the scale of the whole island this specific transient hydraulic behavior associated with rapid exfiltration infiltration processes is hardly locatable on a flat topographic surface which is why the rohrschollen island environment was chosen to assess the worth of nim in the refined modeling of real world systems the life project includes monitoring operations to investigate the effects of the restoration regarding various components of the island of particular interest for our study is the dense network of piezometers fig 5 which were installed along the new artificial channel and the bgw channel at 10 transects with one measurement on each bank of the draining system the temporal resolution of head monitoring in the 20 wells ranges from 5 to 15 min a few head measurements are also available on the western and eastern parts of the island the city of strasbourg is partly in charge of this monitoring green squares on fig 5 because the island is also classified as a nature reserve the french national electricity company edf also monitors the water level close to the right bank of the rhine canal which is on the western bank of the island blue squares on fig 5 all heads and water levels other than the 10 transects are measured twice per month 4 2 modeling scenario the topography of rohrschollen island has been obtained from an airborne lidar survey performed in 2015 the coupled model used to simulate rohrschollen island is a version that only comprises 2 d overland and 2 d low dimensional subsurface compartments with the aim of using the refined topography from the lidar survey to delineate routed flow in surface channels as overland flow in low elevation subareas the whole system is meshed using a 10 m resolution grid inside a 120 m wide area surrounding the new channel and the bgw while the rest of the area employs a 20 m resolution grid the 10 m resolution is smaller than the width of the new channel and the bgw allowing us to properly represent these routed surface flows via 2 d elements two periods of time were simulated the first serving as a calibration period for which several parameters are adjusted and the second period serves as forecast simulation and validation against available data the first period ranges from december 9th 2014 to december 15th 2014 and covers a two peak injection test initially designed to assess the stability of the banks of the upstream part of the new channel the second period ranges from may 15th 2015 to may 21st 2015 and covers a three peak injection test also designed to check on the new channel stability the evolutions of the injection flowrates over time for both periods are reported in fig 6 in this very transient fluvial hydrosystem bounded by the rhine canal and the old rhine the boundary conditions of the system were set as prescribed heads inherited from piezometric measurements collected by the city of strasbourg and edf on the eastern and western boundaries of the island these prescribed head boundary conditions were updated over time following the transient features observed in the data the southern and northern parts were considered no flow boundaries due to the presence of the diversion dam to the south and because of a lack of data to the north as well as the assumption that most fluxes exit the island via the mouth of the bgw the initial conditions were set while running the model with a 2 m3 s 1 source term upstream of the new channel and the boundary conditions described previously until a steady state flow regime was obtained the 2 m3 s 1 injection flowrate is usually imposed under normal conditions when the rhine river discharge is lower than 1550 m3 s as the structure of the island is fairly well known the main flow parameters were preconditioned and mapped using field measurements and geomorphological considerations it must also be stressed that we are not interested in a pinpoint calibration of the model but want to show its relevance in mimicking highly transient and reactive hydrological systems therefore automatic inversion of model parameters by facing model outputs against data was not carried out though this option could be envisioned in future works the morpho sedimentary characteristics of the island were investigated using historical maps and a sedimentological survey bars of coarse sediments gravels pebbles were mapped and the subsurface model was parametrized using their extensions and the sediments grain size eschbach et al 2017 an initial estimate of the saturated conductivity field distribution was built using geomorphological information and knowing that the deep subsurface is mainly composed of gravel corridors around the new channel the bgw and a network of paleo channels visible in the floodplain that can be identified using the digital elevation model were defined and parametrized separately the exchange coefficients between surface and subsurface i e k int and l e of eq 13 were also predetermined using information derived from sedimentological studies succeeding this first parametrization and a first run of the model a manual calibration was carried out to reduce the root mean square error rmse and increase the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 for all the piezometric measurements locations both the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the exchange coefficient between surface and subsurface were slightly modified while trying to preserve the initial preconditioning on parameter values and on spatial patterns previously derived from the sedimentary study the final set of parameters for saturated hydraulic conductivities and exchange coefficients i e the most sensitive parameters of the model are mapped in fig 7 4 3 results fig 8 reports on simulated head values compared with measured ones for all locations and sampling times used in the steps of the model calibration the overall fit between model and data is acceptable with a root mean square error rmse of 0 17 m for heads and a kling gupta efficiency kge coefficient of 0 93 however the calibrated model tends to slightly overestimate hydraulic heads most of the simulated values are above the line in fig 8 marking the ideal value of 1 for the ratio of the simulated value to the observed value this is confirmed by the distribution in fig 9 showing that errors on heads as simulation minus observation are well centered on 0 but slightly skewed towards positive values fig 10 displays the temporal evolution of heads at four locations on the island these locations correspond to measurement points on the left and right banks of the bgw with either the best or the worst rmse at each location the model captures the dynamics of heads properly often with two successive peaks over time as the response to the upstream two peak injection in the inlet channel the amplitude and time phasing of the head peaks are particularly well reproduced with no more than a 10 cm difference between simulation and observation for peak eight reaching 1 5 m relaxation periods in which heads come back to a stable value are harder to simulate but the complete response of the model does not fully depart from observations the late time steady state simulated head values often overestimate observations because the low dimensional subsurface model is slower and retains more water during recession periods see weill et al 2017 this behavior directly impacts and explains the results in figs 8 and 10 it is worth noting that the t6 right head curve fig 10 does not show a two peak evolution as the observation well is located at the northern end of the island far from the injection effects of injections in the inlet canal to the south fig 5 are attenuated as a consequence of hydraulic diffusion throughout the system and only the major injection of 80 m3 s 1 fig 6 is visible on heads to the north it is also interesting to note that simulated head curves at early times show a constant plateau associated with the initial and boundary conditions on the eastern and the western banks of the island as already mentioned these boundary conditions prescribe transient heads set at the observed values in wells close to the banks unfortunately the sampling time step of two weeks is not short enough to capture all the transient effects at the boundaries that propagate onto the island therefore the constant simulated head plateaus at early times do not match the slightly convex head curves of observations figs 11 and 12 map snapshots over the island of heads in the subsurface and water depth in channels at four times in the calibration period i e initial condition first injection peak second injection peak and after four days end of recession it can be observed how the injection in the inlet channel and the surface subsurface interactions impact the subsurface head fields at the beginning of the injection most of the injected water infiltrates through the bed of the channel as the latter is still unclogged by fine grained sediments a water dome thus appears along the inlet channel as a result of the massive infiltration later the dome grows in extension when the injected discharge reaches 80 m3 s 1 after four days the head field comes back to a pattern close to that of the initial state with slightly higher head values showing that the system still bears slightly more water than under usual flow conditions in terms of water depths in channels the initial water depth shows that with 2 m3 s 1 injected upstream the new channel and the bgw are under water as well as some paleo channels in the floodplain once a higher discharge is injected upstream wetlands and swamps appear with up to one meter water depth with 80 m3 s 1 injected at the inlet most of the southern upstream part of the island is under water and water depths in the bgw may reach 3 m for the subsurface heads after four days water depths in channels and swamps go back to their initial values showing that the whole system is very reactive with characteristic times similar in both the surface and subsurface compartments regarding the forecast simulation step validation of the modeling exercise figs 13 and 14 image the comparison between simulated and measured subsurface heads for all the measurement locations and sampling times and the associated distribution of errors as expected the fit between simulation and observation of the calibration is better than that of the forecast compare figs 8 and 13 and figs 9 and 14 with that said the forecast simulation shows reasonable performance with an rmse of 0 24 m and a kge coefficient of 0 75 the trend towards overestimation of heads see above is amplified as shown in fig 14 with a distribution of errors adding a small second peak of simulated values exceeding observations of more than 0 5 m fig 15 displays the temporal evolution of the subsurface heads at the same 4 locations as that presented for the calibration step the model does not reproduce the head histories as well this feature could be related to the fact that the injection composed of 3 successive peaks of discharge in the system during the forecast period is more complicated than during the calibration period nonetheless the overall trends the amplitudes and time phasing of subsurface head peaks are fairly well captured in general subsurface heads and water depths in channels simulated with the coupled model illustrate that the injections designed to restore hydroecological processes on rohrschollen island are effective especially along the new channel and the bgw as they strongly enhance surface subsurface interactions and rapidly impact water storage in both the surface and subsurface domains these stimulations of the water dynamics of the island are expected to influence biogeochemical cycles and finally restore an ecological functioning close to that established before the canalization works that modified drastically the fluvial hydrosystem the coupled model that we employ appears to be a suitable tool to model small to mid scale hydrological systems even if their structure and their dynamics are complex showing high heterogeneity and very transient responses to forcing constraints 5 conclusions most integrated hydrological models of the literature rely on numerically solving the 3 d richards equation to describe flow processes in the subsurface the resolution of this equation often implies the use of a fine vertical discretization needed to properly capture the vadose zone flow processes the multiplication of layers in the modeled domain produces large meshes and numerical systems that are difficult to handle and solve without important computational resources although high performance computational methods are being implemented into richards based integrated models to reduce the computational cost application to an actual complex system can still be plagued by important computational times especially when model inversion is envisioned in a stochastic framework duplicating solutions for the purpose of identifying model output and model parameter uncertainties low dimensional integrated hydrological models in the sense of models that couple surface and subsurface processes but use parsimonious approaches through reduced dimensionality can become relevant alternatives even though the concept of parsimony is appealing few integrated hydrological models of that kind have been developed and tested on their ability to mimic actual complex hydrosystems in applying a low dimensional coupled model including 2 d overland and 2 d subsurface flow to the fluvial hydrosystem of rohrschollen island we show that a reduction of dimensionality does not go with spurious simulations even though the modeled system is heterogeneous and very reactive regarding its hydrodynamic behavior in general the features of flow are well captured in their space and time variations and for all the compartments of the hydrosystem it is worth noting that other applications were carried out with the low dimensional model on geometries including steep slope bedrocks e g the strengbach catchment in pan et al 2015 the results show that the low dimensional model correctly describes complex hydrological processes in the case of non flat bedrocks beneath watersheds it is also of importance to mention that integrated hydrological models are often involved in mass transport problems to cope with water quality issues transport with nim has not yet been addressed the low dimensional model employed in this study has been calculated on a classical laptop using sequential programming and it returns the complete simulation of the rohrschollen system in approximately 8 h of calculation knowing that the system is very transient especially for its surface compartment and requiring time steps on the order of the minute the calculation time appears reasonable for modeling the functioning of the actual system over a period of a week in this specific case the low dimensional model reveals tools suited to forecast the influence of forcing constraints conducive to the hydroecological restoration of a relative small fluvial hydrosystem there exist other applications dedicated to small to mid scale watersheds that do not require very short time steps over long periods of time there is no reason for the low dimensional model to fail in simulating the hydraulic behavior of these systems as practitioners or institutions in charge of water management who in general do not have access to high performance computing may need handy tools integrated hydrological models with reduced dimensionality become a serious option for practical applications in this study neither hydrometeorological conditioning nor mass transfer in watersheds was addressed in the case of rohrschollen island and for the simulation period discussed it is likely that accounting for hydrometeorological forcing would not have changed the results the hydrological context is fully under the control of water levels in the river and flooding associated with water injections in the main channel of the island that being said it is well known that meteorological forcing especially on small watersheds can be at the origin of most of the dynamics of water fluxes as the low dimensional integrated model proposed does not denature the physics of flow in its time behavior and spatial structure coupling with a land surface model might reveal an interesting evolution regarding mass transfers the low dimensionality is also a synonym for the loss of precision in fluid velocity fields that convey conservative and reactive solutes this is especially the case for the subsurface compartment where the two dimensional simplification neglects the vertical components of flow to formulate relevant mass transfer problems further investigations should delineate in which hydrodynamic conditions and for which variables characterizing the mass transfer e g local concentrations and various spatial or temporal moments of the solute plume the reduction of dimensionality does not prohibit success acknowledgements the monitoring of rohrschollen

7154,reservoir operations are increasingly being asked to consider environmental flow which is needed to sustain a healthy river ecosystem the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha is a tool that is used widely to describe environmental flow regimes but few studies have explicitly included its parameters in multi objective reservoir operation models with the goal of incorporating detailed environmental flow requirements into reservoir operations this study proposes a two objective reservoir operation model that includes explicit iha constraints a series of formulae is developed to calculate iha parameters without using a loop or conditional statement which allows operators to manage environmental flow directly an experimental operation of the jinghong reservoir in the upstream portion of the mekong basin is conducted to apply the method the economic objective is defined by hydropower production hp while the environmental flow objective is represented by a weighted aggregate eco index ei based on iha parameters five scenarios with different objective functions and constraints are compared and the results show that the scenario with hp ei as its objective achieved optimal benefits for both indices hard ei and explicit iha constraints led to significant loss of hp that can be attributed to variations of inflow to make this model more convenient for practical use operation rule curves are regressed from the optimized results of the model finally policy implications of the operation with economic and environmental objectives and some limitations are discussed the quantification method of iha parameters provides significant reference value for reservoir environmental operation issues keywords iha environmental flow quantification method operation rules mekong river basin 1 introduction reservoirs especially those with large storage capacities have the flexibility to regulate water in space and time tilmant and muyunda 2010 they serve a wide variety of purposes such as hydropower production flood control water supply recreation and meeting environmental demands many studies have explored the effects of reservoir operation considering ecological objectives harman and stewardson 2005 suen and eheart 2006 tilmant and muyunda 2010 yang and cai 2010 in each of these studies environmental flow plays a significant role generally there are three methods for obtaining environmental flow 1 estimate flow requirements to restore or maintain fish habitat 2 mimic the natural flow regime and 3 determine a suitable flow regime based on existing data on aquatic organisms jager and smith 2008 however conflicts often exist between ecological and other objectives in reservoir operation for example hydropower production is determined by the water level difference between upstream and downstream i e water head when environmental flow is not included the best way to maximize hydropower output is to impound as much water as possible and then release it with a high water head zhao et al 2015 however this hydropower oriented operation would change the downstream flow regime overwhelmingly thus causing detrimental effects acreman and dunbar 2004 many studies have examined the balance between ecological objectives and economic objectives for instance cardwell et al 1996 introduced monthly minimum flow scenarios to explore the trade offs between fish population capacity and water shortage levels shiau and wu 2004 focused on the trade offs between changes in hydrological indicators and human water needs and connected flow variability to natural stream biota the two major methods for solving a multi objective model are the weighted sum method and taking one objective as a single objective while treating the others as constraints wang et al 2015 optimization models are often used to explore pareto optimal solutions yeh 1985 labadie et al 2004 zhao and zhao 2014 operation rules or rule curves which are commonly employed by operators in practice can be derived based on the results of these optimization models huang and yang 1999 tu and yeh 2003 wan et al 2016 for both optimization models and rule curves recreating the natural flow regime is a promising and effective way to meet ecological objectives poff et al 1997 richter et al 1996 the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha richter et al 1996 1997 is a popular tool for capturing the majority of the natural flow regime iha consists of a suite of 33 hydrologic parameters including magnitude duration time timing of extreme flow and frequency that can be used to analyze flow regimes however the complexities of these 33 parameters make it difficult to apply them explicitly to objective or constraint equations when establishing an optimization model therefore the iha parameters are generally used to evaluate the resulting water release and then produce statistics and a set of operation rules harman and stewardson 2005 hughes et al 1997 another method is to find intermediate variables to represent iha parameters and use these in reservoir optimization models the weakness in these two methods however is that operators cannot directly apply iha parameters to guide practice recently wang et al 2015 introduced a mixed linear programming model to constrain some of the iha parameters e g monthly flows and magnitude of extreme flow thus demonstrating a new approach applying iha to reservoir operation nonetheless many iha parameters still cannot be considered explicitly in the objectives or constraints in an optimization model due to difficulties in formulating them quantitatively these facts make it difficult for operators to manage environmental flow directly according to iha parameters this study aims to address the problem by quantitatively formulating all 33 hydrologic parameters of iha into the objectives or constraints of a reservoir operation optimization model while making practical operation rules for environmental flow release this study has two related major objectives a explicitly quantify iha parameters that provide a mathematical basis for environmental flow operation issues b develop an optimization model for hydropower production and environmental flow operation based on all 33 iha parameters and then derive simplified operational rule curves that incorporate environmental flow release based on the optimization model 2 two objective reservoir operation model considering environmental flow 2 1 model framework the framework for the two objective reservoir operation model considering environmental flow presented in fig 1 includes the following steps 1 generate synthetic daily inflows 2 set up the optimization model with appropriate objectives and constraints 3 generate daily release using the optimization model and 4 derive operation rule curves with a focus on the trade off between hydropower operation and environmental flow a schematic sketch of the alteration of streamflow due to reservoir operation is shown in fig 2 water release from the reservoir can be divided conceptually into two parts fig 2 a i e beneficial water release for uses such as hydropower generation and water spill both of these parts are released downstream because water withdrawal for municipal industrial or agriculture use and water diversion are not considered in this model the total volume of water does not change after reservoir operation compared with natural streamflow the downstream flow regime after reservoir operation may be changed substantially leading to ecological alteration fig 2 b to reflect the effect of inter annual climate variability on the robustness of the streamflow series synthetic monthly inflows were first generated for 100 years and then downscaled to daily scale the economic and ecological objectives considered in the model are hydropower production hp defined as the annual output of hydroelectric energy and the eco index ei defined as a weighted average value of the key parameters selected from the 33 iha parameters the principal component analysis pca method was used to select the key iha parameters gao et al 2012 five scenarios were designed to demonstrate the trade offs between the economic and ecological objectives the optimization model was written in gams 23 3 finally reservoir operation rule curves were derived by analyzing the obtained optimal release patterns 2 2 synthetic daily reservoir inflows the time interval used to calculate reservoir operations affects the accuracy of the objectives especially those related to ecology conventional operations use mostly one month or ten day intervals bednarek and hart 2005 cardwell et al 1996 sale et al 1982 suen et al 2009 but these are too coarse to represent environmental characteristics a daily interval is essential for studies that consider ecological demand because iha parameters must be calculated using daily scale data this paper employs a robust simple and parsimonious approach for space time streamflow disaggregation that can capture the features of historical data prairie et al 2007 zhao et al 2013 the markov model is recognized as a good tool for simulating stochastic hydrological processes thomas and fiering 1962 the linear stationary autoregressive or markov model can simulate stationarytimeseries at an annual scale which means that reservoir inflows can be described by a time invariant probability density function monthly streamflow changes periodically within a year thus a periodic autoregressive markov model can be used to generate monthly streamflow assuming that the monthly streamflow satisfies the first order markov process and fits a pearson type iii frequency distribution p iii we obtained the following equation 1 x i j x j b j x i j 1 x j f i j s j 1 r j 2 where x i j is the simulated streamflow in the jth month of the ith year x j is the mean streamflow value of the jth month in the observed series b j is the regression coefficient of the jth month in the observed series f i j is the standardized p iii coefficient generated from a pseudo random number 0 1 s j is the mean squared deviation of the jth month in the observed series and r j 2 is the correlation coefficient of the jth month and j 1th month in the observed series generated monthly inflows were then disaggregated to daily reservoir inflows based on a non parametric approach prairie et al 2007 tarboton et al 1998 wang et al 2013 the disaggregated daily flow was resampled from the fitted historical monthly nearest neighbor flow data using the nearest neighbor bootstrap method k nn k nearest neighbors were computed using the euclidean distance between simulated monthly flow and fitted historical monthly flow the neighbor of the ith year was weighted as follows 2 w i 1 i i 1 k 1 i where k number of sample data points the nearest neighbor the kth month in the historical series has the euclidean distance with the lowest weight 2 3 objectives functions of optimization model the primary economic objective was set as the benefit of hydropower generation defined as follows 3 hp η g i 1 365 rg i h up i h down i where hp is total hydropower production η is the coefficient of efficiency rg i is the water release for hydropower generation on the ith day g is gravitational acceleration h up i is the average reservoir water level on the ith day and h down i is the downstream tailwater level of the hydropower plant incorporating ecological objectives into reservoir operation has been the goal of many studies jager and smith 2008 and the iha metrics are among the most popular tools used to set up an ecological objective function the pca method was employed to derive a subset of indicators from the 33 iha parameters gao et al 2009 olden and poff 2003 pca is a statistical method for deriving a subset as representatives of the overall characteristics of a group of indices the variables chosen by pca contain all the available information in the larger group see jackson 1993 for more details the ei was represented by the weighted mean value of the changing ratio of the chosen parameters as follows 4 ei p 1 p w p a r p a n p a n p where p is the total number of parameters or principal components pcs chosen from the iha w p is the weight of the pth parameter depending on the contribution rate of the pth pc a r p is the value of the pth parameter after reservoir operation regulated and a n p is the value of pth parameter under natural conditions unregulated the smaller the ei the less the natural flow regime is changed by reservoir operation 2 4 water balance constraints three constraints related to reservoir water balance are given as follows 5 i i s i 1 rg i ro i s i 6 h up i a s i 1 s i 2 b c 7 s min s i s max where i i is the net inflow to the reservoir on day i s i and s i 1 are the volumes of ending water storage on day i and day i 1 respectively ro i is spill water released on the ith day a b and c are parameters of the reservoir water level storage curve s max is the maximum water storage m3 and s min is the dead storage m3 eqs 5 7 represent the water balance constraint water stage storage curve and water storage boundaries respectively 2 5 hydropower station output constraint the hydropower station output constraint is defined as 8 go i η grg i h up i h down i ic i where go i is the guaranteed output kw and ic i is the installed capacity kw 2 6 water discharge constraint the water discharge constraint can be written as 9 rl i rg i ro i ru i where rl i and ru i are the lower and upper limits of the water discharge during time period i respectively the lower limit rl i is always set to satisfy the basic downstream ecology and navigation water needs the upper limit ru i is the maximum allowable discharge of a reservoir e g flood control consideration 2 7 ramp constraint the difference in water released between two consecutive days should not be too large otherwise the abrupt change could damage the hydraulic turbine yang and cai 2010 thus the ramp constraint is calculated as follows 10 rg i ro i rg i 1 ro i 1 q th where rg i and ro i represent the same variables as in eqs 3 and 5 and q th is the threshold flow rate of the ramp constraint 3 explicit quantification of iha parameters the iha contains 33 hydrologic parameters that can generally be categorized into six groups 1 magnitude of monthly flows 2 magnitude and duration of annual extreme flows 3 timing of annual extreme flows 4 frequency and duration of high and low pulses 5 rate and frequency of flow changes and 6 zero flow events table 1 richter et al 1996 the explicit quantifications of the 33 iha parameters are formulated individually in this section 3 1 magnitude of monthly flows the mean monthly flows denoted a 1 to a 12 can be represented by eq 11 11 a k i 1 j k rg i ro i j k k 1 2 12 where a k is monthly mean flow in the kth month and j k is the total number of days in the kth month 3 2 magnitude and duration of annual extreme flows there are 11 parameters in this group parameters a 13 to a 17 represent maximum flow events i e 1 day 3 day 7 day 30 day and 90 day maximums respectively and parameters a 18 to a 22 represent minimum flow events i e 1 day 3 day 7 day 30 day and 90 day minimums respectively the base flow index a 23 is calculated using the ratio of 7 day minimum flow to annual mean flow eqs 12 and 13 show the formulations of the 1 day maximum a 13 and eqs 14 and 15 show the formulations of the 1 day minimum a 18 12 a 13 rg i ro i i 1 2 365 13 i 1 365 a 13 rg i ro i 0 14 a 18 rg i ro i i 1 2 365 15 i 1 365 a 18 rg i ro i 0 eqs 13 and 15 are true only when a 13 and a 18 equal the 1 day maximum and minimum flows respectively considering the similarity the mathematical formulations of the 3 day maximum a 14 and minimum a 19 can be deduced as follows 16 temp 3 m i m m 2 rg i ro i m 1 2 363 17 a 14 temp 3 m m 1 2 363 18 i 1 363 a 13 temp 3 m 0 19 a 19 temp 3 m m 1 2 363 20 i 1 363 a 19 temp 3 m 0 the base flow index a 23 can be represented as follows 21 a 23 a 20 i 1 365 inflow 365 where a 20 is the 7 day minimum flow and the denominator is the annual mean flow 3 3 timing of annual extreme flows two parameters are included in this group a 24 the date on which the maximum flow occurred and a 25 the date on which the minimum occurred constraints for a 24 and a 25 follow 22 maxdate temp i rg i ro i a 13 rg i ro i a 13 c 1 i i 1 2 365 23 a 24 i 1 365 i i 1 365 maxdate temp i 24 mindate temp i rg i ro i a 18 rg i ro i a 18 c 1 i i 1 2 365 25 a 25 i 1 365 i i 1 365 mindate temp i where c 1 is a very small number e g 10 4 that guarantees the denominator not equal zero as eq 22 shows the value of maxdate temp i is zero only when the ith day is the date on which the maximum flow occurred otherwise it is equal to i under such conditions a 24 is the date on which the maximum flow occurred the constraints for the date of minimum flow occurrence a 25 are similar 3 4 frequency and duration of high and low pulses high and low pulses are defined as the periods within a year during which daily flow levels exceed the 75th percentile high pulse or drop below the 25th percentile low pulse of the historical series as shown in fig 3 a the high pulse count a 26 is the number of events at which release flow exceeds the 75th percentile there are two such values the high pulse duration a 27 indicates the average number of high pulse event days the total number of high pulse event days divided by the high pulse count using fig 3 a as an example if the flow exceeds the 75th percentile for 60 days then the high pulse duration a 27 should be 60 2 30 the low pulse count a 28 and low pulse duration a 29 can be formulated in similar ways eqs 26 33 represent the constraints for these four parameters 26 d high i 0 5 rg i ro i threshold 75 rg i ro i threshold 75 1 i 1 2 365 27 x high i d high i d high i 1 i 2 3 365 28 a 26 d high 1 d high 365 i 2 365 x high i 2 29 a 27 i 1 365 d high i a 26 30 d low i 0 5 threshold 25 rg i ro i threshold 25 rg i ro i 1 i 1 2 365 31 x low i d low i d low i 1 i 2 3 365 32 a 28 d low 1 d low 365 i 2 365 x low i 2 33 a 29 i 1 365 d low i a 28 threshold 75 is the value of the streamflow at the 75th percentile on the natural flow duration curve threshold 25 represents the 25th percentile of the same and d high i d low i x high i and x low i are intermediate variables take the high pulse as an example if the release flow rg ro on the ith day exceeds the 75th percentile of the historical series threshold 75 the d high i should equal 0 5 1 1 1 otherwise it equals 0 5 1 1 0 x high i is the difference in d high i between two consecutive days because d high i is 0 or 1 the value of x high i should be one of 1 1 0 as shown in fig 3 b four lines represent four possible instances of pulse count in which the flow exceeds threshold 75 two times in a year the higher line represents the d high i value of 1 and the lower line represents the d high i value of 0 therefore each downward or upward sloping line represents x high i values of 1 or 1 respectively according to eq 27 in the four instances the corresponding array d high 1 d high 365 x high i equals 1 1 2 0 1 3 1 0 3 and 0 0 4 respectively the sum of the three variables should be twice the pulse counts thus eqs 28 and 29 stand 3 5 rate and frequency of flow changes this group includes the rise rate a 30 fall rate a 31 and number of reversals a 32 the rates and frequencies of flow changes are represented by flow reversal in ascending or descending order 34 ds i rg i ro i rg i 1 ro i 1 rg i ro i rg i 1 ro i 1 c 2 i 2 3 365 35 rise num 0 5 i 1 364 ds i i 1 364 ds i 36 fall num 0 5 i 1 364 ds i i 1 364 ds i 37 a 30 i 2 365 ds i 1 2 rg i ro i rg i 1 ro i 1 rise num 38 a 31 i 2 365 ds i 1 2 rg i ro i rg i 1 ro i 1 fall num 39 a 32 0 5 i 2 364 ds i ds i 1 where c 2 is a very small number e g 10 4 ds i is an indicator variable and rise num and fall num represent the number of consecutive days on which flows increase or decrease respectively in eq 34 if the release flow on the ith day is higher than that on the i 1th day the value of ds i equals 1 if it is lower ds i equals 1 and if the release flow on the ith and i 1th day are the same ds i equals 0 the numerators in eqs 37 and 38 represent the rise rate and the fall rate respectively eq 39 indicates the number of reversals in either ascending or descending order 3 6 zero flow events the number of zero flow days a 33 is the only parameter in this group it can be easily represented by eq 40 40 a 33 365 i 1 365 rg i ro i rg i ro i c 3 where c 3 is a very small number e g 10 4 all of the 33 iha parameters are represented explicitly by constraint equations without conditional or loop statements using eqs 11 40 it is difficult to apply all constraints in a reservoir optimization model but these formulae can be used directly when the key parameters of the iha are chosen according to operation requirements 4 case study the jinghong reservoir located on the lancang river is used as a case study to demonstrate the optimization model as shown in fig 4 there are six reservoirs on this river and the jinghong reservoir is the farthest downstream the primary objective of the jinghong reservoir is hydropower generation the total installed capacity is 1750 mw and the designed annual capacity is 7800 million kw h the reservoir releases water to the lower mekong basin lmb and began operation in the second half of 2009 the daily flow time series data used in this study were obtained from the mekong river commission http portal mrcmekong org index the daily flow data from 1960 to 1991 at chiang saen station nearest downstream gauge station to jinghong reservoir located in thailand were selected to test the optimization model there is no large intermediate inflow between the gauge station and the reservoir thus the gauge station was used to represent the hydrological conditions of the upstream jinghong reservoir historical natural daily inflow data from 1960 to 1991 were used to generate synthetic daily reservoir inflows the statistical characteristics of the synthetic streamflow series were compared with the historical flow series the pca method was used to select key parameters from the iha for this basin five scenarios were set up for analysis for each scenario the optimization model was run 132 times representing years 32 for the historical series and 100 for the synthetic series the trade offs between hydropower production and the eco index were examined and the impact of the weight coefficients was then analyzed 4 1 generation and validation of synthetic streamflow eq 1 was used to generate synthetic monthly inflow data and historical daily data from 1960 to 1991 were used to generate monthly inflow over 100 years table 2 shows the coefficients of skewness cs deviation cv and correlation between two consecutive months r 2 the regression b as well as the mean square deviation s and mean monthly flow x the mean minimum and maximum values of the observed and simulated streamflow are shown in fig 5 the r 2 value of the simulated and observed flows is 0 907 implying that the synthetic streamflow generated is acceptable hydrological uncertainty could be considered fully by analyzing the operation results of the synthetic daily flows of the 100 years 4 2 representation and weight coefficient of the eco index ei the pca method was used to identify representative indicators for operational purposes and the results are shown in table 3 five parameters were chosen according to the kaiser guttman criterion guttman et al 1954 90 day maximum a 17 low pulse duration a 29 high pulse duration a 27 number of fluctuations a 32 and date of maximum a 24 the ei weight coefficients w p in eq 4 were set based on the contribution rate of each pc they were 0 764 0 084 0 063 0 050 and 0 039 respectively the results show that the 90 day maximum flow was the most significant ecological parameter in this basin explaining 67 of the variation it is worth noting that the first five pcs explained 87 69 of the variation 4 3 scenario setting the emphasis of this paper is not on the economic goals of reservoir operations i e power generation irrigation water supply etc but on adding the environmental flow operation into reservoir operation to balance the economic benefits and ecological effects this study analyzed the five scenarios shown in table 4 the goals of scenarios a and b were to obtain the upper and lower boundaries of the two objectives taking hp and ei as single objective respectively in scenario c hp and ei were combined with the weight coefficient λ scenarios d and e applied different environmental constraints with the single objective of maximizing hp ei was the constraint in the former and the five selected iha parameters were the constraints in the latter the optimization model was written in gams and nonlinear programming nlp in gams was used to solve the model following drud 1994 and devamane et al 2006 with a relevant but small computational task 365 days and 1 reservoir only this model was simple and did not suffer from the dimensionality issue although many advanced algorithms such as the genetic algorithm wardlaw and sharif 1999 progressive optimality algorithm cheng et al 2017 hybrid search algorithm sun et al 2017 and orthogonal dimension reduction search algorithm feng et al 2017 can be used to solve multi objective problems traditional non linear algorithm nlp is sufficient to solve this model if the proposed model is applied to a more complicated system advanced algorithms can be employed 4 4 upper and lower boundaries of the hydropower and ecological indices scenarios a and b were single objective optimization problems without environmental flow constraints fig 6 shows the relationship between ei and hp in these two scenarios the filled symbols and hollow symbols had similar distribution characteristics suggesting that the synthetic flow data captured the characteristics of the natural flow in these cases in scenario a which aimed to maximize hydropower output the value of hp ranges from 258 107 kw h to 342 107 kw h with an average of 311 107 kw h ei has a wide range from 0 133 to 0 707 with an average of 0 36 and is distributed between 0 25 and 0 5 in most years 74 of 132 fig 7 shows the relationship between hp ei and average annual streamflow in scenario a it shows a clear linear correlation between hp and average annual streamflow especially when the latter is low the correlation coefficient r 2 value is 0 73 in total and 0 93 when the average annual streamflow is lower than 2200 m3 s the linearcorrelation between the two parameters suddenly becomes weak when average annual streamflow exceeds 2200 m3 s the r 2 value falls to only 0 05 this implies that hydropower generation is constrained by streamflow in water shortage conditions even without environmental flow considerations in scenario b which aimed to minimize ei the value of hp ranges from 45 107 kw h to 333 107 kw h the highest hp value 333 107 kw h is an outlier fig 6 in this scenario the highest and average hp values are 258 107 kw h and 130 107 kw h respectively which are much lower than the values in scenario a as shown in fig 6 the ei ranges from 0 02 to 0 38 with an average of 0 15 and most of them lie between 0 1 and 0 3 124 of 132 years 4 5 combining hydropower and ecological objectives the hydropower and ecological objectives were combined in scenario c table 4 in which the iha parameters were explicitly considered as part of the objectives hp max the maximum value of hydropower output is 343 kw h in this scenario this is the value used to nondimensionalize hp a normal flow year the year 1979 was used to analyze the effects of weight coefficients varying from 0 to 1 in increments of 0 1 the results are shown in fig 8 a when λ is 0 the optimal model is the same as in scenario b when the value of λ increases the hp value also increases slowly until λ 0 6 when λ increases from 0 6 to 0 7 hp almost doubles from 154 107 kw h to 293 107 kw h before decreasing again when λ reaches 1 the optimal model becomes the same as that in scenario a the change of 90 day maximum contributes the most for ei 76 a smaller λ means that more water will be released from the reservoir in the wet season which is a condition close to the natural flow regime in this case the value of hp cannot be guaranteed because less water will be carried over to the next dry season when λ increases to 0 6 0 7 the consideration on ei becomes less important thus the reservoir can store more water in the wet season for hydropower generation in the dry season fig 8 a demonstrates the trade offs between hp and ei and it clearly indicates that λ 0 6 0 7 is a sensitive range for both objectives in the following simulations λ is set to 0 7 balancing the two objectives with a relatively high hp and relatively low ei value as shown in fig 8 a the optimal results from scenario c are compared with those from scenarios a and b in fig 8 b the hp values in scenario c are very close to those from scenario a ranging from 249 kw h to 329 kw h while the ei values in scenario c are close to those from scenario b ranging from 0 08 to 0 29 with 98 2 of the values ranging from 0 1 to 0 3 this implies that when both of the objectives are considered simultaneously the optimal operation policy tends to maintain the key indicators of environmental flow at a good level without excessively compromising the amount of hydropower production 4 6 maximizing hydropower output with ecological constraints scenarios d and e were designed to analyze the impacts of different ecological constraints on hp in scenario d an upper bound n shown in table 4 was set for the ei value based on the results from scenarios a and b values of 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 were set for this variable the results show that ei is considered as an inequality constraint all of the optimal ei results always equal the upper bound of n fig 9 however as n decreased fewer feasible solutions were obtained and the hp value also decreased when n was set to 0 2 feasible solutions were obtained in 82 of 132 years when n was set to 0 1 the number of feasible solutions decreased to 51 this went down further to only 13 of 132 when n was set to 0 05 no feasible solutions were obtained when n was reduced to 0 02 in scenario d the ei value was fixed but the hp value changed dramatically in different years the latter ranged widely from 100 107 kw h to 243 107 kw h when n was set to 0 2 this was directly related to the uncertainty of inflow the results imply that the value of hp would not be guaranteed within an acceptable range if ei is set as a hard constraint this can be attributed to the effects of inflow variation scenario e constrained the iha parameters for this study the five iha parameters 90 day maximum a 17 low pulse duration a 29 high pulse duration a 27 number of fluctuations a 32 and date of maximum a 24 were selected using the pca method and constrained within certain ranges as specified in eqs 41 45 41 80 a n 17 a 17 120 a n 17 42 90 a n 24 a 24 110 a n 24 43 70 a n 27 a 27 130 a n 27 44 70 a n 29 a 29 130 a n 29 45 70 a n 32 a 32 130 a n 32 the results show that hp ranged from 147 kw h to 305 kw h while ei ranged from 0 1 to 0 22 the hp value was significantly lower in scenario e than in scenario c indicating that the explicit constraints of the iha parameters impose stricter limitations on environmental flow release and lead to greater losses in hydropower generation fig 10 compared to scenario d the ei value in scenario e fluctuated within a certain range but the hp value was higher implying that the latter is more flexible than the former meanwhile scenario e was significant to show that reservoir operators can explicitly control the range of the selected iha parameters according to management requirements when the former are of particular interest the results from the optimization model demonstrate that the iha parameters can be applied as objectives or constraints to guide environmental flow release the comparison of the five scenarios shows that applying the iha parameters in the optimization model in different ways can lead to different results it is clear that scenario c best balanced hp and ei objectives and adapted to variations in inflow 5 discussion 5 1 deriving reservoir operation rules based on environmental flow parameters in practice reservoir operators always prefer simple reservoir operation rule curves that include environmental flow release operations we derived operation rule curves based on scenario c which consider the iha parameters as objectives assuming that the daily water release is based on 1 the inflow of a particular day 2 the release flow of the previous day and 3 the water storage at the end of the previous day as in eq 46 environmental flow operation needs to elaborate time intervals traditional two season clarification i e wet season and dry season can hardly capture the flow regime of an integrated year thus a shorter time scale is needed for environmental operation poff et al 1997 one year was divided into the following four periods based on the streamflow characteristics period 1 dry period january to may period 2 growing period june to august period 3 flood period september to october and period 4 decaying period november to december all parameters were regressed by the results derived from scenario c as shown in table 5 the annual water levels based on this scenario are shown in fig 11 a the lower and upper regulation lines were then regressed dividing the operation chart into areas of reduced output guaranteed output and enlarged output respectively when the water level was lower or higher than the regulation line the minimum or maximum water release constraint was enforced 46 r i a m i i b m s i 1 c m r i 1 d m where r i is the water released on the ith day i i is inflow on the ith day s i 1 is water storage on the i 1th day and a m b m c m and d m are four parameters in period m to demonstrate the effects of the regressed rule curves in different cases the years 1979 1987 and 1982 were chosen to represent normal dry and wet years respectively the results of the regression are shown in table 6 fig 11 b d compare and demonstrate the natural inflow q0 the release flow considering only hp q1 generated from scenario a considering hp and ei q2 generated from scenario c and based on operation rules q3 and the water level considering hp only s1 generated from scenario a considering hp and ei s2 generated from scenario c and based on operation rules s3 the release flow considering only hp q1 changed significantly compared to the natural flow q0 especially in the dry period the water levels s1 show relatively large fluctuations while the release flow based on operation rules q3 shows a trend similar to natural flow q0 and the water level s3 fluctuates only gently the results verify the effectiveness of the derived rule curve the rule curves derived from the optimization model are simple and easy to be applied into practice similar methods can also be applied to longer time scales e g ten day or one month intervals the short term inflow forecast is essential and the period division should be properly based on streamflow characteristics it is not conducive to reservoir operation to divide the period too roughly or too finely to compare the optimization model based release flow with the actual historical release flow the year 2013 was chosen as a case fig 12 in 2013 five upstream reservoirs had been constructed including the jinghong reservoir the actual historical release flow showed obvious changes compared with the natural flow i e releasing more water in the dry season and less in the wet season the hp and ei obtained by the actual historical release flow are 258 107 kw h and 0 513 respectively correspondingly the hp and ei generated by the operation rules are 246 107 kw h and 0 144 respectively which obtains a high ecological return with a small hydropower cost 5 2 policy implications of environmental flow management in mekong river

pulse regime the key indicator of iha and driver for the ecological productivity of the mekong river holtgrieve et al 2013 the mekong river commission s mrc s environment program offers an inter governmental cooperation platform to maintain a balance between economic development and environmental protection however the reservoirs in lmb were mostly constructed by private companies using loans from private banks with little consideration for the environmental flow regimes horne et al 2017 more importantly the dams along the main river were mostly constructed by china which did not participate in the mrc thus very few environmental flow assessments had been conducted in this region a new organization called the lancang mekong cooperation mechanism lmc which consists of all six countries in the mrb was established in 2016 to date the mrc and lmc are the two main inter governmental cooperation organizations in this region due to the increased attention paid to environmental flows by the countries along the mekong river and the developed regional cooperation mechanism environmental flow management became more possible than ever before on march 15 and april 10 of 2016 because of the extreme drought event in the mekong delta in vietnam the chinese government released more than 26 billion m3 of stored water from the upstream jinghong reservoir to the downstream mekong delta for agriculture and ecosystem demands mrc 2016 as a successful case of regional cooperation this event demonstrated an implementation of the win win policy for transboundary river basin management for long term cooperation it is crucial to understand the trade offs between hydropower and environmental flow and thus implement a balanced operation policy with the technical support from the proposed reservoir operation model and rule curves future cooperation among mekong countries will offer more opportunities for multi objective reservoir operation in which environmental flow release will play a progressively more important role 5 3 limitations of the model and case this paper developed a method for calculating iha indicators without a loop or conditional statement that has potential for further use in environmental flow studies however some limitations of the method and case still exist focusing on the trade off between hydropower and environmental flow this paper does not consider the effects of water withdrawal water quality or sediment changes induced by dam construction and operation which can be considered in future work there has been increasing concern recently about the ecological impacts of reservoirs including the impoundment of free flowing river habitat blockage of fish migration routes and reduced downstream water quality acreman and dunbar 2004 which are also worthy of study in the future an actual hydropower reservoir operation system contains not only the basic constraints of water balance and power plant output but also specific constraints such as diameter of water transmission installations and operation decision variables including output volume of the reservoir at each time step haddad et al 2014 reservoir systems considering more sophisticated constraints should be studied further nlp algorithms are widely applied however the nonlinear programming methods have the limitation of slow rate of convergence requiring large amounts of computational storage and time compared with other methods yeh 1985 application of the proposed model in a more complex reservoir system may require more advanced algorithms 6 conclusions in this study iha parameters were employed to quantify ecological alterations in reservoir operation we explicitly expressed the 33 hydrologic parameters of iha using mathematical formulations in a nonlinear manner an optimization model that considered the conflicting objectives of hydropower output and ecological benefit both on a daily scale was derived and applied to the jinghong reservoir in the mekong river basin the eco index ei a weighted average of five of the 33 iha parameters chosen by the principal component analysis method was defined to represent the ecological objective five different scenarios were planned to explore the trade off between hydropower hp and ei and based on this work an operation rule chart was developed for practical use the results of the five scenarios show that scenarios a and b can determine a rough range of trade offs a strong linear correlation exists between the hp and average annual streamflow especially when the latter is low in the scenarios aimed at maximizing hydropower output scenarios a d and e only the results from scenario c maintained the environmental flow indicators at a high level without sacrificing too much hydropower the weighted coefficient λ becomes a turning point at the value of 0 7 when λ is lower than 0 7 both hp and ei decrease dramatically scenarios d and e employed hard iha constraints in the optimization model resulting in a loss of hydropower attributable to the effects of variations in inflow a comparison shows that scenario e is more flexible than scenario d for both hp and ei the importance of explicit iha constraints is that operators can control the range of these parameters according to specific management requirements simplified operation rules which take hydropower generation and environmental flow into consideration were then regressed according to the optimal release flow derived from scenario c in this case cooperation among the countries is an important prerequisite for the implementation of environmental flow policies the proposed method can be used in practical operations and extended to any basin or reservoir although different key parameters and trade off combinations may occur in different basins this study was carried out in a single reservoir so application in multi reservoir systems requires further research

7154,reservoir operations are increasingly being asked to consider environmental flow which is needed to sustain a healthy river ecosystem the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha is a tool that is used widely to describe environmental flow regimes but few studies have explicitly included its parameters in multi objective reservoir operation models with the goal of incorporating detailed environmental flow requirements into reservoir operations this study proposes a two objective reservoir operation model that includes explicit iha constraints a series of formulae is developed to calculate iha parameters without using a loop or conditional statement which allows operators to manage environmental flow directly an experimental operation of the jinghong reservoir in the upstream portion of the mekong basin is conducted to apply the method the economic objective is defined by hydropower production hp while the environmental flow objective is represented by a weighted aggregate eco index ei based on iha parameters five scenarios with different objective functions and constraints are compared and the results show that the scenario with hp ei as its objective achieved optimal benefits for both indices hard ei and explicit iha constraints led to significant loss of hp that can be attributed to variations of inflow to make this model more convenient for practical use operation rule curves are regressed from the optimized results of the model finally policy implications of the operation with economic and environmental objectives and some limitations are discussed the quantification method of iha parameters provides significant reference value for reservoir environmental operation issues keywords iha environmental flow quantification method operation rules mekong river basin 1 introduction reservoirs especially those with large storage capacities have the flexibility to regulate water in space and time tilmant and muyunda 2010 they serve a wide variety of purposes such as hydropower production flood control water supply recreation and meeting environmental demands many studies have explored the effects of reservoir operation considering ecological objectives harman and stewardson 2005 suen and eheart 2006 tilmant and muyunda 2010 yang and cai 2010 in each of these studies environmental flow plays a significant role generally there are three methods for obtaining environmental flow 1 estimate flow requirements to restore or maintain fish habitat 2 mimic the natural flow regime and 3 determine a suitable flow regime based on existing data on aquatic organisms jager and smith 2008 however conflicts often exist between ecological and other objectives in reservoir operation for example hydropower production is determined by the water level difference between upstream and downstream i e water head when environmental flow is not included the best way to maximize hydropower output is to impound as much water as possible and then release it with a high water head zhao et al 2015 however this hydropower oriented operation would change the downstream flow regime overwhelmingly thus causing detrimental effects acreman and dunbar 2004 many studies have examined the balance between ecological objectives and economic objectives for instance cardwell et al 1996 introduced monthly minimum flow scenarios to explore the trade offs between fish population capacity and water shortage levels shiau and wu 2004 focused on the trade offs between changes in hydrological indicators and human water needs and connected flow variability to natural stream biota the two major methods for solving a multi objective model are the weighted sum method and taking one objective as a single objective while treating the others as constraints wang et al 2015 optimization models are often used to explore pareto optimal solutions yeh 1985 labadie et al 2004 zhao and zhao 2014 operation rules or rule curves which are commonly employed by operators in practice can be derived based on the results of these optimization models huang and yang 1999 tu and yeh 2003 wan et al 2016 for both optimization models and rule curves recreating the natural flow regime is a promising and effective way to meet ecological objectives poff et al 1997 richter et al 1996 the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha richter et al 1996 1997 is a popular tool for capturing the majority of the natural flow regime iha consists of a suite of 33 hydrologic parameters including magnitude duration time timing of extreme flow and frequency that can be used to analyze flow regimes however the complexities of these 33 parameters make it difficult to apply them explicitly to objective or constraint equations when establishing an optimization model therefore the iha parameters are generally used to evaluate the resulting water release and then produce statistics and a set of operation rules harman and stewardson 2005 hughes et al 1997 another method is to find intermediate variables to represent iha parameters and use these in reservoir optimization models the weakness in these two methods however is that operators cannot directly apply iha parameters to guide practice recently wang et al 2015 introduced a mixed linear programming model to constrain some of the iha parameters e g monthly flows and magnitude of extreme flow thus demonstrating a new approach applying iha to reservoir operation nonetheless many iha parameters still cannot be considered explicitly in the objectives or constraints in an optimization model due to difficulties in formulating them quantitatively these facts make it difficult for operators to manage environmental flow directly according to iha parameters this study aims to address the problem by quantitatively formulating all 33 hydrologic parameters of iha into the objectives or constraints of a reservoir operation optimization model while making practical operation rules for environmental flow release this study has two related major objectives a explicitly quantify iha parameters that provide a mathematical basis for environmental flow operation issues b develop an optimization model for hydropower production and environmental flow operation based on all 33 iha parameters and then derive simplified operational rule curves that incorporate environmental flow release based on the optimization model 2 two objective reservoir operation model considering environmental flow 2 1 model framework the framework for the two objective reservoir operation model considering environmental flow presented in fig 1 includes the following steps 1 generate synthetic daily inflows 2 set up the optimization model with appropriate objectives and constraints 3 generate daily release using the optimization model and 4 derive operation rule curves with a focus on the trade off between hydropower operation and environmental flow a schematic sketch of the alteration of streamflow due to reservoir operation is shown in fig 2 water release from the reservoir can be divided conceptually into two parts fig 2 a i e beneficial water release for uses such as hydropower generation and water spill both of these parts are released downstream because water withdrawal for municipal industrial or agriculture use and water diversion are not considered in this model the total volume of water does not change after reservoir operation compared with natural streamflow the downstream flow regime after reservoir operation may be changed substantially leading to ecological alteration fig 2 b to reflect the effect of inter annual climate variability on the robustness of the streamflow series synthetic monthly inflows were first generated for 100 years and then downscaled to daily scale the economic and ecological objectives considered in the model are hydropower production hp defined as the annual output of hydroelectric energy and the eco index ei defined as a weighted average value of the key parameters selected from the 33 iha parameters the principal component analysis pca method was used to select the key iha parameters gao et al 2012 five scenarios were designed to demonstrate the trade offs between the economic and ecological objectives the optimization model was written in gams 23 3 finally reservoir operation rule curves were derived by analyzing the obtained optimal release patterns 2 2 synthetic daily reservoir inflows the time interval used to calculate reservoir operations affects the accuracy of the objectives especially those related to ecology conventional operations use mostly one month or ten day intervals bednarek and hart 2005 cardwell et al 1996 sale et al 1982 suen et al 2009 but these are too coarse to represent environmental characteristics a daily interval is essential for studies that consider ecological demand because iha parameters must be calculated using daily scale data this paper employs a robust simple and parsimonious approach for space time streamflow disaggregation that can capture the features of historical data prairie et al 2007 zhao et al 2013 the markov model is recognized as a good tool for simulating stochastic hydrological processes thomas and fiering 1962 the linear stationary autoregressive or markov model can simulate stationarytimeseries at an annual scale which means that reservoir inflows can be described by a time invariant probability density function monthly streamflow changes periodically within a year thus a periodic autoregressive markov model can be used to generate monthly streamflow assuming that the monthly streamflow satisfies the first order markov process and fits a pearson type iii frequency distribution p iii we obtained the following equation 1 x i j x j b j x i j 1 x j f i j s j 1 r j 2 where x i j is the simulated streamflow in the jth month of the ith year x j is the mean streamflow value of the jth month in the observed series b j is the regression coefficient of the jth month in the observed series f i j is the standardized p iii coefficient generated from a pseudo random number 0 1 s j is the mean squared deviation of the jth month in the observed series and r j 2 is the correlation coefficient of the jth month and j 1th month in the observed series generated monthly inflows were then disaggregated to daily reservoir inflows based on a non parametric approach prairie et al 2007 tarboton et al 1998 wang et al 2013 the disaggregated daily flow was resampled from the fitted historical monthly nearest neighbor flow data using the nearest neighbor bootstrap method k nn k nearest neighbors were computed using the euclidean distance between simulated monthly flow and fitted historical monthly flow the neighbor of the ith year was weighted as follows 2 w i 1 i i 1 k 1 i where k number of sample data points the nearest neighbor the kth month in the historical series has the euclidean distance with the lowest weight 2 3 objectives functions of optimization model the primary economic objective was set as the benefit of hydropower generation defined as follows 3 hp η g i 1 365 rg i h up i h down i where hp is total hydropower production η is the coefficient of efficiency rg i is the water release for hydropower generation on the ith day g is gravitational acceleration h up i is the average reservoir water level on the ith day and h down i is the downstream tailwater level of the hydropower plant incorporating ecological objectives into reservoir operation has been the goal of many studies jager and smith 2008 and the iha metrics are among the most popular tools used to set up an ecological objective function the pca method was employed to derive a subset of indicators from the 33 iha parameters gao et al 2009 olden and poff 2003 pca is a statistical method for deriving a subset as representatives of the overall characteristics of a group of indices the variables chosen by pca contain all the available information in the larger group see jackson 1993 for more details the ei was represented by the weighted mean value of the changing ratio of the chosen parameters as follows 4 ei p 1 p w p a r p a n p a n p where p is the total number of parameters or principal components pcs chosen from the iha w p is the weight of the pth parameter depending on the contribution rate of the pth pc a r p is the value of the pth parameter after reservoir operation regulated and a n p is the value of pth parameter under natural conditions unregulated the smaller the ei the less the natural flow regime is changed by reservoir operation 2 4 water balance constraints three constraints related to reservoir water balance are given as follows 5 i i s i 1 rg i ro i s i 6 h up i a s i 1 s i 2 b c 7 s min s i s max where i i is the net inflow to the reservoir on day i s i and s i 1 are the volumes of ending water storage on day i and day i 1 respectively ro i is spill water released on the ith day a b and c are parameters of the reservoir water level storage curve s max is the maximum water storage m3 and s min is the dead storage m3 eqs 5 7 represent the water balance constraint water stage storage curve and water storage boundaries respectively 2 5 hydropower station output constraint the hydropower station output constraint is defined as 8 go i η grg i h up i h down i ic i where go i is the guaranteed output kw and ic i is the installed capacity kw 2 6 water discharge constraint the water discharge constraint can be written as 9 rl i rg i ro i ru i where rl i and ru i are the lower and upper limits of the water discharge during time period i respectively the lower limit rl i is always set to satisfy the basic downstream ecology and navigation water needs the upper limit ru i is the maximum allowable discharge of a reservoir e g flood control consideration 2 7 ramp constraint the difference in water released between two consecutive days should not be too large otherwise the abrupt change could damage the hydraulic turbine yang and cai 2010 thus the ramp constraint is calculated as follows 10 rg i ro i rg i 1 ro i 1 q th where rg i and ro i represent the same variables as in eqs 3 and 5 and q th is the threshold flow rate of the ramp constraint 3 explicit quantification of iha parameters the iha contains 33 hydrologic parameters that can generally be categorized into six groups 1 magnitude of monthly flows 2 magnitude and duration of annual extreme flows 3 timing of annual extreme flows 4 frequency and duration of high and low pulses 5 rate and frequency of flow changes and 6 zero flow events table 1 richter et al 1996 the explicit quantifications of the 33 iha parameters are formulated individually in this section 3 1 magnitude of monthly flows the mean monthly flows denoted a 1 to a 12 can be represented by eq 11 11 a k i 1 j k rg i ro i j k k 1 2 12 where a k is monthly mean flow in the kth month and j k is the total number of days in the kth month 3 2 magnitude and duration of annual extreme flows there are 11 parameters in this group parameters a 13 to a 17 represent maximum flow events i e 1 day 3 day 7 day 30 day and 90 day maximums respectively and parameters a 18 to a 22 represent minimum flow events i e 1 day 3 day 7 day 30 day and 90 day minimums respectively the base flow index a 23 is calculated using the ratio of 7 day minimum flow to annual mean flow eqs 12 and 13 show the formulations of the 1 day maximum a 13 and eqs 14 and 15 show the formulations of the 1 day minimum a 18 12 a 13 rg i ro i i 1 2 365 13 i 1 365 a 13 rg i ro i 0 14 a 18 rg i ro i i 1 2 365 15 i 1 365 a 18 rg i ro i 0 eqs 13 and 15 are true only when a 13 and a 18 equal the 1 day maximum and minimum flows respectively considering the similarity the mathematical formulations of the 3 day maximum a 14 and minimum a 19 can be deduced as follows 16 temp 3 m i m m 2 rg i ro i m 1 2 363 17 a 14 temp 3 m m 1 2 363 18 i 1 363 a 13 temp 3 m 0 19 a 19 temp 3 m m 1 2 363 20 i 1 363 a 19 temp 3 m 0 the base flow index a 23 can be represented as follows 21 a 23 a 20 i 1 365 inflow 365 where a 20 is the 7 day minimum flow and the denominator is the annual mean flow 3 3 timing of annual extreme flows two parameters are included in this group a 24 the date on which the maximum flow occurred and a 25 the date on which the minimum occurred constraints for a 24 and a 25 follow 22 maxdate temp i rg i ro i a 13 rg i ro i a 13 c 1 i i 1 2 365 23 a 24 i 1 365 i i 1 365 maxdate temp i 24 mindate temp i rg i ro i a 18 rg i ro i a 18 c 1 i i 1 2 365 25 a 25 i 1 365 i i 1 365 mindate temp i where c 1 is a very small number e g 10 4 that guarantees the denominator not equal zero as eq 22 shows the value of maxdate temp i is zero only when the ith day is the date on which the maximum flow occurred otherwise it is equal to i under such conditions a 24 is the date on which the maximum flow occurred the constraints for the date of minimum flow occurrence a 25 are similar 3 4 frequency and duration of high and low pulses high and low pulses are defined as the periods within a year during which daily flow levels exceed the 75th percentile high pulse or drop below the 25th percentile low pulse of the historical series as shown in fig 3 a the high pulse count a 26 is the number of events at which release flow exceeds the 75th percentile there are two such values the high pulse duration a 27 indicates the average number of high pulse event days the total number of high pulse event days divided by the high pulse count using fig 3 a as an example if the flow exceeds the 75th percentile for 60 days then the high pulse duration a 27 should be 60 2 30 the low pulse count a 28 and low pulse duration a 29 can be formulated in similar ways eqs 26 33 represent the constraints for these four parameters 26 d high i 0 5 rg i ro i threshold 75 rg i ro i threshold 75 1 i 1 2 365 27 x high i d high i d high i 1 i 2 3 365 28 a 26 d high 1 d high 365 i 2 365 x high i 2 29 a 27 i 1 365 d high i a 26 30 d low i 0 5 threshold 25 rg i ro i threshold 25 rg i ro i 1 i 1 2 365 31 x low i d low i d low i 1 i 2 3 365 32 a 28 d low 1 d low 365 i 2 365 x low i 2 33 a 29 i 1 365 d low i a 28 threshold 75 is the value of the streamflow at the 75th percentile on the natural flow duration curve threshold 25 represents the 25th percentile of the same and d high i d low i x high i and x low i are intermediate variables take the high pulse as an example if the release flow rg ro on the ith day exceeds the 75th percentile of the historical series threshold 75 the d high i should equal 0 5 1 1 1 otherwise it equals 0 5 1 1 0 x high i is the difference in d high i between two consecutive days because d high i is 0 or 1 the value of x high i should be one of 1 1 0 as shown in fig 3 b four lines represent four possible instances of pulse count in which the flow exceeds threshold 75 two times in a year the higher line represents the d high i value of 1 and the lower line represents the d high i value of 0 therefore each downward or upward sloping line represents x high i values of 1 or 1 respectively according to eq 27 in the four instances the corresponding array d high 1 d high 365 x high i equals 1 1 2 0 1 3 1 0 3 and 0 0 4 respectively the sum of the three variables should be twice the pulse counts thus eqs 28 and 29 stand 3 5 rate and frequency of flow changes this group includes the rise rate a 30 fall rate a 31 and number of reversals a 32 the rates and frequencies of flow changes are represented by flow reversal in ascending or descending order 34 ds i rg i ro i rg i 1 ro i 1 rg i ro i rg i 1 ro i 1 c 2 i 2 3 365 35 rise num 0 5 i 1 364 ds i i 1 364 ds i 36 fall num 0 5 i 1 364 ds i i 1 364 ds i 37 a 30 i 2 365 ds i 1 2 rg i ro i rg i 1 ro i 1 rise num 38 a 31 i 2 365 ds i 1 2 rg i ro i rg i 1 ro i 1 fall num 39 a 32 0 5 i 2 364 ds i ds i 1 where c 2 is a very small number e g 10 4 ds i is an indicator variable and rise num and fall num represent the number of consecutive days on which flows increase or decrease respectively in eq 34 if the release flow on the ith day is higher than that on the i 1th day the value of ds i equals 1 if it is lower ds i equals 1 and if the release flow on the ith and i 1th day are the same ds i equals 0 the numerators in eqs 37 and 38 represent the rise rate and the fall rate respectively eq 39 indicates the number of reversals in either ascending or descending order 3 6 zero flow events the number of zero flow days a 33 is the only parameter in this group it can be easily represented by eq 40 40 a 33 365 i 1 365 rg i ro i rg i ro i c 3 where c 3 is a very small number e g 10 4 all of the 33 iha parameters are represented explicitly by constraint equations without conditional or loop statements using eqs 11 40 it is difficult to apply all constraints in a reservoir optimization model but these formulae can be used directly when the key parameters of the iha are chosen according to operation requirements 4 case study the jinghong reservoir located on the lancang river is used as a case study to demonstrate the optimization model as shown in fig 4 there are six reservoirs on this river and the jinghong reservoir is the farthest downstream the primary objective of the jinghong reservoir is hydropower generation the total installed capacity is 1750 mw and the designed annual capacity is 7800 million kw h the reservoir releases water to the lower mekong basin lmb and began operation in the second half of 2009 the daily flow time series data used in this study were obtained from the mekong river commission http portal mrcmekong org index the daily flow data from 1960 to 1991 at chiang saen station nearest downstream gauge station to jinghong reservoir located in thailand were selected to test the optimization model there is no large intermediate inflow between the gauge station and the reservoir thus the gauge station was used to represent the hydrological conditions of the upstream jinghong reservoir historical natural daily inflow data from 1960 to 1991 were used to generate synthetic daily reservoir inflows the statistical characteristics of the synthetic streamflow series were compared with the historical flow series the pca method was used to select key parameters from the iha for this basin five scenarios were set up for analysis for each scenario the optimization model was run 132 times representing years 32 for the historical series and 100 for the synthetic series the trade offs between hydropower production and the eco index were examined and the impact of the weight coefficients was then analyzed 4 1 generation and validation of synthetic streamflow eq 1 was used to generate synthetic monthly inflow data and historical daily data from 1960 to 1991 were used to generate monthly inflow over 100 years table 2 shows the coefficients of skewness cs deviation cv and correlation between two consecutive months r 2 the regression b as well as the mean square deviation s and mean monthly flow x the mean minimum and maximum values of the observed and simulated streamflow are shown in fig 5 the r 2 value of the simulated and observed flows is 0 907 implying that the synthetic streamflow generated is acceptable hydrological uncertainty could be considered fully by analyzing the operation results of the synthetic daily flows of the 100 years 4 2 representation and weight coefficient of the eco index ei the pca method was used to identify representative indicators for operational purposes and the results are shown in table 3 five parameters were chosen according to the kaiser guttman criterion guttman et al 1954 90 day maximum a 17 low pulse duration a 29 high pulse duration a 27 number of fluctuations a 32 and date of maximum a 24 the ei weight coefficients w p in eq 4 were set based on the contribution rate of each pc they were 0 764 0 084 0 063 0 050 and 0 039 respectively the results show that the 90 day maximum flow was the most significant ecological parameter in this basin explaining 67 of the variation it is worth noting that the first five pcs explained 87 69 of the variation 4 3 scenario setting the emphasis of this paper is not on the economic goals of reservoir operations i e power generation irrigation water supply etc but on adding the environmental flow operation into reservoir operation to balance the economic benefits and ecological effects this study analyzed the five scenarios shown in table 4 the goals of scenarios a and b were to obtain the upper and lower boundaries of the two objectives taking hp and ei as single objective respectively in scenario c hp and ei were combined with the weight coefficient λ scenarios d and e applied different environmental constraints with the single objective of maximizing hp ei was the constraint in the former and the five selected iha parameters were the constraints in the latter the optimization model was written in gams and nonlinear programming nlp in gams was used to solve the model following drud 1994 and devamane et al 2006 with a relevant but small computational task 365 days and 1 reservoir only this model was simple and did not suffer from the dimensionality issue although many advanced algorithms such as the genetic algorithm wardlaw and sharif 1999 progressive optimality algorithm cheng et al 2017 hybrid search algorithm sun et al 2017 and orthogonal dimension reduction search algorithm feng et al 2017 can be used to solve multi objective problems traditional non linear algorithm nlp is sufficient to solve this model if the proposed model is applied to a more complicated system advanced algorithms can be employed 4 4 upper and lower boundaries of the hydropower and ecological indices scenarios a and b were single objective optimization problems without environmental flow constraints fig 6 shows the relationship between ei and hp in these two scenarios the filled symbols and hollow symbols had similar distribution characteristics suggesting that the synthetic flow data captured the characteristics of the natural flow in these cases in scenario a which aimed to maximize hydropower output the value of hp ranges from 258 107 kw h to 342 107 kw h with an average of 311 107 kw h ei has a wide range from 0 133 to 0 707 with an average of 0 36 and is distributed between 0 25 and 0 5 in most years 74 of 132 fig 7 shows the relationship between hp ei and average annual streamflow in scenario a it shows a clear linear correlation between hp and average annual streamflow especially when the latter is low the correlation coefficient r 2 value is 0 73 in total and 0 93 when the average annual streamflow is lower than 2200 m3 s the linearcorrelation between the two parameters suddenly becomes weak when average annual streamflow exceeds 2200 m3 s the r 2 value falls to only 0 05 this implies that hydropower generation is constrained by streamflow in water shortage conditions even without environmental flow considerations in scenario b which aimed to minimize ei the value of hp ranges from 45 107 kw h to 333 107 kw h the highest hp value 333 107 kw h is an outlier fig 6 in this scenario the highest and average hp values are 258 107 kw h and 130 107 kw h respectively which are much lower than the values in scenario a as shown in fig 6 the ei ranges from 0 02 to 0 38 with an average of 0 15 and most of them lie between 0 1 and 0 3 124 of 132 years 4 5 combining hydropower and ecological objectives the hydropower and ecological objectives were combined in scenario c table 4 in which the iha parameters were explicitly considered as part of the objectives hp max the maximum value of hydropower output is 343 kw h in this scenario this is the value used to nondimensionalize hp a normal flow year the year 1979 was used to analyze the effects of weight coefficients varying from 0 to 1 in increments of 0 1 the results are shown in fig 8 a when λ is 0 the optimal model is the same as in scenario b when the value of λ increases the hp value also increases slowly until λ 0 6 when λ increases from 0 6 to 0 7 hp almost doubles from 154 107 kw h to 293 107 kw h before decreasing again when λ reaches 1 the optimal model becomes the same as that in scenario a the change of 90 day maximum contributes the most for ei 76 a smaller λ means that more water will be released from the reservoir in the wet season which is a condition close to the natural flow regime in this case the value of hp cannot be guaranteed because less water will be carried over to the next dry season when λ increases to 0 6 0 7 the consideration on ei becomes less important thus the reservoir can store more water in the wet season for hydropower generation in the dry season fig 8 a demonstrates the trade offs between hp and ei and it clearly indicates that λ 0 6 0 7 is a sensitive range for both objectives in the following simulations λ is set to 0 7 balancing the two objectives with a relatively high hp and relatively low ei value as shown in fig 8 a the optimal results from scenario c are compared with those from scenarios a and b in fig 8 b the hp values in scenario c are very close to those from scenario a ranging from 249 kw h to 329 kw h while the ei values in scenario c are close to those from scenario b ranging from 0 08 to 0 29 with 98 2 of the values ranging from 0 1 to 0 3 this implies that when both of the objectives are considered simultaneously the optimal operation policy tends to maintain the key indicators of environmental flow at a good level without excessively compromising the amount of hydropower production 4 6 maximizing hydropower output with ecological constraints scenarios d and e were designed to analyze the impacts of different ecological constraints on hp in scenario d an upper bound n shown in table 4 was set for the ei value based on the results from scenarios a and b values of 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 were set for this variable the results show that ei is considered as an inequality constraint all of the optimal ei results always equal the upper bound of n fig 9 however as n decreased fewer feasible solutions were obtained and the hp value also decreased when n was set to 0 2 feasible solutions were obtained in 82 of 132 years when n was set to 0 1 the number of feasible solutions decreased to 51 this went down further to only 13 of 132 when n was set to 0 05 no feasible solutions were obtained when n was reduced to 0 02 in scenario d the ei value was fixed but the hp value changed dramatically in different years the latter ranged widely from 100 107 kw h to 243 107 kw h when n was set to 0 2 this was directly related to the uncertainty of inflow the results imply that the value of hp would not be guaranteed within an acceptable range if ei is set as a hard constraint this can be attributed to the effects of inflow variation scenario e constrained the iha parameters for this study the five iha parameters 90 day maximum a 17 low pulse duration a 29 high pulse duration a 27 number of fluctuations a 32 and date of maximum a 24 were selected using the pca method and constrained within certain ranges as specified in eqs 41 45 41 80 a n 17 a 17 120 a n 17 42 90 a n 24 a 24 110 a n 24 43 70 a n 27 a 27 130 a n 27 44 70 a n 29 a 29 130 a n 29 45 70 a n 32 a 32 130 a n 32 the results show that hp ranged from 147 kw h to 305 kw h while ei ranged from 0 1 to 0 22 the hp value was significantly lower in scenario e than in scenario c indicating that the explicit constraints of the iha parameters impose stricter limitations on environmental flow release and lead to greater losses in hydropower generation fig 10 compared to scenario d the ei value in scenario e fluctuated within a certain range but the hp value was higher implying that the latter is more flexible than the former meanwhile scenario e was significant to show that reservoir operators can explicitly control the range of the selected iha parameters according to management requirements when the former are of particular interest the results from the optimization model demonstrate that the iha parameters can be applied as objectives or constraints to guide environmental flow release the comparison of the five scenarios shows that applying the iha parameters in the optimization model in different ways can lead to different results it is clear that scenario c best balanced hp and ei objectives and adapted to variations in inflow 5 discussion 5 1 deriving reservoir operation rules based on environmental flow parameters in practice reservoir operators always prefer simple reservoir operation rule curves that include environmental flow release operations we derived operation rule curves based on scenario c which consider the iha parameters as objectives assuming that the daily water release is based on 1 the inflow of a particular day 2 the release flow of the previous day and 3 the water storage at the end of the previous day as in eq 46 environmental flow operation needs to elaborate time intervals traditional two season clarification i e wet season and dry season can hardly capture the flow regime of an integrated year thus a shorter time scale is needed for environmental operation poff et al 1997 one year was divided into the following four periods based on the streamflow characteristics period 1 dry period january to may period 2 growing period june to august period 3 flood period september to october and period 4 decaying period november to december all parameters were regressed by the results derived from scenario c as shown in table 5 the annual water levels based on this scenario are shown in fig 11 a the lower and upper regulation lines were then regressed dividing the operation chart into areas of reduced output guaranteed output and enlarged output respectively when the water level was lower or higher than the regulation line the minimum or maximum water release constraint was enforced 46 r i a m i i b m s i 1 c m r i 1 d m where r i is the water released on the ith day i i is inflow on the ith day s i 1 is water storage on the i 1th day and a m b m c m and d m are four parameters in period m to demonstrate the effects of the regressed rule curves in different cases the years 1979 1987 and 1982 were chosen to represent normal dry and wet years respectively the results of the regression are shown in table 6 fig 11 b d compare and demonstrate the natural inflow q0 the release flow considering only hp q1 generated from scenario a considering hp and ei q2 generated from scenario c and based on operation rules q3 and the water level considering hp only s1 generated from scenario a considering hp and ei s2 generated from scenario c and based on operation rules s3 the release flow considering only hp q1 changed significantly compared to the natural flow q0 especially in the dry period the water levels s1 show relatively large fluctuations while the release flow based on operation rules q3 shows a trend similar to natural flow q0 and the water level s3 fluctuates only gently the results verify the effectiveness of the derived rule curve the rule curves derived from the optimization model are simple and easy to be applied into practice similar methods can also be applied to longer time scales e g ten day or one month intervals the short term inflow forecast is essential and the period division should be properly based on streamflow characteristics it is not conducive to reservoir operation to divide the period too roughly or too finely to compare the optimization model based release flow with the actual historical release flow the year 2013 was chosen as a case fig 12 in 2013 five upstream reservoirs had been constructed including the jinghong reservoir the actual historical release flow showed obvious changes compared with the natural flow i e releasing more water in the dry season and less in the wet season the hp and ei obtained by the actual historical release flow are 258 107 kw h and 0 513 respectively correspondingly the hp and ei generated by the operation rules are 246 107 kw h and 0 144 respectively which obtains a high ecological return with a small hydropower cost 5 2 policy implications of environmental flow management in mekong river basin the mekong river is one of the most biologically diverse river systems in the world white 2002 the list of recognized fish species already exceeds 1700 and is still expanding mrc 2002 specifically the lmb has three major interconnected migration systems the previous operation of reservoirs focused only on hydropower output which would likely destroy the systems and change the flood pulse regime the key indicator of iha and driver for the ecological productivity of the mekong river holtgrieve et al 2013 the mekong river commission s mrc s environment program offers an inter governmental cooperation platform to maintain a balance between economic development and environmental protection however the reservoirs in lmb were mostly constructed by private companies using loans from private banks with little consideration for the environmental flow regimes horne et al 2017 more importantly the dams along the main river were mostly constructed by china which did not participate in the mrc thus very few environmental flow assessments had been conducted in this region a new organization called the lancang mekong cooperation mechanism lmc which consists of all six countries in the mrb was established in 2016 to date the mrc and lmc are the two main inter governmental cooperation organizations in this region due to the increased attention paid to environmental flows by the countries along the mekong river and the developed regional cooperation mechanism environmental flow management became more possible than ever before on march 15 and april 10 of 2016 because of the extreme drought event in the mekong delta in vietnam the chinese government released more than 26 billion m3 of stored water from the upstream jinghong reservoir to the downstream mekong delta for agriculture and ecosystem demands mrc 2016 as a successful case of regional cooperation this event demonstrated an implementation of the win win policy for transboundary river basin management for long term cooperation it is crucial to understand the trade offs between hydropower and environmental flow and thus implement a balanced operation policy with the technical support from the proposed reservoir operation model and rule curves future cooperation among mekong countries will offer more opportunities for multi objective reservoir operation in which environmental flow release will play a progressively more important role 5 3 limitations of the model and case this paper developed a method for calculating iha indicators without a loop or conditional statement that has potential for further use in environmental flow studies however some limitations of the method and case still exist focusing on the trade off between hydropower and environmental flow this paper does not consider the effects of water withdrawal water quality or sediment changes induced by dam construction and operation which can be considered in future work there has been increasing concern recently about the ecological impacts of reservoirs including the impoundment of free flowing river habitat blockage of fish migration routes and reduced downstream water quality acreman and dunbar 2004 which are also worthy of study in the future an actual hydropower reservoir operation system contains not only the basic constraints of water balance and power plant output but also specific constraints such as diameter of water transmission installations and operation decision variables including output volume of the reservoir at each time step haddad et al 2014 reservoir systems considering more sophisticated constraints should be studied further nlp algorithms are widely applied however the nonlinear programming methods have the limitation of slow rate of convergence requiring large amounts of computational storage and time compared with other methods yeh 1985 application of the proposed model in a more complex reservoir system may require more advanced algorithms 6 conclusions in this study iha parameters were employed to quantify ecological alterations in reservoir operation we explicitly expressed the 33 hydrologic parameters of iha using mathematical formulations in a nonlinear manner an optimization model that considered the conflicting objectives of hydropower output and ecological benefit both on a daily scale was derived and applied to the jinghong reservoir in the mekong river basin the eco index ei a weighted average of five of the 33 iha parameters chosen by the principal component analysis method was defined to represent the ecological objective five different scenarios were planned to explore the trade off between hydropower hp and ei and based on this work an operation rule chart was developed for practical use the results of the five scenarios show that scenarios a and b can determine a rough range of trade offs a strong linear correlation exists between the hp and average annual streamflow especially when the latter is low in the scenarios aimed at maximizing hydropower output scenarios a d and e only the results from scenario c maintained the environmental flow indicators at a high level without sacrificing too much hydropower the weighted coefficient λ becomes a turning point at the value of 0 7 when λ is lower than 0 7 both hp and ei decrease dramatically scenarios d and e employed hard iha constraints in the optimization model resulting in a loss of hydropower attributable to the effects of variations in inflow a comparison shows that scenario e is more flexible than scenario d for both hp and ei the importance of explicit iha constraints is that operators can control the range of these parameters according to specific management requirements simplified operation rules which take hydropower generation and environmental flow into consideration were then regressed according to the optimal release flow derived from scenario c in this case cooperation among the countries is an important prerequisite for the implementation of environmental flow policies the proposed method can be used in practical operations and extended to any basin or reservoir although different key parameters and trade off combinations may occur in different basins this study was carried out in a single reservoir so application in multi reservoir systems requires further research
